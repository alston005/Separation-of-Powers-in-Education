Context: A government committee headed by IIT-Hyderabad chairman B V R Mohan Reddy has submitted its report and that its suggestions are being considered by AICTE.

The committee was appointed to come up with a medium and short-term perspective plan for expansion in engineering education.

Important recommendations made by the committee:

More than half the engineering seats fall vacant every year. There were no takers for 51% of the 15.5 lakh B.E/B.Tech seats in 3,291 engineering colleges in 2016-17.

Besides, current capacity utilisation in traditional disciplines is just 40% as opposed to 60% seat occupancy in branches such as computer science and engineering, aerospace engineering and mechatronics.

Mains Question: Examine the challenges faced by higher education sector in India and discuss the impact of policy decisions taken to address these issues?(250 words)

As part of its initiatives to empower women, the Odisha government, last year, launched this scheme to provide free sanitary napkins to school girls across the state.

India is among the first five countries in the world, the first in Asia and the first among the biodiversity-rich megadiverse countries to have submitted the report.

The submission of national reports is a mandatory obligation on parties to international treaties, including the CBD. As a responsible nation, India has never reneged on its international commitments and has earlier submitted on time five national reports to the CBD.

The report provides an update of progress in achievement of 12 National Biodiversity Targets (NBT) developed under the convention process in line with the 20 global Aichi biodiversity targets.

At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, world leaders agreed on a comprehensive strategy for ""sustainable development"" -- meeting our needs while ensuring that we leave a healthy and viable world for future generations. One of the key agreements adopted at Rio was the Convention on Biological Diversity.

The Convention on Biological Diversity is the international legal instrument for ""the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources"" that has been ratified by 196 nations.

The 'Aichi Targets' were adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) at its Nagoya conference. It is a short term plan provides a set of 20ambitious yet achievable targets, collectively known as the Aichi Targets. They can be divided into:

Strategic Goal A: Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society.

Strategic Goal B: Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use.

Strategic Goal C: To improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic diversity.

Strategic Goal D: Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Strategic Goal E: Enhance implementation through participatory planning, knowledge management and capacity building.

Mains Question: Critically evaluate the implementation of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 which is meant to fulfil the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

For Prelims and Mains: OSIRIS-Rex mission and facts on asteroid bennu.

Context: NASA's OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft has set a new milestone in cosmic exploration by entering orbit around an asteroid, Bennu, the smallest object ever to be circled by a human-made spaceship.

OSIRIS-Rex is the first-ever US mission designed to visit an asteroid and return a sample of its dust back to Earth. The $800 million (roughly Rs. 5,600 crores) unmanned spaceship launched two years ago from Cape Canaveral, Florida and arrived December 3 at its destination, some 70 million miles (110 million kilometres) away.

The plan is for OSIRIS-REx to orbit Bennu through mid-February, using a suite of five scientific instruments to map the asteroid in high resolution to help scientists decide precisely where to sample from.

OSIRIS-Rex stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer.

OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA's New Frontiers program, which previously sent the New Horizons spacecraft zooming by Pluto and the Juno spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter.

Bennu was selected for a the OSIRIS-REx mission from over 500,000 known asteroids, due to it fitting a number of key criteria. These include:

Proximity to Earth: In order for OSIRIS-REx to reach its destination in a reasonable timeframe, NASA needed to find an asteroid which had a similar orbit to Earth.

Size: Small asteroids, those less than 200m in diameter, typically spin much faster than larger asteroids, meaning the regolith material can be ejected into space. Bennu is around 500m in diameter, so rotates slowly enough to ensure that the regolith stays on its surface.

Composition: Bennu is a primitive asteroid, meaning it hasn't significantly changed since the beginning of the Solar System (over 4 billion years ago). It is also very carbon-rich, meaning it may contain organic molecules, which could have been precursors to life on Earth.

Additionally, Bennu is of interest as it is a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA). Every 6 years, Bennu's orbit brings it within 200,000 miles of the Earth, which means it has a high probability of impacting Earth in the late 22nd Century.

For Prelims and Mains: Ultima Thule and New Horizons- Key facts.

Context: On January 1, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft became the first explorer to fly past the mysterious object- Ultima Thule, located some 4 billion miles from Earth.

Ultima Thule is located in the Kuiper belt in the outermost regions of the Solar System, beyond the orbit of Neptune.

New Horizons was launched on 19 January 2006, and has been travelling through space for the past nine years. New Horizon's core science mission is to map the surfaces of Pluto and Charon, to study Pluto's atmosphere and to take temperature readings.

Mains Question: Write a note on the significance of NASA's New Horizons Mission.

For Prelims and Mains: Key provisions and significance of the bill, the need for legislation on outer space.

There is a need for national space legislation for supporting the overall growth of the space activities in India. This would encourage enhanced participation of non-governmental/private sector agencies in space activities in India, in compliance with international treaty obligations, which is becoming very relevant today.

Mains Question: What are the salient features of the Space Activities Bill, 2017? Examine how the use of outer space by ISRO has helped common man in India.

Content: Recognizing their two countries are strategic partners, major and independent stakeholders in world affairs, the Ministers committed to work together on regional and global issues, including in bilateral, trilateral, and quadrilateral formats.

The two sides further decided to establish secure communication between the Minister of External Affairs of India and the U.S. Secretary of State, and between the Minister of Defence of India and the U.S. Secretary of Defense, to help maintain regular high-level communication on emerging developments.

Strengthening the Defense and Security Partnership:

Observing the strong ties of family, education, and business, and the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation that unite their people, the Ministers highlighted the unmatched people-to-people ties between their countries and recognized the benefits to both nations and the world from these ties, including the free flow of ideas and collaboration in health, space, oceans, and other areas of science and technology.

The next 2+2 meeting is to be held in the United States in 2019.

Establishing Gas Trading Hub/Exchange in the country

It has been agreed to establish the gas trading hub(s)/exchange(s) in the country wherein the natural gas can be freely traded and supplied through a market mechanism.

Development of Natural Gas Grid:

To develop the natural gas grid, Government has taken a decision to provide a capital grant of Rs. 5176 crore (i.e. 40% of the estimated capital cost of Rs. 12,940 Crore) to GAIL for development of a 2655 Km long Jaddishpur-Haldia/Bokaro-Dhamra Gas Pipeline (JHBDPL) project.

This pipeline will transport Natural Gas to the industrial, commercial, domestic and transport sectors in the States of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.

An Integrated Refinery-cum-Petrochemical Complex:

Oil Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) namely Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) have decided to set up an integrated refinery-cum-petrochemical complex with a refining capacity of 60 MMTPA (Million Metric Tonnes Per Annum) at Babulwadi, Taluka Rajapur in Ratnagiri District in the state of Maharashtra.

Background:

The establishment of a hub is an attempt to meet operators' demands for the adoption of a market-based gas-pricing regime. But India faces challenges in making the dream a reality, amid concerns over third-party access and competition.

The gas hub plan ties in with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to boost the share of natural gas in India's energy mix to 15% by 2030, from just over 6% now.

Domestic supply is also increasing. ONGC, India's largest producer, supplied 23.5bn cubic meters of gas in the 2017-18 financial year and plans to almost double this within the next four years.

The Indian authorities, are considering overhauling the policy of fixed domestic gas prices, currently based on a formula derived from prices in the US, Canada, UK and Russia. Delhi sees itself as a potential candidate for Asia's largest LNG trading hub, in a region that lacks accurate benchmarks reflecting Asian gas fundamentals."

This article is part of Inc42's special year-end series -- 2018 In Review -- in which we will refresh your memory on the major developments in the Indian startup ecosystem and their impact on various stakeholders -- from entrepreneurs to investors. Find more stories from this series here.

""The value of an idea lies in the using of it."" -- Thomas Edison

The cup of ideas runneth over in the Indian startup ecosystem. A good idea is the genesis for any successful startup, but sometimes just having a good idea is not enough.

According to the findings of a survey by the Institute for Business Value and Oxford Economics, 90% of India's startups fail within the first five years. It added that the lack of pioneering innovation is the major reason for the failure of Indian startups -- in essence, they are copycats of startup ideas of the West, the study said.

Turns out, almost half of the Indian startups are actually not needed at all.

It is the absence of scalable ideas that makes 9 out of 10 Indian startups sink like lead balloons, despite the best intentions of founders and investors. The lack of originality is clear from this caveat -- Despite being the third largest startup ecosystem after US and China, the number of international patents India has applied for in 2015-16 was only 1,423 whereas Japan's count stood at 44,235, China at 29,846 and South Korea at 14,626.

This shows the clear mismatch between the number of startups mushrooming and the extent of innovation in the country compared to others.

As per Inc42's The State of The Indian Startup Ecosystem 2018 report, more than 10K Indian startups have shut their operations so far.

While failure is a hard pill to swallow, it is also a great teacher. For a startup founder, there is no bigger disappointment than seeing the product of their efforts come to nought. However there is also the flipside -- if you've never failed, you'll never know what works.

With 2019 just a couple of days away, we at Inc42 have compiled a list of the biggest failed Indian startups of the year. As late-night talk show host, Conan O'Brien said, ""Through disappointment one gains clarity and with clarity comes conviction and true originality""

Just Buy Live connected retailers to buy goods directly from brands across multiple categories such as food, drinks, personal care, auto, smartphones, fashion, stationery, etc. The startup also offered an unsecured credit lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to facilitate the transaction on its portal and provide working capital to small retailers. In August 2017, the startup raised $100 Mn (INR 699.25 Cr) Series B funding from a Dubai-based investment firm, Ali Cloud Investments.

Why it failed

Various reports claim that Just Buy Live may have shutdown due to an unscalable business model and negative cash flow. As per Entrackr's report in March this year, Just Buy Live's cofounder said that the company has temporarily been shut down and would resume operation after raising fresh funding. Its website is currently down.

Shotang was a business-to-business (B2B) online marketplace that connected retailers, distributors and manufacturers to discover, transact and manage their business online using their platform. Its main products were mobiles and apparel. It earned revenue through commissions paid by distributors per transaction.

Why it failed

At its peak Shotang had a $40 Mn (INR 279.7 Cr) market valuation. It had last raised $864K (INR 6.8 Cr) from Patamar Capital in February this year, and $5 Mn (INR 35.94 Cr) from Exfinity Venture Partners in December 2015. Techcircle cited an anonymous person saying that the money it last raised was ""primarily meant to pay off creditors, employees, partners. It tried but failed.""

It is likely that the business was forced to scale down its operation amid fierce competition from the likes of Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm Mall.

PortDesk provided an e-procurement software solution for logistics management for port-related operations such as accounting, cash management, ports DA estimate and voyage, layout and contract management.

Why it failed

In June this year, it was reported that PortDesk has shutdown its business, however, the reason is still unknown. Only a year earlier, the startup had raised $2 Mn (INR 13.98 Cr) in a seed funding round from a Singapore-based maritime services company, Alphard Maritime Group. The startup's founder Pushpit Pallav was not reachable for comments.

Undoubtedly India's largest crypto exchange, Zebpay (till its closure) enabled users to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, and Litecoin, or to purchase airtime and gift cards. According to its website, it had over 3 Mn users.

Why it failed

Zebpay decided to down its shutters in the aftermath of the circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 6 April 2018, restricting banks and regulated payments companies from extending any services to crypto exchanges and wallets.

Many Indian cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as crypto groups, soon knocked the doors of the Supreme Court which, after multiple hearings, has listed the matter for further hearing in January next year.

However, amid the lack of crypto rules and regulations in India, Zebpay, on September 28, 2018 announced its closure. In a statement, it said, ""At this point, we are unable to find a reasonable way to conduct the cryptocurrency exchange business."" The crypto exchange, however, continues to allow users to deposit and withdraw coins/tokens into their wallet.

Since then, the situation has only worsened -- the founders of Unocoin, another leading crypto exchange, were arrested on October 23 by Bengaluru Police over a Bitcoin ATM installation.

Not only Zebpay, a slew of exchanges including Coinsecure, BTCXIndia, MoneyTrade, Bitconnect and more shut down for various reasons this past year.

Online parenting app Babyberry helped parents of a newborn baby to provide the best possible care for their child's holistic growth and development from physical, cognitive, social to emotional growth. The app included features such as digital vaccination chart and reminders, health records management and access to the nearest doctors based on geolocation.

Why it failed

It is uncertain as to what lead BabyBerry to shutdown its operations. Its website is pulled down, it hasn't posted any feeds on its social media since October last year, nor any queries to the founders could elicit any response. In August this year, a report had cited its founder saying that the startup is currently looking to solve technical errors on the platform after many of its customers reported the glitches. Notwithstanding, the startup had raised $1 Mn (INR 6.99 Cr) in 2016 meant for product development and marketing.

MrNeeds offered consumers an online subscription-based service for the delivery of products such as milk, bread, eggs, and other grocery items. In June 2017, ET had cited Wadhwa saying that its ""per delivery costs are 50% to 70% lower than the industry standard,"" and was serving 36K monthly orders for 9K families across Noida.

Why it Failed

The startup has pulled down its website, and is mobile application is not found anymore on Google's play store. It is, however, not clear as to what lead the startup to shut its operations. It is likely that the startup closed down its shutters amid fierce competition from the likes of BigBasket, DailyNinja, and others. Inc42's efforts to reach out to the founders have gone unanswered.

Bike rental startup Tazzo was focussed on point-to-point commuting service and charged INR 5 per km. Its mobile application was integrated using GPS technology and tracked every movement of its entire fleet in real-time, including overspeeding, theft, etc.

Why it failed

TheDearth of the follow-on funding was the main reason for Tazzo to shut down its operation. In October 2016, the startup had raised about $225K (INR 1.5 Cr) seed funding from DSG Consumer Partners, but the capital-intensive nature of the sector it catered too, and the lack of funding, forced the startup to halt its operation in September this year.

Trucks and logistics platform Ezytruk connected carriers, shippers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), to enable systematic transportation of goods. It offered services such as price comparison between carriers, real-time information of the goods, warehouse space management, etc.

Why it failed

Ezytruk had raised a seed funding of $147K (INR 1.02 Cr) from Dubai-based investors Ajith Nair and Anish K in January 2017. However, the startup could not scale and grow further as it was unable to raise further rounds of funding, reported Techcircle, which ultimately led the founders to shutdown the operation this year.

B2B wholesale marketplace Wydr offered a range of products across categories like fashion, home, automotive and electronics to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. The platform allowed sellers to customise their requirements, negotiate prices, and instantly close deals. As at February 2018, the startup claimed to have added over 10K manufacturers and distributors across cities in India.

Why it failed

A report by Entrackr on November 3 cited ShopClues cofounder Sandeep Aggarwal and an early investor in Wydr as confirming the shutdown. The report said that ""the company (Wydr) was scaling down for the past three months and finally pulled the plug a couple of days ago."" An email query sent to Wydr did not elicit any response. Its official website (www.wydr.in) is currently pulled down.

Monkeybox provided Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) - approved vegetarian meals for kids in the age group of 3-18 at school. As on July 2017, the company claimed to be supplying over 1,500 meals per day to more than 85 schools in Bengaluru, with over 2K subscribers on its platform.

Why it failed

The Blume Ventures-backed foodtech startup shut down its operations amid much surprise and speculation. On one hand, the startup had been making quite a few acquisitions -- such as food delivery company 75 In A Box, juice delivery startup RawKing -- and, on the other, there was speculation that it was shutting down as it had failed to garner the required revenue to stay afloat amid fierce competition. On March 23, Monkeybox published a statement saying that ""the operation will be temporarily terminated.""

However, the termination was final. Its official website (www.monkeybox.in) was pulled down.

Apart from Indian startups that shut shop, there are some companies that ceased their operations in India after facing stiff competition and declining revenue. Here are the top top international companies whose India operations were shut down this year.

Walmart-owned ecommerce company Flipkart acquired the Indian arm of global retail company eBay in March 2017 for an undisclosed amount. Like any other ecommerce platform, eBay facilitates consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales through its website.

However, the big difference between eBay and the others is it enables trading on its platforms both in an auction or a fixed price sale. In a buyer's auction, buyers bid for a specific product and in a seller auction, different sellers bid their fixed price for a single product and the buyer chooses the best offer.

Why it failed

In May this year, eBay announced that it was ending its partnership with Flipkart and also forbade the latter to use the eBay.in brand. As the partnership ended, Flipkart migrated eBay India sellers and customers to its platform. Although being among the first players in India's ecommerce space, eBay couldn't actually rake in much revenue and faced fierce competition from Flipkart and Amazon.

As the company slowed down, and before Flipkart took over, eBay India had fired more than 350 employees from its Indian arm.

The reasons for eBay's failure in India have been many: the marketplace model was ahead of its time (eBay launched in 2005); there was no guarantee of product quality for either the buyer or the seller, and Indians never really warmed up to the idea of online auctions.

The company CEO, Devin Wenig, has announced eBay will be relaunched with a new business model in India.

The Alibaba-backed Chinese dockless bike rental company, Ofo, offered bicycles for rent on campuses and gated communities across New Delhi, Indore, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Pune, Coimbatore, and Chennai. At the time of announcing its India operations, the company claimed to have completed 1 Mn rides across seven countries.

Why it failed

Ofo's move to shut down its dockless bike renting service in India is part of company's strategy to scale down its operations in international markets, including countries such as Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, and Israel.

Ofo maintains that the move is aimed at remaining profitable. Techcrunch cited Ofo France general manager Laurent Kennel as saying that the company would focus on ""mature and promising markets"" such as Singapore, the US, the UK, France, and Italy. Moving forward, it is believed to be communicating with local markets about its plans.

Tapzo was an ""all-in-one"" app that used to aggregate more than 35 different apps in one place, across categories such as cabs, food, recharge, bill payment, news, cricket, horoscopes, and more. Tapzo's numbers were definitely impressive: 14,000 daily user base, 55K daily transactions, and an annual run rate (ARR) of INR 210 Cr in GMV/bookings.

Why It Failed

Tapzo's reduced valuation at its last funding round can be considered as a trigger towards its shutdown. Tapzo raised $1.9 Mn (INR 13.28 Cr) in December 2017 from existing investors RB Investments Pte Ltd and Ru-Net South Asia at a post-money valuation of $47.3 Mn (INR 308 Cr) -- nearly 50% less than its valuation in the previous round -- $85.54 Mn (INR 600 Cr).

Around mid of 2018, in August, the startup got finally acquired by Amazon. After the acquisition, Amazon has merged the entire Tapzo team with Amazon Pay, and it was working in the backend. Media reports said that Tapzo's founders are likely to get on board Amazon Pay's team in India.

HolaChef was a food aggregator that connected customers with chefs across the city, offering a new menu selection every day as per its website. Before shutting its operations three months back, the company was managing packaging, storage and delivery of the food.

Why It Failed

The startup was shut down around May 2018 amid a cash crunch. A media report in August has suggested that Kalaari Capital and India Quotient had already resigned from the board of directors of HolaChef earlier in the year.

With the increased dominance of players like Foodpanda, Zomato and Swiggy in the online food delivery market, investors lost interest in the startup. This was coupled with a market correction to make things worse. The last funding raised by Holachef was in February this year when it raised $28,602 (INR 20 Lakhs) in Series B round.

Foodpanda pounced on the chance, acquiring the startup for cheap -- the deal was said to fetch minimal returns HolaChef investors. For Foodpanda, the acquisition was an attempt to test waters in the cloud kitchen space, which its bigger rivals Swiggy and Zomato were already exploring.

A cursory glance at the startup shutdowns reported by Inc42 in the past three years shows that of the 32 startups that ceased their operations, most of them were from sectors such as consumer services, ecommerce, and fintech sectors. However, these sectors were among the top trending sectors in 2018, attracting investment, mergers, acquisitions, and new ventures. In fact, these are sectors that are expected to do better than all other sectors as well.

Goes to prove that it's not all about the idea, doesn't it?

What startups can learn from these stories is to buckle up their business strategy, take stock and identify even the most minuscule problems, and start rectifying them, immediately. They can also sleep on the fact that an idea -- or even market demand -- doesn't alone make a brilliant startup. It's also about execution and the right time, right place. As Edison also said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.""

Update: Holachef and Tapzo have been acquired and not shutdown as was wrongly stated in an earlier version of this article."

In 2006-2007, in the early years of the Web 2.0 that emerged phoenix like from the ashes of the dotcom bust of 2000, Michael Wesch, Professor of digital ethnography at Kansas State University, produced a video called ""The Machine is Us/ing Us"". Prior to the emergence of Web 2.0, the world wide web was primarily a read-only medium to publish news and information to a passive audience. Web 2.0, with its focus on user-generated content and a personal network of trust, created a read-write platform that allowed individuals to feed information easily into the system or 'the machine'.

In the process, the machine learnt stuff that it never knew before. Wikipedia, one of the first Web 2.0 platforms, became the biggest repository of information, if not knowledge. This in turn allowed it to influence a whole generation of students, journalists and web users, and shape the way they view the world. For example, this author who has studied in a Catholic missionary school, had had a great regard for Francis Xavier. But this was completely reversed after he read the Wikipedia article about the murderous inquisition that Xavier had unleashed on the Hindus of Goa. Obviously, no one at school had ever talked about such unsavoury matters.

The thrust of Wesch's video was that every action that a person takes in the digital world is used as an input by 'the digital machine' to increase its own knowledge of both the physical world and recursively, about the digital world. Every 'like' of a post on social media or a click on hyperlink on a web page or a mobile app is like a drop of information that individually and collectively adds to the pool of knowledge about what humans know and think.

This, in turn, is used to shape our own worldview by returning recommendations of what next to view, 'like' and click again. Unless you are like Richard Stallman, an advocate of extreme privacy who hardly uses anything digital -- like Google search, cell phones or credit cards -- you have no escape from this tight embrace of the machine. Fortunately, the machine is not yet one monolithic device. Its world has been broken up into fragments -- Google, Baidu, Amazon, Alibaba and Facebook -- by high commercial walls. But in its tireless striving, it certainly does stretch its arms into every nook and corner of human activity and through that, the human mind.

In parallel with the growth of the web, there has been the emergence of data science. This began as an extension of statistics and has evolved into machine learning. Then again there was the classical 1960s style artificial intelligence that, after lying dormant for nearly 30 years, suddenly woke up and adopted the neural network structure of the brain as a new model of machine learning. This neural network model, often referred to as deep learning is the new age artificial intelligence (AI) and it is racing forward with some truly stunning applications in the area of voice and image recognition, language translation, guidance and control of autonomous vehicles, and in decision-making as in loan disbursement and hiring of employees.

Data science has moved through three distinct stages of being descriptive -- reporting data, inferential -- drawing conclusions from data through the acceptance or rejection of hypotheses and finally predictive -- as in the new-age AI. What has really accelerated the adoption and usage of this new AI has been the availability of data and hardware. The backpropagation algorithm that lies at the heart of all neural network based AI systems that are popular today was developed in the 1960s and 1970s but it has become useful only in the last decade.

It is driven by the availability of (a) huge amounts of data, collectable and collected through the web by the machine described in the Wesch video, and (b) enormous yet inexpensive computing power that is available on rentable virtual machines from cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine and Microsoft Azure.

The key driver in this field is cloud computing. Instead of purchasing and installing physical hardware, companies rent virtual machines in the cloud to both store and process data. The simplest and most ubiquitous example of this is Gmail, where both our mail and the mail server are located somewhere in the Internet cloud that we can access with a browser.

But this same model has been used for many mission-critical, corporate applications ranging from e-commerce through enterprise resource planning to supply chain and customer relationship management systems. Though there has been some resistance to cloud computing because of the insecurity of placing sensitive company data on a vendor machine, the price performance is so advantageous that most new software services are all deployed in the cloud -- and that includes machine learning and AI applications.

Cloud service vendors have aggressively marketed their services by not only offering high-end hardware -- as virtual machines -- at very low prices but also by offering incredibly powerful software applications. Complex machine learning software for, say, image recognition, language translation that are ordinarily very difficult to develop are now available and accessible almost as easily as email or social media. Cloud computing services are categorised into Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).

The first category provides a general purpose computing platform with a virtual machine, an operating system, programming languages and database services, where developers can build and deploy applications without purchasing any hardware. The second category is even simpler to use because the software -- like email as in the case of Gmail -- is already there. One needs to subscribe (or purchase) the service, obtain the access credentials, like user ID and password, connect and start using the services right away -- nothing to build or deploy. It is already there waiting to be used.

In an earlier article in Swarajya (March 2017), we had seen how machine learning and now, the new age AI, use huge, terabyte size, sets of training data to create software models that can be used for predictive analytics. This is an expensive exercise that lies beyond the ability of individuals and most corporates. But with AI or machine learning available as SaaS at a fraction of the cost, new software applications that use these services can be built easily. For example, it would be possible to enhance a widely-used accounting software by replacing the user ID/password based login process with a face recognition based login process.

Similarly, the enormous difficulty of building the software for a self driving car, or for a voice-activated IVR telephony, can be drastically reduced by using AI-as-a-Service from a cloud services vendor. Obviously, all cloud services including SaaS assume the existence of rugged, reliable and high-speed data connectivity between the service provider and the device on which the service is being used.

Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS) can be seen as a logical extension of this model but a closer examination may yield a far deeper, or intriguing, insight.

Cloud Robotics, a new service from Google is scheduled to go live in 2019 and allow people to build smart robots very easily. It is inevitable that other cloud service vendors will follow suit. While many of us view robots as humanoids -- with arms, legs, glowing eyes, a squeaky voice or a stiff gait -- the reality is generally different. Depending on the intended use, a robot could be a vehicle, a drone, an arm in an automated assembly line or a device that controls valves, switches and levers in an industrial environment. In fact, a robot is anything that can sense its environment and take steps to do whatever it takes to achieve its goals. This is precisely the definition of intelligence or more specifically artificial intelligence. So a robot is an intelligent machine that can operate autonomously to meet its goals.

Traditional robots have this intelligence baked, or hard coded, into its 'brain' -- the physical computer that senses and responds to the stimuli that it receives from its environment. This is no different from its immediate role model -- humans. Human beings, and even most animals, learn how to react and respond to external stimuli ranging from a physical attack to a gentle question and we estimate this intelligence by the quality of their response.

In both cases, the knowledge of the external world as encoded in a model along with the ability to respond is stored locally -- either in the human brain or in the local computer. Cloud robotics replaces the local computer that controls a single robot with a shared computer -- located at the cloud service provider's premises -- that controls thousands of robots. Just as Gmail servers store, serve and otherwise control the mailboxes for millions of users each sitting at home, the cloud robotics servers sitting in some unknown corner of the Internet would be able to control millions of intelligent robots that are driving vehicles, flying drones, controlling devices and operating machines in farms, factories, mines and construction sites across the digitally connected physical world.

Circling back to the Wesch video, with which we began this article, these RaaS servers would not just be controlling machinery across the globe but would also be learning from the robots that it controls by using the robots to collect and build up its own pool of training data. This is an extension of the original Web 2.0 idea -- perhaps we could call it Web 3.0. Here, the machine has not only made a successful transition from the digital to the physical world, but also does not need humans anymore to teach it. It can become a self sustaining, self learning physical device.

Privacy would be an immediate issue and like all other cloud services, cloud robotics would be protected with access control and data encryption. But then as we have seen in the past, convenience trumps privacy. We all know that Google can read our Gmail but nevertheless, we still use Gmail simply because it is convenient and free! So would be the case with cloud robotics. We also know that the different RaaS vendors would try to isolate their own robots from interacting with the servers of other vendors or even from each other. But this could be a temporary reprieve. Collaboration among various vendors and pooling of data could happen either through mergers and acquisitions or because it is mandated by governments that are not concerned about privacy issues.

The need for privacy arises because each sentient human sees itself as a unique identity -- I, me and mine -- that is surely distinct from the collective crowd. My data becomes private because it needs to be protected, or shielded, from the collective crowd. But if we go back to the philosophical roots of the Indic Sanatana Dharma and explore the perspectives of Advaita Vedanta, we see that that this sense of ""I""ness is erroneous. Each apparently unique individual is actually a part of a transcendent and collective consciousness referred to as the Brahman.

The Brahman is the only reality and everything else is an error of perception. The world is maya, an illusion that perpetuates this sense of separateness, and creates this distinction between the individual and the world. The correct practice of yoga can lead to the removal of this veil of illusion and initiates the process of realisation. That is when the yogic adept sees the unbroken continuity between his own identity and that of the Brahman and experiences the ecstasy of enlightenment.

We know that many renowned yogis have actually experienced this enlightenment. AI products have now gone well past image and voice recognition and are now known to have the sophistication necessary to create their own private, non-human languages and original strategies in multi-user, role playing games. What we need to know is what happens when robots start emulating yogis and eventually realise their identity with the cloud robotics server of which they are a part."

For many students, it also led to loss of their precious documents. In this environment of despair, there was a welcome announcement. As a special gesture to students from CBSE affiliated schools, whose board exam academic documents such as marksheets, migration certificates, pass certificates were lost or damaged in the Kerala floods, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) decided to facilitate and provide digital mark sheets, migration certificates and pass certificates, made possible due to the integration with DigiLocker. With over 1,300 schools are affiliated to the CBSE in Kerala, this was a significant step as board exam academic documents are crucial for admission for higher studies and employment. This announcement also showed India the importance of electronic storing and validation of documents.

Targeted at the idea of paperless governance, DigiLocker was created as an electronic platform for issuance and verification of documents and certificates in a digital way, thus eliminating the use of physical documents. Organisations that are registered with Digital Locker can push electronic copies of documents and certificates (e.g. driving license, Voter ID, School certificates) directly into citizens lockers. Citizens can also upload scanned copies of their legacy documents in their accounts. These legacy documents can be electronically signed using the eSign facility.

As part of the Indian Tech Leaders Series, we are honoured to bring you the views of Amit Ranjan, Architect, National DigiLocker Project (National eGov Division, Ministry of IT, GoI) who shares the key aspects that were considered while building DigiLocker, the role of open source, and his future vision for DigiLocker

As the CTO / key architect of DigiLocker, what are some of the key aspects that you have kept in mind while designing the platform for scalability?

DigiLocker is a key Digital India initiative for paperless governance and its goal is to create a nationwide federated document exchange network operating across the public and private space. Accordingly, scalability has been one of the key design principles for the project right from the inception stage. The selection of technology and architecture was made in a way that would allow the platform to scale vertically and horizontally. The platform uses concepts like Open APIs, microservices based architecture, cloud storage, caching etc. to achieve this goal.

The partners which integrate with DigiLocker as ""Issuers"" host their data (or documents) individually on their own servers, without any centralised aggregation, thus reducing the risks that may be associated with a single point of failure.

The project was divided into phases with realistic targets. The phases provided concrete goals in terms of key metrics like anticipated number of users of the platform, file storage parameters, database performance etc. Additionally, the infrastructure is constantly monitored, adjusted and fine-tuned with every major release. Scaling an application isn't a one-time activity, but a dynamic, continuing process that needs constant changes and iterations in architecture and solutions used. The technology and product teams running DigiLocker are in a constantly learning mode to face the unique challenges that come up with every stage of the fast-growing platform's evolution.

How important is open source to the overall development and design of DigiLocker?

DigiLocker runs almost exclusively on open source technologies. This is in line with (MeitY) Ministry of Electronics & IT's policy of encouraging open source with a view to promote reuse, reduce cost, invoke community participation and allow peer review. Open source promotes innovation by giving the freedom to try, test and scale your solution, one step at a time. An additional advantage of using open source over proprietary solutions in a government set-up, is reduced time cycles due to absence of RFPs, tendering etc.

DigiLocker is based on open source programming languages like PHP, Python and Node.js. On the server front, it uses Apache, Nginx, MemCache, databases like MongoDB & MariaDB, file systems like GlusterFS etc. The DigiLocker user application (DigiLocker portal) is based on an open source application called OwnCloud. OwnCloud is a very popular solution globally for building open sourced, cloud based, document management systems. DigiLocker with over 15 million users, is the world's largest OwnCloud installation. The DigiLocker team is in constant touch with OwnCloud's open source developer community for feedback and constant iterative learning.

In your view, what are some of the major areas/functions on which DigiLocker has made a major impact in the country? Can you cite some examples?

DigiLocker's impact can be gauged from the fact that it has digitised 294 crore citizen documents and made it available on a user-friendly cloud application that be accessed across web and mobile devices. 64 issuers comprising government and private organizations have been integrated with DigiLocker; prominent amongst them are UIDAI (for eAadhaar), Ministry of Transport (for digital driving licenses & vehicle registrations), Income Tax Department (for PAN verification records), Ministry of Petroleum (for LPG subscription vouchers), CBSE (for Std X & XII marksheets and certificates), NSDC (for skill certificates), eDistrict applications of 13 state governments, secondary education boards of 12 states (for school marksheets and certificates) etc. Citizens have started using DigiLocker in ways that make their lives simpler and paperless.

Here are some notable examples:

* Thousands of citizens are showing their DigiLocker driving license and registration certificates to traffic policemen everydaywhen stopped on the road

* Railway passengers are showing DigiLocker's digital documents to ticket collectors for identity verification

* CBSE announced Std X & XII board results in May 2018; on that day itself, digital marksheets of students was made available to them in their DigiLocker accounts

* Many Fintech startups into consumer lending have integrated with DigiLocker for digitally verifying loan applicants in a few minutes (versus hours or days earlier)

* After the recent Kerala floods, where over a million state residents have lost their identity documents, the state government is working with DigiLocker for reissuing of digital documents directly into citizens' DigiLocker accounts to safeguard against a natural calamity occurring again. So overall one can say that DigiLocker's usage is growing, though a lot more needs to be done.

Your future vision for DigiLocker

DigiLocker's vision falls under the ambit of the Digital India mission to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. The goal of the project is to provide to all Indian citizensa digital platform for paperless services, that they can use in their daily lives. In many ways, the project is ""competing with paper"" through the use of innovative technology.

The entire ecosystem of paper - from its creation, to printing, to storing, transferring and verifying it is slow, inconvenient, wasteful, corruption inducing, besides being unfriendly to the environment. We think DigiLocker can be a transformative game-changer here and make the lives of Indian citizens simpler and more convenient than before. It will also lead to reduced bureaucracy, result in massive cost savings and usher in a new era of technology enabled governance.

Meanwhile, mounting expenditure is a major concern. There are several heads of expenditure that cause concern for the state. Expenditure on pension has touched 74.4% of the budgetary projection, compared to 65.66% during the corresponding period last year. Back-to-back natural calamities -- floods and cyclone -- have forced the state to loosen its purse strings. Following floods, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami announced '292 crore allocation for construction of check dams across the Cauvery and construction of houses for those who lost their homes. Cyclone Gaja left the infrastructure in the delta districts in shambles. While the total damage could run into several thousand crores of rupees, the state government has released '1,000 crore as an interim measure. After much delay , the Union government approved assistance from National Disaster Response Fund of '1,146.12 crore for Cyclone Gaja relief.

The Centre has also been strict about not been releasing funds for the local bodies, citing non-conduct of elections. The share of direct and indirect taxes (outside the purview of GST) for this year has been lower compared to the previous years.

Apart from GST, the state government's other main sources of revenue like taxes and excise on fuel and liquor have also seen considerable increase. Taxes and excise on fuel and liquor have touched 61.75% and 63.73% respectively of the total revenue expected for the year as the fuel price was on the rise in September and October.

With a huge revenue deficit, Tamil Nadu would not be able to comply with the provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, said Madras School of Economics director K R Shanmugam. Despite this, the financial health of the state is not as bad as some other states. He said the economic growth and revenue are expected to overshoot figures of last year. ""The 7th pay commission implementation is still not over. That is one of the reasons for increase in pension outgo,"" said Shanmugam.

Economists say the government will be able to manage the situation provided there is good economic growth. ""There will be tax buoyancy for the government if the state's economic growth is on the rise,"" said N R Bhanumurthy, professor at National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. ""There are still teething problems in implementing GST. All states suffer on account of this. Delay in release of IGST is a major issue. Tamil Nadu is a manufacturing state from where goods are sold to various states. The goods reach a northern state after crossing several states. Only after the goods are sold at the end state, the IGST can be adjusted for the manufacturing state,"" said Bhanumurthy. IGST revenue may be delayed, but it would finally come to the state, he said.

Bhanumurthy also disputed that lowering of GST rates would hit revenue of states. ""Consumption will increase when tax rates are lowered. Thus it will increase tax revenue for the government,"" he said."

The feat comes as another feather in the cap of Bengaluru government schools, where science and maths are no longer dreaded by students, thanks to initiatives like setting up of STEM (science technology engineering mathematics) laboratories in the institutions by NGOs and volunteers.

""I have designed a smokeless train using solar panels. I am experimenting with wind energy to make it faster and more efficient,"" said Ravi Kumar D, a class 7 student from the Hebbal school. The other winners are Mithun from class 6, who came up with a waste management model, and Anil and Vasant Kumar from class 8, whose project was based on wind energy.

""Our students were on a par with their private school counterparts, who have access to good science labs,"" said Umme Salma, science teacher at the government school.

The school has had a science lab for long but it was not used due to shortage of time and logistics. Mobile science labs began visiting the school and teachers started holding classes at a science centre set up on the campus by an NGO. The enhanced quality of education reflected in the numbers -- admissions went up from 425 in 2017 to 535 in 2018.

""When we started mobile science labs for students in government schools, the excitement to learn was palpable. Some of the kids are quick learners. That's what made us set up this centre. Students from 10 nearby government schools can visit the centre, innovate and experiment,"" said Dilip Gowda, head of the science centre set up in the school by Agastya International Foundation.

The foundation runs about eight science centres in government schools in Immadihalli, Electronics City, Yelahanka, Sarjapur Road and Kengeri, among other places.

Ramesh Atloori, son of a construction worker and resident of a 100sq ft tenement in Viveknagar, has two foreign jaunts to his credit. In 2016, he represented a robotics team at Robocup International in Leipzig, Germany, and he visited Japan the next year to take part in the event's 2017 edition. He was accompanied by his schoolmates Aravind Reddy, Ramakrishna and Lawrence Aga, who have a similar background like his. ""It was a dream come true. It was our teacher's motivation which took us to these places,"" said Ramesh.

The quartet was from Seva Bharath Trust Government Telugu Higher Primary School, Viveknagar, and was drawn to robotics during their STEM education classes.

Sridhar P, an IISc graduate, who left his cushy job to train government school students in robotics, has taken students from six government institutions to international competitions. ""STEM labs help in students' overall development, instilling qualities like peer learning, leadership and creativity in them. They give students the confidence that they can make something work. They also connect science and maths to real-world problems. Unconsciously, the students become computer literate too,"" said Sridhar.

""Thanks to the robotics project we started on a pilot basis in Seva Bharath Trust Government Telugu Higher Primary School, students wanted to spend more time in class. They created LEGO robots, a humanoid and what not. Students are bright enough to grasp concepts; it's all about giving them access,"" said Sushmita Ananth from Akshara Foundation.

Vandana P, a teacher from RT Nagar Government School, said that lack of access to labs and rote learning of science with focus on theory make students fear the subject.

""When students are made to do experiments their textbooks cite, they begin to love the subject,"" said Praveen Kumar from Swami Vivekanand Youth Movement, which is currently teaching STEM in 25 primary and 25 high schools in Bengaluru and Dharwad each."

The BSS School

The BSS School has been committing to excellence for the last 68 years, by creating generations of women with proficiency. The gestation continues from the Primary through the Secondary and finally the Higher Secondary level, creating informed choice-makers of the future.

Asian International School

Asian International School has given the district of Howrah and its people the much-needed space, exposure and opportunity to evolve its coming generations into responsible citizens and inspiring leaders.

Ram Mohan Mission High School

Since inception, RMM High School started to rise by & by, and attained its firm footing & position among the most popular schools in Eastern India as the young institution in term of results in both ICSE & ISC exams.

St Francis Xavier School

St. Francis Xavier School's motto is not only devoted in developing high IQ but also a high EQ (Emotional Quotient) so that when they pass out from the portals of the school, they are well-rounded citizens of this great country.

OmDayal Group

OmDayal Group is one of the most trusted educational groups of Eastern India. The group has been dynamically transforming the educational landscape of West Bengal. It all started with the establishment of Delhi Public School, Ruby Park in Kolkata. The school is today, one of the most preferred CBSE schools in the city. Delhi Public School, Durgapur, with a 5-acre campus is changing the face of education in the steel city. Both the schools are under the aegis of Delhi Public School Society, New Delhi.

To Higher Studies

For parents, the search for excellence for the child doesn't end by looking for the best schools in the city. TSS also kept a look-out for the best colleges in the city. And what can be better than the Shri Shikshayatan College! The performance of students in the university examinations of 2017 is a testimony to the fact that Shri Shikshayatan College endeavours to bring out the best in its students and provide an enabling environment. The consistent presence of their students in the University's top rank holders list, every year substantiates one of the highest academic standards of students.

Another sector that is booming in the country is the hospitality sector which attracts a lot of young and dynamic students. And the pioneers in this field are IIHM - Indian Institute of Hotel Management & Subhas Bose Institute of Hotel Management. Both the colleges are the best for your child to learn about hospitality, hospital and travel & tourism management. These educational institutes provide varied, exciting, interesting and different career options to prospective and promising enthusiasts.

Finishing Standard XII In 2019? Consider A Bachelor's Degree In The UK And Ireland

Indian students have historically done well in the UK and currently close to 10% of UK's population are proud Indians who have excelled in spheres of Business, Sciences, Engineering, Life Sciences and other areas of public life. And guess what, universities in the United Kingdom welcome Indian students and it also happens to be one of the safest places to study. Education Pathways India helps students who are interested in higher studies (Bachelor's and Master's) in the UK for more than 12 years. Free individual counselling sessions are offered on a regular basis to students and parents and students are guided for the entire process from counselling till their visas.

SURVEY METHODOLOGY

The objective of this research was to rank the top schools in each zone in Kolkata. The study had two major modules i.e. * Factual survey * Perceptual rating survey

In the perceptual survey module, a structured questionnaire was administered with target respondents to arrive at a ranking of schools in Kolkata. The sample selection was done using a purposive sampling method through the sample was spread out geographically to get better representation. In factual data collection, more than 200 schools were sent the factual data questionnaire and then were rigorously followed up telephonically to share their factual data.

Whether you want to solve the world's problems or pander to your own desires, there's a solution out there for all of us

2018 had a big boom in science and technology, which ushered in some impressive tech from notable and new names, such as ShelfPack's suitcase which unpacks itself and Vollebak's solar-powered jacket. Our technical creativites come out whether we're watching Rick and Morty and Black Mirror or even looking at a product with which we're well familiar and mentally elevating its functions.

We spoke to people across different industries and ages for their ultimate tech wishes -- plus, we let you know if they already exist, so you can make the most of your 2019.

""A restaurant spends a lot of time every day in deciding kitchen assignments, drawing up duty charts, getting things in place to reduce wastage of resources and so on, I would want a tech tool that can do all these functions, compute the menu lists, assign people to different sections and take steps to ensure that food wastage does not occur, if specific numbers are keyed into the device. It will help the industry a lot.""

What's out there?

Platforms such as apicbase.com have food management solutions on the cloud that can offer many solutions to these issues. To reduce food wastage, applications like Winnow can help. This UK-based startup uses a touchscreen tablet to identify what the kitchen staff put in the bin.

An electronic scale records the weight and sends a message to the user, giving the cost of the food they've put in the bin. The meter is connected to cloud software which records and analyses the day's waste. This gives owners and managers the information necessary to drive improvements in their system.

The fashion industry is the second biggest polluter globally. It is a huge consumer and polluter of water. The young designer adds, ""A huge amount of water is used for dyeing fabrics and this contaminated water is in turn released. The vast amounts of water needed can have a devastating effect on the environment and I would love to see some technology where so much water is not required to do the needful. But maily something more affordable for smaller scale designers would be ideal.""

There are a lot of solutions currently in the market, but they sure do cost a pretty penny. 6 years ago, Nike announced a strategic partnership with DyeCoo Textile Systems B.V. which will scale down water consumption in the dyeing process. But an affordable version is yet to be developed.

""In this time and age, all of us are on the phones. The ambient sounds of our streets, the music in the clubs we frequent to relax are also very loud and not safe for the ears. As a musician, having an audience that can hear well and make out the nuances of different strands of music is very important. I would want a tech tool encoded in our phones, that allows us to measure the sounds we listen to on a daily basis and can issue warnings if we exceed the permissible limits. This is very important, since there is a good chance that people with hearing loss issues may not realise there is an issue that needs immediate attention.""

What's out there?

Using a noise-cancelling headphone might be helpful and may offer short-term solutions. Since a sound counter is not yet in the works, it would be a good idea to listen on earphones/headphones with the volume turned down, and moderate the use of these devices.

The skilled mixologist and beverage consultant relies on both his innate and honed senses to do his job right, ""but if we're talking industryrelated, my biggest tech wish has to be a rotovap and centrifuge machine.""

What's out there?

This isn't quite an 'out there' invention, but the rotovap and centrifuge machine aids in the process of clarifying and increasing the yield of juices and in separating out 'milk-washed' spirit. Of course, those familiar with a chemistry lab will know a centrifuge is simply used to separate ingredients by their weight. Some of the big names out there in mixology and cuisine have already sold thousands.

The student of Government High School in Hyderabad has a keen interest in biology and explains, ""I'd love to have a microscope that's affordable and, more importantly, easy to carry between home and school.""

What's out there?

Manu Prakash and Jim Cybulski co-invented the Foldscope, a portable microscope which is yours for $1. The Foldscope is an origamibased optical microscope that can be assembled from a flat sheet of paper in under 10 minutes. It can provide over 2,000× magnification with submicron resolution, weighs less than two nickels (8.8 g), is small enough to fit in a pocket (70×20×2 mm3), requires no external power, and can survive being dropped from a 3-storey building or stepped on by a person.

""In terms of getting stuff delivered from a friend halfway across the city, to getting that chocolate cake delivered in less than 30 minutes, everything in Bengaluru can get done with tech solutions. However, this is lacking in the daily commute space. I stay in Sarjapur road and travel to MG road every day. It is a distance of almost 19 kilometres that takes more than an hour-and-a-half by car.""

""I now take a share auto till the Carmelaram station, take a train till Bengaluru city and then get on the metro. Though the metro is usually efficient, the other modes of transport are not as much. Trains are constantly delayed and buses never come on time. I want a tech tool that will tell me where a particular bus is and when it will arrive at the bus stop. In terms of improving commutes, I feel technology should come up with something to prevent traffic bottlenecks.""

What is out there?

There are plenty of apps in Bengaluru that can tell you what time your bus will arrive at a particular bus stop, such as Bangalore Buses and the BMTC app. In trains as well, applications and online tools like Find My Train and RailYatri are quite accurate in getting the information on trains. As far as solving logjams goes, it is best to wait and see if Elon Musk's ambitious project of getting people to travel on tubes underground will work.

Professor Raveesha loves to interact with his students to find out what could be the latest inventions in tech. He suggests that mobile phones could be upgraded even more. ""My tech wishlist would be a mobile phone with a telescope,"" he says. ""The common man would be able to take photographs of the moon and see what is on its surface. It would be beneficial for students interested in astronomy and the defence sector. I think Apple would design such a phone in the near future.""

Addressing the universal problem of charging mobile phones while on-the-go, Professor Raveesha says, ""I also wish for long-charging mobile phone batteries that will last for a month. Long-lasting batteries will not only be convenient for the common man, but would also be of use to space engineers.""

What's out there?

There are laptops that run on solar energy. It needs to become more popular and I am sure it will soon!"

The conference will be held at IIM-Bangalore on January 4 and January 5, 2019.

The future of learning (FoL) conference 2019 aims to highlight innovation and foster dialogue between the major actors shaping the 21st-century learning models, namely, academics, entrepreneurs, regulators and technologists.

Despite the emphasis on a digital transformation of the economy, the rural-urban divide is huge, with the internet penetration in urban and rural areas pegged at 65 per cent and 20 per cent respectively leaving over 50 per cent of India's population unserved or underserved with regards to educational services. The situation in much of South Asia is similar with 65 per cent of the population with limited or no access to the internet.

The conference will discuss factors that account for these gaps in technology, policy and practice, and how advances in technology can be leveraged to make high-quality education affordable, accessible and empowering.

Climate change news can be incredibly depressing. In 2018 alone, The Conversation covered the loss of three trillion tonnes of ice in Antarctica; Brazil's new president and why he will be disastrous for the Amazon rainforest; a rise in global CO2 emissions; and a major IPCC report which warned we are unlikely to avoid 1.5 degree of warming.

Then there were the rogue hurricanes, intense heatwaves, massive wildfires and the possibility we are emitting our way towards a Hothouse Earth. Global warming has left some wintery animals with mismatched camouflage, and it may even cause a global beer shortage.

But things cannot be entirely bad, can they? We asked some climate researchers to peer through the smog and highlight a few more positive stories from 2018.

Renewable energy is being set up faster than ever

Rick Greenough, professor of energy systems, De Montfort University

2018 saw the largest annual increase in global renewable generation capacity ever, with new solar photovoltaic capacity outstripping additions in coal, natural gas and nuclear power combined.

This is one of several hopeful signs that the ""cleantech"" sector is rising to the challenge of climate change. The UK, for instance, set new records for wind generation. And now that subsidy-free solar generation has proven possible, there are plans for the UK's largest solar farm to provide the cheapest electricity on the grid, thanks to battery backup (crucial for intermittent renewable technology). Tesla, meanwhile, installed the world's largest lithium battery in Australia and it is set to pay back a third of its cost within one year.

Chernobyl fights against climate change

Mike Wood, reader in applied ecology, University of Salford

Three decades ago, the world experienced its worst nuclear accident to date. The damaged Chernobyl nuclear power plant released large quantities of radioactive material into the environment, necessitating evacuation of an area now known as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ). But forget the popularised imagery of a nuclear wasteland; Chernobyl is now home to an amazing diversity of wildlife, its forests are expanding and the future of this region is looking positive.

In the fight against climate change, there is a global need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the removal and storage of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (a process known as carbon sequestration). The ongoing expansion of Chernobyl's forests means more atmospheric carbon is becoming incorporated into the trees. Additionally, the central part of the CEZ is now home to a major new solar farm development and wind farm development is being considered. Consequently, this post-accident landscape is now contributing to a sustainable future.

A new mobilising force for climate action

Anna Pigott, researcher in environmental humanities, Swansea University

The Extinction Rebellion direct action movement might not be the most obvious choice for positivity, what with its use of skull imagery and banners such as the one hung over Westminster Bridge in November reading: ""Climate Change: We're F****d"". But a closer look suggests that the movement's acknowledgement of personal and collective despair in the face of environmental collapse might be a very positive move indeed.

As its co-founder Gail Bradbrook explains, ""grief is welcome here - it is an emotional, physical, and spiritual necessity"". Poets and scholars alike have long spoken about how grief mobilises awareness and action, but rarely has this wisdom found its way into large environmental movements.

Pain usefully alerts us to problems that need our attention, and, in the case of climate change and species loss, our grief is a sign that we care deeply. Now is not the time to turn our back on such emotions. As the poet Mary Oliver has written: ""You tell me your despair, yours, and I will tell you mine."" For many, the Extinction Rebellion movement has given them permission to grieve, and to share this grief with others. And this could be the most mobilising force for climate action yet.

Global economic growth may have peaked

Daniele Malerba, honorary research fellow, University of Manchester

Expansion in the global economy may have peaked, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The economic think-tank is worried by the slowdown, but it may actually be good news for the climate and possibly for society too. This is because less global economic growth means less production, less consumption - and lower emissions.

But any slowdown or eventual reversal in growth must happen in an equitable way to make sure that human well-being still increases. This is why an increasing number of researchers, politicians and citizens are advocating for degrowth.

Degrowth addresses the issue technological improvements are not enough to avoid climate change and an alternative to capitalism is urgently needed. The recent protests in France show that environmental and social issues need to go hand-in-hand. And this is critical in a situation when populist movements are spreading. Degrowth is the solution. As Ghandi once said, we have enough for everybody's needs, but not everybody's greed.

Glimmer of hope in emissions reduction

Parakram Pyakurel, researcher, Warsash School of Maritime Science and Engineering, Solent University

A lot still needs to be done to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions but not all is doom and gloom. For instance, the US, UK and Japan are among the countries whose total carbon emissions from energy fell in 2017 (the most recent year available), according to BP's statistical review of world energy.

Interestingly, Ukraine showed the greatest reduction, with its 2017 energy emissions around 10% lower than in the previous year. This was thanks to a big fall in coal use, perhaps part of the country's grand vision of a 2050 low emission development strategy, though it remains to be seen whether Kiev will take the strategy seriously in the long term.

Other nations that managed to reduce their energy emissions include South Africa, Argentina, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. We'll need to carefully monitor the statistics in upcoming years to see whether they continue on this path.

Local community energy is doing well

Rory Telford and Stuart Galloway, Department of Engineering, University of Strathclyde

Renewable generation technologies such as wind turbines or solar photovoltaics are now a familiar sight, but many may not realise that communities themselves are accelerating the transition towards low carbon energy. In Scotland, the government's programme to support local involvement in renewable energy has been a success. An initial target of having 500MW of community and local owned energy was achieved early and with policy stability and continued effort the new 1GW target by 2020 also looks achievable.

The Smart Fintry project based in Stirlingshire is an excellent example of a community approach to decentralised energy provision. The project balances local renewable electricity generation with community energy needs via dynamic energy management technology and an innovative tariff. This offers far greater flexibility to the network and cheaper energy for households."

(HT File )

For a city that has long been plagued with traffic congestion, air pollution and garbage woes, 2019 could finally be the harbinger of change for Delhi.

Overcoming delays, planning fails, and repeated bureaucratic hurdles, Delhi in 2019 may finally hope to offer its residents a better quality of life.

From adding more buses to cracking down on factories and by incentivising zero-emission vehicles to reducing the load on existing landfill sites -- this year will see a host of projects that will hope to transform the city's carbon footprint, offer faster and greener mobility, and cleaner living spaces.

While some projects were being planned for years, a few others had seen multiple failures and had to be sent back to the drawing board.

An Electric boost

The coming biggest leap for the coming year is likely to be the induction of 1,000 pure electric buses to the city's depleting bus fleet.

The rollout of these e-buses, which is scheduled to begin from July, will make Delhi the first city or state in the country and the second in the world (after China) to have such a massive fleet of zero-emission buses.

The new electric buses will be in addition to the 3,000 CNG buses which will also be rolled out in batches this year.

""If all goes as per plan, then it will be the first time that Delhi will have such a massive state-run bus fleet which will entirely be environment friendly and disabled friendly,"" said transport minister Kailash Gahlot. Until now, the national capital has been deficient in its public transport system as it only has 5,460 buses against the need of 11,000.

Integrating the idea of zero-emission vehicles on a bigger scale will be the government's 'Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy' which is set to be notified by February. Moving beyond e-buses, the policy seeks to contain the growth of petrol-run two-wheelers in the national capital by offering subsidies on e-scooters and pushing the same in the commercial segment.

With two-wheelers covering three fourth of Delhi's registered vehicular population of over 10 million, experts say the government's target is on the right track.

Last mile connection

Adding to this will be Delhi Metro's expansion under the Phase-3 and Phase-4. While major sections of Phase-3, which was Delhi Metro Rail Corporation's (DMRC) largest expansion ever, were opened in through 2018, this year will see the beginning of Metro works for the Phase-4 project which will bring the rapid transit system to Delhi's fringes for the first time.

The project was delayed by two years as the Delhi government had initially refused to give approval to it.

But, adding more buses and Metro lines on a city's map would do little for residents if last-mile connectivity remains unfixed, experts say. ""Agencies get so immersed in big-ticket projects which catch a lot of eyeballs that they often undermine the nitty-gritty details. No matter how many buses or Metro trains you pump into the city's infrastructure, people will still use private cars and taxis if organised last-mile connectivity is absent,"" said Sanjay Gupta, head (transport and planning), School Planning and Architecture (SPA).

He said that agencies have not even looked into planning multi-modal integration. ""Just that multiplicity of authority is killing the entire programme. Someone, maybe the DMRC, has to take the lead and get down on implementing all the plans that remain on paper,"" he said.

A coordinated battle against pollution

When it comes to mitigating Delhi's air quality, which remains toxic for most of the year, experts say there is only one thing which agencies need to focus on -- 'enforcement'.

Instead of stringently implementing the anti-pollution measures only in the winter season, such measures should be enforced throughout the year, experts say.

""Issues such as garbage burning, landfill fires and open storage and dumping of construction waste remain rampant. Coordination among agencies needs to be improved further so all measures are effectively enforced,"" said Bhure Lal, chairman of Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority.

The Comprehensive Action Plan (CAP), which lists both short and long term action plans, has been notified by the Union environment ministry. The plan fixes the responsibilities of each government agency and even provides the deadlines. If implemented in letter and spirit, experts say, the city's pollution level could decline by 70%.

""The GRAP is more of an emergency response. Delhi's hope of improving the air quality depends on the implementation of the CAP. While some of the measures have already been implemented, EPCA has stressed on the need to focus on public transport system and a parking policy to encourage people to shift to public transport,"" said Sunita Narain, director general of Centre for Science and Environment and a member of EPCA.

Officials in the state transport department said Delhi's parking policy will also see the light of day in 2019. Once implemented, the policy, a first in Delhi, is going to make the existing practice of 'free parking' in residential areas as well as public spaces a thing of the past. The rules state that parking rates will also be linked to pollution levels.

This year could also be the first when 'green crackers' may be introduced, paving the way for cleaner festivals. While prototypes of such crackers and fireworks, which purportedly bring down emission levels by at least 40%, have already been developed in laboratories, they would now have to be taken up by the manufacturers for mass production.

Waste management, road infrastructure

This year could also be different for the spaces we live in. Dhalaos may become a thing of the past as civic agencies said they will finally execute their long-promised schemes that would ensure waste segregation at source.

The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has already started this practice at certain colonies such as Defence Colony. The North Delhi Municipal Corporation also aims to start the project this year.

Also, several road infrastructure projects such as the 2.7-km long flyover parallel to existing RTR flyover, an underpass on NH-8 near Mahipalpur along with two flyovers (in Aerocity and Mahipalpur), are likely to be opened in 2019. These projects will improve connectivity to the airport from south Delhi areas.

Subhash Chand, head of traffic engineering and safety division at Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), however, said there is need to look at other future-oriented alternatives. ""We will have to develop nearby towns such as Meerut, Panipat and Palwal in a way so that the people living in such places do not depend solely on Delhi,"" he said."

This is a list of ten articles that were read the most on The Wire in 2018. They were on topics as diverse as the depiction of women in Bollywood, media exposés, the PM's Research Fellowship and the realities of the education system in India. And they're worth revisiting on this last day of the year: for a snapshot of 2018's most popular preoccupations.

1. 'At The End of Your Magnum Opus... I Felt Reduced to a Vagina - Only'

In an open letter to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, actor Swara Bhaskar spelled out how his movie Padmaavat glorified Jauhar and Sati, and reduced women to simply being ""walking talking vaginas"". Condoning such practices at a time when 'honour' killings and the practice of Female Genital Mutilation only aid in propelling patriarchal, misogynist and problematic ideas is a mistake, she argues.

Practices like Sati, Jauhar, FGM, Honour Killings should not be glorified because they don't merely deny women equality, they deny women personhood. They deny women humanity. They deny women the right to life. And that is wrong. One would have assumed that in 2018, this is not a point that even needs to be made; but apparently, it does. Surely, you wouldn't consider making a film glorifying FGM or Honour Killings!

The context of art, any art is the time and place when it was created and consumed. And that's why this gang-rape infested India, this rape condoning mindset, this victim blaming society is the actual context of your film, Sir. Surely in this context, you could have offered some sort of a critique of Sati and Jauhar in your film?

2. Cobrapost Sting: Big Media Houses Say Yes to Hindutva, Black Money, Paid News

Second on the list is a deep dive into the Cobrapost exposé which revealed how some of the biggest names in the Indian media agreed to business proposals by an undercover reporter seeking the promotion of the Hindutva agenda.

For the sting, an undercover journalist, Pushp Sharma, posed as ""Acharya Atal"", a man who identified himself as a representative of an unnamed ""sangathan"", or organisation, but who gave the impression that he was a member of or close to the Nagpur-based Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).

The biggest name to be stung by Cobrapost was Times Group owner and managing director Vineet Jain. In a number of videotaped conversations, Jain and the group's executive president, Sanjeev Shah, can be seen and heard discussing the proposed deal in which Acharya Atal said he would pay Rs 500 crore in exchange for advertorials and events that that would be presented as programming on Krishna and the Bhagvad Gita but which would serve as a cover for Hindutva and its political agenda.

3. Why I Am Resigning From the BJP

In an open letter to the BJP, Shivam Shankar Singh, who worked on the BJP's election campaigns in the Northeast, broke down why he could not support the BJP any more even though he had believed Narendra Modi was a ray of hope in 2014.

Hindu khatre mein hai - they've ingrained it into the minds of people that Hindus and Hinduism are in danger, and that Modi is the only option to save ourselves. In reality Hindus have been living the same lives much before this government and nothing has changed except people's mindset. Were we Hindus in danger in 2007? At least I didn't hear about it everyday and I see no improvement in the condition of Hindus, just more fear mongering and hatred.

Speak against the government and you're anti-national and more recently, anti-Hindu. Legitimate criticism of the government is shut up with this labelling. Prove your nationalism, sing Vande Mataram everywhere (even though BJP leaders don't know the words themselves, they'll force you to sing it!). I'm a proud nationalist and my nationalism won't allow me to let anyone force me to showcase it. I will sing the national anthem and national song with pride when the occasion calls for it, or when I feel like it, but I won't let anyone force me to sing it based on their whims.

4. With Ministers Like These, Every Day Must Be Science Day

There's a lot that India can do to improve the cause of science within its borders and but doesn't because of the way it thinks about the subject. Perhaps the most notable example is Science Day itself - one day reserved to celebrating science when in fact that should be every day. Its historical basis doesn't inspire much confidence either.

We're not faced with a group of ministers bungling their jobs but a group that knows exactly what it's doing: angle for what they say is the 'national interest', and force everything else to tag along. By cornering our reasons to celebrate science into the confines of a single workday, we're at risk of abetting what our ministers are doing: abdicating responsibilities towards science on other days.

... Science is an everyday endeavour; celebrate it, scrutinise it, share it, demand it on every day of the year. Just the same way marking 'Earth Hour' is doing nothing to help Earth if you're not going to have environmentally conscious daily routines, you might as well not mark 'Science Day' if you're going to mark it on just one day.

5. Why Modi Walked Out in 2007 and the BJP Now Shuns Me

In the fifth spot is an excerpt from Karan Thapar's book Devil's Advocate: The Untold Story that told the complete tale of his infamous interview with Narendra Modi in 2007 where the future prime minister ended the interview abruptly when Thapar raised questions about the 2002 Gujarat riots.

'Why can't you say that you regret the killings that happened? Why can't you say maybe the government should have done more to protect Muslims?'

'What I have to say I have said at that time, and you can find out my statements.'

'Just say it again.'

'Not necessary I have to talk about in 2007 everything you want to talk about.'

'But by not saying it again, by not letting people hear the message repeatedly, you are allowing an image that is contrary to the interest of Gujarat to continue. It's in your hands to change it.'

Right through the two or three minutes this exchange lasted, Narendra Modi's face remained expressionless. But it was also clear he wasn't happy. His eyes were cold and hard. Perhaps he was making an effort to keep his face calm and steady. But now his patience or, perhaps, his resolve snapped. He had had enough and ended the interview. With the words 'I have to rest. I need some water' he started to take the microphone off.

6. Exclusive: Punya Prasun Bajpai Reveals the Story Behind His Exit From ABP News

In an explosive exclusive in August, former ABP News anchor Punya Prasun Bajpai wrote about the circumstances of his departure from the channel and the official diktats which preceded it.

Say, a channel does not confine itself to showing the Modi regime in a positive light at all times but occasionally includes stories with a negative tone or, on the basis of facts, shows the Modi government's truth to be a lie. Immediately, BJP spokespersons are told to stop appearing on those channels; that is, they do not participate in any political discussion conducted by that channel.

This started happening on ABP News from the last week of June this year - BJP spokespersons stopped appearing on its debates. A few days later, BJP leaders stopped giving bytes to the channel. The day the truth of the Prime Minister's 'Mann ki Baat' was outed on Masterstroke, RSS ideologues too were told to stay off the channel.

7. IAS Officer Being 'Taught a Lesson' for Taking on Modi, Says Family

At the seventh position is a story by Gaurav Vivek Bhatnagar that blew the lid off the harassment faced by an IAS officer in Gujarat for having acted against Narendra Modi.

IAS officer Pradeep Sharma spent another day in Sabarmati central jail in Ahmedabad on Friday even as his son is getting married in the United States since a special anti-corruption court in Bhavnagar on March 27 denied him bail - both regular as well as temporary for a week - to view his son's wedding from India via a video link, and the high court too refused an urgent hearing in the matter.

A close relative of Sharma insisted that the family was clear in its mind that Pradeep Sharma - who has seen 10 FIRs being filed against him over the last eight years - has suffered all these years ""because of that girl"" who is at the centre of what has come to be known as the Snoopgate scandal.

8. Can't Find 'Vikas' or #AccheDin? Check Narendra Modi's Twitter Timeline

Next is Karnika Kohli's unravelling of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Twitter feed and his conspicuous silences on issues that took the country by storm.

Like Manmohan Singh, Modi the prime minister has remained conspicuously quiet about issues that make his government look bad. While he is quick to wish his foreign counterparts on their birthdays - and express condolences after minor attacks in their countries - Akhlaq's brutal lynching, people who lost their lives waiting in queues after demonetisation, cow vigilantism, the Una lynching, the brutal rapes in Kathua and Unnao and many other incidents didn't make the cut.

Predictably, the prime minister has maintained a stoic silence on the police firing in which 12 people protesting the Sterlite unit in Thoothukudi were killed on May 22. People in the coastal Tamil Nadu town have been protesting for over 100 days, claiming that the unit is polluting the environment and has resulted in illnesses.

9. One Year On, the PM's Research Fellowship Is off to a Sputtering Start

The first year of the PM's Research Fellowship, already much criticised for severe conceptual issues, didn't help its cause. The MHRD awarded only 135 scholars with the fellowship out of a promised 1,000 and didn't clarify how the money allocated for the unselected 865 would be used. Together with a host of other issues, this only strengthens the impression that the government wanted to rebut in the first place: that the PMRF has been ""designed to pile privilege on privilege"".

The 1,800 students who applied from this pool of candidates were those who had already cleared many levels of implicit selection. An analysis of the student composition of IITs shows that not all economic and social backgrounds have equal representation in these elite institutions. There is a whole chain of filters based on economic and caste status, quality of schooling, the ability to afford the coaching required to clear the various entrance exams, and the ability to pay the prohibitively expensive fees that several of these institutes charge - along with hostel fees, mess fees and peer-pressured booze and pizza fees, which introduce inequality in the opportunity available to Indian students to avail a world-class education. It is only a half-joke that the IISc is often called the ""Iyer-Iyengar Institute of Science"".

10. A Sick Society That Manufactures Failures - the True Face of Education in India

In a scathing attack on the education system in India and how it destroys young minds, Avijit Pathak defines why the idea of 'success' has failed students.

Anyone familiar with school education in India knows how parents and teachers pressurise children to opt for science/commerce even if they are not inclined to it. In fact, many of them are never given the space to look at themselves, and understand their unique traits and aptitudes. This is the beginning of alienation in the child's life. This alienation is further intensified when the societal pressure restricts their imagination, and forces them to believe that life is necessarily dark and bleak without medical science/engineering/management.

In this reckless preparation for 'success' their alienated selves find no joy, no ecstasy; coaching centres have no humour, guide books are devoid of creative imagination, 'success mantras' require war strategies, not the spirit of wonder, and the joy of learning is replaced by the neurotic urge to be a 'topper'.

However, this 'success', as I wish to argue, has its own discontents. The reason is that, for most of them, it is an immensely alienating experience. It kills one's creativity; it makes one one-dimensional; it robs one of the spirit of positive life-energy."

The Ahmedabad Police Department has new plans for the new year. Among the many safety and awareness projects, the city police will give more prominence to women's safety, improving road infrastructure, and traffic maintenance.

Other areas of focus will include introducing new surveillance and security equipment along with automation. The police aim to ease road traffic this year.

While speaking to DNA, Police Commissioner AK Singh said that nearly 20 projects will be launched while traffic, infrastructure issues will be handled with a new approach.

The Ahmedabad Police Department will expand its traffic management capacity using a more systematic and policy-based structure for the same rather than using muscle power alone. In 2018, the police collected around Rs 35 cr spot fine from traffic offenders. The system of fine-collection will be automated this year. The Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) will study the city's road movement and its faulty infrastructure. Identified spots will be improved and sorted accordingly. For example, some of the major junctions located on the SG highway lane will be reworked and infrastructural change will be undertaken to reduce traffic congestion and ensure fast traffic movement on the lanes.

The city police department's New Year's gift to self will include 100 new PCR vehicles this year. The vehicles will also work as Abhayam vehicles with facilities for female and child victims. Every vehicle will have a women police official. All police vehicles will have Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras which will recognise traffic offenders and will issue challans too. The 1,006 CCTV cameras that are installed will be upgraded to automatically capture photos of those driving without helmets. Traffic cops will get over 500 mobile devices which will enable them to issue challans to traffic offenders and to detect repeat offenders and track their pending challans. Officers will also be able to collect fine online and by card payment. Every police station will have the capacity to take cyber complaints so that complainants can approach the nearest police station rather than going all the way to the Cyber Cell police station.

There are a total of 48 police stations in Ahmedabad of which only two are women's police stations right now. But that is set to change this year as all 48 police stations will have a desk of female police staff dedicated to helping female victims. Two single spot-rise response centres for women will also be built, one on the eastern side and the other on the western side. The centres will be equipped to provide shelter and medical aid. The city will also get two cyber cell police stations for women which it will be located at the existing women's police stations. The women cyber cell police stations will be equipped to deal with the cyber-related complains."

The airports authorities have received intimation of accommodating 80 charters which would fly VVIP's and other dignitaries for the summit.

Confirming the number of the flights, highly placed sources at the airport told DNA that the airport will try to accommodate as many as they can. ""For the rest, we will seek help from nearby airports like Vadodara, Jaipur, Udaipur.""

It is to be noted that SVPI airport, this month, had accommodated six chartered planes as Udaipur airport lacked space for nearly 200 charters that were flown for the pre-wedding celebrations of Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal wedding.

The city airport here has 33 parking stands and 19 more will be added in 2019.

""Of the 33 parking stands, 13 are reserved for scheduled flights and the rest for non-scheduled flights. It will be very difficult for the airport to accommodate so many aircraft,"" sources said.

""City airport has been observing restrictions on runway operations on Sundays, for maintenance purposes. Since the VGS is falling on the weekend, the same will be lifted and the runway would be made operational for smooth functioning,"" the source further added.

The officials also assured that due to the rush of charter planes, regular operations at the airport will not be impacted.

Interestingly, the aero-bridges at domestic terminal now showcase India's top management B-school Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad's red iconic structure on one side whereas Sabarmati riverfront on the other.

The arrival bay also has a replica of Akshardham Temple and a corner dedicated depictic Asiatic lions of Gir sanctuary.

The international terminal has a statue of Sardar Patel and, on the other hand, also showcases traditional Jhula of Gujarat and a Chabutara. Recently, the authorities have also installed a replica of Teen-Darwaza, an architectural marvel of Ahmedabad built 600-years ago."

Excelsior Sports Correspondent

JAMMU, Dec 31: Former Minister and Congress leader Sh Sham Lal Sharma said that schools should focus on moral values rather than mere education to the students.

The former Minister was speaking in the Annual Day function of Chander Bhaga High School, Akhnoor as a chief guest.

The function started with the lamp lighting by chief guest Sham Lal Sharma (Former Minister), guest of honour Gopal Singh (S.D.M Akhnoor), special guests Nazneen Akhtar (Z.E.O Akhnoor), Kuldeep Kumar Badyal (Principal GHSS), Dr. Swaran Singh Chib (District Youth Services and Sport Officer, Reasi), Sher Singh (Ex. Z.P.E.O Akhnoor) and from the Management of School, Raman Gupta and Aradhana Mahajan.

Sharma in his speech strongly advocated for change in the present educational set up and suggested to introduce moral education subject in every school from primary level. He said parents and teachers have also greater role to play in this direction and they must instil the moral ethics and rich ethos of Indian culture in the students so that they become good citizens and contribute for the welfare of the society and nation. He said on the eve of New Year ""we all should take a pledge to save the Girl Child and raise our voice against the crimes against the females and to contribute for a healthy and prosperous society"".

He asked teachers that while nurturing the students to achieve new highs in science, technology and modern studies, equal attention is paid to outdoor activities like sports, travel, etc which enables physical and mental development of the child."

The Delhi High Court has directed police to expeditiously probe the death of a 12-year-old girl, who committed suicide after allegedly being rebuked and humiliated by her teacher.

The girl was found hanging in the bedroom she shared with her lawyer-mother in a locality in southwest Delhi on December 1.

Naming the school, principal, class teacher and another teacher as party to the petition, the mother approached the court seeking a CBI enquiry into the child's death, alleging that police was not probing the case properly.

Justice Najmi Waziri, before whom the plea came up for hearing, asked the area's Joint Commissioner to personally look into the matter and take legal action against the culprits within 48 hours. The judge also directed police to lodge an FIR into the incident and file a status report before January 10, the next date of hearing.

Advocate R D Rana, appearing for the mother, alleged the girl had told her friends she would commit suicide and not meet them again. The counsel sought protection for the students, studying at a private school, so they could depose without fear.

He further submitted the Class VII student wrote the teacher's name on her palms and hands and the reason for her extreme step. The ""suicide note"" had said: ""meri suicide ki khabar school tak zarur pahuchana."" She had also written: ""Bye world,"" and ""Jai Shri Krishna I am coming"".

The counsel for Delhi Police told the court, ""We are waiting for the autopsy report and are recording statements of victim's classmates.""

The woman, a single mother, said in her petition that her daughter had complained of relentless humiliation at her teacher's hands. She further alleged her daughter had been insisting on changing schools. ""I (mother) had not realised how extreme it has been and that she would commit suicide,"" the plea said, adding ""her teacher used to rebuke her for trivial issues"".

Besides a CBI enquiry, the plea also called for a probe by an independent agency as the school management was ""trying to cover up the case"".

Soon after the incident, the school in a statement had said, ""... Police are presently conducting an enquiry into the case.

The year 2018 was marked by tremendous economic and political turbulence around the world. Yet, for future historians, it may well be the year when Africa started to claim its intellectual and economic-policy independence.

The unlikely trigger for what could turn out to be a continent-wide strategic shift was Rwanda's decision to increase tariffs on imported second-hand clothes and footwear in support of its local garment industry. This provoked an immediate hostile response from the US, which suspended duty-free status for Rwandan textile exports under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), America's flagship trade legislation for the continent.

For a small, landlocked African country that relies heavily on trade, this was a big deal. However, the fact that Rwanda held its ground confirmed that times have changed.

If Rwanda is willing to risk preferential access to the American market to develop its domestic garment industry, it must be confident that it will find alternative markets for its exports.

Meanwhile, other African countries have also adopted a more independent attitude vis-à-vis the major trading powers. African governments have increasingly been taking a stand on a wide range of potentially controversial issues, including trade policy in East Africa, land redistribution in Southern Africa, and macroeconomic and debt management policies in North Africa.

African governments' motive for stepping up now is not only economic. It is also about dignity, intellectual freedom, and a willingness to risk charting one's own course. More broadly, African leaders recognize that the ongoing transformation of the global economy means that no country will have enough power to impose its strategic preferences on others, even when they are much smaller, as in the case of Rwanda and the US.

Empirical research from the World Economic Forum (WEF) shows that tariff reductions and market access have become much less relevant for economic growth than was the case a generation ago. Trade is no longer about manufacturing a product in one country and selling it elsewhere. Rather, it is about cooperating across borders and time zones to minimize production costs and maximize market coverage.

The WEF estimates that, ""Reducing supply chain barriers to trade could increase global GDP up to six times more than removing tariffs."" If all countries could bring the performance of border administration, together with transport and communications infrastructure, up to just half the level of global best practice, global gross domestic product (GDP) would grow by $2.6 trillion (4.7%), and total exports would increase by $1.6 trillion (14.5%). By comparison, the complete elimination of all tariffs worldwide would boost global GDP by only $400 billion (0.7%), and exports by $1.1 trillion (10.1%).

Clearly, global value chains are now the dominant framework for trade. As we have seen, African countries such as Rwanda (as well as Ethiopia and Morocco) are already taking advantage of this paradigm shift. Rather than wasting time in unproductive policy discussions over tariffs, they are redirecting their strategies to focus on trade facilitation.

True, today's trade wars have disrupted international supply chains and will continue to do so. However, new constraints will also stimulate creativity and innovation. For example, as Meghnad Desai of the London School of Economics points out, ""In the light of advances in technologies such as 3D printing and artificial intelligence, it is not far-fetched to imagine that businesses could manufacture domestically the intermediate products that they currently import."" In this case, trade would continue apace, ""but the product mix would shift from intermediate to final products.""

Moreover, in an increasingly multipolar world, low-income countries will not have to rely solely on the West for financing and policy ideas, though they will have to be mindful of the risks of indebtedness and precarious governance frameworks. Even as global commerce has undergone a tectonic shift, traditional development thinking, policies, and practices have not.

Meanwhile, as the major emerging economies pursue technological and industrial development to escape the ""middle-income trap"", they are altering the distribution of roles and responsibilities across the global production system. As a result of the economic success of countries such as China, Vietnam, and Indonesia, other low-income economies in Africa and elsewhere now have substantial opportunities to boost employment in labour-intensive industries. After all, China now produces many of the high-value-added goods that once were the exclusive preserve of advanced economies.

As China and others continue climbing the industrial and technological ladder, the necessary relocation of large parts of their supply chains to lower-cost countries will affect the costing and pricing of goods and labour everywhere. However, developing countries can actually use their latecomer status to reap substantial economic benefits. Despite the wildly exaggerated threat of automation, African countries, in particular, can exploit their lower factor costs to promote successful labour-intensive industries in which they have a comparative advantage.

For example, African countries can lower the cost of doing business by building strategically located production clusters and industrial parks, including for green industries. They are also in a strong position to attract foreign direct investment, which brings the positive externalities of technology and know-how transfer, managerial best practices, state-of-the-art learning, and access to large global markets.

If managed properly, this two-pronged approach could provide ample employment for a low-skilled labour force, while rapidly increasing fiscal revenues. This, in turn, would allow for improvements to infrastructure in other areas, thus creating the conditions for long-term prosperity and social stability.

While trade agreements such as the AGOA are still very important to African countries, broader economic and technological changes are opening up new opportunities, and smart policymakers are seizing them.

This is a pivotal moment in north-south relations. After centuries of being politically and intellectually tethered to advanced economies with little to show for it, Africa is striking out on a new path of self-affirmation.

In this quest for prosperity, African leaders and policymakers have proved ready to withstand sanctions, threats, and setbacks. They may not all have read Nietzsche, but they know that what ""does not kill us, makes us stronger"". ©2018/Project Syndicate www.project-syndicate.org"

The States/Union Territories have been grouped in 16 pairs. Detailed background of the scheme, its objectives, implementation strategy / methodology and the pairing of the States/Union Territories are available in www.ekbharat.gov.in. No separate budget allocation has been made for this scheme.

States have expressed their keen interest in being part of the Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat scheme. They have signed MoUs with their paired States/ Union Territories and have been conducting various events covering a gamut of activities in the educational, cultural, geographical, social , tourism, sports, youth-related activities and sharing of best practices, encompassing a wide range of subjects under the programme with an integrative content relating to their paired States/Union Territories.

"37","1029973052","2018-12-31","http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=186983","Government has developed several mechanisms to ensure the quality of education in Govt schools","pib.nic.in",FALSE,"Central Government has developed the following mechanism for the monitoring of quality of education in Government schools:

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII.

Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

Over the course of 10 months, IGR has highlighted successful initiatives on issues including health, gender parity, climate change, education, and Kerala's post-flood rehabilitation. Here is a selection of five stories, each covering one of our focus areas, that made an impact in 2018 and hold out hope for India's future.

As the country braces for the 2019 general elections, the impact of good governance, or the lack of it, will be under the spotlight. We aim to increase our coverage of governance issues, and welcome your suggestions and feedback.

Climate Change

Challenge: Climate change can lower the standard of living of nearly half of India's population by 2050, the World Bank warned in a June 2018 study. Particularly vulnerable are farmers who are dependent on rainfall for a good harvest, especially in regions such as Karnataka that are prone to drought. In the 15 years to 2015, only three years -- 2005, 2007 and 2010 -- witnessed no drought, as per a 2017 assessment report by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Monitoring Centre. In 2018, 77 percent of the 30 districts were declared drought-hit, The Times of India reported on 14 September, 2018.

Action: A farmer couple, Shyamrao and Laximibai Patil, in water-scarce Kalaburagi in north Karnataka, have shown that a combination of state and NGO support, supported by grassroots innovation, can help farmers combat the effects of climate change.

The Patils practice organic farming, run a dairy and poultry farm, and are helping their fellow farmers experiment with new methods.

The couple have set up their own self-help group to sell produce such as pulses. From their mixed-crop farming and livestock produce, they make an annual income of Rs 5 lakh and a profit of around Rs 2.5 lakh, at a time when 70% of the country's agricultural households spend more than they earn on average every month.

Gender Parity

Challenge: In 2017, nearly 50,000 women died at the hands of intimate partners or family members, making ""home, the most dangerous place for women"", according to a November 2018 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

India is perceived as having the worst record on sexual violence, harassment from cultural and traditional practices and human trafficking, and is considered the least safe country in the world for women, according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll, as IndiaSpend reported on 26 June 2018. Only 14 percent of Indian women who have experienced physical or sexual violence have sought help to stop the violence while 77 percent have neither sought help nor told anyone about the violence they experienced, according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-16).

Action: In Mumbai, health advocacy Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes has since 2001 been running support centres called Dilaasa, which are funded by the National Health Mission, to identify victims of domestic and sexual violence.

Using a model of care that can be replicated across government health centres nationwide, Dilaasa centres have provided help to more than 8,000 women.

Over the two years to 2018, Mumbai's 11 centres identified 5,647 women as potential victims of domestic violence. They got 2,554 cases registered for domestic violence and 809 cases for sexual violence, according to municipal records. Sikkim, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Assam and Uttar Pradesh are replicating and activating this model.

Health

Challenge: India has 46.6 million stunted children and is home to 31% of all stunted children under five--the highest in the world--according to the 2018 Global Nutrition Report, IndiaSpendreported on December 10, 2018.

Nearly 20% of Indian children under five are wasted (have low weight for their height) and 7% severely wasted, according to data from the National Family Health Survey of 2015-16.

The Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), an NGO in Mumbai's Dharavi, the third largest slum in Asia by population, is helping reduce the prevalence of child malnutrition by plugging nutrition awareness gaps and supporting local health workers.

Action: SNEHA's efforts have reduced wasting among children aged up to three by 23% and produced a 109% increase in the services received by children through the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, a government programme covering health, food and primary education. It plugs gaps in nutrition-related knowledge in the community by training community volunteers, who spread awareness and inform anganwadi (daycare) workers about the status of pregnant women and families who are finding it difficult to feed a newborn.

Education

Challenge: India has been successful in increasing primary school enrolment to the extent that more than 83% of primary school-age children were enrolled in 2016-17, according to data from the District Information System for Education (DISE). But fewer than half (47.8%) of grade V rural students could read at least a grade II text in 2016, the Annual Survey of Education Report 2016 found.

Action: World Vision, a non-profit, runs a remedial education programme, Aparajitha, for 4,300 students in government schools in 130 villages in Lalitpur district in Uttar Pradesh. From a zero baseline, within a year 1.55% of enrolled students could read local content (such as newspapers) and understand it; 6.2% (up from 1.8%) could read a story and comprehend it; and 10.4% could read a story (up from 5.1%). World Vision expects to complete the project by 2020 and empower the community to take over.

Disaster Relief and Rehabilitation

Challenge: In the two decades to 2017, India suffered a $79.5 billion loss, ranking among the top five countries in the world to be affected by climate-related disasters, The Wire reported on October 11, 2018. India is taking baby steps towards disaster preparedness, the lack of which is becoming obvious in the wake of climate change-related extreme weather events. Only 7% of the 4,862 dams in the country have emergency action plans, a 2017 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said, the Hindustan Times reported on September 3, 2018. Often, the armed forces are summoned to undertake rescue operations, such as during the recent Kerala floods in August 2018, despite the constitution of the National Disaster Response Force in 2006.

The Kerala floods affected an estimated 5 million people's lives and damaged infrastructure to the extent that the state needs nearly Rs 30,000 crore to rebuild.

Action: The Kerala state electricity board's quick response under Mission Reconnect restored electricity to nearly 2.5 million homes in less than two weeks. Kerala is one of the 15 states in India that have 100% household electrification, the Hindustan Times reported on November 28, 2018. It managed the task by improving coordination through a state-level task force and an army of volunteers comprising retired staff, students and private electricity personnel.

""A plate of bhelpuri. It contains contrasting elements but is simultaneously balanced. Full of surprises, it makes people happy,"" he says. And how accurate is he. Kochi-native Thomas of The Bombay Canteen, Kamala Mills, Mumbai, was in his hometown for Christmas. A long-standing tradition celebrated in style, Thomas did his part by roasting a duck he procured from Mumbai.

This year has been Thomas's year. The Bombay Canteen was voted India's best restaurant at the Condé Nast Traveller and Himalayan Sparkling Top Restaurant Awards. The chef himself has bagged Himalayan Sparkling Raw and Fine Chef of the Year for constantly reinventing Indian food by travelling to far-flung places in the country. Yet, the humble man talks about the milestone his restaurant achieved, over his own. ""What really made me happier was that our restaurant got voted the number one. A restaurant is a collective. Such recognition means a lot more for the team,"" he says.

Thomas's journey was lined with 'naadan' curries and French cheeses. His grandmother, fondly called 'Ammama' lit the stove, or rather, lay the foundations. ""She would perpetually be cooking at some point of the day and somehow everything she made brought a smile to peoples' faces. I was a witness to it and that got me hooked,"" the chef continues. When he turned 16, he expressed his desire to be a chef. Fortunately for him, and now for us, his parents agreed. That led to hotel management at the Welcomgroup Graduate School of Hotel Administration in Manipal, further which he flew to the US and tightened the strings of his apron at the prestigious Culinary Institute of America, Hyde Park, New York in 2007. ""Once I graduated, I applied to the best restaurants in the world. I was posted at La Bernardin, a three-star Michelin French restaurant in NYC, where I learnt from the best,"" he says.

After a year, Thomas decided to head back to his home country and began working at Olive Bar and Kitchen, Bandra, Mumbai. ""I grew from a cook to a chef. Somewhere along the way I realised that I had to travel and taste European cuisines,"" Thomas says. He set sail and took a four-month trip across France, Italy, and Spain. ""I had an epiphany on that trip. I realised how little I had done to explore my own cuisines,"" he continues. He then turned back and began looking at Indian food differently. The oven timer rang at the very instant, and he donned the chef hat at The Bombay Canteen. Nevertheless, Thomas is an honest man and having never cooked Indian food professionally, he felt he must travel across India to 'taste' authentic Indian food. The rest is (food)history.

""I found my career mission on that trip. I saw a whole different side of India and Indian food. I realised I wanted to bring misrepresented Indian food to people through my way of storytelling through social media. That's what we, The Bombay Canteen has done - showcase Indian food using local, seasonal ingredients in a fun way so people are excited about it and constantly keep coming back,"" he says. And how he does it. ""I immerse myself in local cuisines, cook with the locals, go to their homes, understand the foundations of those cuisines, the flavours, learn recipes, and they trigger new dishes at the restaurant thereby creating a backstory for every dish,"" he says.

And what he does see for the food industry in the future? ""What we know as fine-dining, stark white stiff tablecloth, where the service is plated beyond a point of recognition is going to be dissolved. Sustainability is going to be an important part of what we all care about. Indian food is going to be big in a big way- I'd like to call the Indian food movement and I'm happy to be leading the charge,"" he adds."

The survey for identification of street vendors has been completed in 2,322 cities; 16,89,564 street vendors have been identified and 8,18,095 vendors have been given ID cards.

Homeless persons are a particularly vulnerable section of the urban poor population, often facing extreme living conditions, malnutrition and other health issues, as well as exclusion from society. The SUH component aims to provide shelters equipped with basic amenities to provide dignified living conditions and connect them to available safety nets. The SUH guidelines make it mandatory for local municipal bodies to conduct systematic third-party surveys to assess accurately the need for shelters at locations close to places of natural congregation. 1,776 shelters for urban homeless have been sanctioned so far, to create capacity for 89,000 urban homeless persons, and 1,084 shelters are currently functional.

The eastern India state successfully hosted the Men's Hockey World Cup at the iconic Kaling Stadium here, where players from 16 countries and a host of celebrities, including from different sports backgrounds, cultural icons and ambassadors descended to soak in the hockey fervour.

The state government created world-class infrastructure to host the global event while Bhubaneswar, the state capital, was decked up to welcome the sports lovers.

It also organised a Bhubaneswar City Festival for 16 days to coincide with the hockey World Cup.

As thousands of athletes and guests from around the world congregated in the city, the '.FEST' (Food, Entertainment, Storytelling and Trails) festival showcased Odisha's rich culture and delicious cuisine.

""In the course of all these events, as I have received these great people on behalf of the State, I have been struck by one common sentiment echoed by everyone: 'Such a beautiful place and such good people'. It has set me thinking,"" Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said.

In order to promote the hockey, the Odisha government announced a five-year deal with Hockey India in February to sponsor of all the national teams - junior and senior, men and women. The commitment for next five years will entail an expenditure of Rs 120 crore.

""The aim of making Odisha a global sports destination is to showcase the state and present it as an international investment and tourism destination while nourishing the budding talents with exposure to the international players,"" Sports Minister Chandrasarathi Behera said.

The Odisha government has also identified sports as one of its key focus areas as it aims to attract investment to the sector.

The state government has also signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with several leading industrialists to develop 10 world-class high-performance centres in various sports disciplines. The centres will provide international standard training facilities to potential sportspersons for the Olympics and other international events.

Reliance Industries has partnered with the state government for the athletics centre, while the JSW Group would help in developing infrastructure for football and swimming.

Dalmia Bharat Group, in association with the Pulela Gopichand Badminton Foundation, will set up a high performance centre for badminton while the Ahluwalia Group has extended its hand to develop the weightlifting centre.

Women in Golivadi and other nearby villages have been trained by non-government agencies to fight for their rights in terms of land and property so that they have joint ownership of property with their husband.

Balip is a shy lady who has three children - a daughter, a son who works in a factory in Vapi, Gujarat and another daughter who is in Class IX. Though literate Balip is unaware of her age or the ages of her children. ""I am married for long now. You can guess my age,"" she said, hazarding it herself to be around 30. When one looked at her This reporter was surprised at her assumption and she then laughed to say, ""You add whatever digits beyond 30 years""!

Balip is up at the crack of dawn, cooking meals for the school-going daughter and her husband and then goes off to the farm where they cultivate jowar, soya bean and wheat. The village women get together to help each other on their farms. So the farm work becomes easy and this has resulted in a visible bonding between the women.

Married for many years, Balip was not aware of her rights as a wife and a home-maker. ""Women traditionally have been working long hours in their farms, do household work, rear children and yet have no say in the husband's property. We are working towards changing that and also other ills that beset society that make women vulnerable when men are addicted to alcohol, drugs and often resort to violence,"" said a gram sevika.

In 2003, when the late Vilasrao Deshmukh was the chief minister of Maharashtra, the rural development department had brought out a government regulation, Ghar Doghanche which translates to Home for Two. It meant that both husband and wife should jointly own the home

Three years ago, one of the NGOs, Dalit Mahila Vikas Mandal (DMVM) in Satara district, first initiated the movement Ghar Doghanche - Home for Two, a Maharashtra state government resolution of the rural development department into a reality.

A meeting in progress where women in a village in Satara district are made aware about their rights to home and property. Pic courtesy: DMVM

The Satara urban municipality passed a resolution asking the government to add women's name to property. An incentive in the form of a one percent tax exemption is provided to those who do it.

It is a telling statement that women who work long hours in their farms for years are unaware of their rights and worse, fight shy of asking for it when informed about it. Consider the statistics. According to the agriculture census for 2015-16, the percentage share of female operational holders has increased from 12.79 percent in 2010-11 to 13.87 percent in 2015-16. In terms of operated area, the share of women increased from 10.36 percent to 11.57 percent. ""This shows that more and more females are participating in the management and operation of agricultural lands,"" an official statement from the Agriculture Ministry said.

Women constitute 32 percent of India's agricultural labour force and contribute 55-66 percent to farm production, according to the gender and land rights database of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Yet, women still have to fight for their rights in land and property in many states in the country.

DMVM, started in 1990 by advocate Varsha Deshpande, who is executive president, Maharashtra Rajya Mahila Lok Aayog, works primarily on issues concerning women. DMVM has sought the help of women -- abandoned or thrown out of marital homes and return to their parents' homes -- to make SHGs at the village level. These SHGs have been proactive to usher in this change -- of getting women to demand and get a share in their husband's property.

Deshpande's NGO, located at Shahu Nagar in Satara, began creating awareness through a series of public meetings on issues relating to violence and equal opportunity. At first, the women resisted. Like Kusum Gole (name changed) who felt she was being disloyal to her husband of over 40 years. ""Why should I ask my husband after all these years of marriage about the house not being in my name? It did not seem right,"" she said. Slowly, she was convinced by these monthly meetings and interaction with other women. Gole is now a joint owner in the house and property that was earlier only in her husband's name.

Some women were not aware of their rights. Some like Balip have been to school though they haven't completed their matriculation. ""We did not know women have rights. No one told us,"" they said.

A series of advocacy meetings were organised with the district administration pitching in as there is a need to create awareness about gender equality and it cannot be done by NGOs alone.

As of now, five women have found their names on the property that was solely in their husband's name and another 41 women will soon find themselves, joint owners of the property. Their papers have been processed, said Deshpande. Next is 88 other women who will join these women's ranks as joint property owners. ""We were able to get 500 households to share land ownership with women.

Once women are convinced and their names are added to the property, they are used as agents to convince other women in the village.

Men in the village have to be convinced too. They have not been aware of these rights that women have. Some are surprised when asked why they were reluctant to add their wives names to property. ""My wife will get the property after I die,"" said one villager. But most women don't. Often, either their in-laws or their sons throw them out of their homes when the women become widows.

Poverty is an acute issue in these villages and women being abandoned is common. To help women and young girls (child marriage is common to avoid paying hefty dowry later), some who are married and then abandoned by their husbands, NGOs run skill development courses like beautician courses, tailoring, computer and other such course to help them become independent.

The abandoned women are largely not welcome in their parental homes. These free courses run by NGOs give these women self-confidence and the ability to work and earn for themselves and take care of their children. Some like Manju Sakpal (name changed) -- who left her alcoholic husband who not only did not work but frittered away the little she earned by working in other people's fields and was abusive too -- decided to come to her maternal home with her one-year-old baby girl. The parents, mired in poverty as they are, were not too happy about her decision. But she is now a trained beautician and is earning for the baby and her upkeep and is able to give some money to her parents.

""That is why we insist that a woman should find her name on the property so that they are not abandoned like Sakpal, for instance"", says Deshpande. ""Until a woman owns land, she will remain invisible. Getting the house in her name provides her the security and equal status at home and in society. In the long run, if you want to stop domestic violence, this is the way out. Give the woman her rightful share,"" said Deshpande, whose NGO works to provide more women in as many as 24 villages in Satara district their name on the house and property that their husbands own.

Not just that, this year also saw the trend of 'Pink Toilets', loos that are more women-friendly and have amenities such as sanitary napkin vending machine, incinerators, breastfeeding table and then there are PadBanks that provide poor women with sanitary napkins at free of cost or at a very low price.

Here are some of the highlights of the year 2018 and the steps initiated for menstrual hygiene in India:

Sanitary Napkins Gets Exemption From Goods And Services Tax

After the 28th GST Council meet this year, the interim Finance Minister Piyush Goyal announced the GST exemption from sanitary napkins that were previously in the 12 per cent tax bracket under the GST regime. The exemption was the result of serious criticism the move faced earlier from various quarters which raised pointed questions like, 'Why bindi, sindoor and kajal are exempted from the GST and not sanitary napkins.'

The tax exemption is expected to make sanitary pads more affordable for women and help improve their health and well-being.

The year 2018 also saw the construction of many Pink Toilets or women-friendly toilets across India with an aim to provide basic menstrual hygiene to more and more women of the country. While the national capital region got its first Pink Toilet in the year 2017 in Vikaspuri area, this year, saw the construction of many more. New Delhi Municipal Corporation constructed three pink toilets in Central Delhi - Parliament Street (Sansad Marg) Outer Circle, Connaught Place - near Super Bazaar and one in South Delhi's Factory Road - near Safdarjang Hospital. In South Delhi, 14 public toilets in the market areas started providing sanitary pads from vending machines.

Not just New Delhi, in Uttar Pradesh's Kaushambi district, pink toilets are being constructed in all the police stations of the district. The idea of installing pink toilets in all the police stations came after district's first and only pink toilet found acceptance among the villagers a few months ago.

On the other hand, in Lucknow, one pink toilet has been set, the plan is to build around 40 such toilets in the city by the next financial year.

Along with Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka too has taken steps towards menstrual hygiene management. Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has sent circulars to state authorities to set up pink toilets across the state on priority.

The pink toilets that have gained popularity in 2018 are basically women-friendly toilets that provide menstrual hygiene facilities to the women with amenities like sanitary pad vending machines, incinerators for effective waste management of sanitary pads.

According to a 2014 report by the NGO Dasra titled Spot On!, nearly 23 million girls drop out of school annually due to lack of proper menstrual hygiene management facilities, which include the availability of sanitary napkins and logical awareness of menstruation. The National Commission for Women (NCW) has also written to Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar to consider the installation of sanitary napkin vending machines and incinerators within the premises of schools and universities across the country to curtail this drop out rate due to non-availability of hygienic sanitary products and facilities in educational institutions.

Meanwhile, few steps have been taken this year to provide better menstrual hygiene facilities in colleges and schools:

In Mumbai, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation has helped installed 40 sanitary napkin dispensing machines across schools that provide sanitary napkins at just Rs.2. In the next round, NMMC also plans to install incinerators in schools so that used sanitary napkins can be disposed of safely as irresponsible disposal of used sanitary napkins is a health hazard and can spread diseases.

Himachal Pradesh government has announced the installation of sanitary napkin vending machines in all schools, colleges, hostels and places which girls or women visit often in the state by next year.

Karnataka government also has passed circular inviting companies to help set up sanitary napkin vending machines along with incinerators in all the educational institutes as a part of their corporate social responsibility.

In New Delhi, 56 colleges of Delhi University have already got the sanitary napkin vending machines, the goal is to cover all the DU colleges on priority.

To provide basic menstrual hygiene facilities to women, Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal announced railways plan to set up manufacturing units for low-cost and bio-degradable sanitary napkins at 8,000 railway stations of the country that will help provide low-cost sanitary pads.

Some of the railway stations have already started setting up the facilities on their own. Bhopal Junction railway station started the year 2018 by installing two sanitary napkin vending machines that provide pads at Rs 5. It also was the first railway station to have the sanitary napkin vending machine.

Western Railway (WR) in the same month installed sanitary napkin dispenser and incinerators in its six divisions - Churchgate, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Ratlam, Rajkot and Bhavnagar, for its women employees.

During International Women's Day, sanitary pad dispenser was installed in Mumbai-New Delhi Rajdhani. Taking a cue, the Hirakhand Express, running through Naxal-affected tribal areas of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, became the second train after the premium Mumbai-Delhi Rajdhani Express to have a sanitary pad vending machine onboard.

Joining the league to provide better menstrual hygiene to women, Kacheguda Station in Hyderabad too installed a sanitary napkin vending machine.

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) also decided to put up sanitary napkin vending machines at airports across the country. Currently, airports in Indore, Kolkata, Jaipur, Bhubaneswar, Port Blair, Trivandrum, Vishakhapatnam, Vadodara, Pune, Guwahati, Varanasi, Surat, Chandigarh and Kolkata have sanitary pad vending machine for women travellers.

Usually, these vending machines have the capacity to stock upto 75 sanitary pads. To make use of the sanitary napkin vending machine service, women travellers have to simply insert a coin of Rs 1 or Rs 5 as the price varies in all the airports.

Maharashtra launched a state-wide Asmita Yojana scheme in order to provide rural women sanitary napkins at a discounted price. The scheme is providing eight sanitary napkins at a cost of Rs. 5 only and is being implemented by the Rural Development Department under the Maharashtra State Rural Jivonnati Campaign with the Additional Director of Family Welfare Department functioning as the Nodal Officer. The Maharashtra government has allotted Rs. 3 crore for the scheme that aims to cover girls in 36 districts of the state.

Haryana has decided to provide sanitary napkins to students at a cost of Rs 1. The Haryana government in 2017 also took a step to make Menstrual Hygiene a priority in the state, wherein the Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar decided to distribute free sanitary napkins in all the schools of the state. For the same, the government also allotted Rs. 18 crore.

Along with Maharashtra and Haryana, Rajasthan too has taken a lead in promoting menstrual Hygiene. The state government announced the launch of a new scheme across the state's rural areas that will help provide free sanitary napkins to girls and women. The Rajasthan government has allocated an amount of Rs. 76 crore for the scheme.

Assam government as walked an extra mile in order to promote menstrual hygiene in the state. The government is providing a monthly stipend of Rs 600 to girls between 12 to 20 years of age whose family's annual income is less than Rs. 5 lakh, to motivate them to purchase hygienic sanitary products.

On the other hand, Uttarakhand is promoting menstrual hygiene by providing low-cost sanitary napkins to women, especially in rural areas. In 2018, the scheme got kick-started in four of its districts, namely Dehradun, Pauri, Pithoragarh and Almora, wherein the sanitary napkin pads available at Anganwadi centres were sold at Rs. 15 for 8 pads. The uniqueness of the scheme is that the government is providing an incentive of Rs 2 a month to the anganwadi workers who are motivating other women to use the sanitary napkins being provided by the government.

Union Minister of Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi launched #YesIBleed campaign with an aim to provide holistic, healthy and eco-friendly society where menstrual hygiene is practised by menstruating women of all ages, even at grassroot level. The campaign under the Ministry addressed issues by providing access to sanitary napkins to women and awareness on menstrual hygiene.

Along with states taking various steps to promote menstrual hygiene in the country, actors too contributed towards the cause. In January, actor Akshay Kumar, through his movie PadMan did his bit to break the stigma of menstruation. The film is a biopic on a resident of Tamil Nadu Arunachalam Muruganantham who developed low-cost sanitary pad making machine in India and broke the taboo attached with menstruation in his region.

Reel life PadMan Akshay Kumar also launched various campaigns after his movie - #18to82 with an aim to bridge the gap between sanitary napkin users from 18 per cent to 82 per cent in India and#AbSamjhautaNahin that stressed on the need for making low-cost sanitary napkins in the country so that underprivileged women can also be benefitted. The actor also undertook the task of introducing 60 sanitary napkins vending machine in Maharashtra along with Yuva Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray.

Not just Akshay Kumar, Menstrual Hygiene cause also got support from many in the industry thanks to the #PadManChallenge that was started by social entrepreneur Arunachalam Muruganantham to start a conversation about menstruation. From Alia Bhatt, Deepika Padukone, Varun Dhawan and Anushka Sharma to Madhuri Dixit, Anil Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao, to name a few, everyone joined the viral #PadManChallenge to break the silence about menstruation in India.

This year, one thing that has given the cause of menstrual hygiene the boost it deserves is the trend of setting up PadBanks. Today, efforts ie being made to reach out to women with no access or awareness about menstrual hygiene through these PadBanks that operate as a bank, but instead of dispensing money, the PadBanks dispense sanitary pads, either for free or at a discounted price.

In India, some of the known PadBanks are - Dr Bharati Lavekar's digital padbank that accepts donations both in monetary funding and sanitary napkins, which is further used to change the lives of women with no access to basic necessities.

Bihar's Nav Astitwa Foundation 'Swachh Betiyan, Swachh Samaj' PadBank distributes the monthly stock of sanitary napkins at a cost of Rs 20.

Pad sisters' foundation in Jaipur is providing pads to poor women free of cost. The sisters first collect the stock of sanitary napkins from the women and girls who can afford it and then distribute it to ones who cannot afford pads.

Taking to NDTV about menstrual hygiene in India, Meenakshi Gupta, Co-founder of Goonj, a well-known organisation that works on making clothing a basic right for vulnerable section of the population said,

Earlier the problem in India was unawareness on the topic of menstruation. Today, thankfully the discussion on menstruation has started and that is because of the efforts of the authorities, people and organisations that are coming up with menstrual hygiene schemes, campaigns that are helping the less fortunate women of the society by providing them easy access to sanitary napkins.

Nalini Shekar, a social activist and a founder of Hasiru Dala (Green Force), a non-profit organisation that is helping marginalised waste pickers in Bengaluru, said,

Today, I am happy to see various schemes on menstrual hygiene in India. Authorities have understood the need to provide better menstrual hygiene care, there are toilets being made that is taking care of the facilities, suddenly, there is an explosion of sanitary vending machines that are being set up in airports, railway stations and bus stands. It is a good sign, I just hope, authorities take required actions for menstrual waste management as well so that our waste pickers are not exposed to menstrual waste the way they are exposed currently.

2018 was a year of many firsts and records in Indian sport. While MC Mary Kom went on to win her sixth world title on home soil, teenagers like Sourabh Choudhary, Manu Bhaker, Anish Bhanwala and others took the shooting world by storm, winning medals at the Commonwealth and Asian Games and also at the ISSF World Cups.

On the cricket field, the Virat Kohli-led Indian side is on the brink of registering their first series win in Australia and the rise of Hima Das on the athletic track has made the world stand up and take notice of the talent that stormed to a World Under-20 Championship gold in what was her first full year on the international circuit.

Not to forget the exploits of Neeraj Chopra in Javelin Throw, success of Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat on the wrestling mat and the consistent performances of PV Sindhu which culminated in her winning the BWF World Tour Finals to sign off the year in style.

And the success of the Indian Table Tennis contingent at the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games. While India has been winning medals at the Commonwealth Games, the two bronze medals in Jakarta was one of the biggest success stories in Indian sports given the level of competition.

But none of the successes in sports come overnight and the seeds of the results -- positive or negative -- are always sown in the decisions or incidents that take place in the past.

For example, the rise of Das can be trailed back to two coaches in Assam identifying the raw talent of a girl in the local meets and India's sprint coach Galina Bukharina making her shift from the 100 and 200 metre events to the 400 after she joined the national camp.

Similarly, the seeds of success for the Indian teenage shooters were sown about three years back when the National Rifle Association of India launched its junior program under Indian coaches Jaspal Rana and Deepali Deshpande and their efforts finally bore fruit in 2018.

Here is a look at a few decisions or incidents which could shape the direction Indian sports could take in the coming years.

Opinions are clearly divided on the need for the Khelo India School Games (KISG) given that the School Games Federation of India (SGFI) and the National Sports Federations have been conducting age group events for years now to identify and nurture talent. The idea behind KISG stems from the Gujarat Government's Khel Mahakumbh experiment which over the years has managed to broaden the base of children taking up sport and nurturing sporting culture in the state.

The KISG, however, did not follow that model in the strictest sense and made it an event for elite athletes, raising questions about whether spending crores of rupees on yet another inter-school tournament was worth it.

The implementation and approach towards the program can be debated at length but there is no doubt that this is high time, the focus of Indian sports ministry and all stake holders shifted towards grassroot sports and nurturing talent from schools and junior colleges.

This year over 1500 students were selected under the talent identification scheme for support with almost two dozen academies identified for training of these selected athletes. The government also plans to support a few universities to create sports infrastructure in the coming years and hopefully build a robust school and college sports program that can consistently produce talent.

Ask any yesteryear's sports star about their journey to the top and they would credit the Inter-University tournaments as their stomping ground. But over the years, the All India Universities -- the parent body to conduct Inter University tournaments -- has been in doldrums and the haphazard ways in which the SGFI and AIU have been conducting their meets, the structure definitely needs a overhaul.

One can only hope that KISG evolves over the years and actually contributes to talent development and nurturing sports culture at the school or college level, failing which a lot of money would just go down the drain.

One of the major criticism about the National Sports Federations have been their reluctance to turn professional and over-dependence on the sports ministry for funding. There is a long way to go for this to change and sports federations to be self sufficient, but the NRAI and Wrestling Federation of India have shown the way with their strategic partnerships.

The Wrestling Federation has signed a long term deal with the Tata group while the JSW Group has pledged support to the shooting federation till the 2024 Paris Olympics.

The direct financial support in these deals may not be exponential but the Wrestling Federation has already introduced a Central Contract system on the lines of the Indian Cricket Board while the shooting federation plans to utilise the money to pay the Indian coaches better remuneration, a move that they believe can help end India's dependency on foreign experts in the next few years.

The Wrestling Federation which has been struggling to convince the Sports Ministry about the need for hiring foreign coaches for over a year now, has decided to hire a few experts on their own thanks to the support from their corporate partners and the players believe that such a move could actually give them and the federation more freedom to choose coaches and support staff of their choice.

In all the muddle created by infighting between two Committee of Administrators appointed to implement the Lodha Committee reforms, the fact that BCCI's new constitution has been made and cleared by the Supreme Court has been lost. According to the time line submitted by the CoA to the court, elections under the new constitution have to be held by March 2019 and though many state associations are resisting the change, they will sooner or later have to fall in line and implement the reforms if not in toto.

A similar exercise was undertaken in the Archery Association of India where Administrator S Y Quraishi conducted elections under the new constitution which he has drafted. The new constitution debars public servants from being part of the federation and gives a lot more representation to players.

The Indian Olympic Association and even the federation has decided to oppose the new constitution but if the Court puts its weight behind Quraishi's draft, then it could change the face of Indian sports administration.

There are many in other federations who are waiting with baited breath to move the courts seeking change and over throw the incumbents, who have run the federations as their fiefdom for decades.

The popular theme in all these proposed reforms is a bigger role for former players in administration. The argument that players are best placed to run sports federations efficiently is flawed given the fact that administration is a completely different ball game and not all players are competent enough to handle the job.

Most of them who are currently in administration have little or no formal education in administration and are basically functioning at the whims and fancies of their political masters or are merely surviving on their stature as elite sportspersons.

Internationally, many sports federations are run by former athletes but almost all of them have gone back to academics at the end of their playing careers to complete management degrees and rise through the ranks. May be, the amended constitutions will inspire more sports persons in India to take that route.

Age fraud has been an open secret in Indian sports but most federation would prefer to bury their head in the sand and pretend that the problem doesn't exist rather than take the bull by the horns and curb the menace.

Thanks to the sports ministry forcing their hand a few years ago, most of these federations have taken a few cosmetics steps like conducting random age verification tests but the results of which are hardly made public and the federations avoid taking any action against those found over age, hiding behind the argument that the results of the medical tests are not 100% correct.

But the social media outrage over Gourav Mukhi becoming the ""youngest goalscorer"" in the Indian Super League at 16 and the cognisance taken by the international media and hopefully by the international federations should be enough to wake the federations up from their slumber.

Over the last few years, as India has started performing on the international stage in age group tournaments, the chatter around the over age menace has been on the rise even internationally and the Mukhi controversy should be an indicator that in the age of social media and legally aware parents, they can't just ignore the problem.

If the Mukhi case actually leads to a proper system of investigating age fraud and curbing the menace, Indian sports would be indebted to the Jamshedpur FC striker, who is difficult to miss with his trademark moustache that belies his registered age with the AIFF.

The Indian anti-doping program came under scrutiny when the World Anti-Doping Agency decided to pick a considerable chunk of samples that were reported ""negative"" by the National Dope Testing Laboratory and over half a dozen of them came positive in retesting, including those of quartermile Nirmala Sheoran, middle distance runner Sanjivani Jadhav and others.

While the world body has the right to ask for any sample for retesting, what has surprised many is the number of samples WADA took for re-testing to their Montreal lab, clearly indicating lack of faith in the methods employed by the Indian lab.

There is a growing feeling that the National Anti Doping Agency has been far more lenient on top athletes in the past few years as they want to prove that doping incidents have reduced in India and a RTI by the Indian Express shows how the agency hardly tested the big names in the run up to the Asian Games.

But with WADA watching, NDTL runs the risk of losing its accreditation if it doesn't get its house in order. Hopefully that would be a good enough incentive for NADA to get the anti-doping program back on track and for the federations and Sports Authority of India to educate the medical staff attached with the teams on how to tackle the menace."

Delhi's oldest Ghazipur landfill and Asia's largest dumping ground - Deonar in Mumbai, continued to gather waste despite the Supreme Court ordering a closure of these landfills. Meanwhile, Delhi's biggest garbage dump- Bhalswa landfill caught fire that took three days to douse. Recently, Mumbai's second largest dumping ground - Mulund landfill was permanently closed after it reached its saturation point and then there was the fire at Ahmedabad's sole landfill site at pirana, where fumes emitting from garbage are a common sight for passersby.

While landfills continue to be an eyesore in the urban landscape and a crisis that most cities are grappling with, there were a few notable exceptions - Indore, and Ambikapur that declared themselves landfill free and emerged as benchmarks that others can follow.

According to the Central Pollution Control Board report of 2015-2016 which have the last collated figures on the implementation of Solid Wastes Management Rules, 2016, over 1.3 lakh (1,35,198.27) tonnes of solid waste is generated per day in India. Of the total waste generated, while over one lakh tonnes per day (1,11,027.55 TPD) is collected, only a fraction - 25,572.25 TPD is treated and 47,415.62 TPD is landfilled.

To make sure cities go waste free, government also introduced seven star-rating under Swachh Survekshan - a pan India exercise to assess cleanliness in urban India. The seven star rating is the first-of-its kind rating tool for assessing cleanliness of cities and towns in India, designed on a SMART approach that stands for Single metric, Measurable, Achievable, Rigorous verification and Targeted towards outcomes. The criteria to achieve seven star rating is 100 per cent door-to-door waste collection, 100 per cent waste treatment and waste free local water bodies.

The Current Status: The national capital Delhi is home to three of the biggest landfills namely Ghazipur, Okhla and Bhalswa, which have out lived their life and are now unable to take the burden and collapsing under the weight of the waste. A fact that is borne out by the recent events with the Ghazipur dump yard collapsing in 2017, claiming two lives and Bhalswa and Okhla landfill smouldering continuously. The sad part is, despite all this, little to nothing has been done in 2018 to improve the status of landfills with 60-70 metre high mountain of garbage.

All kinds of waste that is wet, dry and toxic is collected together and dumped at a landfill. Once wet waste starts rotting and decomposing then you have formation of methane gas which is not only a toxic greenhouse gas, but flammable also. Because of the same, landfills are always under fire. It is just sometimes it is huge and someone passing sees it, makes a video and posts it on social media and it becomes news, says Chitra Mukherjee, Head of Programmes, Operations, Chintan.

""In Delhi, till date, about 10,500 tonnes of waste is collected per day. 6,100 TPD still goes to waste to energy plant and this is all mixed waste. Only 200 TPD gets composted"", says Swati Singh Sambyal, Programme Manager, Waste Management, Center for Science and Environment.

The Problem: Currently, a portion of collected waste is dumped at some or the other landfill and remaining is treated at waste-to-energy (WTE) plants at Sarojini Nagar, Narela-Bawana, Ghazipur and Okhla. But are these WTE plants effective? Will they solve the problem?

Municipalities keep talking about WTE plants, but honestly they are pathetic, because all kinds of waste goes into it and is burned. WTE plants are neither meeting emission norms, nor helping in waste segregation and then recycling, says Chitra.

The problem in Delhi is lack of accountability and enforcement of Solid Waste Management Rules (SWMR) of 2016. It has been two years and not even single law has been implemented so far, reason being, as East Delhi Municipal Corporation says, lack of funds to provide vehicles and other necessary things to waste pickers. As part of SWMR, waste should be segregated at source and if not then defaulters will be penalised, but according to experts, not even single case has been registered.

Segregation of waste at source ensures that biodegradable waste like kitchen waste is composted, waste like plastic that can be recycled is sent to relevant facilities and only what remains make it way to the landfill. Unlike now where bulk of the waste is piling up at these landfills.

The Solution: To deal with the humoungous amount of waste, earlier this year Supreme Court asked Lieutenant Governor of Delhi to form a committee and come up with solutions. A 24 member team comprising children, civil society members, RWA (Resident Welfare Association) representatives, municipalities and others was formed and the committee is expected to submit its report in the first week of 2019.

The committee is of the opinion that effective enforcement of SWMR of 2016 will help in managing the waste and making municipalities accountable. Being a member of the committee, Chitra knows the on ground issues and says,

The problem is citizens do not connect their responsibility with the landfill. Lot of people complain that we segregate waste at home, but waste pickers mix it. So, who is at fault? Of course, the municipalities as they do not have a dedicated stream for segregated waste.

For remediation that is to stop the environmental damage being caused by Bhalswa landfill, lifespan which lapsed in 2009 and yet it continues to be in use a decade later, a nine member Scientific Advisory Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Dr. Manoj Dutta, Professor, IIT Delhi. According to the committee's recommendation, adoption of landfill mining (process of excavating landfilled solid wastes and processing it) is not a viable option. In the first stage, the committee has asked the municipal corporation to carry out site characterisation under which it needs to collect data on the quantum of waste under and above the ground, type and quality of waste, and other parameters for assessing the current state of the landfill. Once it is done, the nine member committee will prepare the design of the work to be done at the Bhalswa landfill site. While the investigation and design of the project is under progress, execution of plan is scheduled for March 31, 2020 which is still one and a half years from now. If that works well, similar steps can be taken for Ghazipur and Okhla landfill, maybe.

The Experts Opinion: Talking about the steps taken in 2018 and the way forward to deal with active volcanos in the city, Chitra says,

Nothing has happened in 2018, apart from passing the buck. With the committee submitting its report to the apex court, we hope municipalities to take some action in 2019, implement waste segregation, and especially SWMR.

The Current Status: Maharashtra's capital Mumbai is a densely populated city that generates 7,000 metric tonnes of waste per day that directly goes to two dumpyards - Deonar (holding city's waste from over 9 decades) and Mulund and to scientific landfill - Kanjurmarg. After observing the condition of the Deonar and Mulund dumping grounds and noting how they have reached their saturation points, in February 2016, the Bombay High Court had ordered the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to close down the two dumping grounds. It is in October this year that Mulund dumping ground was finally closed permanently, but Deonar continues to function way past its lifespan.

There is no such saturation point for landfills. As far as Deonar is concerned, there is still some space as we have started processing waste and have more plans to manage the waste effectively in the days to come, says BMC official.

While bio-mining and capping (a containment technology that forms a barrier between the waste and the ground, shielding humans and the environment from the harmful effects of its contents) is being practised at Mulund landfill, bio-reactor (under which liquids are added to help bacteria break down the waste) and composting has been adopted at Kanjurmarg. But the question is, are these solutions sufficient and effective?

The BMC's Opinion: ""The process of bio-reactor is useful for mixed waste as well, so the good thing here is we don't have to pay heed to waste segregation. But it is not that we are ignoring waste segregation at source"", says BMC official.

With increase in waste load, BMC plans to increase the processing of waste at Kanjumarg by March end. The plan is to treat upto 5,800-6,000 metric tonnes of waste at Kanjurmarg and leave only 1000-1200 metric tonnes per day at Deonar.

While 5,000 tonnes will be treated via bio-reactor, 1,000 tonnes will be composted. We are strengthening the segregation activity which will further reduce the total generation and load on Deonar, says BMC official.

The Problem: Until October, of all the waste generated, 1400-1500 metric tonnes was dumped at Mulund dumping ground, every day. Now the same waste is being shared by Deonar and Kanjurmarg landfill, increasing the waste burden on already overstretched landfills. Deonar which expired back in 2009 is still being used recklessly and the result is constant fumes emerging from garbage, leading to instances of fires.

Though BMC has plans to treat waste on a daily basis, but what comes up as a major problem is the legacy waste. Lack of waste segregation at source comes up as another issue as without segregation the amount of waste reaching the landfills cannot be reduced.

The Solution: As experts say, decentralised process and segregation is the key to manage the mammoth waste and BMC is currently focusing on segregation. Shedding light on the same, BMC official says,

We have floated the tender, asking for vehicles with compartments to collect the segregated waste. 40 per cent of the requested vehicles are already in action and the remaining will be up soon. This will of course ease the entire process as dry waste will further get segregated into e-waste, plastic, paper, and others and treated accordingly.

Steps Taken By BMC In 2018: BMC has made it mandatory for bulk generators to treat wet waste at source. The ones failing to do so will be penalised as per the law. For residents and small scale waste generators, awareness camps, exhibitions and activities are being organised. People are being educated about the process of wet waste management at home and encouraged to practice the same.

Until and unless waste generators take the responsibility, we cannot do much. If at home you will segregate the waste, it will be easy for us to treat it as centralised processing centers cannot segregate the 7000 tonnes of waste. It has to start from your own home, building, society and colonies, says BMC official.

The Experts Opinion: ""I agree that waste generators need to take action, but decentralised process is pivotal. Like authority cannot lie in an individual's hand, entire waste cannot be managed in one way. Different kinds of waste need to be treated in different way and for the same we need different strategies"", says Chitra.

Earlier in 2013-2014, the waste load on dumping ground in Mumbai used to be 9,400 tonnes which has now come down to 7,000 tonnes and BMC further plans to bring it down to 6,000 tonnes. Can this be achieved? Given the scale of the crisis, the city sure will have its fingers crossed.

Bengaluru, the IT capital of India, is infamous for its garbage crisis and holds the title of 'garbage city of India'. A city with a population of 1.23 crore generates 4,000 metric tonnes of waste on a daily basis. The waste is majorly categorised into dry, wet and sanitary waste. While the dry waste is collected and taken to 164 dry waste collection centers, wet waste is sent to eight processing units, together capable of treating 2,300 tonnes per day and sanitary waste is being treated by a private company.

Along with this, we have organic waste converter (treatment and recycling of solid and liquid refuse material) of capacity 1500 tonnes. 30 per cent of apartments in the city are doing composting on site. Also, we have a learning center where we give lessons on how to do composting, manage waste and other things. Main aim is to encourage waste segregation at source, Sarfaraz Khan, Joint Commissioner, Solid Waste Management, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).

As far as mixed waste is concerned, it is simply dumped at scientific landfill - Bellahalli in the city, which came into existence around three years ago. In November, the orders were given to close Bellahalli landfill within 90 days, but civic body has decided to use the landfill for six more months and then convert it into a motor racing track. As part of the functioning of scientific landfill, currently, at frequent intervals, waste is covered with a thick layer of mud.

Earlier the city of Bengaluru was known as the garbage city, but today we are proud to say that this tag does not belong to us, Sarfaraz Khan.

The reason Mr Khan proudly says this is how in past a quarry turned into landfill was transformed into a beautiful park. Few years ago, the stone quarry at Bagalur was abandoned, after which it had become a dangerous spot due to the 200 feet deep pit. Slowly and gradually, the site turned into a dumping ground, raising concerns among villagers. It is three years ago, BBMP noticed the site and claimed it for a scientific landfill site. The scientific landfill would intake 300-400 tonnes of mixed waste everyday. After every 8 - 10 feet of garbage, 8 feet of mud capping was given. This way, by August 2017, quarry was filled and saplings of neem and amla and flowering plants like crotons were planted on it.

BBMP has done a lot in 2018 to improve waste management in the city. There is a new 'Swachagraha Kalika Kendra', a composting learning center for home and community, Bengaluru is the only city to collect sanitary waste separately, black spots are being cleaned. A lot has been done, but there is still a long way to go. We have infrastructure and policies, but what is lacking is the implementation and streamlined waste collection system. I feel citizens working with officials and elected representatives makes a good combination and together they can solve the crisis, says Nalini, co-founder, Hasiru Dala.

Madhya Pradesh's Indore has managed to grab the title of India's cleanest city for two years in a row. To maintain the lead in Swachh Survekshan 2019 as well, the city took some stringent steps this year with regards to waste management. From implementing 100 per cent door-to-door waste collection, source segregation, scientific land filling, to eliminating decade old waste from landfills, the city has done it all. It is not just focusing on treating household waste, but plastic and construction and demolition waste management as well.

Indore city generate 1100 metric tonnes of waste per day and we cannot leave this enormous amount of waste just like that. To manage the waste, a decentralised waste treatment system exists at each and every hospital, school, RWA, and other such places which make waste treatment possible at source only. The waste which is not treated goes to centralised waste treatment system handled by IMC and there it is taken care of, says Asad Warsi, Swachh Bharat Mission Consultant.

20 metric tonnes of waste generated in fruit and vegetable mandi (market) is used to power its public transport buses. A bio-mechanisation plant is installed in the market which ends up generating three types of gases from the waste generated in the fruit and vegetable market - Methane, Carbon dioxide (CO2), and Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S). Methane is separated, cleaned, purified and compressed and then converted into bio CNG which can fuel 20-25 buses every day.

Can waste generate wealth? Yes, as ambikapur proves it by earning lakhs. Chhattisgarh's Ambikapur has a population of 1.45 lakh and generates 52 metric tonnes of waste on a daily basis, but instead of dumping it on some or the other dumpyard, the city converts waste into wealth and makes Rs. 20-25 lakh per month.

In the year 2015, the municipal corporation made it compulsory for citizens to segregate the waste at source. Since then, every morning, 447 sanitation workers go out, collect the segregated waste which is further segregated at 17 secondary segregation centres within the city. The segregated waste is then sent for recycling, composting and other kinds of processing, depending on the of waste.

Because of the same, the city was awarded as one of India's best city in 'Innovation and Best Practices' (population 1 - 3 lakh) category in Swachh Survekshan 2018.

The state of Chhattisgarh, which got third rank in Swachh Survekshan 2018, is on the way of following Ambikapur's zero waste model to become India's first zero-landfill state. If Ambikapur can do it, other cities of Chhattisgarh can think of doing it, then why not rest of India?, says Suryakiran Tiwari Agarwal, Municipal Commissioner of Ambikapur.

The success story of Indore, Ambikapur, and especially Kerala's Alappuzha which was even recognised by the United Nations Environment Programme for being exceptional in addressing the garbage crisis, show that managing waste effectively is possible. Decentralised system with segregation at source is a viable option and the way forward, according to experts."
"48","1029857223","2018-12-31","https://www.oneindia.com/india/an-umpiring-insight-rendezvous-with-simon-taufel-2829846.html","An Umpiring Insight: Rendezvous With Simon Taufel","Oneindia",FALSE,"""The best way I can describe it is that umpiring chose me. I didn't choose it.""

Simon Taufel is speculating in a hotel room near Newcastle, Australia, reminiscing about his career with Betway Insider's Tom Clee.

Having played the important role of an ICC umpire for a long span of time, with constant supervision over 74 Tests, 174 ODIs and 34 T20 internationals, Taufel was completely aware of the journey full of ups and downs.

But watching his daughter participate in an Under-12s regional tournament, filled his heart with euphoria. However, he was a semi-retired man now.

""When I pulled the pin on my international career,"" he says, ""I sort of thought that I'd lost a lot of my two boys growing up, and I didn't want to lose my daughter.""

Taufel had just touched 29 on the age bar when he played an umpire for the first time in his life in December 2000 in the match between his native Australia and West Indies. It was a moment of utmost pride.

He figures that during the entire duration of 13-and-a half years, 60-70 days on an average just flew by in fulfilling his duties as a devoted umpire and another 3 days away for every one that he was on the field.

On a whole, he remained detached from his family for more than five long years!

""It's not easy and it's not for everyone,"" he admits.

Taufel was about to begin University in June 1990. He had no intention of becoming an umpire until his friend insisted upon joining him in the umpire's course. He still looked at it only as an opportunity to earn some extra bucks!

As luck would have it, his pal Dave was unable to pass the test with the required percentage of 85 and Taufel, on the other hand, came out with flying colours.

""If anything, I was always probably a little guilty of over-preparing,"" he says. ""I'm a bit of a check-list freak.""

He was quickly progressing and before he knew it, his level of achievement highlighted the word 'International'. This clearly meant that he had to revise and summarise six diverse laws each day in order to incorporate the entire rulebook into his brain, every two weeks.

His retention power was at its peak. He did everything to polish his skills and increase his knowledge and thus observed with keen attention: bowlers, batsmen and previous series, way before being assigned any particular work. He even made it a point to grace net sessions with his presence and watch the teams prepare!

Previous tour notes would be his reference guide and he even kept himself updated about local airports and alternative hotels, just in case! This scenario is before the beginning of cricket.

""I think I probably went further than most, simply because I wouldn't describe myself as a natural umpire,"" he says.

""I had to work harder at my game to feel that I was ready and that I deserved to have a good day out there, rather than just turn up and it be OK.""

His winning the ICC David Shepherd Umpire of the Year award for 5 years consecutively came as no surprise because his hard work and sheer dedication were definitely commendable.

However, he kept no awards to himself, except for one, and gave it all away to the people whom he believed to be his pillars of strength throughout his journey.

""I did feel embarrassed and uncomfortable with those awards,"" he says, ""because umpiring is a team sport and we were singling out one person.""

Talking to Taufel, it became evident that the importance of teamwork between umpires is quite fundamental.

After his retiral from cricket in 2012, he upgraded to the position of ICC Umpire Performance and Training Manager, where he commanded the development and implementation of additional resources to assist those on the field and television booth, not to forget the stationing of umpire coaches to all the international level matches.

""If I did my career again, I would probably want to talk more about my mistakes,"" he says.

""To share my shortcomings more with my colleagues after a day's play, rather than keep them to myself and deal with them on my own in my hotel room.""

Introducing the DRS was definitely an assisting tool to review the decisions taken by on-field umpires, but Taufel, who had sailed through without its aid for 9 years, 4 years with its support did not make much of a difference to him. It did not change the dimensions of the game, in his perspective.

""I don't think DRS has necessarily made umpiring easier or more difficult,"" he says. ""It's just made it different.""

""Pre-DRS, you'd deal with the error later. With DRS, you've got to deal with it at the time.

""You hear your decision dissected in your earpiece, in front of millions of people, and then, after 90 seconds, two minutes, you have to publicly change your decision and somehow regather your thoughts.

""You can feel a bit embarrassed and humiliated. It's really tough to move on and focus on that next delivery.""

Technology is pretty influential. It not only affects the decision-making process but also toys with the behaviour of a player. A clear example is Australian batsman, Cameron Bancroft, who in March this year, was caught altering the condition of a ball using sandpaper in a Test match in South Africa.

""The third umpire, quite easily, has got the toughest job out of the whole umpiring team,"" explains Taufel.

""Their job is to watch the TV as their primary focus. There should be nothing that goes out to people in their lounge rooms but is missed by the third umpire.""

But, as this incident - which led to Bancroft, his captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner all being banned - proved, situations can be deceptive.

""I think it's fair to say that nobody would have expected what happened in Cape Town to unfold before our eyes as it did.

""As much as you try to simulate different scenarios in a training environment, sometimes there are things that you just think: 'Wow, is this really happening?'""

Taufel was in charge of the Australian team, officiating umpire selection and match referee management, at that time, and felt empathetic towards the officials put in that tight spot.

""The game of cricket is now more commercialised. It's a different type of animal at Test and international level.""

""There are a lot of people who cross their limits to try to mould the results their way.

""I've got no problem with players playing the game hard, no problem at all,"" says Taufel, who captained his first XI at secondary school before going on to play for New South Wales Schoolboys Under-19s alongside Adam Gilchrist and Michael Slater.

He laughs. ""I played the game pretty hard. I appealed for just about everything I could. I don't think I ever got into trouble with the umpires, but I do remember getting a bit of a bollocking from my coach for swearing on the field.

""For me, behaviour is a captain, a coach and a team issue. At the moment, people seem to abrogate that responsibility of managing player behaviour through code of conduct or umpires.""

Yet Taufel believes that the scene could change the entire game around! Nevertheless, he can proudly say that he was the only umpire who had ever been invited to give the MCC Spirit Of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture.

""I hold the spirit of cricket close to my heart. Results come and go, but who we are and how we play really defines us.

""We are guardians of the game of cricket. We have to leave it in good condition for the next generation.

""The only way that we can do that is through adherence to the laws and to the spirit of that game.""

This is where Taufel believes that players and coaches can learn from umpires.

""You can't change what's already happened, it's part of history now.""

""But, like a cricket umpire who can't change the ball that's already gone, you can certainly do your best to get the next decision right,"" he says.

""That's what I would say to Australian cricket and that's what I would say to the global game: learn from what's happened and use the opportunity to make the game stronger than it's ever been before.

""That's something that everyone can look at. Not just one country or one player or one captain, it's up to everyone to play their role."""

Body overseeing central government school chain, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) has issued a circular stating the principals, teachers and students in the 1,193 KV schools in India use the Kaizala app for better communication, the Financial Express reports.

Kaizala is a productivity application designed and launched by Microsoft for Indian markets in July 2017. The app, which can also run on 2G networks, enables work management and large-group management.

Minister of State for Human Resource Development (HRD) responsible for Higher Education, Satyapal Singh informed the Rajya Sabha that the app would enable the seamless flow of information within KVS and allow organised communication and gathering of information.

""With the help of this application, teachers and administrative staff will be able to connect with parents and vice-versa, facilitating sharing of regular updates on progress made by the students (and) various initiatives undertaken by the KVS,"" the minister said.

Singh also spoke about the E-Prajna project, which will empower KVS students with modern technology. Singh said, ""The KVS has launched a pilot project E-Prajna under which touch tablets pre-loaded with e-content have been provided to Class 8 students and teachers of 25 KVs (one in each region) during the year 2017-18 for classroom transactions in science and mathematics""."

BHEL's Bangalore and Hyderabad units are working on a large scale in the field of solar energy. However, BHEL Bhopal has sent a proposal to the BHEL corporate office proposing to set up a solar plant at some other place as state government has not given permission to set up the plant at Jamburi grounds.

Senior officials of BHEL said that BHEL units will soon have a solar plant, which will promote production of solar energy.

Management has not shown seriousness

To promote solar energy in the BHEL unit, solar panels were to be set up in block-4. The preparation of the solar panel was completed in the block. But, BHEL management did not show seriousness. For this reason, the work of making solar panels could not begin till now.

At the same time, the three BHEL office-bearers of INTUC, EBU, BMS say that BHEL management officials are not showing seriousness in promoting solar energy.

Solar panels set up on buildings of schools

BHEL management had installed solar panels on school buildings almost two years ago. The purpose was to produce so much electricity through solar panels, which would generate daily electricity for schools. Solar panels have been set up in other schools of the BHEL Education Board, including Jawaharlal Nehru School."

Here is a selection of five stories, each covering one of our focus areas, that made an impact in 2018 and hold out hope for India's future.

As the country braces for the 2019 general elections, the impact of good governance, or the lack of it, will be under the spotlight. We aim to increase our coverage of governance issues, and welcome your suggestions and feedback.

Climate Change

Challenge: Climate change can lower the standard of living of nearly half of India's population by 2050, the World Bank warned in a June 2018 study. Particularly vulnerable are farmers who are dependent on rainfall for a good harvest, especially in regions such as Karnataka that are prone to drought. In the 15 years to 2015, only three years--2005, 2007 and 2010--witnessed no drought, as per a 2017 assessment report by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Monitoring Centre. In 2018, 77% of the 30 districts were declared drought-hit, The Times of India reported on September 14, 2018.

Action: A farmer couple, Shyamrao and Laximibai Patil, in water-scarce Kalaburagi in north Karnataka, have shown that a combination of state and NGO support, supported by grassroots innovation, can help farmers combat the effects of climate change. The Patils practice organic farming, run a dairy and poultry farm, and are helping their fellow farmers experiment with new methods.

The couple have set up their own self-help group to sell produce such as pulses. From their mixed-crop farming and livestock produce, they make an annual income of Rs 5 lakh and a profit of around Rs 2.5 lakh, at a time when 70% of the country's agricultural households

spend more than they earn on average every month.

Gender parity

Challenge: In 2017, nearly 50,000 women died at the hands of intimate partners or family members, making ""home, the most dangerous place for women"", according to a November 2018 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

India is perceived as having the worst record on sexual violence, harassment from cultural and traditional practices and human trafficking, and is considered the least safe country in the world for women, according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll, as

IndiaSpend reported on June 26, 2018. Only 14% of Indian women who have experienced physical or sexual violence have sought help to stop the violence while 77% have neither sought help nor told anyone about the violence they experienced, according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-16).

Action: In Mumbai, health advocacy Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes has since 2001 been running support centres called Dilaasa, which are funded by the National Health Mission, to identify victims of domestic and sexual violence. Using a model of care that can be replicated across government health centres nationwide, Dilaasa centres have provided help to more than 8,000 women.

Over the two years to 2018, Mumbai's 11 centres identified 5,647 women as potential victims of domestic violence. They got 2,554 cases registered for domestic violence and 809 cases for sexual violence, according to municipal records. Sikkim, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Assam and Uttar Pradesh are replicating and activating this model.

Health

Challenge: India has 46.6 million stunted children and is home to 31% of all stunted children under five--the highest in the world--according to the 2018 Global Nutrition Report, IndiaSpend reported on December 10, 2018.

Nearly 20% of Indian children under five are wasted (have low weight for their height) and 7% severely wasted, according to

data from the National Family Health Survey of 2015-16.

The Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), an NGO in Mumbai's Dharavi, the third largest slum in Asia by population, is helping reduce the prevalence of child malnutrition by plugging nutrition awareness gaps and supporting local health workers.

Action: SNEHA's efforts have reduced wasting among children aged up to three by 23% and produced a 109% increase in the services received by children through the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, a government programme covering health, food and primary education. It plugs gaps in nutrition-related knowledge in the community by training community volunteers, who spread awareness and inform anganwadi (daycare) workers about the status of pregnant women and families who are finding it difficult to feed a newborn.

Education

Challenge: India has been successful in increasing primary school enrolment to the extent that more than 83% of primary school-age children were enrolled in 2016-17, according to data from the District Information System for Education (DISE). But fewer than half (47.8%) of grade V rural students could read at least a grade II text in 2016, the Annual Survey of Education Report 2016 found.

Action: World Vision, a non-profit, runs a remedial education programme, Aparajitha, for 4,300 students in government schools in 130 villages in Lalitpur district in Uttar Pradesh. From a zero baseline, within a year 1.55% of enrolled students could read local content (such as newspapers) and understand it; 6.2% (up from 1.8%) could read a story and comprehend it; and 10.4% could read a story (up from 5.1%). World Vision expects to complete the project by 2020 and empower the community to take over.

Disaster relief and rehabilitation

Challenge: In the two decades to 2017, India suffered a $79.5 billion loss, ranking among the top five countries in the world to be affected by climate-related disasters, The Wire reported on October 11, 2018. India is taking baby steps towards disaster preparedness, the lack of which is becoming obvious in the wake of climate change-related extreme weather events. Only 7% of the 4,862 dams in the country have emergency action plans, a 2017 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said, the Hindustan Times reported on September 3, 2018. Often, the armed forces are summoned to undertake rescue operations, such as during the recent Kerala floods in August 2018, despite the constitution of the National Disaster Response Force in 2006.

The Kerala floods affected an

estimated 5 million people's lives and damaged infrastructure to the extent that the state needs nearly Rs 30,000 crore to rebuild.

Action: The Kerala state electricity board's quick response under Mission Reconnect restored electricity to nearly 2.5 million homes in less than two weeks. Kerala is one of the 15 states in India that have 100% household electrification, the Hindustan Times reported on November 28, 2018. It managed the task by improving coordination through a state-level task force and an army of volunteers comprising retired staff, students and private electricity personnel.

This was a year for consolidating the gains that have accrued from major policy decisions taken in the previous four years, a time for monitoring of ongoing projects, tackling road blocks and adding to the already impressive pace of work achieved last year. The Ministry took a decision to complete all ongoing projects that had been awarded upto 2015-16, and placed the highest ever target of constructing at least 12,000 kms of national highways as against 9829 kms achieved during 2017-18, and make special efforts to take this length to 16000 km. Overall, more than about 61,300 km length of road projects, costing more than Rs. 6.48 lakh crore, are in progress at present. The balance ongoing works (which have been awarded, appointed dates declared and works going on at sites) are more than 30,200 kms during the year. In the first nine months of FY 2018-19, 5,759 km has been completed in 18-19 against 4,942 km up to same period in last year.

1.2 In order to achieve this target the Ministry brought in policies, guidelines and practices for expediting pre-construction activities and bringing in more efficiency and transparency in the process. The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS)was developed to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC Mode. BhoomiRashi portal is being used extensively for expediting the process of notification for land acquisition. The portal BIMS and BhoomiRashi portals have further been linked with Public Financial Management System(PFMS) to facilitate real time payment to beneficiaries.

1.3 On the finance front too, National Highways Authority of India did a successful financial closure of its first project under Toll- Operate -Transfer this year andoffered 586 km of national highways under the second bundle. The first TOT bundle of 9 projects, totaling approximately 681 KM of roads in two states of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, was awarded earlier during the year for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the Authority's estimate. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) also got an unsecured loan of Rs 25,000 crore from State Bank of India for 10 years with 3 years of moratorium on repayments. This is the largest amount of loan to have been sanctioned to NHAI in one stroke by any institution. This is also the largest long term unsecured loan sanctioned by SBI at a time to any entity.

A two days long exercise was conducted to review of over 700 ongoing National Highway projects in the country, and over 300 projects were identified to be completed by 2019 achieving the highest ever construction in financial year 2018-19.

The table below details the trends of NH construction over the years.

This is the umbrella program for the highways sector unrolled in 2017-18, that aims to optimize the efficiency of road traffic movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. 34,800 km of National Highways are to be constructed under the Phase-I of the programme between 2017-18 to 2021-22 in a phased manner at a cost of Rs. 5,35,000 crore. This includes 5,000 kms of the National Corridors, 9000 kms of Economic Corridors, 6000 km of Feeder Corridors and Inter-Corridors, 2000 kms of Border Roads, 2,000 kms of Coastal Roads and Port Connectivity Roads and 800 kms of Green-field Expressways.

Projects for 6,407 km road length have been awarded under the BharatmalaPariyojana(including residual NHDP) till the end of October this year. DPRs are being prepared for projects for the balance length. De- congestion projects have been completed for 13 out of 191 congestion points identified, and are under progress for de-congestion of 80 other points. In addition, DPRs are being prepared for 93 congestion points.Out of the 35 locations identified for Multimodal Logistics Parks, DPRs have been initiated for 7 locations and availability of land parcels is being confirmed with State Governments for the rest of the locations.

In order to ensure safe and smooth flow of traffic, Ministry has envisaged a plan for replacement of Level Crossings on National Highways by ROBs/ RUBs under a scheme known as SetuBharatam. Under this programme, out of 174 ROBs/RUBs which are to be constructed, 91 have been sanctioned with an estimated cost of Rs.7,104.72 crore. Out of 91 sanctioned, 59 ROBs/RUBs have been awarded which are in various stages of progress.

The project envisages development of easy access to the four prominent Dhams, namely, Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedranath and Badrinath, situated in the state of Uttrakhand. These four Dhams are prominent pilgrimage centres. The project entails development of 889 km of roads with configuration of two-lane with paved shoulders at an estimated cost of about Rs. 12,000 crore. The projects are being taken up on EPC mode and the programme is targeted for completion by March, 2020.

The two projects of Peripheral Expressways around Delhi, comprising 135 km Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), and 135 km Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE) connecting NH-1 and NH-2 from Western and Eastern side of Delhi was completed this year and inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May 2018 and November 2018 respectively. The EPE was constructed by NHAI and WPE by Haryana Government. The two expressways were envisaged with the twin objectives of decongesting and de-polluting the national capital by diverting the traffic not destined for Delhi.

The EPE stretches from Kundli on NH 1 to Palwal on NH 2, and was constructed at a cost ofRs. 4617.87 crore, in addition to Rs. 5900crorewere spent on acquiring 1700 acres of land. It was completed in a record time of about 500 days against the scheduled target of 910 days. It is a fully access-controlled six-lane expressway with a closed tolling system. The expressway has an iconic toll plaza equipped with electronic toll collection infrastructure, ITS control system of the entire EPE and a digital art gallery, with holographic models of major structures and making of the EPE. Weigh-in-Motion equipment at all 30 entry points, solar power on the entire length, eight solar power plants with a capacity of 4000 KW, rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation and 36 replicas of monuments depicting Indian culture and heritage are major features of this expressway. This project has generated employment opportunities of about 50 lakh man-days.

The 8.36 km long Package -1 of the projects was inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May this year. It is a 14 lane, access-controlledsection stretching from Nizammudin Bridge to Delhi UP Border, and was completed in a record time of 18 months as against the earlier expected construction period of 30 months, at a cost of about Rs. 841.50 crore. This is the first National Highway in the country with 14 lanes, and has several features that would help reduce pollution. These include a 2.5-metre-wide cycle track on either side of the highway, a vertical garden on the Yamuna Bridge, solar lighting system and watering of plants through drip irrigation only.

Package II from UP Border to Dasna(19.28 km), Package -III - Dasna to Hapur( 22.27) km and Package -IV - Green-field Alignment from Dasna to Meerut -(31.78 km) are under construction and are likely to be completed by March 2019.

The 473 km expressway will link Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway to Mumbai-Pune Expressway thus providing Expressway connectivity from Ahmedabad to Pune for a length of about 650 Km.

This 1250 km Expressway is being developed along a new alignment between Delhi and Mumbai, which passes through backward and tribal districts of Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. A sum of one lakh crore rupees will be spent on this expressway.It will reduce the distance between Delhi and Mumbai from the present 1450km through NH 8 to 1250 km, and the travel time to 12 hours. The sections of proposed highway from Delhi to Dahod in Rajasthan are under tendering, while the section between Vadodara to Ankleshwar in Gujarat have already been awarded. The DPR is under progress for the remaining sections.

DPR is under progress for this 260 km Expressway. This is a green-field alignment. There are two existing roads connecting Bangalore-Chennai, one is via Hoskote (Bangalore)-AP then to Chennai & second is via Electronic City (Bangalore) Hosur(Tamil Nadu) and then to Chennai. The alignment of the proposed expressway is passing in between these two stretches.

Greenfield alignment is being explored for this 500 km long proposed Expressway.

DPR has been awarded and alignment finalization is under progress for the new green-field 940 km Nagpur - Hyderabad - Bangalore EXP.

DPR is in progress for 75 km of Kanpur - Lucknow EXP

Hon'ble Prime Minister inaugurated the 16.55 km, Rs 759.36 crore Varanasi Ring Road Phase-I and 17.25 km, Rs 812.59 crore Babatput-Varanasi road on NH-56 in November. It has reduced the travel time from Varanasi to the airport, and is proving a big relief to the people of Varanasi and to tourists providing a more convenient access to Sarnath, an important site for Buddhist pilgrimage.

The Ministry has taken up construction of a signature 4-lane Bridge to connect the mainland at Okha to Byet-Dwarka Island off the Gujarat Coast with this SignatureBridge spanning a length of 2.32 kms. The Project has been awarded on 01.01.2018 at a cost of Rs. 689.47 crores. This will be the longest span cable stayed bridge in India with the main span of 500 mtrs. The project is scheduled to be completed in a period of 30 months.

Approval has been given for a project for construction of 9.9 km long new 6 - lane bridge across river Ganga on NH - 96 at Phaphamau in Allahabad with total capital cost of Rs. 1948.25 crore. The construction period for the project is three years and likely to be completed by December, 2021. The new bridge will resolve the traffic congestion on existing old 2 - lane Phaphamau bridge on NH-96 at Allahabad. The new bridge will also facilitate to the large congregation of people at Holy City Allahabad during Kumbh, Ardh-Kumbh and other yearly ritual baths at SANGAM in Prayag. This will give a boost to pilgrimage tourism and local economy of Holy city of Prayag. This new 6 - lane bridge will also be beneficial for the Lucknow / Faizabad bound traffic coming from Madhya Pradesh via National Highway - 27 and National Highway - 76 through Naini Bridge. In addition, this project of new bridge will generate direct employment during construction for about 9.20 lakh mandays.

Approval was given to a project for construction of 6.930 km long 4-lane bridge at Phulaut in Bihar, along with approval for rehabilitation and up-gradation of existing Birpur- Bihpur section of National Highway-106. The construction of this new Bridge will fill the existing 30 km long gap between Udakishanganj and Bihpur of National Highway Number 106 in Bihar, which will provide through connectivity between Nepal/ North Bihar/ East-West Corridor (passing through NH- 57) and South Bihar/ Jharkhand/ Golden Quadrilateral (passing through NH -2), besides full utilization of National Highway Number-31.

A network of 35 Multimodal Logistics Parks had been identified for development in the Phase - 1 of BharatmalaPariyojana. The availability of the land parcels for development of Multimodal Logistics Parks has been confirmed at 7 locations and DPRs have been initiated in all the nodes.

This is a project for constructing a 14.150 km long, 2-lane bi-directional Zojila Tunnel in Jammu & Kashmir. This would be India's longest road tunnel and the longest bi-directional tunnel in Asia. The construction of this tunnel will provide all weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil and Leh and will bring about all round economic and socio-cultural integration of these regions.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the construction, operation and maintenance of the 2- Lane, 4.532 Km long Bi-directional Silkyara Bend - Barkot Tunnel on Dharasu-Yamunotri section along NH -134 in the State of Uttarakhand. The project forms part of the Chardham Plan. The construction period of the project is 4 years at an estimated cost of Rs. 1383.78 crore. Once complete, this stretch will reduce the travel distance from Dharasu to Yamunotri by about 20 Km and travel time byaboutanhour.It will also provide all weather connectivity to Yamunotri, encouraging regional socio-economic development, trade and tourism within the country. The project will be implemented by National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. (NHIDCL).

Around Rs. 1,90,000 crore worth of projects have been sanctioned for the construction of road projects for over 12,000 km in the North East region. The projects being executed by NHIDCL are to the tune of Rs. 1, 66,026 crore, covering 10,892 km of roads in all the eight NE states. Projects costing Rs. 17,257 crore have been allotted to the respective state PWDs. Further, projects costing Rs. 7,000 crore are entrusted to the NHAI.

The Ministry has focused on completion of on-going projects along with sanction and award of new projects. A total of 73 projects (8,187 km) worth an estimated investment of Rs.1,00,000 crore wereidentified as Languishing Projects. The reasons for delay were identified and policy interventions undertaken to address the same.

The Ministry is monetizing its road assets constructed with public funds through Toll-Operate-Transfer (ToT) scheme. The scheme envisages bidding of bundled national highways for a concession period of 30 years. The first bundle comprised 9 projects, totalling 681 km of roads in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. It was awarded in 2018 to Macquarie for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the NHAI's estimate.The second bundle comprises over 586 kms spread over four states - Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal and Bihar. The offer has 12 toll plazas across four highways.

TheNational Highways Authority of India (NHAI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding(MoU)withtheStateBankofIndiatoreceiveRs.25,000croreasa long-term,unsecuredloanfor10years.Thisisthelargestamountofloantohavebeen sanctioned by the SBl in one go. This is also the largest ever fund that NHAI has ever received in one go.

The Ministry has issued detailed guidelines for determination of proper alignment of NH projects, advising executing agencies to examine the feasibility of a green- field alignment, especially in the case of economic corridors, instead of widening existing highways. This has been done because widening involves acquisition of land for Right of Way (RoW), shifting of utilities and demolition of built up structure, all of which involves a lot of time and cost. Also, earlier highways were largely planned to be serpentine, linking all possible towns in the vicinity. This road geometry has been found to be sub optimal, especially in case of economic corridors. BharatmalaPariyojanaalso calls for a corridor approach for economic corridors. It has also been found in a few test cases that it is feasible to acquire a RoW of 60 to 70 mtrs for a green field road project at the same cost as involved in the expansion of an existing road, especially when the associated costs and time taken in utility shifting, tree felling, additional compensation for demolition of structures coming in the RoW under expansion are taken into account.

AWebUtilityhasbeendevelopedwherebythelandacquisitionprocedureforthe NH projects, including processing of all LA related gazette notifications, are being done through a common platform called ""BhoomiRashi"". The Utility has been linked with the e-gazette platform of the MinistryofUrbanDevelopment,GovernmentofIndia,forpublicationofGazette Notifications.TheuseofBhumi Rashi has helped in cutting down the processing time from 2 to 3 months earlier to one to two weeksnow.

BhoomiRashi has also been integrated with the Public Financial Management System(PFMS)platformoftheMinistryofFinancefordepositofcompensationin theaccountsoflandowners/interestedpersonsonarealtimebasis, instead of being parked with CALA.

The Ministry has developed a Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC mode for all NH works and centrally sponsored works.BIMS acts as a data base for allbasic details of bidders like civil works experience, cash accruals and network, annual turnover etc,. This allows quick pre-qualification assessment of bidders based on evaluation parameters like threshold capacity and bid capacity from already stored data. Technical evaluationcantherefore be carried out faster using this information.

AnnualawardsforexcellenceinNationalHighwayssectorhasbeeninstitutedfrom thisyearonwardsforrecognizingconcessionairesandcontractorswhohavebeen performing exceptionally well. Applications have been invited from all the concessionaires and contractors working in the field of highways construction and tolling. These awards are designed across the fivecategories of construction management, operation and maintenance, best toll plaza, safest highway, innovation in design and construction technology.

India's first Highway Capacity Manual developed by CSIR-CRRI was launched this year. The manual is designed to be a tool for guiding road engineers and policy makers in the country. It lays down guidelines for the development and management of different types of roads, based on traffic characteristics on such roads having varying lane configurations.

The Ministry has organized a workshop on 18.12.2018 in Delhi for Regional Officers of Ministry, NHAI and NHIDCL to discuss the issues relating to land acquisition, contract document (EPC/DPR) and E-Disha (ERP projects), new standards and technical specifications. A Manual of Guidelines on Land Acquisition for National Highways under the National Highways Act, 1956 has also been released for seamless process of Land Acquisition for National Highways.

As per the Ministry's annual report on road accidents based on the data reported by Police authorities throughout India, there has been some marginal reduction in the number of road accidents and fatalities in 2017, as can be seen from the table below.

The Ministry has been making concerted efforts to address the problem of road safety through a series of measures that include improving road infrastructure, road safety audits, identification and rectification of black spots on roads and strengthening the automobile safety standards, organizing road safety awareness programmes and strengthening enforcement etc. These efforts have started showing some results.

The Ministry has so far identified 789 road accident black spots in various States of which 651 ON National Highways and 138 are on State roads. Work for rectification of these black spots is at various stages of completion.

The Ministry has been working in association with States, Vehicle manufactures and NGOs for strengthening the driving training. Institute of Driving training and Research (IDTRs), Regional Driving Training Centres (RDTCs) and Driving Training Centre (DTC) have been established which act as model Driving Training Centres with state of art infrastructure. Ministry has also launched a scheme for creating driving training centres in all the districts of the country and support refresher-training programme for heavy commercial vehicles drivers.

Four forms i.e. (a) Learner License, (b) Driving License, (c) Renewal of License, and (d) updation of Address - all have been consolidated into one. The new form will enable Aadhar based verification of the applicant's identity to provide online services for renewal, change of address etc. Another highlight of the new form is that it would capture an applicant's willingness for organ donation.

The permissible safe axle weight of goods vehicles was revised and increased by about 15% to 20 % for different configurations of axles. The decision was taken with a view to help in increasing the carrying capacity of goods transport vehicles and bring down logistics cost. The amendment will increase the carrying capacity of goods vehicles by about 20-25 % and lower logistics costs by about 2%. It will also bring down the incidence of overloading. While automobile technology and road construction quality have improved greatly over the years, the axle loads have remained the same since 1983 when they were last notified. There was a felt need to harmonize the axle load with international standards.

NHAI has developed a matrix-based methodology to rank the Fee Plazas on parameters such as electronic tolling, time taken in clearance of FASTag lanes, display panels, staff behaviour, cleanliness, etc. The data for the matrix is to be collected by the Regional Officers who will use the same to rank the Fee Plazas under their jurisdiction. Meanwhile, a countrywide drive was launched by NHAl on more than 300 toll plazas across the country on 10 February, 2018, to address issues that affect highway users. Officers visited toll plazas and addressed issues of user convenience and took feedback from the people.

6.3 Linkage of PFMS with Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) and BhoomiRashi

The two IT initiatives of this Ministry, which are aimed at expediting pre- construction processes relating to bidding and land acquisition respectively, have now been integrated with the Public Financial management System (PFMS). The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) is aimed at streamlining the process of pre-qualification of bidders for EPC Mode of contracts for National Highway workswithenhanced transparency and objectivity. The BhoomiRashiportal of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways allows for totally digital and paper-less processing of land acquisition cases, and has resulted in transparent, quick, corruption-free and error-free handling of land acquisition cases. It has alsomade the possible real-time tracking of activities and generation of reports relating to land acquisition. Revenue records of about 7 lakh villages across the country have been integrated in the portal. This digital change has drastically reduced the time taken for issuance of land acquisition notifications from 3-6 months to 1-2 weeks. Over 2000 notifications have already been issued by the Ministry in the first eight months of this financial year that while during the past two years, about a thousand land acquisition notifications could be issued every year. The process has also brought transparency in the system. Earlier the approved compensation amount used to be parked with the CALA (Competent Authority for Land Acquisition) but with BhoomiRashi portal this amount directly transferred into the account of the person concerned, through Public Financial Management System which is an integral part of the portal. In addition to this, the process is also environment friendly since there is no physical movement of files - all work is done digitally.

An advisory has been issued by this Ministry wherein the citizen can produce the transport related documents such as registration, insurance, fitness and permit, the driving licence, certificate for pollution under check and any other relevant documents, if required, in physical or electronic form, on demand by any police officer in uniform or any other officer authorized by the State Government in this behalf. This would enable the use of digital platforms for carrying and verification of the documents and is a step towards citizen facilitation and to ensure so that citizen are not harassed/ inconvenienced.

Prime News, Nation, (New Delhi), December 31:-The government has appointed four new Information Commissioners in the Central Information Commission which was functioning with just three of them as against a sanctioned strength of 11, including the Chief Information Commissioner.

President Ram Nath Kovind has approved the appointment of former IFS officer Yashwardhan Kumar Sinha, former IRS officer Vanaja N Sarna, former IAS Neeraj Kumar Gupta and former Law Secretary Suresh Chandra as Information Commissioners in the Central Information Commission, a government order accessed by PTI said.

Sinha is a 1981-batch Indian Foreign Service officer who was the High Commissioner of India in the United Kingdom.

An alumnus of St Michael's High School in Patna and St Stephen's College in Delhi, Sinha had served a number of important postings in the Ministry of External Affairs including the crucial Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran Division, which he headed for four years as Additional Secretary.

The only woman in the CIC will be Sarna, a 1980-batch Indian Revenue Service (Customs and Excise) officer, who was the Chief of Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC).

Neeraj Kumar Gupta, a 1982-batch IAS officer, was Secretary in the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management.

Chandra, an Indian Legal Service officer, retired as Union law secretary this year and was also private secretary to the then Law Minister Arun Jaitley between 2002 and 2004.

All the bureaucrats appointed by the government have retired this year.

After recent retirements of Chief Information Commissioner R K Mathur and Information Commissioners Yashovardhan Azad, Sridhar Acharyulu and Amitava Bhattacharyya, the Commission, the highest adjudicating authority in RTI matters, was left with three Information Commissioners, prompting activists to approach the Supreme Court on the issue of vacancies.

The Supreme Court had asked the Centre and states to maintain transparency in appointments of Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners and upload the details of search committees and applicants on website.

Commenting on the appointment process, Commodore Lokesh Batra, one of the petitioners in the case, said the government has failed to comply with the Supreme Court directions of posting the details on website.

""As my gut feeling said, the government did not comply with the Supreme Court directions viz transparency as it did not post details on its website,"" Batra told PTI.

During the hearing, the Centre had told the top court that the search committee has shortlisted names for the post of CIC and a final decision will be taken soon.

A bench of Justices A K Sikri, S Abdul Nazeer and R Subhash Reddy asked the Centre to put on the website details of search committee for CIC and ICs.

Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand, appearing for the Centre, had informed the court that a total of 65 applications were received for the CIC post and 280 applications for the post of four ICs in the Central Information Commission.

She had said that after these posts are filled up, notification will be issued for inviting applications for remaining posts of ICs.

The Centre seems to have ignored plea of former Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu who had called for adequate representation of non-bureaucrats in the Commission in accordance with the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

Citing Section 12 (5) of the RTI Act, he had written to the President that the Act provides for selecting people of eminence, having experience in law, science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass media or administration and governance."

Ltd in early August, had asked policy makers to look into the grievances of offline traders about e-commerce companies.

Taking the cue from the Competition Commission of India (CCI), the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP), responsible for foreign direct investment policy, has taken steps that have caused angst among companies in India's $41 billion online shopping industry, catering to about 100 million shoppers.

The CCI had then declined to look into complaints of alleged predatory pricing and preferential treatment to some vendors filed by brick-and-mortar retailers as these were not found to be relevant in deciding whether the Walmart-Flipkart deal stifled competition.

The regulator had said majority of the concerns raised by traders had no nexus to the competition dimension of the deal but those worries may merit policy intervention. ""As per FDI policy, an e-commerce platform cannot influence market prices directly or indirectly. However, this is a matter of consideration for the appropriate regulatory/enforcement authority. The issues concerning FDI policy would need to be addressed in that policy space to ensure that online market platforms remain a true marketplace providing access to all retailers,"" the regulator had said in its order.

Competition regulators typically approach such concerns primarily from the view of consumer benefit and do not bar exclusive tie-ups unless they lead to appreciable adverse effect on competition.

CCI, which examined the wholesale business-to-business operations of both Walmart and Flipkart in India, did not find the transaction to cause any adverse effect on competition in that segment either. ""The deal will fundamentally not change the competition landscape. Within e-commerce, major players exist today and will continue to exist tomorrow despite the deal,"" said Anurag Mathur, partner and leader, consumer goods and retail, PwC India's strategy and management consulting practice.

A government official, said on condition of anonymity, said last week that the clarification on e-commerce FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) was meant to ensure a level-playing field among all vendors who sell their wares through such platforms. The market behaviour of online market places that foreign investors could acquire without government approval is a concern for their old school retail rivals as well as for policy makers as retail trade is the livelihood of a large number of people and is a politically sensitive issue.

India does not effectively permit FDI in offline multi-brand retail. Rules allow up to 51% FDI in this segment with government approval, but not a single proposal has been cleared so far."

Private equity fund Cerestra Advisors has acquired a K12 school in Pune as a part of their plan to build a portfolio of schools in the country and float an educational Invit (infrastructure investment trust).

Cerestra bought Billabong High International School in Hadapsar area of Pune for Rs 600 million through its Cerestra Edu Infra Fund, which presently owns a total of eight K12 schools valued at over Rs 4.5 billion.

The said school is spread across 2.25 acres of land and has a built-up area of 135,000 square feet with a capacity of 2500 students. The school is leased to the operator for a period of 30 years.

Cerestra has a total of eight such schools, which were bought and leased back to leading Indian chains including Jain Group of Institutions (JGI) in Bengaluru, Sancta Maria in Hyderabad and Witty International in Mumbai, among others.

""Cerestra had launched its first Education Infrastructure Fund in 2016 with the objective of creating a first of it's kind Education Invit. The plan is to have a relationship with eight to ten leading school operators across India and have a portfolio of $70-100 million worth of assets with each of them,"" said Chhabra.

""We focus on the assets which have a long-term rental yield potential. This model also helps the school operators to monetize their assets to raise funds. In this structure, the operating business unlocks significant capital for expansion without needing to resort to debt. Staying asset light also results in a superior return on equity for the operators this creating a win win partnership,"" he said.

Chhabra said they were closing their second education fund of $300 million which will start investing from the first quarter of next year.

Cerestra was started by Chhabra as part of Religare' global asset management business. The Capital Partnership, a global multi-family office with over $7 billion under management, partnered with the management team to buyout Religare from the venture as of last year."

Even though this patent was later invalidated, the process developed by Coolidge helped in brightening the world. A.S.Ganesh throws light upon Coolidge, the man who helped utilise the ductility of tungsten...

You've seen incandescent light bulbs, haven't you? A device wherein a wire filament is heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light, the incandescent light bulb is one of the earliest forms of electric light that still remains relevant to this day. If you had looked at these bulbs close enough, you surely would have noticed the wire filament. That filament is generally made of tungsten and it was William David Coolidge who made that possible.

Born in a small farm in Hudson, Massachusetts, the U.S. in 1873, Coolidge was drawn towards electrical devices from a very young age and spent a considerable amount of time in the town's machine shop. He excelled at school right from the beginning and went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1891, specialising in physical chemistry and electrical engineering.

Even though he had to borrow money to complete his course work and graduated with a debt, he won a scholarship to the University of Leipzig, Germany, where he received his Ph.D. in Physics in 1899. He returned to teach at MIT, conducting research at the same time into the electrical conductivity of aqueous solutions at high temperatures.

It was during this time, in 1905, when Willis R. Whitney, American chemist and founder of the General Electric Research Laboratory, approached Coolidge and offered him a position in his laboratory. The laboratory was devoted to original research to discover profitable fields, but had been drawing blanks and was failing in its mission. Coolidge accepted the offer and would eventually help them turn a corner.

As GE's lighting business depended on the Edison high-resistance carbon-filament lamp, Whitney and the management were tasked to ward off the competition from ceramic-filament lamp and mercury-vapour lamp, which were gaining prominence. Coolidge, who first got into the lamp filament problem through tantalum, soon switched to tungsten and was left to explore its possibilities.

Through years of toil, Coolidge observed that sintered (coalesced into a solid or porous mass by heating without liquefaction) tungsten filaments lost some of their extreme brittleness when passed through a rolling mill with heated rolls. This proved to be a foot in the door and further years of research allowed them to come up with a process that made tungsten sufficiently ductile (the ability to be drawn out into a thin wire) at room temperatures.

Using close control of the working temperatures and through trace metal additions, the process was perfected. GE scrapped all its previous lamp-making equipment and started selling lamps with the ductile tungsten filaments by early 1911. Considering that these bulbs went on to dominate the lighting industry, it proved to be a shrewd move from the company.

The ductile tungsten thus obtained even came to be known as ""Coolidge metal"" and Coolidge received a patent for this process on December 30, 1913. This patent, however, was invalidated in the 1920s on the grounds that ductility was a property inherent to metallic tungsten. The courts ruled that Coolidge metal was essentially a discovery and not a patentable invention.

Apart from his contribution towards lighting, Coolidge also had a hand in various other achievements. He invented the Coolidge tube, capable of producing highly predictable amounts of radiation, that became the prototype of the modern X-ray tube. He also worked on the construction of X-ray machines for cancer treatment and ably steered GE's Research Laboratory to safety during the Great Depression. By the time Coolidge passed away aged 101, he had amassed innumerable patents, awards and honorary degrees, not to mention the goodwill of the countless lives that he had impacted."

An alumnus of St Michael's High School in Patna and St Stephen's College in Delhi, Sinha had served a number of important postings in the Ministry of External Affairs including the crucial Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran Division, which he headed for four years as additional secretary.

Neeraj Kumar Gupta, a 1982-batch IAS officer, was secretary in the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, while Chandra was an Indian Legal Service officer, who retired as Union law secretary this year. Between 2002 and 2004, Chandra was the private secretary to then law minister Arun Jaitley.

The Supreme Court had asked the Centre and states to maintain transparency in appointments of Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners and upload the details of search committees and applicants on their website.

Commenting on the appointment process, Commodore Lokesh Batra, one of the petitioners in the case, said the government has failed to comply with the Supreme Court directions of posting the details on the website.

""As my gut feeling said, the government did not comply with the Supreme Court directions viz transparency as it did not post details on its website,"" Batra told PTI.

Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand, appearing for the Centre, had informed the court that a total of 65 applications were received for the CIC post and 280 applications for the post of four ICs in the Central Information Commission.

She had said after these posts are filled up, notification will be issued for inviting applications for remaining posts of ICs.

Gentlemen, here's to you. It's been a fine year for Hindi cinema, and these performers were at the forefront, soaking up that unforgiving spotlight. They took on unconventional characters, mastered demanding new skills, and stepped far out of their comfort zones. These ten men left me applauding. Here are Hindi cinema's best actors of the year:

10. Ranveer Singh (Simmba)

There is a lot to be said for the old-school Hero with a capital H, a leading man with screen-conquering presence and irrepressible charisma and Ranveer Singh -- bless his deafeningly loud soul -- says it all and more in this one. With a less magnetic actor, this would have been a Sunil Shetty film.

9. Vijay Raaz (Pataakha)

They call him 'Bechara Bapu,' the feeble father. A prematurely ageing man, deflated by warring offspring. He wants his children to be better than he was -- he warns them about smoking, for instance, despite being a smoker -- but they don't listen till he spits on a stone and leaves decisions to fate. Raaz plays this Gandhi-figure with a droopy melancholia, arresting our attention.

Raaz also stole the film Stree with a one-scene appearance, as an old writer who lives in fear, perpetually asking if The Emergency has been lifted.

8. Jaideep Ahlawat (Raazi)

He doesn't suffer fools. In Meghna Gulzar's Raazi, Ahlawat plays a senior intelligence officer, RAW trainer Khalid Mir. He's been asked to school an inexperienced, unqualified chit of a girl -- a girl whose only qualification to being a spy is being born to one -- and his behaviour is appropriately cut and dry, never a quarter given as he exactingly demands that she better herself, quick. The role demands brusqueness and Ahlawat is excellent in it.

7. Ravi Kishan (Mukkabaaz)

In one of the most important roles of the year, Kishan plays a proud Dalit boxing coach. When questioned about his caste, Sanjay Kumar sits bolt upright, unwilling to give an inch. He's the one who explains the difference between an actual boxer, a mukkebaaz, and a scrappy thrower of punches, the mukkabaaz of the film's title. He pushes his students hard, matter of factly telling his protege that it's good the young boxer's wife is away so his body will get rest. Kishan's body language is tight, as if there is no room for even a rested muscle when people are watching, and the actor only unwinds when he's about to feast on unexpected meat -- ""It looks like the goat has walked to us,"" he says, jubilant -- or when that meat leads to him being lynched.

6. Avinash Tiwary (Laila Majnu)

One of the most disarming lines on screen this year came from Tiwary's character in the timeless Laila Majnu, playing a man perpetually on a charm offensive. He tells the girl he is trying to woo how he is aware he isn't a good looking man -- which is why he needs to try so hard to be smart, dress well, hide behind some stubble. This is not the self-awareness of most leading men, and Tiwary is anything but typical as he goes from courtship to delirium. The more frenzied he gets, the harder it is to look away from him.

5. Shah Rukh Khan (Zero)

An entitled brat constrained only by the size of his body, Khan plays the ultimate overreacher with a Napoleon complex. The actor brings an electric vitality to the part of the obnoxious Bauaa Singh, and tackles this peculiar fable with panache, no matter how preposterous his task: from trying to move stars while stars watch him, to bolting from a wedding while still garlanded by banknotes, using those notes to pay for his travel, all while he clutches a reality-show envelope like a golden ticket. Absurdly romantic.

4. Gajraj Rao (Badhaai Ho)

Very briefly, Jeetender Kaushik considers growing a moustache. A modest ticket-examiner on the Northern Railways, he is an older-than-usual father to be, which has given him a peculiar status among the family, as a champion of virility. Rao plays him as a simple man, eager to please both wife and mother, a man who doesn't believe in tipping those who do their job, but one who ultimately grants a (smaller) mango as a reward. His secret romance is poetry -- his pen-name is 'Vyakul,' meaning Restless -- that he writes on the sly and reads aloud to his wife behind closed doors. Understated and effortless, Rao was the year's most romantic hero.

3. Varun Dhawan (October)

Sometimes you have to keep an actor from acting -- or, at least, from showing his acting. Dhawan is immaculate in Shoojit Sircar's October as a directionless hotel management trainee who finds focus -- a rather disproportionate amount of focus, true -- with the injury of a colleague who happened to ask about him right before a severe accident. Dhawan is open-mouthed and naive, a man-child forced to grow up by thrusting someone else's responsibility unto himself. It is a performance disdainful of the camera. Where is Dan, she asked. There is no truer answer than to say he's just... around.

2. Ayushmann Khurrana (Andhadhun)

This is tougher than it looks. A man pretending to be blind, who is later actually blinded. Plus even when Khurrana is playing a pretender, he's still making it a strong, committed blind performance, not the Hindi film look-to-the-left kind of blindness we're used to. The actor nails the tonality between his shifts in sightlessness, and crucially keeps the tiniest of his actions tell-tale; his deliberations take on new meaning with every repeat viewing. Notice, for instance, how performative he's being when feeling around for the time on his wristwatch.

As if this wasn't enough, Khurrana trained hard and learnt to hammer melodies out on the piano while other actors waltzed about in front of him with blood and bodies. Deceptively brilliant -- in every way.

1. Vineet Kumar Singh (Mukkabaaz)

Movie muscles in Hindi cinema may never have looked as earned and as authentic as those of Singh in this boxing movie.

His Shravan Kumar is driven to rebellion not because of injustice but because of a beguilingly pretty girl, and gradually he finds himself boxed in by bigots and biases. Singh is fierce, driven and impressively fleet-footed, both in the ring and outside, as he puts up with many a humiliation to keep his hopes up.

Singh wrote this film, learned to box, and wrote lyrics for its finest song, Paintra. This is a bonafide labour of love for the actor, and that suits the character he creates. With Shravan Kumar, he gives us a guy willing to move the world for a kiss and a knockout."

Not only dissidents and activists, but also high-level officials, Marxists, foreigners and even a movie star -- people who never publicly opposed the ruling Communist Party -- have been whisked away by police to unknown destinations.

The widening dragnet throws into stark relief the lengths to which Xi's administration is willing to go to maintain its control and authority.

A look at some of the people who went missing in 2018 at the hands of the Chinese state:

FOREIGN PAWNS

China threatened ''grave consequences'' if Canada did not release high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou, shortly after the Huawei chief financial officer was detained in Vancouver in December for possible extradition to the U.S.

The apparent consequences materialized within days, when two Canadian men went missing in China. Both turned up in the hands of state security on suspicion of endangering national security, a nebulous category of crimes that has been levied against foreigners in recent years.

Former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig was taken by authorities from a Beijing street late in the evening, a person familiar with his case said. He is allowed one consular visit a month and has not been granted access to a lawyer, as is standard for state security cases.

Also detained is Michael Spavor, who organizes tours to North Korea from the border city of Dandong. China has not said whether their detentions are related to Meng's, but a similar scenario unfolded in the past.

A Canadian couple was detained in 2014 on national security grounds shortly after Canada arrested Su Bin, a Chinese man wanted for industrial espionage in the U.S.

Like Spavor, Kevin and Julia Garratt lived in Dandong, where they ran a popular coffee shop for nearly a decade. They also worked with a Christian charity that provided food to North Korean refugees.

While Julia Garratt was released on bail, her husband was held for more than two years before he was deported in September 2016 _ about two months after Su pleaded guilty in the US.

TAX-EVADING ACTRESS

Fan Bingbing was living the dream. Since a breakthrough role at the age of 17, Fan has headlined dozens of movies and TV series, and parlayed her success into modeling, fashion design and other ventures that have made her one of the highest-paid celebrities in the world.

All this made her a potent icon of China's economic success, until authorities reminded Fan -- and her legion of admirers -- that even she was not untouchable.

For about four months, Fan vanished from public view. Her Weibo social media account, which has more than 63 million followers, fell silent. Her management office in Beijing was vacated. Her birthday on Sept. 16 came and went with only a handful of greetings from entertainment notables.

When she finally resurfaced, it was to apologize.

""I sincerely apologize to society, to the friends who love and care for me, to the people, and to the country's tax bureau,'' Fan said in a letter posted on Weibo on Oct. 3.

She admitted to tax evasion. State news agency Xinhua reported that Fan and the companies she represents had been ordered to pay taxes and penalties totaling 900 million yuan ($130 million).

""Without the party and the country's great policies, without the people's loving care, there would be no Fan Bingbing,'' she wrote, a cautionary tale for other Chinese celebrities.

Xinhua concurred in a commentary on her case: ""Everyone is equal before the law, there are no 'superstars' or 'big shots.' No one can despise the law and hope to be lucky.""

SECURITY INSIDER

Unlike most swallowed up by China's opaque security apparatus, Meng Hongwei knew exactly what to expect.

Meng, no relation to the Huawei executive, is a vice minister of public security who was also head of Interpol, the France-based organization that facilitates police cooperation across borders.

When he was appointed to the top post, human rights groups expressed concern that China would use Interpol as a tool to rein in political enemies around the world.

Instead, he was captured by the same security forces he represented.

In September, Meng became the latest high-ranking official caught in Xi's banner anti-corruption campaign. The initiative is a major reason for the Chinese leader's broad popularity, but he has been accused of using it to eliminate political rivals.

Xi pledged to confront both high-level ''tigers'' and low-level ''flies'' in his crackdown on graft _ a promise he has fulfilled by ensnaring prominent officials.

Meng was missing for weeks, before Chinese authorities said he was being investigated for taking bribes and other crimes. A Chinese delegation delivered a resignation letter from Meng to Interpol headquarters.

His wife Grace Meng told the AP that she does not believe the charges against her husband. The last message he sent her was an emoji of a knife.

DARING PHOTOGRAPHER

Lu Guang made his mark photographing the everyday lives of HIV patients in central China. They were poor villagers who had contracted the virus after selling their own blood to eke out a living _ at a going rate of $7 a pint, they told Lu.

A former factory worker, Lu traversed China's vast reaches to capture reality at its margins. He explored environmental degradation, industrial pollution and other gritty topics generally avoided by Chinese journalists, who risk punishment if they pursue stories considered to be sensitive or overly critical.

His work won him major accolades such as the World Press Photo prize, but his prominence likely also put him on the government's radar.

This November, Lu was travelling through Xinjiang, the far west region that has deployed a vast security network in the name of fighting terrorism. He was participating in an exchange with other photographers, after which he was to meet a friend in nearby Sichuan province. He never showed up.

More than a month after he disappeared, his family was notified that he had been arrested in Xinjiang, according to his wife Xu Xiaoli. She declined to elaborate on the nature of the charges.

STUDENT MARXIST

In the past, the political activists jailed in China were primarily those who fought for democracy and an end to one-party rule. They posed a direct ideological threat to the Communist Party.

This year, the party locked in on a surprising new target: young Marxists.

About 50 students and recent graduates of the country's most prestigious universities convened in August in Shenzhen, an electronics manufacturing hub, to rally for factory workers attempting to form a union.

Among them was Yue Xin, a 20-something fresh out of Peking University. Earlier this year, she made headlines by calling for the elite school to release the results of its investigation into a decades-old rape case.

This time, she was one of the most vocal leaders of the labor rights group, appearing in photographs with her fist up in a Marxist salute and wearing a T-shirt that said ""Unity is strength"" -- the name of a patriotic Chinese communist song.

Yue, a passionate student of Marx and Mao Zedong, espoused the same values as the party. She wrote an open letter to Xi and the party's central leadership saying all the students wanted was justice for Jasic Technology laborers.

Her letter quoted Xi's own remarks: ""We must adhere to the guiding position of Marxism.'' Yue called Marx ''our mentor'' and likened the ideas of him and Mao to spiritual sustenance.

Nonetheless, she ended up among those rounded up in a raid on the apartment the activists were staying at in Shenzhen. While most have been released, Yue remains unaccounted for. She has been missing for four months."

The government has appointed four new Information Commissioners in the Central Information Commission which was functioning with just three of them as against a sanctioned strength of 11, including the Chief Information Commissioner.

President Ram Nath Kovind has approved the appointment of former IFS officer Yashwardhan Kumar Sinha, former IRS officer Vanaja N Sarna, former IAS Neeraj Kumar Gupta and former Law Secretary Suresh Chandra as Information Commissioners in the Central Information Commission, a government order accessed by PTI said.

Sinha is a 1981-batch Indian Foreign Service officer who was the High Commissioner of India in the United Kingdom.

An alumnus of St Michael's High School in Patna and St Stephen's College in Delhi, Sinha had served a number of important postings in the Ministry of External Affairs including the crucial Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran Division, which he headed for four years as Additional Secretary.

The only woman in the CIC will be Sarna, a 1980-batch Indian Revenue Service (Customs and Excise) officer, who was the Chief of Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC).

Neeraj Kumar Gupta, a 1982-batch IAS officer, was Secretary in the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management.

Chandra, an Indian Legal Service officer, retired as Union law secretary this year and was also private secretary to the then Law Minister Arun Jaitley between 2002 and 2004.

All the bureaucrats appointed by the government have retired this year.

After recent retirements of Chief Information Commissioner R K Mathur and Information Commissioners Yashovardhan Azad, Sridhar Acharyulu and Amitava Bhattacharyya, the Commission, the highest adjudicating authority in RTI matters, was left with three Information Commissioners, prompting activists to approach the Supreme Court on the issue of vacancies.

The Supreme Court had asked the Centre and states to maintain transparency in appointments of Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners and upload the details of search committees and applicants on website.

Commenting on the appointment process, Commodore Lokesh Batra, one of the petitioners in the case, said the government has failed to comply with the Supreme Court directions of posting the details on website.

""As my gut feeling said, the government did not comply with the Supreme Court directions viz transparency as it did not post details on its website,"" Batra told PTI.

During the hearing, the Centre had told the top court that the search committee has shortlisted names for the post of CIC and a final decision will be taken soon.

A bench of Justices A K Sikri, S Abdul Nazeer and R Subhash Reddy asked the Centre to put on the website details of search committee for CIC and ICs.

Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand, appearing for the Centre, had informed the court that a total of 65 applications were recived for the CIC post and 280 applications for the post of four ICs in the Central Information Commission.

She had said that after these posts are filled up, notification will be issued for inviting applications for remaining posts of ICs.

The Centre seems to have ignored plea of former Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu who had called for adequate representation of non-bureaucrats in the Commission in accordance with the Right to Information (RTI) Act.Citing Section 12 (5) of the RTI Act, he had written to the President that the Act provides for selecting people of eminence, having experience in law, science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass media or administration and governance."

Amongst all the higher education choices, a MBA program is top of your list for your future career goals. You are in search for a MBA program that launches you in the corporate world or upgrades your skill set for the next better job. So what are your expectations from the MBA program? Naturally you might be considering many factors to evaluate the right program for you. And they could be an appropriate mix of a few objective touchstones, and a few very subjective ones based on your individual choices. So here are some of the factors that you may consider to add to your list of evaluation criteria of choice.

So two main things you need to consider, first what do you want to do for the next two years, and secondly, what you want to do after these two years? These are important questions you need to ask yourself as they will help you decide the MBA program that gets aligned to your career goals. Not all MBA programs will be good at everything, for example, some produce good Marketing professionals and other good Human Resource professionals.

The batch strength of an MBA program matters a lot: it impacts your program experience, your networkingopportunities, your leadership opportunities, your faculty and other departmental connects and probability of getting a good job as the competition becomes tough. Though larger batch sizes attract more companies but smaller batch strengths offer a more personalized, individualized experience. An ideal batch strength should be around 120 like in case of our university.

Well, the academics matter no matter what. So it is essential for you to evaluate the MBA curriculum and its progression. An MBA program is completely different from your graduate programs. It is important that the curriculum matches with your career goals. You need to check that the curriculum is developed in collaboration with the industry. Some pointers here could be checking out the industry experts interaction with students, live and industry projects, sessions taken by industry experts or faculty's industry experience, student - faculty ratio - a 10:1 is ideal, and new electives introduced keeping the industry trends in consideration.

Most of the MBA programs provide placement assistance which can be student - faculty driven or centralized. So anMBA degree is not only about the academics! A good institute or University develops their students professionally and personally, so you need to find out that beside getting many companies to campus, how well the career support department helps you develop certain skill sets and prepare you to crack the best of the interviews on campus. Read employment reports, research employers, determine which programs offer the career support that matches your career goals. For example at Manav Rachna we have ""Corporate Resource Centre (CRC)"" which engages with the industry and constantly strives for expanding the industry-academia interface. Along with CRC is Career Development Centre (CDC)

which provides extensive process oriented and activity driven training on Personality Development, Business English, Business Communication and Aptitude Development.

Though Ranking matters, but I think it still cannot be the only criterion for selecting an MBA program. Anyways, rankings are based on many criteria like admissions, student diversity, infrastructure, placements, academics and research to name a few. Rankings use data provided by B-Schools and can provide prospective students and their families with useful information. But you should understand the methodology behind determining rankings and whether a particular B-school is rated high on the criterion most important to you. For example, does the B-school get a high rating on placement or research or infrastructure? Rankings can be one tool that students use early in the search process, but personal visits and interactions are the best way to find the ""perfect match.""

Job placement for many is a very important parameter for selecting a business school. Students join an MBA program for increasing their employability opportunity or upgrading their role and salary packages. Understanding this scenario,the business schools across India put a lot of emphasis in attracting good companies to campus. The following things need to be considered regarding the job placements in a B-School; first of all, the industry-wise bifurcation of companies visiting campus, number of student placed industry-wise, highest-average-lowest package industry-wise et al. Beside the salary, you should also understand the placement process of a B-school. The process may include: timing & period of placement, is the placement student led, faculty led or management led, criteria for Day I...Day II companies, how many interviews can you appear in, mandatory or choice based opting of interviews, placement offer conditions etc.

It's not all about academics, the B-School infrastructure also matters for an overall development of the student. You should check for the followings: number of classrooms, multimedia teaching aids, how well the library is equipped w.r.t. Journals, magazines and books, sports facility, auditoriums, canteens/mess, playgrounds, computer lab -student ratio, Wi-Fi, Learning Management System (LMS), Virtual class rooms, online library, hostel facility and medical facility.

In conclusion, your choice of the best MBA program emanate from a careful scrutiny of the targeted destination on all the above-said parameters. Do not let ""halo"" effect of any one aspect dominate your thinking - for instance, mere ranking may not be a suitable appraisal. Look at your needs. Maybe you are an introvert, and need a campus that opens up your personality. Maybe your quantitative skills are not strong, and you would gain if basics are taught very well. Or maybe your quantitative skills are exceptional, and you are yearning for advanced market research live projects."

Challenge: Climate change can lower the standard of living of nearly half of India's population by 2050, the World Bank warned in a June 2018 study. Particularly vulnerable are farmers who are dependent on rainfall for a good harvest, especially in regions such as Karnataka that are prone to drought. In the 15 years to 2015, only three years--2005, 2007 and 2010--witnessed no drought, as per a 2017 assessment report by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Monitoring Centre. In 2018, 77% of the 30 districts were declared drought-hit, The Times of India reported on September 14, 2018.

Action: A farmer couple, Shyamrao and Laximibai Patil, in water-scarce Kalaburagi in north Karnataka, have shown that a combination of state and NGO support, supported by grassroots innovation, can help farmers combat the effects of climate change. The Patils practice organic farming, run a dairy and poultry farm, and are helping their fellow farmers experiment with new methods.

The couple have set up their own self-help group to sell produce such as pulses. From their mixed-crop farming and livestock produce, they make an annual income of Rs 5 lakh and a profit of around Rs 2.5 lakh, at a time when 70% of the country's agricultural households spend more than they earn on average every month.

Challenge: In 2017, nearly 50,000 women died at the hands of intimate partners or family members, making ""home, the most dangerous place for women"", according to a November 2018 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

India is perceived as having the worst record on sexual violence, harassment from cultural and traditional practices and human trafficking, and is considered the least safe country in the world for women, according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll, as IndiaSpend reported on June 26, 2018. Only 14% of Indian women who have experienced physical or sexual violence have sought help to stop the violence while 77% have neither sought help nor told anyone about the violence they experienced, according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-16).

Action: In Mumbai, health advocacy Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes has since 2001 been running support centres called Dilaasa, which are funded by the National Health Mission, to identify victims of domestic and sexual violence. Using a model of care that can be replicated across government health centres nationwide, Dilaasa centres have provided help to more than 8,000 women.

Over the two years to 2018, Mumbai's 11 centres identified 5,647 women as potential victims of domestic violence. They got 2,554 cases registered for domestic violence and 809 cases for sexual violence, according to municipal records.

Sikkim, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Assam and Uttar Pradesh are replicating and activating this model.

The Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), an NGO in Mumbai's Dharavi, the third largest slum in Asia by population, is helping reduce the prevalence of child malnutrition by plugging nutrition awareness gaps and supporting local health workers.

Action: SNEHA's efforts have reduced wasting among children aged up to three by 23% and produced a 109% increase in the services received by children through the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, a government programme covering health, food and primary education. It plugs gaps in nutrition-related knowledge in the community by training community volunteers, who spread awareness and inform anganwadi (daycare) workers about the status of pregnant women and families who are finding it difficult to feed a newborn.

Challenge: India has been successful in increasing primary school enrolment to the extent that more than 83% of primary school-age children were enrolled in 2016-17, according to data from the District Information System for Education (DISE). But fewer than half (47.8%) of grade V rural students could read at least a grade II text in 2016, the Annual Survey of Education Report 2016 found.

Action: World Vision, a non-profit, runs a remedial education programme, Aparajitha, for 4,300 students in government schools in 130 villages in Lalitpur district in Uttar Pradesh. From a zero baseline, within a year 1.55% of enrolled students could read local content (such as newspapers) and understand it; 6.2% (up from 1.8%) could read a story and comprehend it; and 10.4% could read a story (up from 5.1%). World Vision expects to complete the project by 2020 and empower the community to take over.

Challenge: In the two decades to 2017, India suffered a $79.5 billion loss, ranking among the top five countries in the world to be affected by climate-related disasters, The Wire reported on October 11, 2018. India is taking baby steps towards disaster preparedness, the lack of which is becoming obvious in the wake of climate change-related extreme weather events. Only 7% of the 4,862 dams in the country have emergency action plans, a 2017 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said, the Hindustan Times reported on September 3, 2018. Often, the armed forces are summoned to undertake rescue operations, such as during the recent Kerala floods in August 2018, despite the constitution of the National Disaster Response Force in 2006.

The Kerala floods affected an estimated 5 million people's lives and damaged infrastructure to the extent that the state needs nearly Rs 30,000 crore to rebuild.

Action: The Kerala state electricity board's quick response under Mission Reconnect restored electricity to nearly 2.5 million homes in less than two weeks. Kerala is one of the 15 states in India that have 100% household electrification, the Hindustan Times reported on November 28, 2018. It managed the task by improving coordination through a state-level task force and an army of volunteers comprising retired staff, students and private electricity personnel."

There are multiple ways parenting prepares you to succeed at work.

The parenting skills you learnt on your sabbatical are most definitely transferable and you might find yourself coming back better trained than ever before.

So often as a parent, you need to be an out-of-the-box thinker to develop innovative strategies to seemingly unmanageable problems on a daily basis, working non-stop with absolutely no vacations.

Whether you liked it or not you would have honed your patience and communication skills for managing a diverse range of personalities and only your exceptional organisational skills could have helped you juggle multiple high-stress priorities.

I've raised two children and nothing I've previously done has taught me as much about leadership as raising my kids.

As a parent, you become trained to constantly think about solutions.

Here are six keys skills that parenthood will teach you, which are irreplaceable in the workplace:

1. Multi-tasking

Nothing compares to the multi-tasking required as a mother.

Being able to attend a conference call while changing a baby's diaper and have a toddler tugging at your shirt teaches you how to multi-task effectively.

If you can coordinate school pick-ups, decide tonight's dinner menu and make strategic business decisions you can allocate mindshare to each activity appropriately.

And after having to cater to your older child's needs, younger child's needs, husband's needs, in-laws' needs, parents' needs, and finally your own needs -- you sure become an expert at the art of multi-tasking!

2. Problem solving

Finding missing papers, coordinating doctor appointments and finding a bathroom for a potty-training toddler-parents are always solving problems.

As a parent, you become trained to constantly think about solutions. And often your family has to work as a team to get things done.

Helping kids solve problems through trial and error can also be helpful at work.

Our role as parents is to set up an environment where the cost of the error is never too high and is far outweighed by the lessons learnt in the process.

It's the same at work. When you face with a challenging situation it is imperative to think on your feet and come up with reasonable solutions, while minimising risks.

3. Teamwork

It was only after we became parents, my husband and I started feeling like we were part of a team. A team that needed to support one another physically, mentally and emotionally.

As a team, we needed to lay down ground rules and stick by them.

We needed to cover up when the other was unavailable, sick, or just having a breakdown.

We had to remind one another that 'this too shall pass' and our kids will turn out fine.

This kind of teamwork teaches you how important it is to build camaraderie in the workplace too, support and uplift one another instead of tearing each other down.

4. Leadership

Being a parent also improves your leadership abilities.

At home, you could have led high-pressure negotiations with hardly any advance preparation, which sets you up for impeccable decision-making capabilities.

Your delegation and team management efforts at home forces you to strategise and become more efficient with your time at work.

Your compassionate skills at home can help foster more empathy at work for the many work-life challenges.

5. Patience and endurance

No job in the world requires more patience than bringing up children. Because not only are children unreasonable but they are extremely fragile.

No matter how far they might drive you to the edge, you need to somehow keep your cool. And nothing can teach you endurance better than having to tend to a sick child.

Once you have built the patience and endurance that motherhood teaches you, you can apply them to every challenging situation at work.

6. Visualisation

When you're a parent, you always tend to visualise the bigger picture of what needs to get done ahead of time. For example, when you plan an outing with the kids, you have to constantly think ahead of all of the things that could possibly go wrong.

You need to visualise the day ahead in its entirety, always thinking about the challenges ahead. This skill is useful at work.

Challenges might hit a project but since you are accustomed to using visualisation as a problem-solving tool, you have the edge to overcome temporary setbacks and steer them instead toward your goals.

Parents bring resilient focus to project management along with creativity and innovation.

He was not able to sleep or focus on anything. His life had come to a standstill. The moment he was dreading had finally arrived. On 12 October (late Friday), the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) had issued a circular to entities operating in the e-payments space to completely halt the use of Aadhaar e-KYC (electronic-know your customer).

Mr. A, the founder of an e-wallet company, who was not able to get clarity from regulators on the usage of Aadhaar post the Supreme Court's verdict, finally got clarity from the circular. But the scramble had only just begun. Life in a world without e-KYC had to be figured out, at least for the time being. But the senior executive team of the e-wallet firm was to get together only on 14 October (Monday) to hash out a way forward.

Three weeks earlier, like most people in the country, Mr. A was glued to his television set from 10.30am, switching from one news channel to other. It was unlike him to be watching TV in the office that early on a weekday, but the day was momentous.

It was 26 September -- the day the Supreme Court weighed in on the fate of the Aadhaar unique identity project. Mr. A recounts how anxious he had become as he waited for the court verdict. ""What happens if Aadhaar-based customer acquisition is banned? What happens to my business model? What happens to all these years of efforts?"" were some of the thoughts that crossed his mind. And then, around 12.30pm, the Constitution bench's verdict was finally out.

While affirming the constitutional validity of Aadhaar, the apex court had said Aadhaar can only be used for welfare schemes and for delivering state subsidies. It had barred private companies from using Aadhaar data for authenticating customers. Also, in order to address privacy concerns, the court said it was not mandatory to link Aadhaar with bank accounts or mobile phone numbers.

For Mr. A and his team, making sense of the 1,448-page judgment itself took time. They brainstormed about the many possible interpretations of the judgment for more than five days, trying to somehow figure out a way to save the business from collapsing. He also did not know when exactly to stop customer verification through the Aadhaar-based mechanism. ""The judgment was not 100% clear on whether it had to be stopped on the same day,"" he said.

While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had updated its KYC guidelines in April 2018, all eyes had been on the Supreme Court. In the meantime though, e-wallet firms had already gone ahead with customer verification models based on Aadhaar. It was just cheaper and far more convenient. But on 14 October, in the internal meeting at Mr.A's company, the top management decided to completely roll back Aadhaar-based customer verification until further clarity came from the regulators. It was a sudden and unexpected speed bump in the path of India's booming fintech industry.

Impact on industry

Like Mr. A, most fintech companies, telecom operators and payment banks had built their business models based on the unique biometric number in order to deliver services in a paperless, cashless and presence-less manner.

""All the pillars of financial inclusion have been impacted with the restricted use of Aadhaar,"" said Suresh Sethi, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), India Post Payments Bank (IPPB). ""It was being used for not only banking and account opening, but other efficiencies were getting introduced -- like the whole concept of instant loans and insurance, and also the ability to invest immediately,"" he added.

IPPB, which used Aadhaar-based e-KYC to verify customers, has not been able to on-board new customers in the last two months. Only customers seeking direct benefit transfer (DBT) have been able to open accounts through Aadhaar-based e-KYC, said Sethi. ""Currently, the account opening per day is 15-20% of what we were doing earlier. The pace of acquisition has slowed down by 75-80%.""

Similarly, other payment banks have also confirmed that they have not been able to on-board new customers other than those seeking DBT as they all use Aadhaar-based KYC to verify customers.

IPPB has been incorporated as a public sector company under the Department of Posts with 100% government equity and is governed by the RBI. The bank was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 1 September to increase access to banking services in rural areas. The postal agents provide doorstep banking and account opening facility using a hand-held device, mobile phone, and a biometric reader.

According to Mr. A, the prepaid payment instruments (PPI) industry caters to around 250 million customers annually and the average cost of doing a physical KYC for each customer is around ₹100. The total cost of verifying these customers physically would be around ₹2,500 crore to the industry.

Even if other forms of identification were listed during customer verification, most customers would voluntarily opt for Aadhaar and this was also easier for us as the customer would be verified on a real-time basis, said Harshil Mathur, CEO and co-founder of Razorpay Software Pvt. Ltd, an online payment solutions company.

Since Aadhaar-based verification is not possible anymore, around 30-40% additional customers have to be physically verified which has significantly ramped up the operational costs for the company.

If the e-KYC suspension was not the only cause of worry for the fintech industry, e-sign based e-mandates used for automated collection of loan payments was also suspended in November by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the umbrella organization for all retail payments in the country. It resulted in even higher operational costs for digital lenders.

According to a circular issued on 23 November by NPCI to banks, the e-sign based e-mandate product has been suspended with effect from 26 November in compliance with the judgment of the Supreme Court.

""A lot of mutual funds and digital lending companies which were moving from physical mandates to Aadhaar-based mandates had to go back to physical mandates which is expensive and inefficient,"" said Mathur of Razorpay. ""For customers too, this is very inefficient. Instead of auto debit every month, customers will have to come and make payments now.""

Some of the fintech firms are now using net banking-based mandate, which is currently live with only five banks. NPCI has plans to launch a debit card-based eNACH which might offer some respite for these companies. A recent report by Omidyar and the Boston Consulting Group said that digital lending to micro, small and medium enterprises in the country is projected to increase between 10-15 times by 2023 to ₹6-7 trillion.

Consumer concerns

The Aadhaar judgment has been lauded as a pro-consumer move by most critics of the project. It has definitely eased the lives of the common people who would get calls and emails from banks, insurance companies, lending companies and telecom operators to update their Aadhaar details. Before 26 September, Aadhaar was mandatory for almost everything including school and hospital admissions. With the Supreme Court doing away with the mandatory linking of Aadhaar, most consumers that Mint spoke with feel that they have finally gotten a chance to decide for themselves and use Aadhaar voluntarily.

Anirudh Sharma, a 32-year-old mechanical engineer recounts how he would get notifications from Paytm every day in July to complete his full KYC. ""I was not able to send money to my friends and family in their Paytm wallets. So, the only option left was to get my full KYC done,"" he said. However, when the Paytm executive came to his doorstep to do his full KYC, he was told that only Aadhaar-based KYC would be possible. The executive was carrying a biometric reader and a mobile phone to complete the process. Despite the quick and easy verification experience, Sharma said, ""I should be the one choosing which identity proof I want to give or not give.""

Similarly, Seema Vashisht, a 46-year-old designer, who runs her own fashion store, said she got her Reliance Jio SIM card a few months ago through Aadhaar e-KYC. She too never got an option to exercise her choice while submitting identity proof documents. ""After getting a mobile phone number based on my Aadhaar number, how can they ask me to link my mobile phone to Aadhaar? Isn't it a two-way process? Why does it involve one process after another?"" she said.

In the absence of a digital fix, which bypasses the bar on e-KYC, the offline process for acquiring a new phone number could take between 24 to 36 hours. In this nebulous sweet spot between convenience and privacy rights, the future of Aadhaar's use by the private sector will be decided. Some experts say the top court judgment requires the use of Aadhaar to be purpose-limited, legally-backed and privacy-protected. They say there may still not be a problem if a person volunteers to give his or her Aadhaar card as proof of identity.

According to a 27-year-old civil services aspirant, who did not wish to be named, every state and the central government entrance exam still lists Aadhaar as the first option among the many documents admissible as a form of identity proof. ""Before the judgment, Aadhaar would be marked compulsory, but now only the word 'compulsory' has been removed. The rest is the same. Aadhaar still is the topmost option in the list of documents and while verification, the examiners also emphasize on Aadhaar for establishing identity when I go to take the test.""

Regulatory uncertainty

Sethi of IPPB said the bank is actively in talks with the regulators to get an alternative KYC process in place. ""We have made various representations to the government and we have very clearly heard from the government that they are working towards finding a way which involves voluntary usage of Aadhaar e-KYC.""

UIDAI has recently introduced an XML-based protocol, which they have shared with RBI, he said. ""RBI is reviewing it to see if it can be a surrogate, paperless process. It basically means that you get on to a portal and you get your Aadhaar data downloaded in the form of an XML file and that file will have all the information needed for opening an account.""

However, the proposed process will depend on the accessibility to the internet. ""Under the new mechanism, a customer will have to go to the bank or kiosk to get the sourced data, which is going to be a bit of a barrier, especially for the segments we are targeting. If we expect them to download and create this file, or go to an enrolment centre and get the file, there are going to be barriers,"" Sethi said.

Mr. A said he has also approached the Payments Council of India (PCI), the industry body for prepaid payments, for exploring all the possible options to be able to conduct his business -- including video-based KYC and artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions.

The AI-based application being considered will help customers send their identity proof over the web, enabling their facial images to be captured by the app from different angles to ensure liveliness. (Liveness is the ability to check whether it is a photograph before the camera or an actual human being). The use of 'offline Aadhaar', which relies on QR (quick response) code instead of biometric e-KYC for customer verification, is also being considered by the central bank, said a person familiar with the development.

But despite the many rounds of meetings and consultations, no clear path forward is yet in place.

The way forward

On 17 December, the government for the first time laid out its cards in the open, with the Union cabinet giving a go-ahead to amend existing laws in order to give legal backing to the voluntary use of Aadhaar. But the regulatory space will continue to be a muddle for quite some time. Any changes in legislation would require parliamentary approval and with a general election in sight, the time available for piloting any amendments through parliament is rather limited. The related big-ticket item of a personal data protection law is also pending.

The Congress, on its part, strongly opposes the use of the biometric ID by private entities. Thus, what's in store seems to be months of uncertainty and impasse.

The prevailing state of affairs has pushed some industry voices to question the logic of a government-mandated standard to begin with. ""What if multiple solutions were encouraged originally?"" asked Ashish Aggarwal, senior director and head of public policy at Nasscom. Instead of getting into how exactly private companies verify their customers, the regulators should just focus on common standards, interoperability, and portability. The market can come up with ideal solutions to solve issues of operational nitty-gritty, Aggarwal said.

Caught up in these larger debates are ordinary people like Mr. A and millions of India's fintech users. Their wait continues as the country's e-wallet boom looks to push past the e-KYC hiccup."

A tentative Proposition is there may be an explanation in Friedman's Permanent Income hypothesis.

Without doubt, the biggest macro puzzle of 2018 is what exactly is driving down food prices. Food inflation tumbled from 4.7% at the year's start to -2.6% by November; at 137.8, CPI-food was below July 2017 level (138.3). Startling anomalies arose, upsetting inflation forecasts and historically familiar policy outcomes -- a widely expected price boost from higher MSPs not only failed to materialise, but market prices actually sank below the official floor! Many explanations surfaced, examining the depression in food prices from supply as well as demand perspectives. But, none precisely conforms to the data. The year ends with the unresolved question carrying over to 2019. As fits the occasion, a brief dissection is accompanied by a new, tentative hypothesis for trial in 2019.

The dominant narratives on the collapse in food prices were supply-side ones. One driver singled out was the government's proactive food-supply management through procurement, imports, stocking, open market sales and public distribution, export restrictions, stock-holding and inter-state movement limits, anti-hoarding raids and extensive price interventions. But, these weren't enduring enough for the broad-based, deepening price decline, except for pulses where a series of mistimed interventions (high import volumes coinciding with MSP incentives resulting in higher output and stocks) played a key role. Next is the excess production supposition due to increased productivity, rural infrastructure investments, and better access to markets, information and technologies. But agriculture production and yields data does not support these explanations.

Annual average growth of food crop volumes, including high-value horticulture crops, has been way lower in the four years to 2017-18 compared to corresponding growth measures in the previous four years (2010-11 to 2013-14) with the sole exception of milk. Neither do the data betray exceptional productivity increases in any major food crop or horticulture. Yields appear to vary with rainfall and its distribution over the years. This incontrovertible evidence on output and yields led us to examine if demand factors explained the persistence of abysmally low food prices (FE, June 2018). Aggregate private final consumption demand grew a strong 7% on average from 2014-15 to 2017-18. But this robust domestic demand seemed unable to support food prices, despite accounting for some imports and weakening global food prices from 2013. This led us to speculate if private consumer spending was overestimated, or income growth skewed towards urban segment while the rural component lagged behind given steadily decelerating rural wages after 2014 and sustained weakness of labour-intensive segments observed from their strained finances, and even possible diversions of housing, MUDRA and other retail loans' diversions to vehicle/tractor purchases.

But in 3Q2018, FMCG sales accelerated with broad-based strength, including home-care & personal products. Core inflation remained firm at 5-6% and even more sometimes in the period, especially health and education components. On the other hand, momentum in consumer goods' growth (durables & non-durables) fell off its March 2018 peaks. And further complicating this mixed picture of demand strength, food inflation tumbled in 2H2018, turning into deflation by October!

The puzzle about what's dragging down food prices only deepened. The contrarian trends here and there leave us no wiser at the end of the year. Even RBI is puzzled, uncertain about portents for its outlook in the medium-term and wants to understand better the drivers of food inflation as revealed from its December meeting minutes.

2019 begins with the puzzle unresolved. The unclear trends pose two questions: Has spending on certain goods and services become essential for the neo-poor (people whose income and consumption rose sharply in the past decade and half) in both rural and urban India? If yes, is this group continuing to spend on these items but reducing its overall food consumption as per capita income growth fell in the last two years?

A tentative hypothesis is worth examining in 2019 for answers. With reference to Milton Friedman's permanent-income hypothesis (1957), consider the income-consumption trajectory of the average Indian consumer: Incomes rose rapidly in the post-2004 growth boom -- 8% average in FY06 to FY08 and 7.2% to FY11 -- and poverty declined sharply in the period. Consumption shifts towards more and better foods such as vegetables, fruits and protein-rich items were observed, followed by increase in demand for some consumer non-durable goods and services such as education, communications, health, etc. which no doubt became essential spending for many of these new consumers. Per capita income growth slowed in 2011-13, but resumed climbing to 6.8% by FY16; it then fell a steep 100 bps to 5.8% in FY17, decelerating to 5.3% in FY18.

Two consecutive years of falling incomes will possibly be seen as temporary by the marginal consumer whose spending pattern changed with the past upward shift in permanent income. She is thus likely to maintain her standard of living (uphold aspirational expenses) because she expects her income to restore to normal or permanent level in future. This is the central idea underlying Friedman's permanent-income hypothesis -- increases/decreases in income that people view as temporary have little effect on their consumption spending; on average, people base their idea of normal or permanent income on what happened over the past several years and attempt to retain consumption, including by dis-saving.

Some of these forces might be at play in India as spending on non-food goods and services, which entered the consumption basket with higher income levels, is perhaps being sustained. This could be through cutting food consumption and/or by dis-saving. Aggregate household savings have fallen while some consumers are eating less better foods than before to maintain their living standards. School enrolments and education premium rose with higher incomes for example, and education expenses are likely to be incurred even when income growth slows for its improbable that children will be withdrawn from school or prevented from entering higher education if households perceive their income decline as temporary. Similarly, recently acquired tastes and preferences for personal products, communication goods and services also attain the characteristics of 'essential' or 'necessary' spending. Empirical support for this speculation, in addition to the sustained inflation seen in these categories (core inflation), is offered by surveys of consumers expectations. These consistently show high consumer optimism about the future even when the current perceptions remain lower. RBI's survey of consumer perceptions and expectations on spending reveals the discrete jump of September-2014 persists at those levels even as consumers' worries on jobs and the economy have fallen back to pre-Sept 2014 levels.

This is still a tentative hypothesis which can only be validated by future NSSO consumption expenditure surveys. However, if this proposition holds, then food consumption should gradually return to normal when expectations improve in consonance with optimism about the future. Along with, food prices should then recover in 2019. On the contrary, if current expectations continue to remain lower or further deteriorate, then consumers would begin to cut on their other expenses, thus dragging core inflation down."

India is one of the prominent ancient countries and civilizations of the world. She is the confluence of diverse socio-cultural land for which rest of the world has interest to know her with deeper perspective. India is a country where anybody can experience the absolute degree of calmness of the Himalayas on one hand and enjoy the beauty of long coastal sea beach around the mighty oceans. India is the sum up of twenty nine States and seven Union Territories and each of them is characterized with distinct topography, heritage and culture. Contribution of India as one of the important countries of the world to the cause of peace and harmony is enormous. Yet India is still recognized as one of the developing economies in the globe. She suffers from low rate of economic growth, burden of huge population and consequently mass unemployment. Inclusive economic growth is difficult to achieve unless every qualified jobseeker is gainfully employed in different trades in accordance with capability and potential possessed by them. Employment is an important factor for promotion of economic growth of the country. It may be observed that dependence of the world economy has gradually been shifting to service sector from that manufacturing and agricultural sectors. There are many countries in the world whose lion share of Domestic Gross Product (GDP) comes from service sector. Tourism may be considered to be one of the major segments of service sector of India since it has enormous potential for generation of employment and consequently it can contribute to the cause of economic development of the country.

The International Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) are of the view that tourism can be one of the world's top job creators and perhaps the same is aptly applicable to India who is attributed with five thousand years old human civilization. The ability of tourism sector of the national economy to generate employment opportunities for the less-skilled group of people may be considered to be an important factor if its true potential is explored and tapped properly for securing a rapid economic growth of the nation. This sector of the economy does possess higher degree of prospect to stimulate other sectors and as a result there shall be spillover effect in the economy. The consumption demand derived from tourists expenditure is able to generate more employment. Though certain kind of importance of tourism sector is felt by the Government but potential of tourism sector as a contributor to the cause of economic development is yet to be explored in effective sense. Any spending committed by the tourists enables this sector to create employment as other sectors of the economy shall be required to supply inputs to the tourism sector in terms of hospitality, accommodation, transport, entertainment and any other incidental allied services. Tourism sector is one of the prominent sources of earning foreign exchanges for India. This sector has tremendous contributory strength in order to be signified as tourism industry. Tourism needs to be given adequate attention by all the States in general and by the State of Jammu & Kashmir in particular. The State of Jammu and Kashmir is known to be the Paradise of the Earth because of its natural beauty. Jammu and Kashmir has a special place in the room of tourism industry and tourism itself has huge potential for contributing to the cause of economic progress of the State. As it has been mentioned earlier that India has inherited diverse and rich cultural heritage from her glorious past, sustainable economic development is possible through promoting tourism. Survival , growth, development and sustainability of economic progress is possible through tourism to a significant extent for which this industry needs to have moderate quantum of investment to attract tourists and of course, strategic thinking. Political, economic, social and technological factors are required to be examined in order to give a result fetching shape to the tourism industry. These factors affect the performance of any business and tourism is not an exception to it. Long-term growth and sustainability of tourism industry can definitely influence the growth rate of other sectors of the national economy. It may be observed that tourism was comparatively given less attention and weightage as was necessary for its promotion after independence. There is dearth of private investment in tourism sector and whatever has been achieved so far is due to government patronage by and large. Tourism is an integral part of human civilization and it is an inherent instinct of an individual to be a tourist and therefore less marketing effort is able to create the market for tourism.

The tourism industry can act as important catalyst in the process of socio-economic progress of both rural and urban areas. Tourism industry can help in poverty reduction and raising standard of living of the people around the tourists spots . It has been seen in various research studies that tourism sector is currently contributing about seven to eight percent of GDP of the country and it can contribute substantially much higher percentage of GDP if the State Governments and the Central Government together adopt the promotional measures by framing suitable developmental strategies . Resources under the command and control of the State Governments are limited as compared with that of the Central Government and thus the Central Government should shoulder more responsibility for bringing about development of tourism industry. The most important resource for promotion of service sector is people and therefore both the State Governments and the Central Government should come forward for making adequate provisions for training and development of people having interest in joining tourism industry for earning livelihood and preferring tourism as a career option. Tourism industry can provide employment to both unskilled and skilled labor force. Universities should offer opportunities for formal education in the domain of tourism and play a significant role in skill development and development of tourism industry management professionals. Though several Universities are playing an important role in providing tourism management education in the country but it is quite insignificant for meeting the demand of the industry.

The first Tourism Policy was announced by Government of India in 1982 which provided for the action plan for tourists' arrival and necessary facilities to be extended to them. Again Government of India had appointed a Committee on National Tourism in 1988 and this committee mainly focused its attention on public sector for development of tourism industry in India. The Central Government revisits its tourism policy from time to time but it is an imperative to invite private sector participation and foreign investment in this sector of the economy in order to expand the domain of tourism industry. The policy makers are recommended to take a note that tourism industry has been suffering from shortage of professionally qualified and skilled personnel, shortage of training institutes, shortage of qualified trainers and almost primitive working conditions for the employees. The Government should act a catalyst instead of being stringent regulator of the industry.

It came to light following a relentless investigation by AB Paul, a retired chief engineer of the State public health engineering department (PHED), in 2000 that these children were victims of dental, skeletal and non-skeletal fluorosis due to the presence of excessive fluoride in the water they consume.

The surface water-based piped water of the PHED was provided to the residents of Tapatjuri localities, comprising three villages with a population of about 4,000, in 2013. Prior to that they mostly used to drink water drawn from dug wells, or water supplied by the PHED from groundwater sources.

Paul initially took the help of Kampur-based voluntary organisation 'Environment Conservation Centre' to tackle the situation.

From IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath to Uber's Komal Mangtani, several of them made headlines for their unparalleled contributions in traditionally male-dominated domains. Their rise also highlighted the steady increase in the number of women in leadership and senior-management roles.

Let's take a look at nine powerful Indian women and their journeys in the world of tech and business.

1 Gita Gopinath: Chief Economist, International Monetary Fund

Gita Gopinath had gone to study economics at Delhi's Lady Shri Ram College For Women thinking she would join the Indian Administrative Services. Today, she is, as described by IMF chief Christian Lagarde as '...one of the world's outstanding economists, with impeccable academic credentials..'.

Gopinath was appointed in October 2018 to direct the leading global body's research department, becoming the second Indian after former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan to hold the key post.

That's not her only record. Gopinath, who is the John Zwaanstra Professor of International Studies and Economics at Harvard University, is also the third woman and the first Indian after Nobel laureate Amartya Sen to become a tenured professor at Harvard's Department of Economics.

Born in 1971 to Malayali parents in Calcutta and raised in Mysuru, Gopinath grew up speaking more Kannada than Malayalam until her posting as Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's economic adviser in 2016, as revealed by her parents in an interview.

Her appointment generated controversy due to her neo-liberal economic views, which is in contrast with the policies of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) that leads the Kerala government. Her family's close relations to noted Communist leaders in Kannur reportedly helped silence some of the critics of her ideological inclinations.

She holds MA degrees from both the Delhi School of Economics and the University of Washington, and a PhD from Princeton.

She lives in Massachusetts, with her husband Iqbal Dhalibal, former IAS officer and executive director at Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab at Department of Economics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

TRIVIA: Gopinath became the third female economist in the world to occupy a highly influential position this year, after the appointments of Pinelopi Koujianou and Laurence Boone, as chief economists to the World Bank Group and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), respectively.

2 Dhivya Suryadevara: Chief Financial Officer, General Motors

Dhivya Suryadevara's journey from Chennai's Mandaveli to the high table at auto major General Motors is the stuff of dreams.

Named in June as the first female CFO at 110-year-old GM, she replaced former CFO Chuck Stevens, who had been working at GM for more than 40 years (longer than Suryadevara has been alive).

Suryadevara (39), who belongs to a Telugu-speaking family, lost her father when she was very young and grew up with her mother and two elder sisters at their house in Chennai. Her mother, a retired bank employee, continues to live in the city while all her three daughters are settled abroad.

She studied in St John's Senior Secondary School in Mandaveli and earned a degree in commerce from the Ethiraj College for Women before pursuing Chartered Accountancy at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. At 22, she left to the US to get an MBA from Harvard Business School.

Suryadevara, who joined GM in 2005 as a senior analyst at the age of 25, had a crucial hand in the company's divestment of German automaker Opel, acquisition of driverless car start-up Cruise Automation, investment in ride-sharing firm Lyft and SoftBank's funding in GM Cruise. Suryadevara went on to become vice president and treasurer of corporate finance at GM in 2015, after serving as the CEO of GM Asset Management from 2013.

With Suryadevara's promotion and GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra leading the company, GM is today one of only two Fortune 500 companies to employ both a female CEO and CFO (the other being Hershey).

Suryadevara had started her career with a World Bank internship, and also had a stint with PricewaterhouseCoopers before moving to investment banking at UBS. In 2015, she was named in the list of Forbes '50 Under 40'.

Suryadevara constantly shuttles between New York (where she and her family is based) and Detroit (for work).

TRIVIA: According to the 2018 Fortune 500 list, just 24 of these companies have female CEOs, a dip from 2017's record-breaking number of 32, the highest share of women since the magazine first launched its 500 list in 1955. On the brighter side, there are currently 64 female CFOs in the Fortune 500.

The names of four Indian-origin women on the Forbes list of America's top 50 female technology moguls in 2018 gave everyone joy: Padmasree Warrior, former chief technology officer (CTO) of Cisco; Komal Mangtani, senior director at app-based cab aggregator Uber; Neha Narkhede, chief technology officer and co-founder of streaming platform Confluent; and Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan, CEO and founder of identity-management company Drawbridge.

3. Padmasree Warrior, former chief technology officer Cisco

Padmasree Warrior, born Yellepeddi Padmasree in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, was one of the few women at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi in the 1980s. The chemical engineering graduate left to the US in 1982 with just 100 dollars in her pocket and took a job with Motorola in 1984 at its semiconductor factory, while working on her doctorate at Cornell University. She stayed with the mobile maker for over 23 years, going on to become Corporate Vice-President and general manager of Motorola's Energy Systems Group, Corporate Vice-President and Chief Technology Officer of its semiconductor sector. Motorola received a National Medal of Technology from President George W. Bush in 2004 during her time there.

Warrior has been credited with her contribution to Motorola's 'Seamless idea' - where a smartphone could seamlessly tie up all aspects of a person's life. Motorola dropped it later.

Her career at tech conglomerate Cisco started in 2008, reportedly after being persuaded by Cisco's chief executive officer John Chambers for close to a year. In Warrior's seven years as CTO and head of strategy, she helped Cisco expand through multiple acquisitions and gave several presentations as the face of the company.

After engaging with semiconductors and batteries and cellphones and networks at Motorola and then exploring how the mobile and the Internet could be blended at Cisco, just as the world was waking up to the Internet of Things (IoT), Warrior made another jump.

This time, from a Fortune 100 corporation to a 15 person start-up to in search of new ways to use tech to help people. Warrior led the Chinese firm NIO along with founder William Li, to become Tesla's main rival in delivering electric, driverless cars. In her three years as President and CEO at NIO US (before her sudden exit in November 2018 due to personal reasons), she built a team of 700 at Silicon Valley.

Warrior serves on several prestigious boards like those of Microsoft, Spotify and Gap. She is married to her IIT-D classmate and former Motorola colleague Mohandas Warrior, who is CEO of laser manufacturing company Alfalight.

TRIVIA: Forbes described Warrior, who is awaiting her 'next adventure', as someone who continues to 'find time to mentor other women in the tech industry, stay in touch with her 1.6 million Twitter followers and follow a nightly meditation routine.' Warrior is also known for her erstwhile blog ""Bits at the Edge"",where she once famously criticized the Apple iPhone.

4 Komal Mangtani, senior director at app-based cab aggregator Uber

Komal Mangtani, a graduate of Gujarat's Dharamsinh Desai Institute of Technology, is one of the world's most influential female software engineers. As the head of app-based cab aggregator Uber's Business Intelligence team, her team provides the tech that helps the business grow and 'ensures that the rides are physically safe, that communications between riders and drivers are as efficient as possible, that our drivers get there on time.' One of her main tasks is to live track and prevent financial fraud on the platform.

43-year-old Mangtani is an active campaigner for women in engineering as proved by the positions she holds: advisory board member for Women Who Code and head of the #LadyEng group at Uber. The University of California, Berkeley alumnus led Uber to make a 2 million dollar donation to Girls Who Code to close the gender gap in tech for young women.

She was formerly head of engineering at Cloud Content Management company Box, where she was reportedly poached from VMWare. In her six-year-stint at software major VMWare, she had led product development on its cloud service products and helped in several acquisitions.

TRIVIA: Mangtani and other women at Uber have been taking pains to reflect a new culture for women at their workplace, following a 'very very strange year' for Uber, as put by whisteblower Susan Fowler. In 2017, the former Uber employee wrote a scathing post on the multiple instances of sexism and sexual assault at the company; this was the final straw after a long series of scandals for Uber, from passenger safety issues to mistreatment of female employees.

5 Neha Narkhede, chief technology officer and co-founder of streaming platform Confluent

When Neha Narkhede was a Linkedin employee, she came across a big issue: business leaders were unable to make quick decisions due to lack of real-time user data. In 2010, her efforts to fix it led to the revolutionary Apache Kafka, an open-source software platform to help companies react to problems in milliseconds, which she co-founded with her colleagues Jay Kreps and Jun Rao. When the trio saw how much their software was being relied on (over one-third of Fortune 500 companies like Netflix, Uber and Twitter use it), they built their startup Confluent in 2015, a streaming platform that helps businesses adopt Kafka.

The company has raised over $80 million in funding from investors like Sequoia Capital and Benchmark.

The 32-year-old Mumbai-born Narkhede has always credited her parents for her journey, especially the fact that they got her a computer when she was eight. She is a graduate from the University of Pune and Georgia Tech.

TRIVIA: Here is an example of Kafka's contribution, as quoted in a Forbes interview: ""Right away companies can change prices (eg, Uber surge fares) or pick the best product to show a customer (such as Netflix suggested titles) by plucking such data as they go by.""

6 Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan, CEO and founder of identity-management company Drawbridge

Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan is CEO of a company that was named as the fastest-growing company led by a woman in the 2015 Inc. 5000 list. In 2018, Forbes named her among America's top 50 female technology moguls.

The former Google employee created Drawbridge in 2010: a machine learning driven platform that uses device IDs to understand how consumers interact with their online ads, make purchases, and what interfaces they use: phones, laptops, etc. Drawbridge can know if a certain customer feels more comfortable to respond to an ad or make a purchase on a laptop as opposed to their tablet, for example.

The South Indian who was raised in Mumbai was formerly Lead Scientist at mobile ad start up AdMob, later acquired by Google in 2009. She has been named one of Business Insider's ""Most Powerful Women in Mobile Advertising"" for three years in a row.

TRIVIA: While doing her PhD in Information Theory and Algorithms from Stanford University. her work got carried on board the prestigious New Horizons, NASA's farthest space mission to Pluto.

Indian-origin tech execs Jayshree Ullal and NeerjaSethi made it to the Forbes' list of America's 60 richest self-made women in June 2018.

7 Jayshree Ullal, president and CEO of Arista Networks

Ranked 18th in the list of 60 richest self-made women, Jayshree Ullal is among just 72 self-made women billionaires in the world. The former senior vice-president of Cisco jumped in 2008 to become the president and CEO of Arista Networks, an unheard of startup then, which under her leadership recorded revenues of USD 1.6 billion in 2017. Arista, founded in 2004 by ex-Cisco engineers David Cheriton and Andreas von Bechtolsheim, counts Microsoft as its biggest customer (comprises 16 per cent of Arista's business).

After Arista became Cisco's rival in the multibillion-dollar market for ethernet switches used in data centers, Cisco filed a lawsuit alleging Arista copied its intellectual property. Their fight is still going on.

56-year-old Ullal was born in London, raised in Delhi and moved to the US, where she studied at the San Francisco State University and Santa Clara University. She started work at Cisco in 1993 after it acquired the communications company (Crescendo Communications) where she was working as vice president of marketing. At Cisco, she grew to become senior vice president of Data Center, Switching & Security Technology Group, helping oversee more than 20 mergers and acquisitions.

She has also held various product and engineering positions at Ungermann-Bass, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and Fairchild Semiconductor.

TRIVIA: Jayshree Ullal has a net worth of 1.3 billion dollars as of 2018, through her 5 per cent stake in the company, some of which is earmarked for her two children, niece and nephew.

With just 2000 dollars, Neerja Sethi started Syntel in 1980 with her husband Bharat Desai in their Michigan apartment. In July 2018, Syntel was sold to European IT major Atos for a whopping 3.4 billion dollars. The couple is expected to make 2 billion dollars from the deal.

Syntel provides technology and IT services utilising a network of software development centres in India, and has 23000 employees, 80 per cent of whom are in India.

The husband and wife met at Tata Consultancy Services. Sethi holds an undergraduate degree and MBA from the Delhi University, and a masters degree from Oakland University. Desai, who was born in Kenya and grew up in Mombasa and Ahmedabad, is a IIT-Bombay alumnus and has an MBA from the University of Michigan.

TRIVIA: Sethi, the 63-year-old vice president of Syntel, has a net worth of $1 billion. Her husband Desai's net worth as of July 2018 is $1.6 billion.

9. Sudha Balakrishnan, chief financial officer, Reserve Bank of India

Sudha Balakrishnan is not just the central bank's first female CFO, she is the first person to occupy such a post since (now former) RBI governor Urjit Patel took over and brought in organizational changes. The chartered accountant and ex-CFO at the National Securities Depository Limited, is the 12th executive director of RBI and will serve a term of three years.

Her appointment in May drew opposition from the Reserve Bank of India Officers' Association which argued that there was no legal requirement for the appointment of a CFO as the RBI did not have to follow any strict accounting standards.

It was ex-RBI chief Raghuram Rajan who suggested a designated person to handle the central bank's books (which was until then an in-house task), and the government had rejected this as it involved changing the RBI Act. This move also reflects the growing demand for specialized financial skill sets across all sectors.

Sudha Balakrishnan gets a salary of Rs 400000 (Rs 2 lakh if she avails free housing) every month. Her tasks involve reporting RBI's financial information, ensuring its accounting policies comply with regulations, overseeing its budget processes and handling RBI's investments in India and abroad. She is also in-charge of the government's bank account department that takes care of payments and collection of revenue and taxes."

In best case scenario, Bumrah is expected to bowl at least 30 overs (minimum) across two innings at Sydney which will take his tally to over 400 overs.

With Bhuvneshwar Kumar fresh and raring to go and young Khaleel Ahmed also joining the ranks during the ODI phase, there is a school of thought that Bumrah could be sparingly used during the next 13 ODIs (3 away and 5 home vs Australia, 5 away vs New Zealand).

Bumrah, who played a stellar role with match haul of nine for 86 in India's 137-run win against Australia at the MCG, has played nine away Test matches this year with 48 wickets in this current calender year.

Bumrah has bowled 379.4 overs in nine Tests while Mohammed Shami has bowled a few overs more (383.5 overs) but he has played 12 Test matches. Ishant Sharma during this phase has bowled 335 overs while off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has bowled the maximum overs (386 overs).

Among these bowlers, both Ashwin and Ishant do not figure as far as India's World Cup preparation is concerned as the core team of 20 is already set.

The core 20 comprises the 16 selected for Australia and New Zealand ODIs along with Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey and Umesh Yadav, who are still very much in the mix.

It is understood that Indian team management as well as national selectors are on same page with regards to the workload management of the pacers.

Bumrah is expected to play a major role in India's final Test match of the season in Sydney and everyone associated with the national team are aware that he is also an integral part of Mumbai Indians set-up for the Indian Premier League.

In best case scenario, Bumrah is expected to bowl at least 30 overs (minimum) across two innings at Sydney which will take his tally to over 400 overs.

With Bhuvneshwar Kumar fresh and raring to go and young Khaleel Ahmed also joining the ranks during the ODI phase, there is a school of thought that Bumrah could be sparingly used during the next 13 ODIs (3 away and 5 home vs Australia, 5 away vs New Zealand).

Bhuvneshwar, Khaleel along with Hardik Pandya and the two wrist spinners could provide Bumrah some relief time to time during upcoming ODIs as he will be as important as skipper Virat Kohli in the larger scheme of things.

However, the tricky part for the BCCI mandarins will be discussing Bumrah's workload management with the Mumbai Indians team management.

Earlier in October, there were discussions during a meeting between CoA, team management and selectors whether bowlers in the fray for the World Cup could be rested during the IPL but it didn't see the light of the day as franchises were wary.

However, there is expected to be some effort put in by the BCCI to convince Bumrah's franchise to co-operate looking at the bigger picture.

""For someone of Virat's stature, he can take a call himself and discuss with his franchise about his workload.

Delegation of Powers to CS & Administrative secretaries

The Governor allocated the powers read with the Presidential order as Jammu and Kashmir has come under the spell of President's rule on December 19.

Malik has also delegated powers of Ministers to the Chief Secretary and some Administrative Secretaries in respect of the matters allotted to them through a Government order.

Official orders issued today by the General Administration Department (GAD) said all cases which were required to be submitted to the Cabinet in terms of Schedule-II of the Jammu and Kashmir Government Business rule will be submitted by the Administrative Departments with the approval of the concerned Advisor to the State Administrative Council (SAC) through the Chief Secretary.

In the President's rule, the SAC, headed by the Governor and comprising his Advisors, the Chief Secretary and the Principal Secretary to the Governor, had powers of the State Cabinet.

""All cases which were required to be submitted to the Chief Minister in coordination or the Governor in terms of Schedule-III and Schedule-IV of the Jammu and Kashmir Government Business Rules, will be submitted by the Administrative Department concerned with prior approval of the concerned Advisor to the Governor through the Chief Secretary,"" the Government order said.

However, the cases involving major policy decisions or having substantial financial implications will be submitted by the Administrative Secretary concerned to the Advisor through the Chief Secretary, the order said, adding that the powers already delegated to the Administrative Secretaries, will continue to be exercised by them.

The Chief Secretary (BVR Subrahmanyam) will enjoy financial powers in the cases related to accord of administrative approval to all kinds of works/projects under plan/non-plan costing over Rs 7.5 crore and up to Rs 20 crore with the concurrence of Finance and Planning Departments.

""In cases under Centrally Sponsored Schemes/Central Mega Flagship Schemes/TFC grants/plan scheme having implication above Rs 50 crore in each case, the funds authorization powers have been vested with the Chief Secretary,"" the Government order said.

It added that cases where administrative and financial powers have been delegated in various codes/manuals in favour of all departments/ Administrative Departments /specified departments, they will be exercised by the concerned Administrative Secretaries only with approval of the Chief Secretary.

Cases where administrative and financial powers have been delegated in various codes/manuals, but competent authority or authorities have not been specified, the powers will be exercised by the Chief Secretary with prior concurrence of Finance Department.

The Chief Secretary and some of the Administrative Secretaries will hold powers of the Ministers.

The Administrative Secretaries given powers of the Ministers included those of GAD, Planning, Development and Monitoring Department, Finance, Revenue, Higher Education, Labour and Employment, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, School Education, Law Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. However, their powers have been specified in the Government order.

Reflecting on her journey as a writer in her memoir Listen To Me, veteran novelist Shashi Deshpande expresses her unease over the doubts raised about the authenticity of fiction written by Indian English writers. Many senior writers of various Indian languages have often questioned the ability of the English language to capture Indian life. Deshpande, who writes in English, rightly responds that writers have little choice in choosing the language of their creative world; rather the language comes to them.

However, the question returns soon after. Just a few paragraphs later, as she assesses her predecessors and contemporaries, Deshpande notes that she ""found Indian books in English wanting in some, or in many, respects"". She goes on to add: ""I could respond with greater enthusiasm to stories and novels translated from Indian languages"", and then she almost seals the argument by stating that ""as a writer I felt that my writing was much closer to them (writers of Indian languages) than to the works of known writers in English; it seemed that this, perhaps, was where I belonged"". The visible irony in the above observations underlines the candidness of a memoir that wishes to be ""seen in the context"" of ""Indian Writing in English (IWE)"". A writer asserts her right to write in a language of her choice, yet cannot avoid admitting to the deficiencies of fiction written in the language in India.

With a similar candidness, she comments on the diaspora writers, whose writings, after an initial surge, begin 'faltering'. ""For them to continue to write about India was to write from a distance, giving a sense of getting the material second hand,"" she says about the Indian writers based in the US.

These observations touch a sensitive nerve of IWE, particularly fiction. Not many IWE writers of some repute have been able to question their community as convincingly as Deshpande does.

Quite often, in an attempt to make some revelations or startling claims, people resort to controversial statements in their memoirs. Not with Desphande; her tone remains reasoned and sensible.

The book also has some insightful episodes about the life of women writers and the subtle discriminations they face at various levels. A review, she recalls, of her novel That Long Silence (it later got the Sahitya Akademi award) was clubbed with reviews of two novels by other women writers. It was published under the headline -- ""An exclusive ladies club"". ""It made the writers of these novels seem ladies of leisure,"" she writes, ""people who lived a life of ease and comfort and wrote in their free time"". ""Because we were women, women who wrote in English, a certain presumption was made about us."" The headline reflected the gender disparity that pervades the high seat of literature.

Many years later, Deshpande was the chair of the jury for the prestigious Commonwealth Writer's Prize. Among the shortlisted novels were JM Coetzee's Disgrace and Salman Rushdie's The Ground Beneath Her Feet, which she had read earlier, and ""hadn't thought very highly of"".

The award went to Coetzee, and Deshpande recalls Rushdie's reaction on the award night: ""What I felt most uncomfortable with was the sense of entitlement; that, because Rushdie had come home, he deserved a reward"". Later, Rushdie wrote an article in The New York Times and spoke of her ""disparagingly"", called her ""a stony-faced judge"".

Deshpande's memoir is remarkable in its calling out the bluff of the male superiority in literature. As she takes on writers from VS Naipaul, Rushdie to Atish Taseer, her account becomes a powerful defence, and mirror, of women writing in India. Significantly, while expressing her opinion, she doesn't turn vitriolic or vindictive. It's the voice of a writer for whom the dignity of words remains paramount.

Amid this, the book describes her journey as a writer, her upbringing in the artistic town of Dharwad, where her father made her learn Sanskrit. It's also peppered with her comments on the works of fellow writers, for instance Rohinton Mistry's A Fine Balance, many details of which ""seem to have been culled from media reports"".

The question that remains is this: Has the scene changed for the next generation of women writers, or women in general in India? In the 1950s, 50% of the girl students in Deshpande's class in a school in a small town of Karnataka went on to make prominent careers. Seven became doctors, one an eminent writer, one a mathematician, another was the director of a prominent management institute before she became the director of a bank, and so on. Sixty years on, can one make a similar statement about girls in a small town school?"

The premise of education in the current times, especially in the management domain, rests on shifting sands.

Thus, the biggest challenge that B-schools today face is developing learning modules and curriculum that are topical enough to groom the managers of tomorrow.

To address this uncertainty and transformation, the very simple mantra adopted by pro-active B-schools is research. Knowledge dissemination without knowledge creation is no longer conceivable, and hence a structured research strategy is at the helm of most leading B-schools functioning.

However, the dictate of developing contemporary thought and frameworks is not easy. The best of B-schools face constraints which may be in terms of funds or manpower, or both. Further, in case one is examining new phenomena like reverse consumer socialisation (the child mentors the parents/adults about novel practices such as mobile wallets and shopping) or revisiting established paradigms, most B-school may be at a loss to address the complexity of the phenomenon.

However, to tweak an existing cliché - complexity is the mother of invention and innovation. As one examines closely the current management thought that is gaining ground with Academicians and practitioners alike is that collaboration rather than competition is the way forward.

The first level of collaboration that B-schools need to look at is on home-ground, in terms of collaborative efforts across functional domains. The reason for this is that new and altered business scenarios are essentially complex and multi-dimensional.

For example, contextual or content-based marketing models have to be understood from the consumer behaviour perspective as well as basic digital marketing strategies. At the same time, one cannot ignore the IT interface that is the platform on which this occurs. Thus, to deliver a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon, research needs to be quintessentially cross-functional. This also goes for areas such as management of pricing across aggregated business models.

The other form of collaborative research that B-schools need to undertake is industry-academia interface to comprehend new/altered phenomena. This, in fact, is not a new practice and has been there since the 1900s. Change management practices focused on the impact of new strategic business relationships such as alliances, joint ventures, aggregator and outsourced functional models cannot be tabled unless the practitioner and academic partner come together to comprehend the novel phenomenon.

The third level of collaboration is equally critical as this prima-facie is institutional. Each school develops its own research focus and agenda. However, each entity in isolation - both geographically and basis orientation - will be able to conceptualise theories that at best may be restrictive.

Thus, cross-institutional research collaboration is the only approach to deliver generalisable results. For example, to study Technology Adoption Behavior or Talent Management or Entrepreneurship Models; collaborations amongst B-schools across countries or regions will be able to collate information from diverse populations and therefore develop seminal models.

To summarise, the three C's of collaborative research mantras for B-schools:

* Concentrated or complimentary: Collaboration can be concentrated in a single area and school and contribute seminal thought or be based on allied school and domain collaboration.

* Cultural homogeneity or cultural heterogeneity: Collaboration is needed to assess behaviour patterns e.g. Fantasy Sports Gaming that may be culturally uniform versus Investment Patterns that may have a contextual underpinning.

* Conceptual framework or concrete application: Whether the knowledge imperative is to develop conceptual models for disruptive innovation strategies or to work out on-ground multi-channel distribution strategies, the complexity demands that research be carried out in the zone of collaboration to deliver both comprehension and implementation.

Thus, collaborative research is no longer a choice but a directive for B-schools today. (MR, Inputs: Agencies)."

But except conducting recce at the site located at Khloo Ryngksan in East Jaintia Hills district and attempts to set up the high-powered pumps needed to flush out water nothing much happened during the day. Actual work on the ground will begin early on Sunday morning.

National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) Assistant Commandant Santosh Kumar Singh, who is overseeing operations at the rat hole coal mine. said a three member team of the Indian Navy visited the site.""They did a recce of the spot, spent 30 minutes inside the main pit. They also held a meeting with us and are likely to start operation tomorrow. Now that they are here we will assist them,"" he said.

The water levels inside the mine remains unchanged, he said.

Ace diver Jaswant Singh Gill from Amritsar with prior experience of saving miners in West Bengal was again at the coal mine today.

A team of Odisha fire and emergency services, who finally reached the spot, tried to install their high-powered pumps. ""They may be operational by tomorrow,"" Singh said.

""Pumps and other machinery are being installed at the site. Everyone is working overtime with extreme dedication and zeal as our mission is to save lives. That is our top priority,"" East Jaiñtia Hills district police chief Silvester Nongtnger told Hindustan Times.

He aid that after all the gear has been installed and put into place on Saturday night, rescue operations will begin on Sunday morning. ""We will start right from the first hour itself.""

The initial rescue operation to help the miners started on December 14 once the NDRF and SDRF teams arrived. On December 17, a team of Directorate General of Mine Safety along with Coal India officials arrived and suggested 100 HP submersible pumps be used. The district administration wrote to the state government seeking immediate help from Coal India on December 20. However, it was only on December 26 that Coal India received a request from state government for assistance.

The rescue operation launched by the state government had to be stopped as the pumps were not adequate to flush out large volumes of water. The state government then sough Centre's help and high-powered pumps and a team was dispatched from Odisha.

But due to total lack of coordination and support from the local administration in Meghalaya, the arrival of 21-member team was delayed.

The team reached Guwahati on Friday morning around 11:30 am, but due to lack of transport provided by Meghalaya they had to wait till 5:45 pm to start their 220 km journey to the mine.

""Initially we were told that we would be travelling by trucks. Then the plan was changed and it was decided that dumpers would be used to shift the equipment to the accident site,"" said Sukant Sethi, Chief Fire Officer (Odisha), who is leading the team.

""By the time we reached a primary school (located 25 km from the mine) where we were supposed to spend the night it was 2 am on Saturday. There was no person from Meghalaya government's side who helped us with basic needs,"" Sethi said.

Despite the problems faced by them, the team was keen to reach the spot soon to help the trapped miners. They finally reached around 1 pm on Saturday

Another aspect of seemingly lukewarm response by the government has emerged. Tata Trusts had offered to lend two pumps which it had airlifted from London to augment rescue efforts during the Kerala floods to Meghalaya but till date, there has been no response from the government.

Efforts to reach Peter W Ingty, additional chief secretary in-charge revenue and disaster management by Hindustan Times proved futile as he did not respond to calls."
"108","p-1028860662","2018-12-29","http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/vulnerable-women-gain-power-through-community-support","Vulnerable Women Gain Power Through Community Support","pressreleasepoint.com",FALSE,"It had been more than four years since the small village of Timangolo, in Cameroon, became the reluctant host to as many as 7,000 refugees fleeing an armed conflict in the neighboring Central African Republic (CAR), yet despite a sharp jump in population, no one had the money to invest in a place where people could gather, relax and enjoy a meal.

Then a group of women decided to take a chance.

In 2017, an unlikely group of entrepreneurs -- refugee women armed with an idea, some cooking skills and a lot of hope -- built and opened Timangolo's first and only restaurant. Within two months, the women were turning a profit. How they found the confidence, basic business skills and capital needed to bring their dream to reality highlights the success of an International Medical Corps program known as Women and Girls Safe Spaces (WGSS), and how it can empower even society's most vulnerable people.

The idea of women's safe spaces in unstable environments is not new and has grown widely over the past decade, especially in areas where strongly patriarchal cultures exist and the disruption of armed conflict or natural disaster can make women and girls even more vulnerable. Even so, opportunities can be found here: though women and girls are disproportionally exposed to traditional cultural barriers and safety risks, they are often the agents of positive change in their communities. Spaces created by programs such as WGSS function as safe havens that in crisis fulfill a critical need -- where survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) can discreetly muster the confidence to report such incidents without fear of reprisal and receive immediate support.

In more routine times, the safe spaces are locations where women and girls can gather in a protective environment, receive information, build support networks to improve their safety and well-being, and gain skills that can empower them.

In the case of the Timangolo restaurant, a safe space provided a place where the aspiring women investors first received encouragement to proceed with their project, then got the tools needed to launch it: advice from an International Medical Corps partner with expertise on running a business, plus a start-up grant of less than $100.

International Medical Corps is an acknowledged leader globally in the development of WGSS programs and has helped establish them in some 20 countries affected by humanitarian emergencies, including Cameroon. The programs have become an important part of our work to prevent GBV and to support survivors of such violence when it does occur.

In Cameroon, groups of vulnerable women and girls include refugees from Nigeria's far north and western areas, as well as from CAR's East Region and local host communities. In neighboring Nigeria, groups include residents of camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in and around the cities of Maiduguri and Damboa in the troubled northeastern areas, where the infamous Boko Haram militant group first began its attacks more than a decade ago and continues to be a malign presence, strengthened by an alliance with the Islamic State.

International Medical Corps' technical coordinator for GBV programs in Cameroon, Jacqueline Uwimana, explains that there are three key components to our strategy for preventing violence against vulnerable women and girls:

Raising awareness within communities on women's civil and human rights, and underscoring that culturally accepted traditions of inflicting violence upon women and girls are illegal, morally wrong and must be reported to authorities;

Adding capacity to raise awareness and provide essential assistance to survivors of GBV, including individual case management and the option for referral to complementary services; and

Empowering women to raise their voices, by creating women-led organizations within communities, and strengthening support networks for women and girls to provide them with skills that can generate income, such as embroidery, sewing, catering, trading, textiles and farming.

""The culture prevents women from speaking up at meetings or discussing issues in public like rape and other violence toward women,"" says Hassana Pindar, who manages International Medical Corps' WGSS program in Nigeria. ""We urge them to speak out because it's their right to do so.""

Yet Pindar admits it has not been an easy task. ""When we started, the cultural barriers were too high,"" she recalls. ""Women had to ask their husband's permission just to leave the house and come to the women's shelter. Once here, they would nervously check the time to make sure they wouldn't be late home. Very, very, very slowly they gained confidence, so that now it's no longer an issue.""

The key to this change of behavior? A simple three-letter word: men. Long treated mainly as the central cause of GBV, men were instinctively viewed as the barrier to progress -- the adversary of women seeking empowerment to do more with their lives. Though men certainly play this role, they are not destined to forever do so. They also have the power to transform community resistance toward women's empowerment into wholehearted support, because in highly conservative, traditional societies, community leaders and elders -- invariably men -- are the custodians of these traditions.

""How could we change this without being helped by the keepers of traditions?"" Uwimana asks rhetorically. ""Impossible.""

Pindar agrees. ""To gain acceptance of these new ideas in the community, we have to engage the men,"" she says.

Faced with this reality, program managers like Pindar and Uwimana began reaching out to community leaders and others in positions of influence to convince them that oppression and violence against women and girls weaken the community as a whole. They also began to push back against community efforts to stifle the reporting of GBV-related incidents while promoting efforts to empower women by teaching them income-generating skills.

Uwimana says her team actively searched for potential partners among men in the in the community: those who sent their children to school, for example, or were known to help their wives, and who could understand the benefits of preventing GBV and of empowering their spouse by providing them with the option to learn skills that could add both to household income and to the community's economy. They offered these men sensitivity training -- within what Uwimana calls ""Husband's Schools"" -- where they could learn how to communicate women's empowerment as a social benefit for both individual families and the community.

""We've learned we have to engage men in this, especially for violence prevention,"" she says. ""Once they get it, that's when we begin to see progress.""

Progress has come in many forms -- such as the organized pushback against plans by a local Muslim imam in the Cameroon town of Mblie to marry an 11-year-old girl. After eventually giving in to the pressure from other men involved in Husband's School, he renounced the planned marriage and joined a village committee campaigning against gender-based violence. Today, when child marriages do occur, they usually are conducted in the community's shadows.

In the Nigerian town of Auno, a 48-year-old husband and father named Mallam Dauda says that an International Medical Corps sensitivity session for men about the social and economic consequences of GBV changed his life. ""I now often talk with other men about its dangers,"" he explains proudly.

The lesson here is that when residents of both sexes work together to protect women and girls, and encourage active community engagement, the outcomes can be impressive.

""We've seen some wonderful results,"" notes Pindar. ""I've seen women who were hardly surviving who are now able to provide for their families and plan for their futures. The programs have changed, the design has changed. That's why we've achieved success.""

Though Women and Girls' Safe Spaces have existed for many years, there were few guidelines available for which strategies worked and which didn't. To rectify this, in 2014 International Medical Corps began a two-year research project -- with support from the US State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (BPRM) -- to study the effectiveness of the safe spaces created for refugees who had fled war in South Sudan for camps in Gambella, Ethiopia. Findings from this study reinforced our commitment to the safe spaces as an important approach for supporting women and girls.

In 2017, International Medical Corps partnered with the International Rescue Committee to develop guidance that could be used globally to implement safe spaces for women and girls: The Women's Safe Space Toolkit (WSSTK), which is being developed through coordination with multiple agencies and piloted in four countries, with BPRM support. Work on the project began in early 2018 and is expected to take two years to complete.

Meanwhile, back in the village of Timangolo, the initial success of the refugee women restauranteurs led them to reinvest their initial profits in upgrading restaurant's building. The upgrades generated profits of 300,000 Cameroon francs (about $520) over a period of five months -- and started the women thinking about other possible ventures to empower themselves and the community."

BK Nandanoor: DDPI with a golden heart

A defunct government school at the remote Mallapur village in Raichur district in north Karnataka is now abuzz with activity, thanks to the efforts made by Deputy Director of Public Instruction (DDPI) B K Nandanoor. The school, which had shut its doors in August this year, started operating from December 18, and at least four children have resumed studies.Setting an example of a grassroots initiative, Nandanoor got the government school reopened after residents approached him.The school was shut after a teacher was suspended and the students dropped out, even though a new teacher was deputed. Nandanoor swung into action at once on December 17. Nandanoor says,""I read the admission list of the school and then set a target for visiting the students' houses. I visited all the houses.""

Karnataka High Court: Makeover moves for B'luru

Bengaluru's aesthetic beauty has been restored, city roads are free from potholes, and cleanliness has improved -- all thanks to the Karnataka High Court, which woke up BBMP from slumber. Acting on a batch of PILs, a division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari directed BBMP to preserve the city's visual appeal by removing illegal hoardings, flexes and banners. Due to this, new bye-laws are being evolved to regulate hoardings. BBMP officials even registered an FIR against Minister D K Shivakumar for not removing an unauthorised ad, despite being given time. Citizens also got relief from pothole-riddled roads and garbage piles in public areas. The court availed the assistance of Army engineers to check the quality of work done by BBMP.

Nanditha: The power of one student

Nanditha (11) gets the undivided attention of her teacher every day. The resident of Obenahalli in Kolar is the sole student in the Government Primary School. The school, which was shut down at the start of the year 2016-17 after most students left it for private institutions, was reopened on the insistence of Nanditha, her parents and well-wishers. Komala GK, Nanditha's teacher, recalled how her parents, who work as daily wage workers, came looking for her all the way to the new school where she was posted. ""I could see anger, fear and sadness in them. They asked me what their daughter should do with the school closed."" The government was forced to reopen the school at the start of the 2017-18 year and admit Nanditha. Now even when her teacher takes leave, another one is deputed.

Namma Thambis: Green warriors of Ulsoor Lake

On October 10 this year, over 1,000 Thambis of the Madras Sappers waded into the waters of Bengaluru's Ulsoor lake and fought a war against an invasion, and won it. The battle was against water hyacinth, a weed. Ulsoor lake, situated in the heart of the IT City,is also used by the Sappers for training. Tired of seeing their lifeline being suffocated owing to pollution, the Sappers took matter into their own hands. The soldiers,on boats, pulled out the waste using their bare hands. They also removed plastic waste, household rubbish and other garbage. At the end of the day, the Army also issued a wake-up call in their signature fashion, blunt and to the point: ""People should understand that it is not the business of the Army to become garbage cleaners.""

Ananya:Hero in the hills

Ananya Vasudev RM saved 15 families of Karike village in Kodagu district during this year's floods and subsequent landslides. Ananya Vasudev,an assistant lecturer of Geology at the National Institute of Technology, received a WhatsApp video from a friend which showed loud sound emanating from the ground. Ananya Vasudev asked his friend to send another video. After seeing the fresh video, he was sure the sound was due to soil piping and the area could see a landslide. Soil piping is a formation of voids within soil which causes internal erosion and seepage. He immediately spoke to Kodagu Deputy Commissioner Sreevidya who sent a team to the village and evacuated the families. As predicted by Ananya, the area saw a huge landslide a few hours later.

S B Vastradmath: Speedy justice his goal

Chitradurga district court judge S B Vastradmath has done his bit to ensure that the public reposes its faith in the judiciary by delivery of quick judgments. Recently, he was in new for sentencing a man who killed his wife to life imprisonment within 13 days of the crime. He pronounced another judgment within 11 days of the crime. In September, the judge delivered 153 judgments in 22 days without taking a day's leave. He has broken his own record of achieving 70 points in a single calender month, which was earlier set by him during his tenure as the Civil Judge (Jr division) at Molakalmuru. In the system to evaluate judges, a point is awarded for each judgment where the maximum is 70 points irrespective of the number of cases. Vastramath says awarding death penalty to 3 men accused of rape and torture of a woman in Kolar was his most memorable judgment.

Anita R:Lighting up cells

Inmates of Dharwad Central Jail have smiles on their faces now -- thanks to Jail Superintendent Anita R.Reason: She ensures that they, especially women, don't waste their time feeling guilty or unworthy. She has ensured that the inmates exhibit their talent and also earn some money when confined within the four walls of the jail. Each month, Anita comes up with unique programmes. From making diyas to undertaking a beautician's course to knitting winter wear, her ideas keep the inmates occupied. Men are sent to work in fields and run a vegetable shop within the Dharwad jail premises. They are taught baking too. Anita's measures have yielded results, with many inmates confessing that they have shown behavioural changes. Anita has more things planned for the inmates in 2019.

Ayub Ahmed: Dignified farewell mission

Meet Ayub Ahmed, who uses his own resources to shift unidentified and unclaimed bodies, and performs their last rites. This 38-year-old Mysuru resident has been carrying out this job for the past two decades. As soon as members of the public, hospitals or even the police inform him about unclaimed bodies, Ahmed reaches the spot in his old Ambassador car and takes the body. He works as a loader at the Mandi Mohalla Market in Mysuru. Though Ahmed has not kept an official count of the bodies that he has buried or cremated so far, Ahmed puts the figure at about 10,000. Ahmed posts photos of the bodies on his Facebook page in the hope of reaching out to the kin of the deceased. In absence of claims, he gets the paperwork done, after which he takes the unclaimed bodies to the graveyard and performs the last rites as per their religion.

Krishna Byregowda:Crusade against plastic

At a time when plastic water bottles were the norm in government offices, Rural Development Minister Krishna Byregowda decided to do away with them at his offices and meetings. He replaced the plastic bottles with glass tumblers and reusable water bottles. Byregowda even carries a personal water bottle to the Assembly and Council to avoid using plastic or paper cups. Each person who visits the minister's office is served water in a glass tumbler, unlike the popular practice in most government offices where water is given in plastic or paper cups. Such was the impact of his approach to the matter that the CM asked officials to refrain from distributing water in plastic bottles at all government events.

Randeep D: Official in public demand

That good work seldom goes unnoticed was proved in the case of IAS officer Randeep D, who was brought back as the Additional Commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) owing to public pressure after being shunted from the position. Randeep was transferred by an order signed by Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy as the Commissioner of Social Welfare Department. However, he had earned the confidence of waste management activists for his attempts to reform the ill-managed system in the city. Randeep was credited with setting up the Solid Waste Management control room, bringing proposals of GPS tracking of auto-tippers and compactors, and updating the microplan. Activists pointed out his role in implementation of standard operating with regarding BBMP's Animal Husbandry Department. This led citizens to launch an online campaign to demand his reinstatement. After the campaign got the support of about 1,000 people, Kumaraswamy had to take a relook at his decision.

Kempaiah: BEO answers the call

An inspiring act by the Block Education Officer of Bangarpet Taluk went a long way to show how personal involvement can improve the learning ambience for children. Kempaiah shocked the school administration authorities, as well as teachers and students during a visit to a Kannada Higher Primary School in the district -- he cleaned a blocked toilet. Kempaiah had decided to visit the school to see the conditions for himself after he received several complaints from parents about the unhygienic conditions in the classrooms and toilet. While checking the toilets, when he saw it blocked, he got to his knees and started cleaning it with a brush. He had expressed to TNIE that it was unfortunate that the teachers and anganwadi workers had not kept the school clean. The girls in the school were forced to walk to their homes in the village for toilet breaks during class hours.

Inscription Stones of Bangalore: Documenting city's history

A civic activism project, ""Inscription Stones of Bangalore"" aims at creating awareness about and protecting ancient stone inscriptions (shila shaasanas) found in the Bengaluru region. The group has discovered several new inscription stones and restored the neglected ones by relocating them to a respectful place. They have educated citizens through postcards, public talks, school visits, poster presentations and other group- funding initiatives. With the help of latest technology, they have created 3D models of critically-endangered stone inscriptions. This project follows in the footsteps of B L Rice, who between 1894 and 1905, documented the stones in his 12-volume book, Epigraphia Carnatica. The project also acts as a platform for interested Bengaluru residents to work towards conservation of these ancient stones, which speak a lot about the Garden City's rich cultural past."

The year 2018 is ending with spectacular success of Indian scientists and technologists in space and defence sectors, with a series of high impact missions. But that's not all Indian scientists achieved in 2018. Several scientific developments, new techniques and promising technologies - in fields ranging from nanotechnology to space weather - made headlines during the year. Here is a collection of 15 such stories that gives a glimpse of important developments reported by Indian scientists during the year.

A gel that can protect farmers from toxic pesticides

Most farmers do not wear any protective gear while spraying chemicals in fields, which often leads to pesticide exposure and toxicity. Scientists at the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Bangalore have developed a protective gel - poly-Oxime - that can be applied on skin and can break down toxic chemicals into safe substances, preventing them from going deep into the skin and organs like the brain and the lungs. The research group plans to develop a mask that can deactivate pesticides.

World's thinnest material with novel technique

Pushing the envelope in nanotechnology, researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar have developed a material that is 100,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. They synthesized a two-dimensional material of just one-nanometer thickness (a human hair is about 80,000 nanometer wide) using Magnesium diboride - a compound of boron. This is said to be the world's thinnest material . It can find a range of applications - from next-generation batteries to ultraviolet absorbing films.

Gene editing applied to banana genome

Using the gene editing technique - CRISPR/Cas9 - researchers at the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute, Mohali have edited the banana genome . This is the first such work in any fruit crop in India. Banana is a the fourth most important food crop after wheat, rice and corn in terms of gross value of production. Gene editing could be deployed for improving nutritional quality, agronomical important traits as well as pathogen resistance in banana.

Discoveries to tackle Zika, dengue, JE and chikungunya

The National Brain Research Centre (NBRC) at Manesar has figured out cellular and molecular mechanisms that show how Zika virus causes microcephaly or small head size in babies. Researchers discovered that envelop protein of zika virus affects proliferation rates of human neural stem cells and promotes premature but faulty neuron formation. Another study led by scientist at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad has identified a key protein which helps dengue as well as Japanese Encephalitis viruses replication inside human body by inhibiting anti-viral cytokines. This finding could pave way for development of targeted drugs for dengue and JE. For detecting Chikungunya, a group of researchers from Amity University, Noida, Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi and Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, have developed a biosensor using molybdenum disulphide nanosheets .

Faster diagnostic tests for tuberculosis

Scientists at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi have jointly developed highly sensitive and rapid tests for detection of tuberculosis infection in lungs and surrounding membranes. Unlike current tests that use antibodies for detection of bacterial proteins in sputum samples, new tests use Aptamer Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA) and Electrochemical Sensor (ECS) for detection of a bacterial protein in the sputum.

Arsenic found in Punjab groundwater

Till now arsenic was a major problem in West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Chhattisgarh. It was also known that there is arsenic contamination in groundwater in Punjab. Now a new study done by New Delhi-based TERI School of Advanced Studies has found that that Punjab's floodplains are severely affected by arsenic contamination . In some wells, arsenic levels were found to be 20 to 50 times higher than WHO prescribed limit.

Here is our story on arsenic contamination in West Bengal

Space weather warning model rules out 'mini ice age'

A team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata have dismissed the speculation that the upcoming sunspot cycle is going to be stronger, based on calculations using a model developed by them. The near-Earth and inter-planetary space environmental conditions and solar radiative forcing of climate over the upcoming sunspot cycle 25 will likely be similar or marginally more extreme relative to what has been observed during the past decade over the current solar cycle. The method makes it possible to make predictions almost a decade before the next sunspot cycle activity peaks in strength.

New tool developed for autism screening

In many cases, autism is misdiagnosed as mental retardation and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Early identification and interventions may help children with autistic disorders. To help this process, scientists at the Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, have developed an Indian tool for screening children for autism. The Chandigarh Autism Screening Instrument (CASI) is designed to help community health workers to carry out initial screening for autism.

Hope for Alzheimer's, Huntington's

Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have figured out the way memory deficit develops in early stages, resulting in Alzheimer's disease . They have found that early breaking down of a protein, fibrillar actin or F-actin, in the brain leads to disruption in communication among nerve cells and consequently memory deficits. This knowledge can be used to develop early diagnosis test in future. In another study done in fruit flies, researchers at Department of Genetics at Delhi University South Campus found that it was possible to restrict the progression of Huntington's disease by increasing insulin signaling in the brain neuronal cells.

Green technique can address Plaster of Paris pollution

A team of scientists at Pune-based National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) has developed a technique that helps recycle Plaster of Paris waste from hospitals in an eco-friendly and economical way. The new technique disinfects waste and converts it into useful products like ammonium sulphate and calcium bicarbonate. The technique can also be used to disintegrate PoP waste from idols immersed in water bodies.

Stone Age tools, genetic studies throw new light on peopling of India

The Stone Age tools discovered in a village near Chennai suggest that a Middle Palaeolithic culture was present in India around 385,000 years ago -- roughly the same time that it is known to have developed in Africa and in Europe. The discovery pushes back the period when populations with a Middle Palaeolithic culture may have inhabited India, and challenges popular theory that the Middle Palaeolithic was brought to India by modern humans dispersing from Africa only around 125,000 years ago or later. In the North, population genetic study has revealed that the Rors who inhabit modern Haryana came to the Indus Valley when it was flourishing during the Bronze Age and inducted West Eurasian genetic ancestry

Sikkim gets real-time landslide warning system

A real-time landslide warning system has been set up in the Sikkim-Darjeeling belt of north-eastern Himalayas which is highly vulnerable to landslides. The warning system consists of over 200 sensors that can measure geophysical and hydrological parameters like rainfall, pore pressure and seismic activities. The system is capable of warning about 24 hours in advance. It has been deployed by researchers of Kerala-based Amrita University and Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority.

Computing capacity for weather forecasting gets a boost

During the year, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) upgraded its computing capacity for weather forecasting and climate monitoring, taking its total high performance computing (HPC) power to as high as 6.8 Petaflop. With this, India rose to the fourth position, next only to United Kingdom, Japan and USA in terms of dedicated capacity for HPC resources for weather and climate proposes.

Scientists use silk polymer to develop artificial vertebral disc

Scientists at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati developed a silk-based bioartificial disc that may find use in disc replacement therapy in future. The group has developed a fabrication procedure for a silk-based bioartificial disc adopting a ""directional freezing technique"". The disc mimics internal intricacy of human disc and its mechanical properties too are similar to those of the native ones. The use of a silk biopolymer to fabricate a biocompatible disc can reduce the cost of artificial discs in future.

Transgenic rice with reduced arsenic accumulation, flowering mustard

To address the problem of arsenic accumulation in rice grains, researchers at Lucknow- based CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute developed transgenic rice by inserting a novel fungal gene, which results in reduced arsenic accumulation in rice grain.They cloned Arsenic methyltransferase (WaarsM) gene from a soil fungus and inserted it into rice genome.

Indian Railways, being the most versatile and largest railway network in the world, definitely needs to pick up pace to match the newer demands of the people and make its mark.

This railway university is essential step in that direction. It will help the railways adopt the latest technology nd will also boost the skill levels of students, helping them acquire potential jobs in this sector. This initiative will also help the railways strengthen its roots in research and development.

The emergence of the railway university in India is the need of the hour as it will provide opportunities for students to hone the skills required in this field. With more universities planned, they will help in providing students with the understanding of the various engineering facets that are needed in this field.

It will also be instrumental in providing room for innovation and will help the railways move towards modernisation and undertake radical research.

(HT File)

With some school headmasters (HMs) dragging their feet over paying penalties for allegedly inflating attendance of students, the Bihar government has finally decided to recover fines by deducting the amount from their salary.

The HMs allegedly spiked attendance of students to claim more funds under the mid-day meal(MDM) programme.

Though the government received reports of irregularities long ago and imposed financial penalty on HMs, the fines could not be fully recovered. Many of the HMs moved court for relief citing their unwanted involvement in non-academic work, while others were just indifferent.

The government has ordered the recovery of a Rs8.68-crore penalty from HMs. Of which, Rs 4.21-crore (48%) has been recovered. More than 1,000 HMs have allegedly fudged the data since 2013, when the idea of penalty was first mooted by the state education department.

RK Mahajan, principal secretary of the department of education, recently directed all district programme officers (DPOs) to deduct the penalty amount from headmasters' salary in five instalments over as many months.

""The DPOs must ensure a monthly deduction from all those who have not deposited the penalty amount within a month of the receipt of the letter, except those who have got stay from the court,"" stated a letter by Mahajan.

""During inspections, the attendance of that particular day in the school and the average of the previous week is matched. If the deviation is within 10%, there is no issue. However, if the deviation is above 10%, a penalty equivalent to the amount given in the last three months is imposed on the headmaster,"" said Vinod Kumar Singh, director of the mid-day meal programme, .

Another official said that in several cases, the accused HMs with the help of their association approached the Patna high court or the Lokayukta, claiming that they were overburdened with non-academic work like management of MDM. The court has also asked the government to find an alternative to free teachers from MDM responsibilities.

Though the Bihar government tried to hand over MDM to NGOs or self-help groups (SHGs) and also ran pilot projects, a viable alternative has not been found because of the scale of the programme. In Bihar, despite a drop in enrolment numbers, 1.20 crore students from Class 1 to Class 8 are estimated to avail MDM daily.

In a Niti Ayog meeting a few months ago, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar advocated the direct benefit transfer for the centre's flagship MDM programme to plug leakages. ""Cooking in schools has a direct bearing on education. Instead of centres of learning, schools are viewed as centres of food. Poor quality and unhygienic conditions often lead to unpleasant incidents,"" he had said.

However, to achieve this, the Centre would have to change the policy at the national level, which seems unlikely. Bihar, on its part, has been seriously mulling the option of handing over MDM to women SHGs, which are 8 lakh in the state, the highest in the country. A pilot project has been launched in one block each of Jehanabad and Muzaffarpur to assess the feasibility."
"114","1028769578","2018-12-29","https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/are-menstrual-disorders-more-prevalent-in-developing-countries/301044","Are Menstrual Disorders More Prevalent In Developing Countries?","http://outlookindia.com/",FALSE,"In all conversations around menstruation, the one topic that should have been at the forefront, and yet is hardly even touched upon, is menstrual health. Health is a very measurable entity. Numbers, diagnosis and medical expertise can easily point to exactly where we stand with respect to menstrual health. Yet, there is utter silence. In a recent trend, menstrual researchers such as those who gather on platforms like 'Menstrual Health Hub' have begun to state that there is a need to gather evi­dence-based research. This is a relief, especially after years of blindly pushing for sanitary napkins, saying these could save women from dangerous rep­roductive health issues.

But is it really the case that there isn't enough data, or simply that we are not comfortable talking about what the existing data rev­eal? Let's take a deep dive into this and look at what exactly is making the modern researcher uncomfortable when it comes to hard data on menstrual health.

Do developing countries rea­lly have a greater ­prevalence of menstrual disorders? The vast majority of work on menstrual health and hygiene is happening in developing countries like India, Kenya, Nigeria, Brazil, Nepal, Bangladesh, etc. However, the discourse and agenda is largely set by entities from developed countries such as the US, UK and Australia. If we look at the data from comparative studies such as the WHO's multi­-country study (Omran et al., 1981), we find that they usually compare data from dev­eloping countries, with hardly a mention of the prevalence of menstrual disorders in developed countries.

The assumption that dev­eloping nations have a higher prevalence of menstrual disorders is generally not contested. The reasons cited are often poor socio-economic status, illiteracy and simply the fact that a country is 'dev­eloping'. Let's rev­isit this assumption by looking at comparative data on two of the most prevalent menstrual disorders -- menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) and dysmenorrhoea (painful per­iod) -- among adult women and adolescent girls in India, other developing countries and developed countries.

Heavy menstrual bleeding/Menorrhagia: India: Studies from different regions in India indicate that among adult women, the prevalence of heavy menstrual bleeding is bet­ween 1.6 per cent in Thiruvanan­thapuram, Kerala (Abraham et al. 2014) to 18.7 per cent in Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu (Kavitha et al. 2015). And among adolescent girls, it was found to be between 0.8 per cent in rural Haryana (Singh M.M. et al. 1999) to 23 per cent in urban West Bengal (Subha et al. 2010).

Developing countries: Studies from different developing nations (other than India) indicate the prevalence of heavy menstrual bleeding among adult women to be between one per cent in south-western Nigeria (Esimai et al. 2010) to 35.3 per cent in Brazil (I.S. Santos et al. 2011). And among adolescent girls, it was between 3.6 per cent in Enugu, Nigeria (Theophilus et al. 2010) to 38 per cent in Assiut city, Egypt (Mohamed et al. 2012).

Developed countries: In comparison, the data from developed countries indicate a higher prevalence of heavy menstrual bleeding among adult women -- between 22 per cent in the Netherlands (Fraser et al. 2015) to 52 per cent in England (Santer et al. 2005). Further, a study of elite athletes in London rep­orted that 54 per cent of women experienced heavy menstrual bleeding (Bruinvels et al. 2016).

Among adolescent girls, it was found to be 8.6 per cent in Washington DC (A.M. Houston et al. 2006) to 63.6 per cent in Japan (Nohara et al. 2011). Further, in the UK, 20 per cent of all women, and 30 per cent in the US, have a hysterectomy before the age of 60 -- and menorrhagia is the main presenting problem in at least 50-70 per cent (Hemaidi et al. 2007).

Menstrual pain/Dysmenorrhoea: India: Studies from different reg­ions in India ind­icate that among adult women, the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea is between 11.3 per cent in Thiruvanan­thapuram, Kerala (Abraham et al. 2014) to 68.6 per cent in Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu (Kavitha et al. 2015). And among adolescent girls, it was found to be between 15 per cent in urban West Bengal (Subha et al. 2010) to 72.6 per cent in urban Nagpur (Thakre et al. 2012).

30 per cent of women in the US have a hysterectomy before they turn 60 -- and menorrhagia is the main presenting problem.

Developing countries: Studies from different developing nations (other than India) indicate the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea among adult women to be between 14 per cent in rural Gambia (Walraven et al. 2002) to 89.1 per cent in Iran (Habibi et al. 2015). And among adolescent girls, it was found to be between 25 per cent in Enugu, Nigeria (Theophilus et al. 2010) to 84.9 per cent in Turkey (M. Seven et al. 2014).

Developed countries: In comparison, data from developed countries indicate a higher prevalence of dysmenorrhoea among adult women -- from 23 per cent in Boston (Abenhaim et al. 2005) to 77.6 per cent in Japan (H. Ju et al. 2014). And among adolescent girls, the numbers are still higher in developed countries. Dysmenorrhoea among adolescent girls was found to be 56 per cent in Italy (Rigon et al. 2010), 58 per cent in New York (K. O'Connell et al. 2006), 65 per cent in Washington DC (Houston et al. 2006), 74.5 per cent in South Korea (Jeon et al. 2014), (Yamamoto et al. 2009), 83.2 per cent in Singapore (Agarwal et al. 2009), 85 per cent in Houston, Texas (Bankiram et al. 2000), 80 per cent in Perth, Australia (Grbavac et al. 1999) and an exceedingly high 94 per cent as per an MDOT study of adolescent girls across Australia (Parker et al. 2006).

Menstrual Products and their impact on menstrual health: The undisputed trend of menstrual discourses in developing ­nations has been the promotion of menstrual products, especially sanitary napkins, under the guise of Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM). The idea is to emulate women from developed countries who have access to such products. However, the menstrual health data above raises serious questions about why the focus has been on developing nations, when in fact developed countries have a greater prevalence of menstrual disorders, in spite of them following WASH United's much-touted menstrual hygiene formula, of using declared hygienic products such as sanitary napkins and having access to good sanitation.

""Evidence to support the link between poor Menstrual Hygiene Management and other ­outcomes is weak and contradictory.""

Which brings us to the next question: do menstrual products have any impact on menstrual or reproductive health disorders? A study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ((Torondel et al. 2013), which looked at 14 articles to understand possible correlations between menstrual health management and reproductive tract infection (RTI), found that there was no association bet­ween confirmed bacterial vaginosis (typically characterised by excessive white discharge) and MHM. It also says: ""The body of evi­dence to support the link between poor MHM and other health outcomes (secondary infertility, urinary tract infections and anaemia) is weak and contradictory."" The study concludes: ""It is plausible that MHM can affect the reproductive tract, but the specific infections, the strength of effect and the route of transmission remain unclear.""

Strangely, it has occurred to very few that menstrual disorders have little to do with hygiene or the product used (except in the proven case of tampons causing Toxic Shock Syndrome among some women). The most common menstrual disorders such as dysmenorrhoea (period pain), ­menorrhagia (heavy bleeding), amenorrhoea (no bleeding) and oligomenorrhoea (menstrual cycles > 35 days) have no association with what product is used or how hygiene is maintained. The more serious disorders like endometriosis or PCOS are even more cut off from hyg­iene correlations. Some write-ups go to the extent of associating poor menstrual hygiene with cervical cancer, for which there is even less evidence.

Should we let MHM ­evangelists teach us?: Menst­ruation is as old an occ­urrence as women themselves. Our ancestors were never taught MHM. They simply knew what to do, and passed on the knowledge from generation to generation. Woven into their culture were various practices that served to prevent menstrual disorders. Practices that allow women to take the needed rest during menstruation and avoid physical exe­rtion, along with specific diet restrictions; these are not tab­oos, but the means by which women in ancient soc­ieties took care of their health -- by intelligently weaving science into ­culture and religion, so that large masses of women are benefited.

Whether it is India's Ayurveda, China's Acupuncture (Armour et al. 2016) or the indigenous science of the Caribbean isl­ands (Flores et al. 2014, Tinde et al. 2014), there is a far deeper understanding of the menstrual cycle than we have cared to investigate. This und­erstanding shows in the menstrual health of women from these countries. This is the area where research could go if we choose wellbeing instead of treatment and surgery, not to mention the effect prevention will have on health budgets. But first, we should be willing to acc­ept that the supposedly deficient targets of MHM 'benevolence' -- that is, women from developing countries -- might in fact be the ones who still hold ans­wers on how to prevent menstrual disorders.

Here's an honest question. How comfortable would menstrual researchers and NGOs that fight for poor girls and women in developing countries be if they had to state that, as of 2018, it is not India, Gambia, Nigeria, Brazil or Nepal that have the most menstrual disorders, but nations like the US, the UK and Australia -- countries that are leading the menstrual hygiene movement to help developing countries. Yes, it is a lot easier to state that there still isn't 'enough' evidence-based research on menstrual health.

The eastern India state successfully hosted the Men's Hockey World Cup at the iconic Kaling Stadium here, where players from 16 countries and a host of celebrities, including from different sports backgrounds, cultural icons and ambassadors descended to soak in the hockey fervour.

The state government created world-class infrastructure to host the global event while Bhubaneswar, the state capital, was decked up to welcome the sports lovers.

It also organised a Bhubaneswar City Festival for 16 days to coincide with the hockey World Cup.

As thousands of athletes and guests from around the world congregated in the city, the '.FEST' (Food, Entertainment, Storytelling and Trails) festival showcased Odisha's rich culture and delicious cuisine.

""In the course of all these events, as I have received these great people on behalf of the State, I have been struck by one common sentiment echoed by everyone: 'Such a beautiful place and such good people'. It has set me thinking,"" Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said.

In order to promote the hockey, the Odisha government announced a five-year deal with Hockey India in February to sponsor of all the national teams - junior and senior, men and women. The commitment for next five years will entail an expenditure of Rs 120 crore.

""The aim of making Odisha a global sports destination is to showcase the state and present it as an international investment and tourism destination while nourishing the budding talents with exposure to the international players,"" Sports Minister Chandrasarathi Behera said.

The Odisha government has also identified sports as one of its key focus areas as it aims to attract investment to the sector.

The state government has also signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with several leading industrialists to develop 10 world-class high-performance centres in various sports disciplines. The centres will provide international standard training facilities to potential sportspersons for the Olympics and other international events.

Reliance Industries has partnered with the state government for the athletics centre, while the JSW Group would help in developing infrastructure for football and swimming.

Dalmia Bharat Group, in association with the Pulela Gopichand Badminton Foundation, will set up a high performance centre for badminton while the Ahluwalia Group has extended its hand to develop the weightlifting centre.

The Aditya Birla Group, in association with the Gagan Narang Sports Promotion Foundation, will set up the Birla-Gagan Narang Shooting High Performance Centre while the Tata Group will develop infrastructure for hockey.

The Xavier-Emlyon Business School will set up a high performance centre for sports management, while Rungta Mines Ltd and Abhinav Futuristic Pvt Ltd will set up an advanced medical rehabilitation centre.

The All India Football Federation (AIFF), with the Odisha Sports Development and Promotion Company (OSDPC), will establish a high performance centre to boost football in the state. This will see Odisha become AIFF's High Performance Centre with developmental side Indian Arrows getting a permanent base in Bhubaneswar.

Earlier, the state government partnered with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) for establishment of a high-performance academy for athletics.

Having organised several international hockey events, the state government's love for hockey continues when it gave its approval to host the Hockey Olympic qualifiers next year.

""We are grateful to the Odisha government and people for organising the Men's Hockey World Cup 2018 so successfully. It was a marvelous tournament over here. We are in debt to everyone. And now I feel privilege to announce that the Hockey Olympic qualifiers will also be held here in 2019,"" said International Hockey Federation (FIH) president Narinder Batra during the hockey World Cup.

Bhubaneswar had earlier hosted Asian Junior Women's Rugby tournament, the 22nd Asian Athletics Championship, Men's Hockey World League. It had also hosted the 2014 Hockey Champions Trophy. Odisha also owns the Kalinga Lancers franchise in the Hockey India League.

""With the organisation of several national and international events, Odisha has truly emerged as a sports hub in the country. While the government has decided to develop sports infrastructure, these mega-events will provide exposure to Odia boys and girls to the best sportspersons in the world,"" said former India skipper and hockey Olympian Dilip Tirkey.

But due to total lack of coordination and support from the local administration in Meghalaya, the 21-member team which left Bhubaneswar on Friday is yet to reach the site in East Jaintia Hills district where the miners are trapped.

The team equipped with 10 high-powered pumps to flush out water from the mine reached Guwahati on Friday morning around 11:30 am, but due to lack of transport provided by Meghalaya they had to wait till 5:45 pm to start their 220 km journey.

""Initially we were told that we would be travelling by trucks. Then the plan was changed and it was decided that dumpers would be used to shift the equipment to the accident site, said Sukant Sethi, Chief Fire Officer (Odisha), who is leading the team.

(Click here for live updates on the trapped miners)

""By the time we reached a primary school (located 25 km from the mine) where we were supposed to spend the night it was 2:00 am on Saturday. There was no person from Meghalaya government's side who helped us with basic needs,"" Sethi said.

""There was no food, blankets or beds for the men to take few hours of rest. We are not used to such cold temperatures in Odisha and had to rush for our mission without carrying enough warm clothes and bedding,"" he added.

Despite the problems faced by them, the team wants to reach the spot soon to help the trapped miners. But the Meghalaya government was yet to send transport to carry the men and equipment to the site on Saturday morning.

""It's 8:00 am already on Saturday. We have been told that some vehicles are on the way to the school where we are staying, but they haven't reached yet. What is more surprising is that there is no Meghalaya government officer who is coordinating with us,"" Sethi said.

HT caught up with additional chief secretary, PW Ingty to find out the reason for the delay but he couldn't throw much light. ""The team has just left and they're on their way now,"" he said over phone adding that since he was travelling he didn't have much information.

When contacted, East Jaiñtia Hills district police chief Silvester Nongtnger said the onus of arranging vehicles etc. lies with the DC and not him. ""Please ask the DC or the ADM in charge,"" he told HT over phone from Khliehriat the district headquarters.

When asked if an option for a helipad was explored to further shorten the transportation time, Nongtnger said, ""We have some feasible locations and I had already given the coordinates to the DC, I don't know what happened next please ask him,"" the SP responded.

HT tried to reach out to the additional district magistrate SS Syiemlieh who is filling in for deputy commissioner FM Dopth who went on medical leave on December 26 but was asked to call back after an hour as he was very busy.

Meanwhile, the SP said nothing positive has emerged today and everything remains at standstill. ""We are waiting for the team from Odisha and then only we can proceed on our next course of action after the personnel and pumps etc. reach here,"" he added.

It is worth mentioning the apart from the district officials, no senior state government official or minister has visited the site in the past two weeks. On Friday, Peter Ingty, additional chief secretary, in-charge of disaster management also went on leave."

Indian Navy divers on Saturday joined the operation underway to rescue 15 miners trapped inside a flooded rat-hole coal mine in Meghalaya since 13 December, officials said Friday. The Navy spokesman said in a tweet that a 15-member diving team from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh will reach the site in the remote Lumthari village in East Jaintia Hills district Saturday morning.

""The team is carrying specialised diving equipment including a re-compression chamber and remotely operated vehicles capable of searching underwater,"" he said.

The Navy carried out an initial assessment on Friday to determine an effective response.

Pump manufacturing company Kirloskar Brothers Ltd and Coal India were jointly moving 18 high-powered pumps to drain water out of the 37-foot-deep mine. A team of surveyors from the two companies also conducted an on-the-spot assessment of the situation. They will submit a report to East Jaintia Hills district authorities on the technicalities about positioning pumps for effectively carrying the operation, officials at the site said.

The team would carry special diving equipment including a remote-operated vehicle capable of conducting an underwater search.

The Air Force has airlifted 10 pumps from Bhubaneswar. Its personnel have landed in Guwahati, 270 kilometres away from the coal mine, official sources said.

Trump advisor heads to Turkey, Israel after Syria pullout

US national security advisor John Bolton said Friday he would visit Turkey and Israel to coordinate on Syria, after President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw all US forces.

Bolton said he would head in January to both Turkey -- which has enthusiastically backed Trump's sudden move -- as well as Israel, a close US ally where the pullout has caused concern.

""We will discuss our continued work confronting security challenges facing allies and partners in the region, including the next phase of the fight against ISIS (also referred to as Islamic State), as the US begins to bring troops home from Syria,"" Bolton tweeted.

"141","1028532986","2018-12-28","http://mydigitalfc.com/fc-weekend/real-estate-attract-big-money","Real estate to attract big money","mydigitalfc.com",FALSE,"For Indian real estate sector, 2018 has been a year of transformation in particular. Crucial policy decisions and policy reforms by the government such as demonetisation, Rera, real estate investment trust (REIT), GST, crackdown on the benami properties and RBI tightening norms on NBFCs - all have impacted the real estate sector in big way, both in a positive or negative manner.

Let's look at the ramifications of those key policy changes on various verticals and aspects of the real estate sector.

Residential market

The premium residential real estate segment in the price bracket of Rs 2 crore and Rs 25 crore per unit has faced a challenging time in several pockets across India this year. Having said that, the most preferred ticket size or the sweet spot has been between the range of Rs 50 lakh and Rs 100 lakh per unit across geographies.

India is predominantly a young country, as the majority of the population is under 26 years. Similar to the scenario in the western countries, nuclear families are on the rise in India as well. Such change in the demographics and social fabric will surely continue influencing the demand patterns. Homebuyers now look for hassle-free purchase with peace of mind. They prefer to buy home once the project is on the verge of completion. No buyer is willing to risk his/her investment in projects that are stuck due to delay in obtaining permission and approval, title issues, lack of capital or fund diversions. Buyers always look for safe and risk-free investments.

Luxury projects

From an investment perspective, a property in a big realty project comes with higher saleable risk and low return on investment. However, an exit from such an investment customarily comes at a ready possession stage of the property, thus mitigating all the risks related to that of under-construction properties. But, too many luxury projects at the same time in close proximity across cities contribute to the slow-down in the sale of high-value properties. India is a country with varied income groups. Both poor and super rich co-exist. One shouldn't forget that aspect.

Although completed and under construction projects in the luxury segment are expected to get absorbed over the next 18-24 months, the sectoral pain would persist for at least 18-24 months in the luxury segment. Going forward, the developers will become extremely careful while launching such projects in future. To mitigate the risk of unsold inventory, developers should initiate more critical analysis to evaluate the demand-supply gap for each premium location.

Affordable housing

Affordable housing segment in India is facing its fair share of challenges since most of the projects are located in the outskirts of cities which lack basic infrastructure and amenities such as transportation, water, electricity, school, hospitals, etc. Hence, sale usually picks up the pace when projects near completion. Unless the developers are reputed strong track-record, buyers won't feel comfortable in buying home.

It's fact that the affordable housing is essentially low margin projects. The developers have to infuse a significant amount of liquidity in the form of equity as well as debt to ensure the projects are completed within the promised time frame. Too much supply of affordable houses is not an attractive scenario from both the investors' and the developers' point of view. Many lenders are not willing to fund projects which are outside the city limit. Those who are still willing to fund should look for robust project completion track record and the reputation of the developers.

Price factor

Price is a key factor in the decision-making process of purchasing a particular property. At the moment, the price range of Rs 4,000 and Rs 8,000 per square feet has emerged as the only lucrative space in demand, as compared to the Rs 8,000-15,000 per square feet range which was in demand 18 months back. Having said that, developments are happening only in the tier - I and tier - II cities. Rest of the region is still languishing.

Unsold inventory

The residential real estate market has witnessed a sluggish demand throughout the year which has caused the unsold inventory levels to rise in key micro-markets.

GST

The real estate sector was previously burdened with multiple taxes like VAT, service tax, stamp duty, etc. The implementation of GST has, in a way, removed the multiplicity of taxes to introduce just two components i.e. GST and stamp duty. However, GST has increased cost unit for the investors or buyers to the tune of 12 per cent, which has led to the slowdown in sales.

Rera

Rera has brought in a lot of disciple and transparency to the real estate sector. Thanks to Rera, buyers and the investors have become aware of various rights available to them. An organised sector will also benefit the builders in the long run in terms of better planning, execution, easy availability of fund, generating interest among the buyer and resultant improved sale. With Rera in place, customers are assured of timely delivery of the projects and the protection of their capital due to the penalty provision and the provision to maintain 70 per cent of the money collected towards the cost of construction. What's more, the pre-launch sale is not permitted unless approval and permissions are in place. Rera has proved to be a big help in streamlining the Indian real estate sector.

JV & consolidation

In a market which has been witnessing a slowdown for the past few years, the trend of joint ventures being formed by developers and strategic investors as well as between developers is gaining momentum. The objective is not only to raise capital during this financial crunch but also to pool their resources together to bring credibility and expertise in delivering projects. There are partnerships taking place between the developers and the land-owners as well which minimise the need to block funds upfront to purchase land. The developer, in such partnership, brings to the table the required know-how on the macro and micro aspects of the industry - from land laws and regulations to nuanced understanding of the pulse of the buyers to make watertight agreements with the borrowers (or buyers?).

Commercial real estate

In this segment, retail and warehousing verticals have seen growing interest among the investors and buyers this year since this asset class usually earns a decent return in the form of rental income and price appreciation. A number of global fund and investors always looks for acquiring such properties.

PE & global investors

Private Equity players such as Brookfield, Goldman Sach, Blackstone, CPPIB, ADIA, Warburg Pincus, KKR, GIC and Sun Group have been continuously investing in the commercial and retail real estate segments throughout the year.

NBFC & housing finance

Top NBFC & HFC who has supported real estate developers during the year (especially when Banks were not lending) are Piramal, Indiabulls, L&T Finance, Altico Capital India, KKR, JM Financial, Edelweiss, PNB Housing, LIC Housing, Capri Global. However, post IL&FS saga, these NBFCs have slowed down the lending process. There is slow credit off-take from banks to NBFC and NBFC to developers at the moment.

The lenders and investors such as banks, HFC, NBFC and PE have also tightened lending norms apart from slowing down lending. The IL&FS debacle has put pressure on the entire lenders and investor community. The funding to the real estate sector has dried up.

Way forward

Improvement in the economic activities across sectors such as manufacturing, services and trading would certainly lead to the availability of higher disposable income. The real estate sector is one of the largest asset classes in India and in the world and it will surely find buyers once the economy regains its momentum.

A major chunk of the investments could flow into the commercial real estate segment, followed by retail and residential real estate segments. This trend is expected to persist as the sector continues to mature with developers ramping up their operations to become more organised and transparent in their approach, thereby attracting greater attention from the domestic and offshore investor base.

The foremost strength of the Indian real estate industry is its rising population as that in itself creates housing shortage and subsequent demand. Because of rapid urbanisation, the housing shortage in India has touched 20 million units.

The sector also offers tremendous employment generation and business opportunities, both direct and indirect. These job prospects straddle a broad spectrum of profiles such as material suppliers, architects, contractors, project management consultants, design consultants, so on and so forth.

The sector is also dependent to a great extent on the performance of the sectors like steel, cement, electronics, furnishing, IT etc. Ever increasing domestic demand combined with a growing economy and favourable investment climate form the backbone of the real estate sector.

To accelerate growth, the wish-list of the sector includes rapid development in urban infrastructure, technology advancement, influx of funding, single window clearance mechanism for a speedy approval process, to name a few.

The dynamics of the real estate sector are changing with the affordable housing becoming the new target segment, demand for office and retail spaces witnessing a resurgence and industrial corridors driving the development of smart cities. Banking on these factors, the real estate sector in India is set to gain a competitive advantage which will help in stimulating growth in the sector."

The premise of education in the current times, especially in the management domain, rests on shifting sands. Thus, the biggest challenge that B-schools today face is developing learning modules and curriculum that are topical enough to groom the managers of tomorrow.

To address this uncertainty and transformation, the very simple mantra adopted by pro-active B-schools is research. Knowledge dissemination without knowledge creation is no longer conceivable; hence a structured research strategy is at the helm of most leading B-schools functioning.

However, the dictate of developing contemporary thought and frameworks is not easy. The best of B-schools face constraints which may be in terms of funds or manpower, or both. Further, in case one is examining new phenomena like reverse consumer socialisation (the child mentors the parents/adults about novel practices such as mobile wallets and shopping) or revisiting established paradigms, most B-school may be at a loss to address the complexity of the phenomenon.

However, to tweak an existing cliché - complexity is the mother of invention and innovation. As one examines closely, the current management thought that is gaining ground with academicians and practitioners alike is that collaboration rather than competition is the way forward.

The first level of collaboration that B-schools need to look at is on home-ground, in terms of collaborative efforts across functional domains. The reason for this is that new and altered business scenarios are essentially complex and multi-dimensional.

For example, contextual or content-based marketing models have to be understood from the consumer behaviour perspective as well as basic digital marketing strategies. At the same time, one cannot ignore the IT interface that is the platform on which this occurs. Thus, to deliver comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon, research needs to be quintessentially cross-functional. This also goes for areas such as management of pricing across aggregated business models.

The other form of collaborative research that B-schools need to undertake is industry-academia interface to comprehend new/altered phenomena. This, in fact, is not a new practice and has been there since the 1900s. Change management practices focused on the impact of new strategic business relationships such as alliances, joint ventures, aggregator and outsourced functional models cannot be tabled unless the practitioner and academic partner come together to comprehend the novel phenomenon.

The third level of collaboration is equally critical as this prima-facie is institutional. Each school develops its own research focus and agenda. However, each entity in isolation -- both geographically and basis orientation -- will be able to conceptualise theories that at best may be restrictive.

Thus, cross-institutional research collaboration is the only approach to deliver generalisable results. For example, to study Technology Adoption Behaviour or Talent Management or Entrepreneurship Models; collaborations amongst B-schools across countries or regions will be able to collate information from diverse populations and therefore develop seminal models.

To summarise, the three C's of collaborative research mantras for B-schools:

Thus, collaborative research is no longer a choice but a directive for B-schools today. IANS"

In Chennai, the year began on a good note as the police gatecrashed a birthday party organised by gangsters for their leader and nabbed over 75 history-sheeters as well as notorious goon Binu Papachan.

The conviction by the Chengalpet Mahila Court of Daswant on charges of kidnap, rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl was another piece of good news. The accused had also murdered his mother.

These apart, the year witnessed police commissioner A.K. Viswanathan pushing to bring the entire city under CCTV camera coverage.

In the middle of the year, the news about the serial rape of a young hearing impaired girl in Aynavaram came as a shock. The girl was raped for seven months and the police arrested 17 men.

The year also saw ministers and police officers being drawn into controversy after the CBI's anti-corruption wing raided residences of Health Minister C. Vijaya Baskar, DGP T.K. Rajendran and former city commissioner of police S. George in connection with the gutkha scam. Subsequently, five persons, including Madhav Rao, the owner of the gutkha company, were taken into custody.

In November, the Madras High Court appointed A.G. Ponn Manickavel, Inspector General of Police, probing idol theft cases in Tamil Nadu, as a special officer for a period of one year to continue the probe. This order was given on the day of his retirement. Early in the year, the Mr. Manickavel had seized antiques and antiquities from a few eminent personalities in the city.

As the year drew to an end, the police stumbled upon a case in which one Sampath Raj had hidden cameras in the bathrooms and bedrooms of a women's hostel he owned. His arrest set the government machinery working and steps are being taken to regularise private hostels.

Besides, police claimed to have busted an illegal immigration racket with the arrest of a Mumbai-based woman at the Chennai airport recently.

The districts too saw their fair share of major crimes. In November, five teenagers, all school students, plotted and executed an honour killing in Veeravanallur police station limits in Tirunelveli.

In Sivaganga district, communal tension raised its ugly head after a lull in Katchanatham village. Three persons were hacked to death in the incident.

In Coimbatore, the death of a college student during a disaster management preparedness drill conducted by a fake NDMA trainer made headlines.

Madurai was at the epicentre of a controversy that shook the State. An audio clip of a phone conversation between an assistant professor Nirmala Devi and her girl students was leaked on social media in mid- April. It was about luring students into providing sexual favours to higher officials of the university. The temple town also saw the arrest of uniformed personnel in connection with a dacoity reported in a doctor's house in Melur in December."

Later in the year, the government was forced to own up to the responsibility of protecting lakes in the city, though the progress on that front has been debatable.

News of the fire caught the attention of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in New Delhi, which had taken up a suo moto case after a similar fire in 2017.

An evidently irked NGT took the Karnataka government to task over recurring fires and froth in Bellandur. Slamming the State government for not taking preventive measures, a bench, headed by NGT acting chairperson U.D. Salvi, directed the government to submit a time-bound action plan by the end of January.

Within days, the government got its act together and formulated a holistic and time-bound action plan. But, the NGT expanded the net of scrutiny to include Varthur and Agara lakes, and asked the State government to come up with plans for their revival as well.

Also, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) was directed to carry out a pilot study on the macrophytes.

The NGT further made it clear that the 99 apartments in the Bellandur catchment area, which were served notices before, must install sewage treatment plants.

Going a step ahead, in April, the NGT constituted a panel comprising a professor from the IISc., the commissioner of the civic body, secretary of Bangalore Development Authority and senior scientists from central and State pollution control boards, to inspect the Bellandur, Agara and Varthur lakes.

'Shut down industries'

In one of its strictest orders, the NGT, in a follow-up hearing in April, directed shutting down all industries around Bellandur and announced that anyone polluting the lake would have to pay an environment compensation of ₹5 lakh. The government was directed to take up one-time cleanup of the lake in a month. The government failed to meet the deadline and asked for more time.

In a further rap to the government for its poor management of Bellandur lake, the commission, directed to monitor the cleaning operation, submitted a scathing report in June stating that the de-weeding activity was not only futile, but could further harm the water body. The committee also put the spotlight on Varthur lake and called it an aggravated calamity.

Hefty penalty

In its most recent order on December 6, the NGT again came down heavily on the State government for failing to protect Bellandur, Agara and Varthur lakes. It directed the government to transfer ₹500 crore to an escrow account to utilise for execution of the action plans to clean the lakes. The green body also directed the government to deposit ₹50 crore with the Central Pollution Control Board as environment compensation, and the BBMP was told to pay ₹25 crore.

Another panel, headed by former Supreme Court judge N. Santosh Hegde, has been set up to monitor implementation of the action plans.

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has decided to appeal against the NGT order in the Supreme Court.

While the cases will continue to be heard by the NGT, the saga of fires, froth, and indiscriminate dumping of garbage and sewage in the city's lakes continues.

Some lakes spring back to life

While Bellandur, Varthur, Agara, Kalkere, Kaggadasapura and Mestripalya lakes were in the news for all the wrong reasons, there was a glimmer of hope for Madiwala, Hebbagodi and Jakkur lakes.

Madiwala lake underwent a massive transformation. The 272-acre water body in BTM Layout, which was under development since the end of 2016, became home to many native species of flora and fauna. The transformation was the result of a proposal by the Karnataka Knowledge Commission to develop the lake into a unique biodiversity park. The developed lake now has an open butterfly park, conservatory of insectivorous plants and orchids, cycad and palm grove, herbal garden, an island ecosystems and a scented garden.

A CSR initiative saw the revival of Hebbagodi lake, off Hosur Road near Electronics City. It has a new embankment with a fence, increased water holding capacity and a waste segregation yard. The work was carried out by Biocon Foundation, the CSR arm of Biocon Ltd. and Syngene International Ltd.

A collaborative project by students of Srishti School of Art Design & Technology and artists from Germany led to the creation of a floating island made out of waste at the Jakkur water tank, next to the lake. The island is expected to serve as a platform to connect the community with the lake.

Threat of green cover receding

From trees making way for 'developmental projects' to allegations of illegal mining in a forest, Bengaluru's green cover continued to face threats from multiple fronts.

The year began with thousands of citizens raising their voices against quarrying and mining around Bannerghatta National Park. They pointed to environmental violations in the buffer zone of the park and mining in eco-sensitive elephant corridors.

A new draft notification for BNP by the Ministry of Environment and Forests signalled further danger to the ecology of the forest. The draft trimmed down the Eco-Sensitive Zone around the park from 268.96 sq.km. to 169 sq.km. This means opening up more area for mining and commercial development.

The new year may not hold any good news either. The coalition government's big ticket infrastructure project -- elevated corridors -- announced this year, is expected to result in the axing of as many as 3,000 trees, and pruning of another 2,000 in various parts of the city. Citizen groups are awaiting public consultations to put forth their objections."

Edited excerpts

Q: What is your sense, are we over staying to welcome the bulls or do you think we are on the start of genuinely some big growth period?

For the last few weeks, I am clear that we are going to move along with the emerging markets in 2019.My very well researched and considered view is that 2019 is going to be the year of the emerging markets and more so.

Taking India, if we look at how dynamics have played out, we have had huge outflows in 2018, close to in the range of about $40 million or nearby is what domestic liquidity and domestic investment savings have supported the market.

We haven't followed off the cliff, with such massive outflows. Now in 2019, we are going to get some more inflows, which are reasonably sure in the emerging markets as the way mature markets now are more or less plateaued out and are having their own problems of slow down and various other trade war issues etc. We being a more internal market in terms of having very strong domestic growth itself and not dependent on exports or the international markets, would be a natural choice for investors worldwide to deploy money.

I think overriding reason why I think India is poised for a very good year or two ahead is some of the fundamental reforms that are falling in place. Forget the fiscal deficit has become 117 percent or what it was etc. that is all this 3-6-12 months' kind of an adjustment. But as an investor, if you look back some of the structural changes that have been done starting from the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government and carried forward by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government whether it's oil pricing, subsidy issues and pricing, now no one blinks an eye when fuel prices change every day versus earlier. The Goods and Services Tax (GST), Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and non-performing assets (NPAs) are more or less absorbed and dealt with. I am not saying they have all been sorted out, but they have been absorbed and dealt in balance sheets, corporates have tightened themselves and I am very confident that the next two to three years are the year for the equity investors.

More importantly, if you look at anecdotal sentiment, today is worse going into the New Year what has probably been in the last 5-10 years. After 2008-2010, this has been the worse December, where the sentiment going into the New Year, so we are kind of well positioned to deploy our money at this point of time.

Yes, we are seeing volatility as Dow and other things will be out in the next few weeks or a month or two. We are on tract for fundamental shaping up better, earnings shaping up better, so a mix of this is going to give us a very good investment horizon for the next two to three years to deploy money.

Q: I think the only argument to that is the fact that consumption growth was expected to be the main driver for this market in the last two years and now we have seen a genuine slowdown there. If you talk about autos, we hear that dealer inventory levels are as high as 12-13 weeks right now and there is definitely a talk of some slowdown especially in rural, etc. How would you deal with that piece?

I agree with you and I think there is no one better than you who looks at this sector and really has the pulse of this, particularly in auto, hearing and understanding the analysis. However, I think what we are seeing is a short term phenomena and we are seeing this in pockets, where we are having problems. We were bound to have these as we could not have month-on-month numbers going on for three to five years. We could not have Eicher Motors or Maruti or something just carrying on at that breakneck speed. We needed a pause and whether that pause came in, since liquidity tightened or consumer sentiment came negative in the last few months or because of internal political and other dynamics that we had here. That was mainly led by some liquidity issues, some fear that the economy and actually on ground economy having going slowed down in the last year or two, we have seen the numbers wherever you say it was because of the long tail of the GST impact or demonetisation impact but like I said most of that has been absorbed now."

The prestigious St Xavier's College, which is kicking off the sesquicentennial year celebrations Saturday, is looking at massive fund-raising to open satellite campuses, build a 300-bed-strong girls' hostel, and set up endowment chairs as it crosses another milestone.

The first college to become autonomous under the Mumbai University back in 2010 and looking to upgrade itself to be a university, the college was founded by the German Jesuits on January 2, 1869.

The Jesuits also run about 100 other schools, 24 colleges, and innumerable non-formal and adult education centres across the country.

Father Keith D'Souza SJ, the rector and vice- chairperson, told PTI that the sesquicentennial celebrations will begin with a liturgical service (holy mass) in the college chapel Saturday.

Another key event of the year-long celebrations is the fund-raising dinner being hosted on January 3 at the Taj Mahal hotel, for which he is inviting alumni and leading corporate leaders. The college is also inviting two Nobel Peace laureates, Muhammad Yunus of the Gramin Bank fame of Bangladesh and Kailash Satyarthi, next month as part of the 150th year celebrations.

Some of the notable alumni names include the Godrej brothers Adi and Nadir, Anu Aga, Soli Sorabjee and Fali S Nariman, the late adman Alyque Padamsee, Swati Piramal, Sunil Gavaskar, Himanshu Roy (ex-Mumbai top cop who committed suicide recently), Vidya Balan, Ashish Bhasin, Dentsu Aegis South Asia chairman, Rajdeep Sardesai, writer Amish Tripathi, and adman Gerson da Cunha, among others.

On the proposed satellite campuses, the vice-principal Father Roy Pereira SJ, the college had its first layman principal in Agnelo Menezes who retired in May this year and the first non-Christian principal in Rajendra Shinde since then--said the move is necessitated by the acute space crunch at the Fort campus which is now a heritage property.

""We Jesuits run over a dozen educational institutions in the island city alone, including schools, colleges, engineering colleges etc. As part of the expansion of this iconic college, we are planning to have a few satellite campus at our sister-institutions. The first such facility could come either at the St Xavier's School nearby or the St Mary's High School,"" Pereira said, adding however, ""nothing has been finalised yet as we have to first secure the funds.""

When asked about the requirement, he said nothing is worked out yet. ""We will spend more time after the sesquicentennial year celebrations"".

He said looking beyond the heritage Fort campus through extension campuses will give a boost to the college's aspiration of attaining the university status which it has been pursuing for a year now.

On the need for a girls' hostel, Father D'Souza said Xaviers' was began as a boy's college in 1859 by the German Jesuit missionaries and it remained so till 1912, but today girls are a little over 70 percent of total student intake.

""We are looking at constructing a 300-bed-strong hostel for the girl students within the heritage campus itself, as most of these girls come from outside the city,"" D'Souza said.

He also said the college is seeking direct finance or funding to set up endowment chairs in various faculties, which alone may cost the college around Rs 1 crore. He was quick to add that in the past the college had received some funds from the Tatas and the Godrej group. It is looking at setting up such endowment chairs in the field of research and teaching.

On expanding the academic offering, Pereira said the college is planning to expand the masters offering in arts such as economics, psychology, sociology etc, to three more subjects, apart from more postgraduate degrees in science, commerce and management.

D'Souza said the college badly needs to raise funds as it is incurring loss of around Rs 1 crore annually, primarily due to the salaries and other overhead expenses.

This was primarily because the state government not only had stopped funding around 30 years ago but has also barred minority institutions like Xavier's from raising tuition fees.

From the CBSE Class 12 Economics exam paper leak to alleged leak of Staff Selection Commission's (SSC) CGL 2017 exam. The probe is on in these cases.

The government's decision to scrap homework for Class 1, 2 students, and setting limits to the weight of school bags to granting the Institute of Eminence status to best institutes of India was praised by many, likewise many academicians criticised its role to dissolve University Grants Commission (UGC). As the year draws to a close, we look back at some of the crucial events and decisions happened in the education sector.

Year-ender 2018: Top education news of this year Institute of Eminence status

The Union Human Resource Development Ministry in July granted the Institution of Eminence (IoE) status to the IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay and IISc Bangalore. From the private sector, the Manipal Academy of Higher Education, BITS Pilani, and Jio Institute were granted the tag. The UGC had received 103 applications including JNU and Delhi University for IoE status. The selection of Reliance Foundation's non-existent Jio Institute triggered a political debate with the Opposition accusing the NDA of favouritism. As per the RTI filed by The Indian Express, the government internally disagreed about the Jio institute,

CBSE paper leak

The paper leak of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE Class 10, 12) examinations is one of the biggest education scams of this year, as the board has to cancel the papers of both Class 12 examinations following the leak. The police had made significant arrest in this case, 12 people were arrested from Bihar in connection CBSE Class 10 Mathematics paper leak, and three from Delhi for CBSE Class 12 Economics paper leak.

Advertising

To prevent the paper leak, from this year the board is planning to use encrypted question papers. Under the encrypted system, each examination centre will be provided with login details and the question paper will be printed in the school and then photocopied and distributed.

No homework for classes 1, 2 students, HRD ministry limits school bag weight

The students of classes 1 and 2 do not have to do homework, as per the directives issued by the Human Resources Development (HRD) Ministry to states and union territories. The directives also mentioned the prescribed weight limit of school bags for each class.

According to the official order, the HRD ministry has ""instructed all the states and Union Territories to formulate guidelines to regulate the teaching of subjects and weight of school bags in accordance with the Government of India instructions"".

As per these instructions, which the schools have been asked to comply with, institutions cannot assign homework to students of classes I and II. ""Schools should not prescribe any other subjects except language and mathematics for classes I and II and language, EVS and mathematics for classes III to V students as prescribed by the NCERT,"" the order said.

JEE Main to be conducted twice a year

The HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar in July announced that JEE (Mains) will be conducted twice a year. While the JEE (Mains) will be held in January and April, NEET will be conducted in May, the minister said.

The latest development has come as a breather for many students grappling with the inadequate time to prepare for these exams, which were previously conducted once a year. Earlier, students used to appear for these exams just after their Class 12 Board, forcing them to focus on their board and entrance exams simultaneously.

CBSE relaxes passing criteria for Class 10 students

In a relief to Class 10 students, the Central Board of Secondary Education has extended the passing criteria. ""To give relaxation to students, the board has decided to ease the passing criteria for Class 10 students from 2019,"" said CBSE chairman Anita Karwal. From next year, the students need to get a minimum of 33 per cent marks in theory and practical combined to declare pass in the subject.

""It has now been decided to extend the same passing criteria henceforth for the students of secondary classes i.e. candidates appearing for Class 10 examination 2019 onwards will have to secure 33 per cent (both taken together) in the subjects to be eligible to pass the subject,"" mentioned the official release. Earlier, CBSE had announced that students do not have to pass separately in theory as well as practical exams.

Senior executives can now be IIM director

Future directors of the prestigious Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) may no longer need to have anything to do with academia -- or even possess a PhD. According to rules notified under the IIM Act this week, executives, who have been in senior management roles for at least 15 years, will now be eligible to be appointed as directors.

The premier business schools, in the past, have been headed by corporate executives, but such examples are few and far between. Ravi J Matthai, the first full-time director of IIM-Ahmedabad in 1965, and Subir Chowdhury, who headed IIM-Calcutta in the 1990s, are two such examples.

Scrapping of UGC

The Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry had in July announced its decision to replace the University Grants Commission (UGC) with the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) by repealing the UGC Act, 1951.

According to a draft, which has been placed in the public domain by the ministry to seek feedback from the stakeholders, the new commission will solely focus on the academic matters and monetary grants would be under the purview of the ministry. The decision has not gone down well with a section of academicians, who have questioned the move saying politicians should not be involved in academic matters.

Rolling back the controversial selection rule for research students, the University Grants Commission (UGC) scrapped oral interviews, or viva-voce, as the sole criterion for admission to Ph D and M.Phil programmes.

The higher education regulator has amended the UGC (Minimum Standards and Procedure for Award of M.Phil/ Ph.D Degree) Regulations 2016 to give 70 per cent weightage to performance in the written entrance test and 30 per cent to the oral interview for the final selection of a candidate, The Indian Express has learned.

The commission has also permitted relaxation of five percentage points in the minimum marks to be scored in the written test by SC, ST and OBC candidates. So, while a general candidate will have to secure at least 50 per cent in the entrance examination to qualify for the interview or viva voice, a candidate from the reserved category will have to score 45 per cent.

Visva Bharati VC row: Tussle between govt and president on the appointment of VC

The government asked President Ram Nath Kovind to overturn his decision on the appointment of Visva Bharati University Vice-Chancellor (V-C) only after he ignored HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar's recommendation for the post and chose Swapan Kumar Dutta instead, according to official records accessed by The Indian Express under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

As reported by The Indian Express on February 23, Kovind, in an unprecedented move, withdrew his assent to Dutta's selection as the head of Visva Bharati in Santiniketan, at the behest of the HRD Ministry. He also scrapped the panel of three finalists forwarded by the government last year.

National Medical Commission Bill

Government think-tank NITI Aayog has pitched for enactment of the National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill, 2017, observing that regulatory bodies the Medical Council of India and the Nursing Council of India have ""failed"" to ensure adequate availability and quality of health professionals.

In its 'Strategy for New India @75' document released on Wednesday, the Aayog has recommended revamp of the regulatory system of nursing education to ensure quality training in nursing schools and also stressed on developing centres of excellence in nursing and enhancing the stature of government nurses, as reported by PTI.

False academic records, Motihari VC Arvind Agrawal resigns

The Vice-Chancellor of Mahatma Gandhi Central University (MGCU) in Bihar, Arvind Agrawal was resigned from the post following allegations of falsifying his academic records.

But for 22-year-old Gopika Nandu, a tri-athlete who is a cyclist, swimmer and runner, it is a ticket to the Ironman Copenhagen Denmark Triathlon which is set to take place in 2019. The event is being organised by the World Triathlon Corporation.

Gopika already owns the title of being the youngest woman super randonneur (SR) in the state after she completed four long distance events covering 200 km, 300 km, 400 km and 600 km known as brevets at a randonneuring season, an international long-distance cycling sport.

Since most of these events extend to multiple days of nearly continuous pedalling, the sport is a challenge and is a test of the endurance, time and management skills of the rider. There are allowances for bad weather, mechanical breakdowns or health issues of the rider.

Gopika was always into active sports. ""I was an athlete from my school days and used to participate in district-level athletic meets. In 2013, I joined the Trivandrum Runners Club and completed several marathons over the past few years.""

In 2017, she took up cycling. She joined the Trivandrum Bikers Club and started participating in Brevets. In the same year, she completed her first 200kms brevet (Thiruvanthapuram - Karunagappally- Thiruvananthapuram).

However, after being employed in the IT sector, Gopika says she was not able to constantly pursue her dream. Nevertheless, in 2018, she completed her first brevet of the year covering a distance of 200 km (Thiruvanthapuram - Karunagappally- Thiruvananthapuram). She later went on to complete a 300 km Brevet (Thiruvanthapuram- Alappuzha -Thiruvanthapuram) and also finished a 400 km brevet (Kochi-Thrissur-Kochi- Neendakara-Kochi)and 600 km brevet from Kochi-Pothundy- Kochi- Attingal-Kochi.

"" Initially I was little scared to participate in these events but I was determined to complete it. It mainly depends on how you plan your time and follow your diet,"" said Gopika.

Gopika says cycling was never an 'accident' but rather a dream come true. It was to prepare herself for one of her life goals, competing in the Ironman event- completing a 4 km swim, 190 km bicycle ride and a 42 km run. ""This type of event requires rigorous training and commitment and I have already started training myself with an aim to participate in the Ironman event in 2019."" Gopika draws inspiration from Solonie Pathania from Pune, who is the third lady Ironman from India and is all set to participate in the Ironman Copenhagen, Denmark in August 2019."

A video of the shocking incident shows six students aged 9-10 years, belonging to Class 3 and 4, standing naked in the hot sun, with their pants down to their ankles and their arms up in the air. The boys stand outside their classroom, even as other students pass by.

The private school, located in the interiors of Chittoor, is run and owned by the school principal Maharaja Naidu, who is on the run after the video came to the attention of child rights activists.

According to child rights activists, the students' parents allege that it was the principal who humiliated the students by asking them to remove their clothes for being late to school.

Some parents also say that the kids were punished for not completing their homework. The parents have been staging a protest in front of the school since Thursday morning, 27 December.

Speaking to TNM, Achyuta Rao, president of Hyderabad-based child rights organisation Balala Hakula Sangham, alleges that not just the principal, but the Mandal Educational Officer (MEO) is also colluding with the school authorities and is trying to hush up the issue.

""Our organisation had a word with the MEO. Instead of immediately cancelling the recognition of the school, the MEO Leela Rani is trying to cover up the issue and has said that she will be taking up the matter with the higher authorities. Is that how an issue of such serious nature has to be dealt with? The principal of the school should be booked under POCSO Act as it's a clear case of exploiting the children's modesty. The children should also be given psychological counselling in the aftermath of such a traumatic experience,"" Rao said.

Balala Hakula Sangham has filed a complaint with the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and has demanded that action be taken under the POCSO Act. Until now, the police have not registered a case against the school management.

Speaking to the local media, Chittoor DEO B Pratap Reddy, said an investigation into the issue is underway and that the school's recognition for the academic year 2019-2020 could be withdrawn.

The concept of long-term investing is for all practical purposes, dead. Many investors in this age of by-the-minute business news channels associate long-term investing as holding a stock for a whole one year. Gone are the days when we would still have the shares that our father or grandfather bought. And we are paying the price for it -- dearly!

Busting the Myth

The main criticism against long-term buy-and-hold strategy is that we live in a world that is changing by the day. Nothing -- not even profits, market shares or the stock price remain as they are in the future. So the best course of action, is to buy-and-sell.

Subscribe to the Value Research Insight newsletter

Amateur investors alone don't fall for this view. A top ranking Mumbai based fund manager that this writer interviewed a couple of years back had this to say, ""How can you say what will happen in 10 years? We may have a war in the Middle East, crude can shoot up, hell we may even be very close to World War III!"" And that was the end of discussion on long-term investing.

Buffett has been a long-term proponent of investing for the long-term. ""I want a simple business, easy to understand, great economics now, honest and able management, and then I can see about in a general way where they will be 10 years from now. If I can't see where they will be 10 years from now, I don't want to buy it. Basically, I don't want to buy any stock where if they close the NYSE tomorrow for five years, I won't be happy owning it...People buy a stock and they look at the price next morning and they decide to see if they are doing well or not doing well. It is crazy. They are buying a piece of the business. That is what Graham -- the most fundamental part of what he taught me,"" (Lecture at the University of Florida Business School, 1998).

The Coffee Can approach

Michael J. Mauboussin, earlier Chief Investment Strategist at Legg Mason Capital Management wrote about the coffee can approach to investing. This was a real-life story about an investor in the US who would buy $5,000 worth of stocks and put their share certificates in a safe deposit box. Sitting in the box, the investor did nothing about them. After his death, it was found that some investments turned into losses and were valued at $2,000, many others were valued at over $100,000 and one investment had gained a value of $800,000!

This real-life story will elicit different reactions among different individuals. Some would say you cannot buy-and-forget; some others would reminisce that is what their fathers did. But the key lesson is not buy-and-forget. Rather that, it is wise not to get carried away with market fluctuations and stick to your investments. This is the essence of Buffett's investing style. ""Lethargy bordering on sloth remains the cornerstone of our investment style."" (Annual Letter 1990).

Many critics would say long-term investing doesn't work in India. Let's see with an example. Infosys has been struggling for many years and is really not anyone's favourite stock to own right now -- apart from old-time shareholders! The stock is down 31.5 per cent from its peak and no one knows for certain when things will turn around -- even with Narayana Murthy back. But here's the kicker. If you had bought Rs 1 lakh worth of Infosys 10 years back and did nothing with it, today, in spite of all the negatives, you would be sitting on a mind-boggling sum of R 6 lakh! A similar investment in a much diversified Sensex would have netted you R 5.27 lakh. Heed the advice of Munger, Buffett's partner in investing. ""Don't pay attention to 3-5 years"". Investing is a longer term game. The most successful investors in history swear to that."

From darkness to light. Or so I thought when I heard about my shifting from the dark dungeons of coal mines, as coal secretary, to the bright lights of school education, as secretary for school education and literacy.

However, I discovered soon that in the coal sector, mining was underground and mafias operated above it, but in the minefield of school education, it was the other way round. All the education mafias existed underground, and they were all masked, masquerading as so-called noble giants. Having taken on some of the mafias of the coal sector and partly succeeded in bringing the sector to order, the task was now to handle these 'noble giants'. It was made more difficult as there was no public outrage against invisible scams in education as was in the case of coal.

Everything seemed to be apparently in order.

To make matters worse, I was the fifth person to hold the charge of secretary in the education department in just two and a half years. Most of my predecessors with impeccable credentials in the education sector did not continue or were not allowed to continue. The government apparently found in me to be the most 'educated' person (I had never worked in this sector except for a brief tenure of three months in 1997 in adult education in Uttar Pradesh) to handle this sector.

It would be an understatement to state that the education sector was in bad shape - both in terms of budgetary allocation and human resource management.

Also read: My friend told me the coal sector was like 'Gangs of Wasseypur': Former secy Anil Swarup

The budgetary allocation for school education was Rs 55,115 crores during 2014-15. This amount got reduced in subsequent years. For instance, the allocation for 2016-17 was Rs 43,554 crore.

On the human resource front too, the situation was alarming. The department had five secretaries between 2014 and 2016. A number of joint secretaries were also changed during this period. It was like musical chairs reminiscent of my days in UP where it was rumoured that the only industry flourishing was the transfer industry.

In the two biggest states of the country, the positioning of top management followed a peculiar pattern. Whereas in UP, there were two additional chief secretary-level officers manning school education and secondary education separately (creating huge coordination problems), in the state of Bihar, one officer looked after both the education and health departments. Consequently, the health of education continues to suffer.

In addition to this, the mafias were having a field day, eating into the system, like termites. Fortunately, like all mafias, those in the education sector too were not a majority, but played a dominant role in decision-making. They were extremely well connected and deeply entrenched. There were a host of mafias, but the prominent ones were operating in these areas:

There are around 16,000 B.Ed and D.El.Ed colleges in the country. A large number of these exist only in name. If you pay them well, you can get a degree without an effort. It was rumoured that if you pay them more, they could even arrange for a 'naukri' (a government job). Action was initiated by then chairman of National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) Santosh Mathews, an upright officer, by issuing notices to all the colleges to furnish the details of their existence on affidavits. The idea was to ensure that only those that actually existed got recognition and in case of wrong information they could be prosecuted. It worked initially, but the colleges realised that quite a few of them could be in trouble. Despite the support he got from most of the states, he was put under enormous pressure by the mafias who took the 'judicial' route to pin down the chairman. He had to quit.

In a few northern states of the country, a number of examination centres are given on 'theka' (contract) for copying. These centres are highly 'priced' as they facilitate mass copying or cheating during examinations. The current chief minister of UP, Yogi Adityanath, came down heavily on this mafia. This was last done by Kalyan Singh in 1991, but thereafter no chief minister could dare to do that. Consequent to the steps taken in UP in this year's exams, more than one million students chose not to give exams. It is a reflection of the 'addiction' to mass copying.

Also read: To fix India's education system, we need good action plans not policies

The publishing industry thrives on the education sector. People with vested interests want to maintain status quo as this benefits them. It happens at two levels. As respective state governments provide free books to students, there are various ways in which money is made. The 'mandatory cuts' in getting the books printed centrally constitutes a substantial portion. The initiative taken by the UP government in 2018 and the consequent savings thereunder lends credence to this allegation. The Bihar government is toying with the idea of direct benefit transfers recognising the 'dealings' inherent in central printing and distribution.

The other level of money making is done by a handful of private publishers who enter into an 'arrangement' with the private schools in the name of quality, and compel the students to buy almost four to five times more expensive books as compared to the NCERT ones. If all the students of around 20,000 CBSE-affiliated schools were to source NCERT books, there would be an estimated annual expenditure of around Rs 650 crores. Compared to this, if they source books from private publishers, it would cost around Rs 3,000 crores per annum. The difference is too great to justify the quality argument.

The NCERT did a wonderful job in the current academic year to ensure that books were available on time so that the students were not compelled to buy expensive books, but this effort will need to continue. The NCERT will always be under pressure from people with vested interests to be 'inefficient'.

Most of the private schools in India contribute enormously to imparting quality education. However, some of them are bringing a bad name to this segment. There are some extremely powerful individuals who are able to get away with the most immoral things in education. They violate various norms, legal and ethical, with impunity because having been part of the official machinery at some point in time they know the tricks of the trade.

Irrational hiking of fee, charging huge sums of money to 'lend' their brand, harassing the brand assignees are some of the many tricks they practice. The chairperson of the CBSE Rajesh Chatur who chose to take them on was shown the door in 2017. His successor, Anita Karwal, one of the finest civil servants, was also set to be 'sacrificed'. But she held her ground despite pressure.

The good news in all of this is yet again from UP where the state has enacted a law on the fee regulation after consulting all the stakeholders. Hence, the legislation has been welcomed by all. Hopefully, other states will follow suit.

As we enter the sprawling Godrej facilities in the Mumbai suburb of Vikhroli to meet group Chairman Adi Godrej for our lunch meeting, the first thing we notice are the changes taking place.

A landscaped garden, the under-construction buildings and the new headquarters all suggest that it is no longer a conservative, 121-year-old group.

Tall structures have replaced the understated three-storeyed buildings, announcing the group's real estate ambitions.

<>Godrej One, the new 11-storeyed headquarters, is the first building under The Trees, a mixed-use development master plan, which will have commercial, retail, residential, a five-star hotel and cultural spaces.

The other change is Adi Godrej handing over the reins at key operating companies last year to his children, while he continues as chairman at the group level and at Godrej Industries.

Known for his disciplined lifestyle, Godrej, an early riser, walks to stay fit and makes it to office at quarter past eight every morning.

He's also on time for our lunch, slated at 1 pm at the directors' dining hall on the fifth floor of Godrej One.

The Godrej family, whose net worth, according to the Forbes 2018 ranking, is $14 billion, derives a significant portion of its wealth from owning land in Vikhroli.

Godrej Properties, the group's real estate arm, says Godrej, holds enormous promise as the demand for quality housing grows in Mumbai and other cities.

The Godrej group is the largest real estate owner of Mumbai with 4,000 acres, and The Trees project is part of the group's monetisation exercise.

Other listed group companies include Godrej Consumer, Godrej Industries and Godrej Agrovet.

As we are served Mexican bean soup and corn cheese toast, the 76-year-old Godrej is quick to point out that he is not an art connoisseur and the painting was bought by his wife Parmeshwar who passed away two years ago.

In a sense, she was the perfect foil to Godrej, say industry peers, outgoing to his largely reserved nature, a fashionista to his more formal dressing style, a woman who led her life to the fullest.

Unlike his billionaire peers, Godrej doesn't find it necessary to own a corporate jet, preferring to fly commercial or occasionally chartering aircraft.

He says about his wife: ""She added her own dimension. She had a lot of friends; was social. She also helped in the business, with advertising (for brands such as Cinthol) as well as in new product formulations.""

Parmeshwar's work on improving AIDS awareness in the country along with actor Richard Gere as part of the 'Heroes Project' a decade-and-a-half ago is well-known.

Godrej himself remains passionate about healthcare, education and environmental sustainability.

He recently stepped down as chairman of the board of Indian School of Business, but continues to be on the board.

He has championed the cause of effective skilling and training of people at various fora.

""I don't think there is a dearth of jobs in India. What exists instead is a clear gap between skilled people and the work at hand. Employers on most occasions find it difficult to find a match between the two, which is why it is important to focus on skill training,"" he says.

Joint ventures stitched up by the Godrej Group across categories from appliances to personal care, wheat flour to packaged food, following the 1991 liberalisation of the Indian economy, were rolled out quickly, but didn't last long.

Godrej has no regrets about them saying, ""They were not useful beyond a point.""

In the last 10 years, the group has opted to take the inorganic route to growth, buying companies across Asia, Africa and South America.

Godrej says the group's focus remains mainly on these markets and that it is open to divestment opportunities elsewhere, such as the one it undertook recently in the UK, where the group exited Keyline Brands, its first overseas acquisition, done in 2005.

Godrej does not have any diversification plans on the table, but will ""enter adjacencies"".

The macro headwinds that India is facing at present do not bother him.

India, he says, will be the fastest growing major economy in the world despite all the challenges.

His advice to the next generation is to ""look forward to Mondays"".

Godrej, who holds a bachelor's degree in engineering and an MBA both from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is passionate about management.

""My father was into technology while I was more into management,"" he says.

Godrej, say corporate governance experts, has always relied on a healthy board comprising qualified practitioners and was amongst the first to introduce independent directors on the boards of group companies in India.

""The way to avoid a conflict is to take a thought or idea to the board early on the decision-making process,"" he says over the main course of ratatouille lasagna.

The Godrej model of ownership has also been keenly tracked by observers that involves inducting qualified family members into the business, encouraging them to contribute meaningfully to the organisation in their chosen domain and working closely with professional managers in the group.

Godrej's three children -- Tanya, Nisaba and Pirojsha -- have all been through this process, he says, who are now heading group companies after working their way up.

While Tanya is the chairperson of Godrej Nature's Basket, Nisaba heads the Godrej Consumer board, while Pirojsha is chairman, Godrej Properties.

Though Godrej has given his children the freedom to run their companies, he still oversees operations as group chairman.

""They are qualified and capable of running their businesses well. While we keep ownership and management separate, if anybody from the family wants to join the business, our point is that you have to be well qualified to do so,"" he says as the table is cleared for dessert, which includes cut fruits.

The Godrej Group has also been at the forefront when hiring women, giving them flexi-hours and daycare facilities, and has been one of the early employers of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community in its offices across the globe.

""We were early believers in diversity and felt that we should have a strong representation of women in our organisation. Globally, 40 per cent of our employees are women. In certain geographies such as Africa, Indonesia and the north east of India, the percentage of women employees is even higher,"" Godrej says.

It had also set up a committee for sexual harassment complaints years ago.

""We gave women the option to complain if they faced a problem,"" he says.

His love for travel has taken Godrej to 95 countries across the seven continents.

A supporter of the World Wildlife Fund in India, Godrej prefers nature and likes to get away to the mountains.

He loves reading autobiographies and biographies and has been greatly influenced by leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Margaret Thatcher.

""Right now I am reading Ramchandra Guha's Gandhi: The Years That Changed the World. This is possibly the thickest book I've ever read,"" he says on his favourite pastime.

""I am fascinated by the fact that Socrates was Plato's tutor, Plato was Aristotle's tutor and Aristotle was Alexander's tutor. I have read about them all and the impact they've had,"" he says as we finish our coffee."

Alappuzha sub-collector Krishna Teja's Facebook page 'I am for Alleppey' is helping rehabilitate those affected in the flood-battered state.

Bengaluru: In August, when severe floods ravaged Kerala, killing 433 people and causing damage worth Rs 40,000 crore, the relief and rescue efforts, particularly by the local fishermen, were hailed by everyone.

One of the earliest, and biggest, rescue missions -- ""Operation Kuttanad"" -- was led by state Finance Minister Thomas Isaac and Alappuzha sub-collector Krishna Teja Mylavarapu. The alertness and quick response shown by this officer and his team in evacuating and moving people to safer zones saved the lives of nearly 2 lakh people in the Kuttanad area of Alleppey, which was the worst affected by the flood.

After the rescue operations, the young, dynamic IAS officer shifted focus to rehabilitation and launched ""I am for Alleppey (IAFA)"" on Facebook, the first crowd funding-based social media initiative that has been successfully helping locals rebuild their lives.

The campaign team is close to building nearly 500 homes and provided for infrastructure for schools and hospitals, largely in the Kuttanad area. Businessmen and celebrities have come forward to help and donate, giving people cattle and ensuring safe potable water.

On 24 December, the initiative marked 100 days of its launch.

During the rescue operations, Teja realised how crucial social media could be when several images and messages were circulated on it. He decided to use Facebook to seek help.

""During a crisis, the focus of the people and government is usually concentrated on rescue. But after one tides over the crisis, the focus is lessened during rehabilitation (sic). That is when I realised that it is important to concentrate on rehabilitation,"" Teja told The Print, explaining the rationale behind the initiative.

""I thought we would bring some campaign which gives some momentum for the work we have done. That is why I launched 'I am for Alleppey'. This initiative works in tandem with government programmes and adds value to efforts put (in) by all of us,"" he said.

When the page was shared among Teja's friends the day it was launched -- on 14 September -- within six hours, a woman from Kerala, who was living in Andhra Pradesh, agreed to adopt a primary health centre in Kuttanad. ""This was our first success story,"" said Teja.

Teja's Facebook page has built up an impressive following since then, and has been liked by more than 96,000 people.

""I am for Alleppey"" has been conducting several rehabilitation programmes:

Officials found during a survey that despite extensive rescue operations, nearly 500 animals were lost. This was a severe setback for the 133 families in Kuttanad who were completely dependent on livestock for their livelihood. This initiative helped generate interest among those who wanted to donate a cow to the dairy farm owners.

The process is simple. IAFA volunteers identify healthy cows in the district or nearby areas. When a donor approaches them through the Facebook page, a price lower than the market rate is quoted. Once the price is fixed, the cow is handed over to a beneficiary identified by the IAFA team. This way the dairy farmer benefits directly.

""We ensure that it is a healthy and insured cow, preferably one that is pregnant so that it would not stress the farmer,"" says Teja. ""Every cow is screened and insured for a year. There are already 120 people who are ready to donate cows and we have already donated 66 cows.""

He emphasises that the IAFA ensures it sources the cattle from Kerala and not from neighbouring states such as Tamil Nadu, so that that revenue generated remains within the state.

Kuttanad faced two successive floods and schoolchildren lost out on three months of their academic year. Attendance fell and classrooms were empty. The IAFA provided notebooks, schoolbags and water bottles for children as incentives to go to school.

The move worked. By 14 November, three months after the floods, 40,000 students were back in government schools in Alleppey.

In Kuttanad, the anganwadis also grappled with another problem after the deluge -- that of drinking water contamination. The IAFA came to the rescue, fitting water filters free of cost to ensure clean drinking water.

The team from the blockbustre film Baahubali was the first to promise to build five houses in the area. Later, many others stepped in. By the end of January, the team expects 500 houses to be built.

Telugu cine star Allu Arjun adopted 10 anganwadis while organisations such as the Ramakrishna Mission, Save the Children and Andhra Pradesh Unaided Schools Management Association provided for schoolbooks and other basic facilities. Of 99 anganwadis, 50 have been adopted till date.

Stressing on dignity for widows, the IAFA refers to their families as women-headed ones. It believes these families require extra help as it is even more difficult for them to rebuild their lives. About 6,000 such families have befitted and received kitchen and other household articles, campaign workers say.

The IAFA has organised medical camps and provided two months' free medicine, food and protein supplements to benefit nearly 4,000 elderly people in the area.

Several specially-abled persons lost equipment such as hearing or visual aids during the floods. IAFA volunteers visited the houses of such people and gathered a list of their requirements. After registering with the local primary health centres, nearly 6,000 people were provided equipment free of cost.

The worst-hit roads in Alleppey were mapped and identified to assess the extent of damage to trees. After a detailed study, 400 saplings were planted to help rebuild the green cover.

The IAFA provided free nets to the local fishermen.

Rameshan, a cattle farmer from lower Kuttanad's Kainakari panchayat, lost most of his livestock. He is a beneficiary of the ""Donate a Cow"" campaign.

""I am happy that I can sell this milk and feed my family. I don't understand what this internet and Facebook is. But I know that through Krishna Teja sir, I have been given a cow sponsored by a Good Samaritan. We are very thankful,"" he said.

Shiny V, headmistress of the KK Kumarapilla Smaraka Government High school in Karumady, Alleppey district, recalls how badly affected her school was.

""We wanted to encourage children to come back to school and instill reading habit in them. There was no space to keep such books and (I) requested for almirahs. I met sub-collector Krishna Teja sir who at that time asked me the condition of our computer lab.... it was in bad shape..."" says Shiny V.

""In less than an hour, he (Teja) said he will provide us funds worth Rs 2 lakh. With that money we bought four laptops, 11 chairs, two printers and furnishings for the computer room. We are indebted to our sponsor AP Unaided Schools Association who provided us infrastructure for our school,"" she adds.

C.S. Balachandra, founder of Abhaya Foundation, is among the organisations helping with construction of houses.

""Instead of distributing only relief material, we wanted to involve ourselves in a more constructive way. After consulting with three sets of engineering experts from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala, we found a 'flood-resistant construction module' which costs close to Rs 6 lakh per unit. On an experimental basis, we are building five homes in the Thirumala and Nehru Trophy wards,"" he said.

The efforts by Teja and his team have received positive feedback on social media, and have been appreciated by both the state and the central governments.

""I am for Allepey is an endeavour in addition to the rehabilitation programmes by the Kerala government. We are only additionally facilitating to help maximum impact in our small way... I only hope that in times of need or calamity, people get together and help one another, during and after,"" says the IAS officer."

The market dynamic forces have been determined after conducting a detailed study of the Global Recycled Metal Market.

Europe recycled metal market share is projected witness gains of more than 4% during the forecast timeframe. This is primarily due to stringent laws and legislations imposed by environmental regulatory bodies in Europe, which has triggered metal recycling to reduce the carbon footprint and help save the environment from hazardous waste generated. For instance, Directive 2008/98/EC imposed by European Commission defines basic concepts related to waste management.

According to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc. Recycled Metal Market size is forecast to exceed USD 125 billion by 2024

Industry Growth drivers are

* Rapidly growing construction industry in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East

* Strong product demand from electrical & electronics industry in North America

* Stringent & supporting legislations for metal recycling in Europe

It signifies terms and conditions related to waste, recycling and recovery. Moreover, Directive 2012/19/EU prevent the generation of electrical & electronic waste and to promote reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery to reduce the quantity of waste to be eliminated, whilst also improving the environmental performance. These trends are likely to make significant impact on the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Recycled non ferrous metal market size was valued more than USD 90 billion in 2017. Non ferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, lead, precious metals and other metals such as nickel, zinc, tin, palladium, etc. These metals find wide-ranging applications across construction, electrical & electronics, transport, consumer goods, industrial machinery, nuclear, military and several other end-user industry. For instance, lead is widely used electronics in batteries, ammunition, cable sheathing, etc.

Lead batteries are used in transport industry and constituted approximately 35% of the total industry share in terms of volume in 2017. These trends will help boost the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

In terms of volume, recycled metal market share for building & construction constituted close to 45% of the total business share in 2017. It is mainly due to comprehensive recycled metal applications in the building & construction industry. For example, ferrous metals (iron and steel) are broadly used in the construction of large steel frameworks in the building, bridges, drainage components and various other architectural frameworks.

Furthermore, non ferrous metals including aluminum, copper and lead are also utilized in the building & construction sector. Lead sheets are used for roofing, cladding of vertical walls, soundproofing in partitions and ceilings in office, school and hotel buildings. These trends will help make considerable contribution to reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

North America electrical & electronics industry is on the rise which is due to consistently changing consumer's preferences and continuous technology upgradation. For instance, the electrical & electronics industry was valued more than USD 900 billion in 2016 and accounted for a total of 21% of the global electrical & electronics industry. These trends will drive reprocessed metal demand owing to its wide spread applications in metal plating electronics via electrodeposition. It provides improved corrosion resistance, enhanced electrical conductivity and improved solderability which helps in protecting against wear.

Furthermore, precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, rhodium, etc. are also widely applicable in the electronics industry owing to its unique physical and chemical properties which provides reliability to the electronics sector. It will help attain significant gains to the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

Ineffective metal reprocessing is a key constraint which is probable to impede the global reprocessed metal market size by 2024. For instance, only 40% of the total copper produced is attained from recycling and 33% of the total aluminum produced is attained from recycling process. Nevertheless, rising emphasis on metal processing and reusability to reduce carbon footprint and impact of hazardous waste will generate plentiful opportunities for the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Key reprocessed metal market players are Sims Metal Management, Steel Dynamics, European Metal Recycling, Nucor Corporation, ELG HanielGmbh, Schnitzer Steel and Novelis. The market players are expanding their capacity to process metal to attain profitability in the market. For example, Novelis announced to build flat-rolled aluminum plant in January 2018 in Kentucky U.S. for USD 300 million.

Amid a spurt in domestic passenger traffic at Tiruchi international airport, local tourism circles have made a strong pitch for resuming direct flight services to the country's financial capital, Mumbai, from here.

2018 saw a fast-growing Tiruchi airport getting connected to three key cities of Bengaluru, Kochi and Mumbai, thanks to new services launched by private airliners. In addition, there was direct connectivity to Chennai and more overseas flights.

Introduction of the new services had a positive impact with domestic passenger movement witnessing a two-fold increase from the begining of the current fiscal up to November.

Airports Authority of India (AAI) statistics show that domestic passenger movement exceeded 2.23 lakh from April to November in the current fiscal at Tiruchi airport as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year (April - November 2017) when the figure stood at 83,282.

The daily direct flight service from Tiruchi to Mumbai and from thereon to New Delhi and back operated by Jet Airways from March-end followed by launch of daily services to Bengaluru and Kochi by IndiGo, which also introduced four flights to Chennai from June, helped in boosting domestic traffic.

The Tiruchi-Mumbai-Delhi flight service was operated using Boeing 737-800 series aircraft with more seating capacity unlike ATR flights with limited seats to Chennai, Bengaluru and Kochi.

However, the sudden withdrawal of service in the New Delhi-Mumbai-Tiruchi-Mumbai- New Delhi sector in October-end, seven months after its introduction, came as a huge disappointment to frequent flyers from the delta region consistently seeking connectivity to more domestic destinations from here.

The airline stopped the daily service citing operational reasons notwithstanding the good patronage with the passenger load factor exceeding 80%.

Amid this scenario, Trichy Tourism Federation has now made a strong pitch for introduction of flight services in Mumbai-Tiruchi-Mumbai sector. The federation, in a representation to Air India authorities, requested the airline to operate service in the Mumbai-Tiruchi-Mumbai sector to benefit the business community and tourism.

In the representation, federation president V. Vasudevan said Air India was the first to introduce flight service in the Tiruchi-Mumbai sector twice a week a few years ago, which proved successful. However, the operations were stopped.

The daily service introduced by Jet Airways in the New Delhi-Mumbai-Tiruchi-Mumbai-New Delhi sector from March registered an average 85% cabin factor in both directions. The representation further said that Tiruchi had a large business and ethnic community and a mixed traffic segment that would benefit trade community and tourism if the services were to be launched.

""Tiruchi is a rapidly growing city today attracting devotees to various shrines situated in this part of the region, besides housing prestigious educational institutions such as National Institute of Technology, Indian Institute of Management and Tamil Nadu National Law School and a slew of industries. Hence, there is a definite need to have direct connectivity with Mumbai at a time when Tiruchi airport is on an expansion mode,"" says M.A. Aleem, member, Airports Advisory Committee, Tiruchi International Airport.

The Tiruchi-Mumbai service operated until a few months ago proved a real hit, and keeping this factor in mind the airlines should come forward to launch the service in the sector again, said Dr. Aleem.

Airliners would definitely not lose revenue by starting the service given the good load factor recorded earlier, added Dr. Aleem, a city-based neurologist."

Authorities at Chaitanya Bharati School forced the students studying in class III and IV to stand naked outside the school after they came in late on Wednesday. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) filed a complaint against the school, following which the district administration lodged a police complaint.

Punganuru sub-inspector P Gouri Shankar said they have booked academic in-charge Dulam Bhuvaneswari and correspondent Kadiyala Nagaraju Naidu for forcing the students to stand outside the school in the sun. ""We received a complaint from Punganuru mandal educational officer (MEO) Pulluru Leelarani on Thursday,"" he said. The accused have been booked under several sections of the IPC, including for causing hurt, assault and criminal intimidation, and section 75 (cruelty) of Juvenile Justice Act.

There are allegations that though the issue was highlighted earlier, the MEO did not initiate any action against the authorities and acted only after Chittoor collector P S Pradyumna ordered an inquiry into it. Chittoor district educational officer, K Panduranga Swamy, has issued orders withdrawing the recognition of the school on Thursday.

'Children must be counselled'

The NCPCR alleged that MEO initially tried to suppress the matter and demanded that his immediate suspension for ""colluding with school management to hush up the issue.""

Child-rights activist Achyuta Rao, who brought the matter to NCPCR, demanded that children be counselled. He also accused police of lapses as they have not invoked Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act."

The circular has come as a relief for students who were upset with the Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board (KSEEB)'s plan to ban all watches.

""The reports of ban on all kinds of watches created lots of confusion and we're worried about time management,"" said Tanu Kamath, a student from Jayanagar.

Another student, Kanika V from JP Nagar, said: ""I'm happy with this decision. I had actually started practising writing examination without using a watch. How could they even think of banning all watches when students do not have enough time to look at the wall clock while writing exam?""

On November 28, 2018, TOI had reported about the students' demand to ban only smart watches. KSEEB had earlier suggested keeping only wall clocks in exam halls in the wake of malpractices committed by students with the help of digital watches.

""People deployed for frisking at exam centres will be alerted about the ban on smart watches or cheating watches,"" said KSEEB director V Sumangala.

Though students wear smart watches inside SSLC exam halls, no such cheating case has been reported so far. Instances of digital watches being used to commit malpractices in exams conducted by other boards and universities prompted the proposal, said KSEEB officials.

About 8.4 lakh students will write the exams, beginning from March 21.

Restriction needed

During exams, students are reminded every now and then about the time left to finish writing paper. Restriction on use of only smart watches is a safer option, as banning all sorts of watches might make students anxious

Rupa D Kini, principal, Shantiniketan English Medium School, Udupi

Wrist watches are not necessary for students as they will be updated about the time. The decision to restrict students from wearing digital watches will certainly curb malpractices. Students often employ various tactics during board examinations, and now, they will be controlled

R Srilakshmi, teacher

I'm happy with the decision to ban digital watches. Students cleverly use them for other purposes rather than checking time during exams. It's a distraction for others too

The DEO after examining the bag physically, even weighed them.

The officials said that in majority of the cases, the students were found to be carrying bags heavier than what the government has prescribed. In some of the schools, the management had followed the government resolution and made changes in the time-table.

The state government had earlier issued a directive to all district education officers and district primary education officers to conduct surprise raids in schools and check the weight of schoolbags carried by children.

The education department has asked all DEOs to carry out checks in at least three schools every week irrespective of the board to which a school belongs. DEOs have been asked to check schools affiliated to Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board according to Gujarat government rules, while those affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education will be checked according to CBSE standards.

In the last week of November, after the government of India's decision, the Gujarat government had also announced that it will act against schools not following the schoolbag weight criteria and that are forcing children to carry bulky bags.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said, ""We have issued a directive to all education officers to check and prepare a list of schools flouting schoolbag norms. We will first issue notices and if the schools fail to reduce the bag weights we will penalize them. The government is working outthe penalty for such schools.""

Chudasama said no homework is to be assigned to students of classes I and II. Only half an hour of homework can be given classes III to V students and the same for Classes VII and VIII students can be one hour per day.

A district education officer said, ""It will be difficult for us to check the exact weight of the bags as we will not be carrying weighing machines. Inspectors who will be going to the schools will be using their own judgment by looking at the bags and holding it in their hands.""

He said, ""We have asked the schools to schedule their periods in such a way that the student is not required to carry all text books. According to government direction classes for only three to four subjects are to be held in a day. The notebooks for homework and classwork should not be separate. There shall be no separate notebook for essay writing."""

In another context, Winston Churchill said, ""I am a man of simple tastes easily satisfied with the best."" That is what ""excellence"" is - the best you know, the best you can. However, there is one difference: the best is the ultimate (what we learnt in school: good, better, best), whereas excellence is ever changing. No limit, because excellence is ""improving"" every day, every hour, every minute, every moment. Lincolns and Churchills are not an exception, anyone and everyone can do their best in whatever they do. Everyone wants success and happiness

There are innumerable written and spoken words by motivational speakers, management gurus, and spiritual leaders about how to achieve success and happiness in life. They revolve around a variety of attributes like courage, confidence, concentration, education, enthusiasm, self-esteem, attitude, time management, the list can go on. The real learning starts at birth, at home and then at school. Character building also starts here. Abraham Lincoln's letter to his son's teacher is a testimony of parental anxiety for inculcating courage, honesty, integrity, sublime faith, in their children. Careers generally grow on this foundation. Excellence is hammered in young age with emphasis on ""examination marks"" in competition with others. Anything above 90 percent is considered excellent. First, second, and third rank is the criteria of superior performance. The question to be asked ought to be: Have you done your ""best""? Not the rank. Not the number of marks. Think of an Olympian. He/she works hard for 4 years trying to improve in those 1460 days (365 x 4). That does not mean that everyone will get gold. What matters is one's individual effort, competition with one's own self, not competition with others. Ask yourself: have I done my best? Martin Luther King, Jr. explains excellence beautifully thus: ""If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as a Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, 'Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well'. Aristotle expressed excellence in a slightly different way: ""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore is not an act, but a habit."" Start your journey of excellence

When, where, and how to start? Anytime, anywhere, the choice is yours. The society needs ""excellent physicists, excellent construction workers, excellent legislators, excellent first-grade teachers"". One may be brilliant, average, or mediocre in studies but everyone must strive for excellence in life skills. An often overlooked aspect of excellence is the right ""tools"" that we need to use to achieve excellence. Based on his own experiences in teaching , research, industry, management and, training, the present author has identified 5 core ""tools""/""skills"": positive attitude, communication skills (all the four, speaking, listening, reading, and writing), self-esteem, enthusiasm, and humility. If you have them, sharpen them, and if not, learn and practice them yourself or through coaching. This does not make other 'tools' less important. Remind yourself that learning is a life-long process. Develop passion for excellence

Excellence is a powerful word, it stirs mind. It cannot be thrust on anyone, like greatness can be. ""To achieve excellence, we must cultivate passion and trust"", say Tom Peters and Nancy Austin in their classic 'A Passion for Excellence' (1985). Passion for excellence is not free, it carries a price. The authors elaborate further: ""It is a personal commitment. Doing better than average takes tenacious preparation. You need courage and self-respect. It's believing that something can be done . The price of excellence is time, energy, attention, and focus. Excellence is a high cost item"".

A High Court bench issued a show cause notice to the managing societies of three schools asking why it should not order appropriate action against them, following a petition challenging their change of name mid-year from Presidium to Prudence.

In mid-November, The Indian Express had reported that three schools under the prominent Presidium franchise informed parents that they had chosen to disassociate from it due to financial irregularities. They stated that they would be known as 'Prudence' schools under the chairmanship of G S Matharoo, who was part of the management team of Presidium group.

A bench of Justice C Hari Shankar heard a petition by a group of parents, whose children study in the Dwarka Sector-22 branch of Prudence. The plea alleged the name change was done without following due process and that it jeopardised the future of students by running the risk of de-recognition by CBSE.

The parents have petitioned against the management societies of all three schools -- in Ashok Vihar, Dwarka Sector 16 and Dwarka Sector 22 -- stating that the name change had been affected in the middle of the academic year without prior notification or consultation with them.

In November, Education Minister Manish Sisodia had told The Indian Express that while a school cannot be compelled to remain part of a franchise, it requires government approval to do so and that no prior application had been received from the three schools.

The Prudence schools are now operating with a new logo, signboards, ID cards and uniforms. According to Matharoo, the change was instituted keeping the best interests of students in mind. He said the schools would file their response in court: ""Only the name has been changed, which was done through unanimous resolutions of all three managing societies due to financial malpractices by Presidium. Everything else remains the same... We submitted our proposal for name change to the Directorate of Education soon after the circular was sent to parents, and the proposal is currently being processed.""

The court re-notified the matter for February 2019, and gave the respondents four weeks to file a counter affidavit.

""We are examining the legal aspects of both the proposal and parents' complaints... and the validity and precedent for post-facto approval in such cases,"" said Director of Education Sanjay Goel."

Should business leaders spend more time asking questions? Hal Gregersen has a firm answer to that: Yes. Gregersen, the executive director of the MIT Leadership Center and a senior lecturer on leadership and innovation at the MIT Sloan School of Management, has been studying executives for decades. Time and again, he has noticed, the most successful managers are among the most inquisitive people in business. Now Gregersen has synthesized his observations on the subject in a new book, ""Questions Are the Answer: A Breakthrough Approach to Your Most Vexing Problems at Work and in Life,"" published by HarperCollins.

Acting on the complaint lodged by mandal education officer Leela Vathi at the Punganur police station, the cops registered a case against Bhuvaneswari and Naidu, and sent them to remand, said sub-inspector Arun Kumar Reddy.

Honorary president of Balala Hakkula Sangham Achyuta Rao had earlier brought the matter to the notice of the chairperson of the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, New Delhi. He wanted the commission to issue an order to initiate action under the POCSO (Protection of Childre n from Sexual Offences) Act.

Chittoor district educational officer K. Panduranga Swamy told Deccan Chronicle: ""It came to our notice that on Tuesday the school teacher punished some of the students of classes III and IV by letting them stand outside in the sun with bare bodies because they were late and had not done their homework. We immediately pressed the MEO to lodge a complaint at the local police station and ordered a thorough probe in the matter. We won't tolerate such inhumanity against the children and hence we have withdrawn recognition of the school and will take severe action against the school management.""

Minister for industries N. Amarnath Reddy has also instructed the district collector to withdraw recognition to the school.

Under the collector's direction, the DEO further released a statement, which reads: ""As a result of the negligent behaviour of the management, the boys left with bare bodies and this is a serious lapse on the part of the management which cannot be excused and thus attracted the provisions of Rules in GO Ms No. 1, dated 01.01.1994 and Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, 1988. Whereas, the school management behaved with total negligence in maintaining the safety of students and violated the provisions of rules governing the recognition of the private educational institutes and AP Education Act, 1994. Keeping in view of instructions of the HRD minister, we have withdrawn the permission and recognition granted to the school.'"

Image: Mexy Xavier

For Manoj Kumar, co-founder and CEO, Social Alpha, the idea of creating a startup ecosystem that would deliver social goals was always at the back of his mind. In 2013, while doing the Advanced Management Programme at Harvard Business School, he met R Venkataramanan, now the managing trustee of Tata Trusts. Somewhere, Venkataramanan's interests in philanthropy and Kumar's interest in entrepreneurship crossed paths. ""I asked myself what can be done to ensure that startups in the social sector remain sustainable?"" says Kumar.

In 2015, Tata Trusts set up the Foundation for Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship, branded as Social Alpha, to promote socially-relevant innovations and entrepreneurship. One of the first NGOs Social Alpha incubated was Hasiru Dala: It transformed the Bengaluru-based non-profit, which improves the lives of ragpickers through its waste management services, into a for-profit venture.

Social Alpha works with the idea that innovation, incubation and investment together can solve problems. Says Kumar, also head-innovation and entrepreneurship with Tata Trusts, ""Once you have innovated, one needs to check if it is validating the hypothesis and the best model to implement this innovation is entrepreneurship.""

In the commercial space, the lab-to-market ecosystem is well developed. But it is not the case in the social sector. Social Alpha handholds a startup through its entire lifecycle, from innovation to market-readiness. ""We look for innovators and entrepreneurs who are on a mission to create an impact, help them with incubation, lab access, market access, real estate solutions (they can work in our office) and most importantly we help them with seed capital,"" says Kumar.

As a technology business incubator, approved by the central government's department of science and technology, Social Alpha incubates in two ways: One, if the company is set up already, it is incubated as a startup; and for innovators or entrepreneurs with an idea, a programme called 'Entrepreneur in Residence'. ""While we handhold them through the innovation stage, we also help them understand how to set up a sustainable business,"" adds Kumar.

While venture capitalists do fund startups in the social sector, Social Alpha's focus is more philanthropic. ""Our priority is social impact, followed by financial sustainability and then scale. We co-create a milestone-based social impact plan with the founders and a business plan to support that impact plan,"" says Kumar. As of now it has 34 incubatees (of which they have invested in 26), with a mix of both for-profit and not-for-profit.

Says Manas Nanda, founder, Bubblenut Wash, ""There was a sense of empathy from Social Alpha [unlike other investors] for the cause and for the entrepreneur. As compared to a traditional VC or angel investor, Social Alpha was looking at 10-12 years when it came to getting money back. Apart from networking within the ecosystem, they helped us with grants from the government of India.""

Social Alpha has been working in sectors like waste management, education, sanitation, water, health care and energy access. Going forward, Kumar hopes to explore sectors such as medicine, vaccines and drugs. Some of the incubatees include Kitablet, Kamal Kisan, Bubblenut Wash, Innaumation, Farmveda and Aarna Biomedical Products.

What are the factors Kumar and his team look at before taking a startup on board? ""The first is the problem being addressed and what makes the idea stand out. This is followed by a technical evaluation and analysis of the company's business plan,"" says Kumar. The funding provided to each startup ranges from ₹10 lakh to ₹1 crore.

Till date, Social Alpha has invested $5 million. Besides, it helps the startups to raise funds. The initiative will continue to remain a not-for-profit but encourages incubatees to become for-profit so they can be self-sustainable. Philanthropy, says Kumar, is now redefining itself. ""We believe philanthropy is all about creating an ecosystem so that entrepreneurs and innovators can grow."""

Rao has also asked the Chittoor Superintendent of Police to register a tight case against the teachers, and school management personnel involved. The accused should be booked under the stringent provisions of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences (POSCO) Act.

The UN humanitarian coordination office, OCHA, is reporting that as of Wednesday, according to the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), 430 people are dead, 1,495 injured, and 159 are missing.

An estimated 22,000 people are displaced due to shelter damage and the latest tsunami alert. Damages include some 924 houses, 73 hotels and villas, 60 shops, 434 boats and 65 vehicles.

Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency warned that a new tsunami could affect the area surrounding the Anak Krakatau volcano in the Sunda Strait. Authorities are alerting people to stay up to one kilometre away from the coastal area.

The deadly tsunami is believed to have been triggered by an underwater landslide following a volcanic eruption on Saturday.

Wednesday marks the anniversary of 2004's deadly 26 December Indian Ocean quake and tsunami which killed more than 226,000 people in 13 countries, with Indonesia bearing the highest number of fatalities.

""Most survivors have been huddling in temporary shelters away from the shore, but have started to emerge to search for loved ones and assess damage to their property,"" says Arifin M Hadi, Head of Disaster Management at the Indonesian Red Cross.

More than 400 Red Cross staff and volunteers are reportedly delivering medical services and supplies to tsunami-ravaged villages. ""Our teams are seeing many broken bones and broken homes, and people who are very shaken,"" continued Mr Hadi. ""Indonesians have withstood a string of disasters this year and with them, so much loss and misery.""

Meanwhile, Jan Gelfand, head of UN partner agency, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), support office in Jakarta, pointed out that previous disaster responses illustrated the value of providing rapid treatment for the injured, ""not only to save lives, but also to prevent long-term health complications.""

""The Indonesian Red Cross's mobile medical teams are reaching remote and hard-to-reach areas to treat people who haven't had help since Saturday,"" he explained.

On Tuesday, IFRC announced that it was releasing more than $333,583 from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to replenish relief items and enable the Indonesian Red Cross to ramp up medical care, psychosocial support, sanitation services and the distribution of clean water for an estimated 7,000 people in affected areas.

Since the December 2004 tsunami, Indonesian Red Cross staff and volunteers have received extensive disaster preparedness and response training, with volunteers in the weekend's hardest hit Banten province, having conducted tsunami awareness and response exercises with at-risk communities only two months ago.

For its part, UNICEF Indonesia is providing targeted assistance through bed-nets and school sanitation kits, as well as technical assistance on nutrition and child protection in the aftermath of the disaster.

UN agencies, the Government and other humanitarian partners are still working together to support ongoing humanitarian efforts for the earthquake and tsunami that struck Lombok and Central Sulawesi provinces in late September, focused on the city of Palu."

The UN recognised the Prime Minister in the Policy Leadership category for his bold environmental leadership on the global stage. His pioneering work in championing the International Solar Alliance where the country heralded a global coalition of nations to tackle climate change by leveraging the power of solar energy which has been lauded globally. Some of the major highlights of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in the year 2018 are outlined below:-

World Environment Day:

Considering India's global leadership in environmental protection and climate change sectors, the UNEP had chosen India to be the global host for World Environment Day (WED) on 5 June, 2018.

The main event was organized in Delhi and included a series of conferences in Vigyan Bhawan, a mega exhibition in Rajpath Lawns behind Vigyan Bhawan and the concluding event was graced by the Hon'ble Prime Minister and dignitaries from UN also attended the event. This WED, 2018 focused on ""Plastic Pollution"" which is one of the most challenging environmental concerns today.

Green Good Deeds Campaign:

Green Good Deeds, the societal movement launched by the Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr Harsh Vardhan to protect environment and promote good living in the country, has earned worldwide accolades.

""Green Good Deeds"" is an idea to take environmental awareness to the people and get them involved. Formally launched in January 2018, the campaign lauds small positive actions performed by individuals or organisations to strengthen the cause of environmental protection. The Ministry has drawn up a list of over 600 Green Good Deeds and asked people to alter their behaviour to Green Good Behaviour to fulfill their Green Social Responsibility. These small, positive actions, to be performed by individuals or organisation to strengthen the cause of environmental protection have been enlisted on a mobile App called Dr Harsh Vardhan App.

Students under Eco-clubs are implementing the Green Good Deeds (GGDs) initiative which seeks to transform the people's behaviour into Green Good Behaviour and fulfil Green Social Responsibility. A ten point agenda has been developed to implement the GGDs through Nodal agencies in State/UTs implementing the Ecoclub programme. Various activities covered under GGDs like cleanliness drives within the school campus, carry out waste segregation into biodegradable and non-biodegradable, paper re-cycling and conducting tree plantation drives etc are being implemented across the country by the students. The green attitude is visible in their actions. Further GREEN GOOD DEEDS event was successfully organised on 6.10.2018 at India International Science Festival (IISF) 2018 held at Indira Gandhi Prathishthan, Lucknow. Event was inaugurated by Dr. A.K. Mehta Additional Secretary, MoEFCC. Exhibition showcasing the success stories under Ecoclub programme. Around 200 Ecoclub students from Uttar Pradesh participated in the Drawing and Essay competitions.

In order to skill youth in environment, forest and wildlife sectors and enable them to be gainfully employed/ self-employed, MoEF&CC launched a Green Skill Development Programme (GSDP) in June, 2017 on a pilot basis. The programme is now being scaled to an all India level. More than 30 skilling programmes are being conducted during 2018-19, covering diverse fields-pollution monitoring (air/ water/ soil), STP/ETP/CETP operation, waste management, forest management, water budgeting & auditing, conservation of river dolphins, wildlife management, para taxonomy, including PBRs, mangroves conservation, bamboo management and livelihood generation.

During 2018-19 from August till date, 944 candidates have successfully completed the different skilling courses. Currently, 568 candidates are enrolled in various ongoing courses. The objective of creating a pool of Master Trainers during 2018-19 is also being met as 283 of the successful trainees have offered to be Master Trainers, who would skill more youth across the country in various skill sets, related to environment, forest and wildlife. A mobile app giving information about the training programme being conducted under GSDP, list of the Institutes offering these programme and other details has been also launched.

Reclassification of Bamboo & Removal from Category of Tree:

The Government of India has made concerted efforts to promote bamboo cultivation right from enabling regulatory provision, to supporting the bamboo plantation on a large scale by launching newly restructured National Bamboo Mission with a budget outlay of Rs 1290 crore.

The amendment in Indian Forest Act, 1927, will facilitate the inter-state movement of bamboo, as there will be no requirement of permit during transit from one State to another. It will ultimately result in reducing the gap of availability of resources from bamboo-surplus states to bamboo-deficit states. As a result, both producers and consumers will be benefitted.

The Climate Change Division of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) looks after the issues related to climate change including the international negotiations and domestic policies and actions. India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Paris Agreement and Kyoto Protocol. The Division is also responsible for submission of National Communications (NATCOMs) and the Biennial Update Reports (BURs) to UNFCCC. Several domestic programmes/ schemes have been initiated in the recent years for addressing climate change. Some key initiatives include the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC), Climate Change Action Programme (CCAP) and State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) among others. In order to create and strengthen the scientific and analytical capacity for assessment of climate change in the country, different studies have also been initiated under CCAP.

During the year 2018, many important bilateral and multilateral meetings and negotiations on climate change were held in the run up to the 24 Conference of the Parties to UNFCCC (COP-24), in which Hon'ble Minister, EF&CC and senior officials of the Ministry participated. The Ministry hosted international meetings of the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) on 1 and 2 November 2018 and BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) countries on 19 -20 November 2018. The meeting has helped in strengthening and securing common interest and positions of the developing countries in the run up to COP-24 to the UNFCCC.

Twenty Fourth Conference of Parties (COP-24) in Katowice, Poland was successful in adopting Paris Agreement Work Programme. The conference was significant one which focused on other key issues including the conclusion of 2018 Facilitative Talanoa Dialogue and the stocktake of Pre-2020 actions implementation and ambition. India engaged positively and constructively in all the negotiations while protecting India's key interests including recognition of different starting points of developed and developing countries; flexibilities for developing countries and consideration of principles including equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC). India re-affirmed its commitment to multilateralism and international cooperation and its image has undergone a positive change

An India Pavilion was also setup during Twenty Fourth Conference of Parties (COP 24) of UNFCCC held in Katowice, Poland from December 3 to 14, 2018. The theme of pavilion this year was 'One World One Sun One Grid' based on an ambitious target set by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during the first assembly of the International Solar Alliance on October 2018 that 40 percent of its installed power capacity will be from non-fossil fuels by 2030. Eminent dignitaries from the other participating countries of Japan, Qatar, Austria, Maldives, UK and the host country Poland visited the India Pavilion and gave remarkable feedback. The India Pavilion also became a platform to bring together 43 different stakeholder institutions including Central Ministries, State Governments/ Departments, Think Tanks, Civil Society Organisations, etc. to showcase their climate change action taken in various sectors through 20 side events. A footfall of about 14-15,000 people at India pavilion during the course of COP-24.

In 2018, under National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC), a total amount of Rs. 42.16 crore has been released to seven (07) ongoing projects to support adaptation activities in Rajasthan, Sikkim, H.P., Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Manipur and Kerala. Till date 27 projects (including one regional project) have been approved at a total cost of Rs. 673.63 crore and Rs. 369 crore have been sanctioned.

Under Climate Change Action Programme (CCAP) scheme, a total amount of Rs. 2.15 crore has been released for capacity building in Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland, Telangana and two demonstration projects in Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh respectively. Ministry is also implementing two scientific programmes under CCAP namely, National Carbonaceous Aerosols Programme (NCAP) and Long Term Ecological Observatories (LTEO).

India will be submitting its Second Biennial Update Report (BUR) to UNFCCC in late December 2018 to comply with the reporting obligations under the convention. The report among others, contains information on the national GHG inventory for the year 2014.

They were produced before a court and let-off on bail after the hearing. Police identified three of the accused -- Manoj Kumar, Gupta and Likith -- all residents of Bengaluru.

Last Friday, the four staffers had allegedly beaten up Vijay Kumar, a resident of Srirampura and an SSLC student at a private school in Rajajinagar. The boy had gone alone to the second floor of Mantri Square Mall on Sampige Road to play games, and after a while, when his phone battery ran out of charge, he went around looking for a power socket to charge it. Some customers who were on the same floor, had also kept their mobile phones at the charging point.

The guards, who noticed the boy loitering near the charging point, suspected him to be a mobile thief and started slapping him.Even as he tried to explain that he was only looking for a charging point, they bundled him to the cellar and assaulted him with wooden logs and electric wires for over an hour. After this alleged torture at their hands, a bewildered Vijay was forcibly ejected from the premises.

Following the complaint by his father Anand, who works at a garment store, the police issued notice to the mall management and subsequently arrested the four men.""They admitted to having assaulted the boy. They said that other customers caught the boy and handed him over to them, saying he was trying to steal mobiles,"" police added."

Lever had said, ""I believe that nothing can be greater than a business, however small it may be, that is governed by conscience; and that nothing can be meaner or pettier than a business however large, governed without honesty and without brotherhood."" The group's ""legacy of doing well by doing good"" elevates it effortlessly to the position of sectoral leader in BW Businessworld's list of the Most Respected Companies of 2018 in the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) segment.

With net sales of Rs 34,530 crore (on gross revenue of Rs 35,218 crore) and an EBITDA (earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation) of Rs 7,276 crore, Hindustan Unilever is without doubt a market leader in the FMCG horizon in India. In the 2017-18 financial year HUL's cash from operations was Rs 8,000 crore, an increase of Rs 1,369 crores over the previous fiscal. At HUL, integrated e-tendering, smart inventory modelling, digital factory, smart robotics and an efficient fulfilment centre are technological buzzwords.

Hindustan Unilever's earnings are slated to get a boost with the proposed merger with GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Limited (GSKCH). The amalgamation of Hindustan Unilever and GSKCH has recently been approved by the HUL Board of Directors. The scheme approved will entail the existing shareholders 4.39 shares of HUL for every share in GSKCH India, valuing the total business at Rs 31,700 crore, subject to requisite approvals from statutory authorities and shareholders.

Some of the milestones in Hindustan Unilever's list of achievements include the company's beverage factory in Kolkata receiving the prestigious Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) National Food Safety Award 2017 for outstanding achievements in food safety. Hindustan Unilever's Puducherry Home & Personal Care (HPC) factory secured the second place at the CII's Southern Region Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) Excellence Awards 2017 in the 'Manufacturing - Others' category.

Responding to queries at the annual investors' meet, Sanjiv Mehta outlined strategies for Hindustan Unilever's strategy for specialised markets. He said, ""We also know how to build a small brand and make it mighty. The question is, when HUL grows a small brand into a Rs 1,000 crore brand, it doesn't receive as much focus as a player who is very small and creates a niche property of Rs 200 crore. We wish them well. Many times they open up new segments.""

Hindustan Unilever has often been called a 'Leadership Factory'. At last count, the company had unleashed 500 leaders into the corporate world. The company's leadership practices have ensured that it is the 'No1 Employer of Choice' for business school students for seven consecutive years in a row. The company does not lag behind in the sphere of social responsibility either. Hindustan Unilever has embraced the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP), which contributes to activities listed in the Schedule VII of Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013.

The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan aims to achieve three big goals globally - improve the health and well-being of more than a billion people, reduce the environmental impact of making and using its products and enhance the livelihood of millions of people.

The Lifebuoy hand-washing programme reaches out to more than 67 million people. In keeping with the Swachh Bharat Mission, Hindustan Unilever impacted the lives of more than 1.1 million people through the Domex toilet academy. It has also been able to reduce waste from manufacturing by more than 52 per cent in 2017. Project Shakti for women's empowerment has created some 80,000 entrepreneurs.

""HUL believes that a gender balanced workforce is essential to run a sustainable business,"" says Mehta. ""The company,"" Mehta says, ""has achieved 39 per cent gender diversity in management positions through consistent efforts towards building a strong talent pipeline of high potential women leaders, nurturing their career aspirations, providing excellent parental support and flexible working options and creating a truly inclusive work environment where they can bring their best selves to work."""

Features & Comparison | iGyaan Network","iGyaan Network",FALSE,"Gaming smartphones were fringe products till about two or three years back and have recently come into the limelight. A few years ago, smartphone research and development was going mostly into making the screens larger and better, increasing speeds for day-to-day work and increasing battery life. But since then a lot has changed, and phones have become even more powerful. Now, phones can support games that have high-end graphics and can run them without harming the CPU or the battery of the phones. However, there are certain drawbacks to buying and using gaming phones as well. In this article we will discuss the positives as well as the negatives of buying a gaming phone.

Gaming smartphones are phones that are primarily built with a focus on gaming and are modified to suit gamers' needs. They are usually higher-end phones with great batteries, more than decent RAM and memory and a number of other specifications like liquid cooling and overclocked CPUs. We will talk about these differences later in the article.

To understand how the trend started, we have to go a long way back to the time feature phones were a thing, maybe even before that. The history of Gaming as we know it can be traced back to the first interactive electronic game with an electronic display in 1947, the first true video games in the early 1950s, and the rise of early arcade video games in the 1970s. The first portable video game was introduced in the form of the Handy Game created by Epyx in 1987. This device later turned into the Atari Lynx in 1989. Portable gaming consoles these days include Sony's PSP, Playstation Vita and Nintendo Switch. Portable video game consoles were all the rage when they first came to the market a few years back. Every college or school kid had one and buying or trading games were considered a common phenomenon.

However, when gaming consoles were selling like hotcakes, smartphone manufacturers were brewing up a storm. Video games however, weren't new and had existed on phones for a long time. The first mobile phone game was introduced in 1994, with a pre-installed Tetris on a mobile phone called Hagenuk MT-2000. In 1997 however, things changed a lot for the mobile phone gaming industry when Nokia decided to redesign a game called Snake and put it in some of their phones. The game became widely popular and thus started a long and arduous journey towards the marriage of a telephonic device and a gaming device. The smartphones of today with their high-end games would not have been possible without these companies and their gamble into gaming.

We often get asked why one should consider buying a gaming phone and not buy a high or similarly specced top-end smartphone. There are both positives as well as negatives to buying a gaming phone. Let's discuss the positives first.

Overclocking is the process of increasing a computer's clock rate to make it run at a higher speed than it is supposed to. The term overclocking is usually used with regard to CPU and GPU but can be applied for other components as well. Most smartphones are under-clocked because, even though their CPU may support higher speeds, the phone might overheat and die. Most phones do not have a decent cooling system in place because our day-to-day functions on a smartphone do not generate so much heat. Overclocking generates a lot of heat as the CPU performs more tasks per second thus requiring better cooling. This brings us to our next point.

Most computers use two types of cooling to keep the system at an optimum temperature. These are heat sinks and liquid cooling. But phones cannot really use a heat sink as phones need to be thin and light and everything from a battery to a motherboard and cameras need to be cramped in there. So gaming phones use heat pipes and liquid cooling instead. But most other phones have no cooling systems and use the metallic or aluminium back to dissipate heat. How this works is when the CPU heats up, the back of the phone heats up.

The air outside is generally cooler than the phone, which absorbs the heat from the back of the phone. So, in short, gaming phones have a better and faster cooling system in place. These cooling systems are much more efficient in dissipating heat and will keep your phone cool while the phone performs at a much higher speed.

Gaming phones, since they are generally built for performance draw a lot of battery. Thus, these phones need a lot of juice to keep running. Generally speaking, gaming phones have better batteries compared to other top end smartphones. While many lower end phones may match the same battery capacity, the gaming phones do indeed work for longer as they have optimised performance in terms of the screen and CPU drawing from the battery.

Gaming phones have certain RAM optimisations through software that help the phone perform at it's optimal best. This is done by better memory management. RAM optimisation enables a phone to clear up the RAM by killing unwanted Apps so that the gaming experience is unhindered.

Since these phones are made specifically for gaming, these are built from ground up. keeping the quirks of gaming in mind. For example, the Asus ROG Phone has a headphone jack both at the bottom of the phone as well as on the side of the phone. This allows a gamer to play games in the horizontal mode using two hands while charging the phone. There are several such modifications on gaming phones that make a gamer's life much easier.

Many high end phones these days have really good screens. Many have AMOLED displays or retina displays. But the gaming phones have an extra feature that in terms of the refresh rate. A refresh rate is the rate an LCD or LED panel changes a frame. It is calculated in frames per second (fps) and a higher refresh rate is extremely helpful for gamers since the images change faster compared to other screens giving gamers the extra edge to kill and spot enemies faster than others. Many gaming phones have a refresh rate of 120 Hz while normal smartphones usually have a refresh rate of 60 Hz.

High Quality Speakers

Gaming requires really great quality speakers. A good speaker can give you an immersive experience in gaming. Gaming smartphones usually feature great speakers with HD sound, dolby digital sound or Dolby Atmos stereo speakers. Some of these phones have great amplifiers as well.

Most high-end phones have a decent amount of RAM. For example, the latest iPhone XS has 4GB of RAM while the flagship Samsung Galaxy S9 has 4GB RAM. However, most gaming phones these days offer upto 10 GB of RAM. This makes day-to-day functions faster as well, apart from gaming of course!

Added Accessories

Gaming phones come with accessories that can be used to make the gaming experience better. These include extra battery packs, phone coolers, additional headphone jacks and more. These accessories might be expensive but they are quite helpful and can elevate your gaming experience overall.

So what gives? If gaming phones are so good then why isn't everyone buying it instead of a top end smartphone? Well, in making these high end hardware and software changes, the phone companies sacrifice other features. Let's find out what the negatives are.

Most gaming phones are not meant for taking photos or selfies, so their cameras are usually not that great. Many of the budget gaming phones usually sacrifice image quality by reducing the camera specifications. For example the Xiaomi Black Shark has a 20 Megapixel front camera but has a 12 megapixel and 20 megapixel back camera but the ZTE Nubia Red Magic has a single 24 megapixel sensor at the back. Even though the cameras are not bad, but compared to top of the line smartphones in the same price range, the image quality falls flat.

Bulky

These phones have a lot of modifications done in order to make it gaming friendly. These modifications take up space thus making these phones heavy and large. These are nowhere near the sleek smartphones that we see and use everyday and may feel like a brick at times. But it also sets you apart from the similarly designed phones that we see everyday. These phones have a dash of colour, look menacing and usually have glowing lights in the back. If you are a fan of sleek smartphones, gaming phones probably aren't for you.

These phones are specced to the brim and because of that, are expensive. They can be priced anywhere between $ 400 to $ 800 and are quite expensive. It is also to be noted that phones with similar specifications from manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung can go way above that reaching prices as high as $ 1500.

Delayed Software Updates

Gaming smartphones are generally not known for speedy software updates and OS updates. Since these phones have their own UI to make the phone look more like a gaming device, these UI changes take time for the company to implement on a new OS. This can be a hassle for people who like to get timely security and software updates.

Now that we have discussed both the positives and the negatives, here is a list of the best gaming phones available in the market that you can consider to buy:"

The District Educational Officer (DEO) of Chittoor, Dr K Panduranga Swamy, told International Business Times, India: ""An investigation is underway and as the school management has violated the child rights, the registration of the school will be cancelled from the year 2019-2020.""

""The district collector has also been informed about the seriousness of the issue and stringent actions will be taken against the management and principal of the school, Nagaraju,"" he added.

This is not the first such incident in the state. In 2015, a teacher of a private school in Eluru in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh had thrashed a girl student of class 1 and made her sit on a stone, naked in the hot sun, as a punishment for not doing homework.

In the same year, another teacher from a government school in Bheemunipatnam Mandal, Vishakapatanam, asked two students to remove their shirt and stand under the sun for three hours, as a punishment for not doing the homework."

For half a century, the Stanford computer scientist Donald Knuth, who bears a slight resemblance to Yoda -- albeit standing 6-foot-4 and wearing glasses -- has reigned as the spirit-guide of the algorithmic realm.

He is the author of ""The Art of Computer Programming,"" a continuing four-volume opus that is his life's work. The first volume debuted in 1968, and the collected volumes (sold as a boxed set for about $250) were included by American Scientist in 2013 on its list of books that shaped the last century of science -- alongside a special edition of ""The Autobiography of Charles Darwin,"" Tom Wolfe's ""The Right Stuff,"" Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring"" and monographs by Albert Einstein, John von Neumann and Richard Feynman.

With more than one million copies in print, ""The Art of Computer Programming"" is the Bible of its field. ""Like an actual bible, it is long and comprehensive; no other book is as comprehensive,"" said Peter Norvig, a director of research at Google. After 652 pages, volume one closes with a blurb on the back cover from Bill Gates: ""You should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole thing.""

The volume opens with an excerpt from ""McCall's Cookbook"":

Here is your book, the one your thousands of letters have asked us to publish. It has taken us years to do, checking and rechecking countless recipes to bring you only the best, only the interesting, only the perfect.

Inside are algorithms, the recipes that feed the digital age -- although, as Dr. Knuth likes to point out, algorithms can also be found on Babylonian tablets from 3,800 years ago. He is an esteemed algorithmist; his name is attached to some of the field's most important specimens, such as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string-searching algorithm. Devised in 1970, it finds all occurrences of a given word or pattern of letters in a text -- for instance, when you hit Command+F to search for a keyword in a document.

Now 80, Dr. Knuth usually dresses like the youthful geek he was when he embarked on this odyssey: long-sleeved T-shirt under a short-sleeved T-shirt, with jeans, at least at this time of year. In those early days, he worked close to the machine, writing ""in the raw,"" tinkering with the zeros and ones.

""Knuth made it clear that the system could actually be understood all the way down to the machine code level,"" said Dr. Norvig. Nowadays, of course, with algorithms masterminding (and undermining) our very existence, the average programmer no longer has time to manipulate the binary muck, and works instead with hierarchies of abstraction, layers upon layers of code -- and often with chains of code borrowed from code libraries. But an elite class of engineers occasionally still does the deep dive.

""Here at Google, sometimes we just throw stuff together,"" Dr. Norvig said, during a meeting of the Google Trips team, in Mountain View, Calif. ""But other times, if you're serving billions of users, it's important to do that efficiently. A 10-per-cent improvement in efficiency can work out to billions of dollars, and in order to get that last level of efficiency, you have to understand what's going on all the way down.""

Or, as Andrei Broder, a distinguished scientist at Google and one of Dr. Knuth's former graduate students, explained during the meeting: ""We want to have some theoretical basis for what we're doing. We don't want a frivolous or sloppy or second-rate algorithm. We don't want some other algorithmist to say, 'You guys are morons.'""

The Google Trips app, created in 2016, is an ""orienteering algorithm"" that maps out a day's worth of recommended touristy activities. The team was working on ""maximizing the quality of the worst day"" -- for instance, avoiding sending the user back to the same neighborhood to see different sites. They drew inspiration from a 300-year-old algorithm by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who wanted to map a route through the Prussian city of Königsberg that would cross each of its seven bridges only once. Dr. Knuth addresses Euler's classic problem in the first volume of his treatise. (He once applied Euler's method in coding a computer-controlled sewing machine.)

Following Dr. Knuth's doctrine helps to ward off moronry. He is known for introducing the notion of ""literate programming,"" emphasizing the importance of writing code that is readable by humans as well as computers -- a notion that nowadays seems almost twee. Dr. Knuth has gone so far as to argue that some computer programs are, like Elizabeth Bishop's poems and Philip Roth's ""American Pastoral,"" works of literature worthy of a Pulitzer.

He is also a notorious perfectionist. Randall Munroe, the xkcd cartoonist and author of ""Thing Explainer,"" first learned about Dr. Knuth from computer-science people who mentioned the reward money Dr. Knuth pays to anyone who finds a mistake in any of his books. As Mr. Munroe recalled, ""People talked about getting one of those checks as if it was computer science's Nobel Prize.""

Dr. Knuth's exacting standards, literary and otherwise, may explain why his life's work is nowhere near done. He has a wager with Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google and a former student (to use the term loosely), over whether Mr. Brin will finish his Ph.D. before Dr. Knuth concludes his opus.

The dawn of the algorithm

At age 19, Dr. Knuth published his first technical paper, ""The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures,"" in Mad magazine. He became a computer scientist before the discipline existed, studying mathematics at what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He looked at sample programs for the school's IBM 650 mainframe, a decimal computer, and, noticing some inadequacies, rewrote the software as well as the textbook used in class. As a side project, he ran stats for the basketball team, writing a computer program that helped them win their league -- and earned a segment by Walter Cronkite called ""The Electronic Coach.""

During summer vacations, Dr. Knuth made more money than professors earned in a year by writing compilers. A compiler is like a translator, converting a high-level programming language (resembling algebra) to a lower-level one (sometimes arcane binary) and, ideally, improving it in the process. In computer science, ""optimization"" is truly an art, and this is articulated in another Knuthian proverb: ""Premature optimization is the root of all evil.""

Eventually Dr. Knuth became a compiler himself, inadvertently founding a new field that he came to call the ""analysis of algorithms."" A publisher hired him to write a book about compilers, but it evolved into a book collecting everything he knew about how to write for computers -- a book about algorithms.

""By the time of the Renaissance, the origin of this word was in doubt,"" it began. ""And early linguists attempted to guess at its derivation by making combinations like algiros [painful] + arithmos [number].'"" In fact, Dr. Knuth continued, the namesake is the 9th-century Persian textbook author Abū 'Abd Allāh Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, Latinized as Algorithmi. Never one for half measures, Dr. Knuth went on a pilgrimage in 1979 to al-Khwārizmī's ancestral homeland in Uzbekistan.

When Dr. Knuth started out, he intended to write a single work. Soon after, computer science underwent its Big Bang, so he reimagined and recast the project in seven volumes. Now he metes out sub-volumes, called fascicles. The next installation, ""Volume 4, Fascicle 5,"" covering, among other things, ""backtracking"" and ""dancing links,"" was meant to be published in time for Christmas. It is delayed until next April because he keeps finding more and more irresistible problems that he wants to present.

In order to optimize his chances of getting to the end, Dr. Knuth has long guarded his time. He retired at 55, restricted his public engagements and quit email (officially, at least). Andrei Broder recalled that time management was his professor's defining characteristic even in the early 1980s.

Dr. Knuth typically held student appointments on Friday mornings, until he started spending his nights in the lab of John McCarthy, a founder of artificial intelligence, to get access to the computers when they were free. Horrified by what his beloved book looked like on the page with the advent of digital publishing, Dr. Knuth had gone on a mission to create the TeX computer typesetting system, which remains the gold standard for all forms of scientific communication and publication. Some consider it Dr. Knuth's greatest contribution to the world, and the greatest contribution to typography since Gutenberg.

This decade-long detour took place back in the age when computers were shared among users and ran faster at night while most humans slept. So Dr. Knuth switched day into night, shifted his schedule by 12 hours and mapped his student appointments to Fridays from 8 p.m. to midnight. Dr. Broder recalled, ""When I told my girlfriend that we can't do anything Friday night because Friday night at 10 I have to meet with my adviser, she thought, 'This is something that is so stupid it must be true.'""

When Knuth chooses to be physically present, however, he is 100-per-cent there in the moment. ""It just makes you happy to be around him,"" said Jennifer Chayes, a managing director of Microsoft Research. ""He's a maximum in the community. If you had an optimization function that was in some way a combination of warmth and depth, Don would be it.""

Dr. Knuth discussing typefaces with Hermann Zapf, the type designer. Many consider Dr. Knuth's work on the TeX computer typesetting system to be the greatest contribution to typography since Gutenberg.

Sunday with the algorithmist

Dr. Knuth lives in Stanford, and allowed for a Sunday visitor. That he spared an entire day was exceptional -- usually his availability is ""modulo nap time,"" a sacred daily ritual from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. He started early, at Palo Alto's First Lutheran Church, where he delivered a Sunday school lesson to a standing-room-only crowd. Driving home, he got philosophical about mathematics.

""I'll never know everything,"" he said. ""My life would be a lot worse if there was nothing I knew the answers about, and if there was nothing I didn't know the answers about."" Then he offered a tour of his ""California modern"" house, which he and his wife, Jill, built in 1970. His office is littered with piles of U.S.B. sticks and adorned with Valentine's Day heart art from Jill, a graphic designer. Most impressive is the music room, built around his custom-made, 812-pipe pipe organ. The day ended over beer at a puzzle party.

Puzzles and games -- and penning a novella about surreal numbers, and composing a 90-minute multimedia musical pipe-dream, ""Fantasia Apocalyptica"" -- are the sorts of things that really tickle him. One section of his book is titled, ""Puzzles Versus the Real World."" He emailed an excerpt to the father-son team of Martin Demaine, an artist, and Erik Demaine, a computer scientist, both at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, because Dr. Knuth had included their ""algorithmic puzzle fonts.""

""I was thrilled,"" said Erik Demaine. ""It's an honor to be in the book."" He mentioned another Knuth quotation, which serves as the inspirational motto for the biannual ""FUN with Algorithms"" conference: ""Pleasure has probably been the main goal all along.""

But then, Dr. Demaine said, the field went and got practical. Engineers and scientists and artists are teaming up to solve real-world problems -- protein folding, robotics, airbags -- using the Demaines's mathematical origami designs for how to fold paper and linkages into different shapes.

Of course, all the algorithmic rigmarole is also causing real-world problems. Algorithms written by humans -- tackling harder and harder problems, but producing code embedded with bugs and biases -- are troubling enough. More worrisome, perhaps, are the algorithms that are not written by humans, algorithms written by the machine, as it learns.

Programmers still train the machine, and, crucially, feed it data. (Data is the new domain of biases and bugs, and here the bugs and biases are harder to find and fix). However, as Kevin Slavin, a research affiliate at M.I.T.'s Media Lab said, ""We are now writing algorithms we cannot read. That makes this a unique moment in history, in that we are subject to ideas and actions and efforts by a set of physics that have human origins without human comprehension."" As Slavin has often noted, ""It's a bright future, if you're an algorithm.""

All the more so if you're an algorithm versed in Knuth. ""Today, programmers use stuff that Knuth, and others, have done as components of their algorithms, and then they combine that together with all the other stuff they need,"" said Google's Dr. Norvig.

""With A.I., we have the same thing. It's just that the combining-together part will be done automatically, based on the data, rather than based on a programmer's work. You want A.I. to be able to combine components to get a good answer based on the data. But you have to decide what those components are. It could happen that each component is a page or chapter out of Knuth, because that's the best possible way to do some task.""

Lucky, then, Dr. Knuth keeps at it. He figures it will take another 25 years to finish ""The Art of Computer Programming,"" although that time frame has been a constant since about 1980. Might the algorithm-writing algorithms get their own chapter, or maybe a page in the epilogue? ""Definitely not,"" said Dr. Knuth.

""I am worried that algorithms are getting too prominent in the world,"" he added. ""It started out that computer scientists were worried nobody was listening to us. Now I'm worried that too many people are listening."""

President JKJCCPS Showkat M Chowdhary said the Fee Fixation Committee, as per the High Court Directions, approves the fee for a full calendar year and not on monthly basis.

He said the schools submit all the documents, income and expenses attested by Chartered Accountant, undertakings and declarations to the Fee Fixation Committee on the basis of which the fee is fixed.

""The private schools hire staff on yearly basis who are provided salary and provident funds for full year. No school hires staff as daily wagers. Accordingly, the schools charge tuition for full calendar year. The schools also make it sure that the teachers and other staff are paid properly. They also upgrade its infrastructure and other facilities on regular basis in an effort to impart quality education to the students so that they can compete not only at state or national level but at international level.""

About the transportation charges, JKJCCPS said the private schools charge for only 10 months even though they provide salary to the drivers and conductors for full year.

""Besides other charges including road tax, insurances are also borne by the schools for 12 months and there is no exemption from any authority or company to schools for the school buses during winter months. The schools only save fuel during the winter months on the basis of which only 10 months transportation fee is charged from the parents.""

JKJCCPS said transport facilities are provided to the students on no profit no loss basis.

""This facility is for the smooth transportation of the students so that they reach the schools and return back home on fixed times. It is neither prudent to say that schools will ply buses on losses.""

JKJCCPS said it is not mandatory for the parents to avail transport facility. ""If parents feel the transport is not viable, they can opt out of this facility and drop the students at schools on their own.""

It said the Coordination Committee has already given clear-cut instructions to the schools not to charge arbitrarily or make unnecessarily charges.

""We have also urged parents to register their complaints with the Coordination Committee for its prompt redressal.""

JKJCCPS urged parents no to resort to media trails instead seek better education for the wards.

""In today's modern world when competition is very high for the students, parents should exhort upon the school management to further upgrade infrastructure in terms of latest teaching aids and other facilities which should be integral part of class room.""

JKJCCPS further urged parents' association to sit with coordination committee over the issue and clear doubts, if any, regarding the fee charged from the students.

""We believe that media trials will serve no purpose but only hamper the school functioning and derail our effort to impart quality education. We will also like to invite media for open discussion and clear any doubts on the matter so that we focus on providing quality education to the students and help parents lay a strong foundation of their children."""

According to K Arunachalam, general secretary of the ANSPA, they had sent a complaint to the DIOS regarding six private schools, namely Apeejay School, Somervillle School, Amity International School, Delhi Public School, Noida, Cambridge School and Bal Bharti School, for increasing fees in an alleged arbitrary manner.

""Although we have received information regarding two schools agreeing to roll back hiked fees, they have not done it yet. If schools really intend to adjust the hiked amount with the future fees, they have to do it in the next quarter. It has been four months since the Act has been enforced, however, no private school has followed it yet,"" Arunachalam said.

On November 3, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar had held a meet with principals of all private schools in the district and asked them to decided their fee structure as per the newly regulated Act and upload it on their school's website within a week's time.

Reacting to allegations of inaction by the district fee regulatory committee, Upadhyay said, ""We will decide in the next committee meeting on schools which do not follow the fees Act.""

However, Asha Prabhakar, principal of Bal Bharti School, denied claims made by the DIOS.

""We had already returned the hiked fees to parents in July this year. The ordinance came in April and we were told to roll back hiked fees. There was a rise of ₹7,000 in the first quarter and we returned the amount in the second quarter fees. The claims of DIOS that Bal Bharti School has agreed to roll back fees now only is untrue,"" Prabhakar said.

The management of the Cambridge School could not be contacted at the time of this report going to publication."

You have a lot to gain when you embrace failure as a means to generate learning, growth, and innovation, as explained in the insightful book, The Other ""F"" Word: How Smart Leaders, Teams and Entrepreneurs Put Failure to Work by John Danner and Mark Coopersmith.

John Danner is a management consultant with extensive experience in industry and government, and teaches at UC Berkeley and Princeton. Mark Coopersmith has worked in the startup and corporate sectors, and is a Senior Fellow at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.

The 19 chapters are spread across 258 pages and are written in conversational style, with plenty of frameworks, tools, examples, and even humour. The online companion offers resources and tools such as the Failure Value Report Card. I have summarised some of my key takeaways below; see also my reviews of the six related books Adapt, The Up Side of Down, The Wisdom of Failure, Fail Better, Fail Fast, and Failing to Succeed.

The authors define failure as ""mistakes and unwelcome outcomes that matter"". This includes intentional experiments as well as unpredictable external events. Some are caused by error and carelessness others are the result of experiments and exploration, while still others are caused by accidents. They vary in terms of frequency, impact, and predictability.

Failure is personal and emotional, and can cause pain, fear, shame, guilt, depression, isolation, and embarrassment. In organisations, failure can lead to denial, retaliation, scapegoating and a blame game; for some employees, it can even lead to job loss, denied promotion, damaged reputation, and stigmatisation. ""Its memory lingers and deepens our fear of failure going forward,"" the authors explain.

Many organisations penalise, ignore, rationalise or cover up failure. Failure is also referred to variously as defeat, collapse, mistake, loss, misstep, blind alley, bungle, flop, fiasco, mess, disaster, or screw-up.

But the authors argue that failure can actually be harnessed as a source of strategic advantage by startups, SMEs and corporates, provided leaders adopt the right perspective and create the right kind of culture. It is important to realistically confront failure and manager it rationally.

""Although no one likes to fail, truly successful leaders know how to turn a bad experience from a regret into a resource. They put failure to work, driving innovation, strengthening genuine collaboration, and accelerating growth in their organisations,"" the authors begin.

""You can use the inherent power of failure to inform, teach, and inspire your organisation to lift its own level of performance,"" they urge. Failure has subjective and objective connotations, depending on aims, standards, expectations, and frames of reference.

Some failures are losses while others are acceptable defeats. The definitions of failure can vary within the organisation, so it helps to begin by checking how you and your colleagues define failure, cite examples of past failure, and what lessons have been learned from them.

Though failure is everywhere, it is treated like a taboo. Failure is like gravity, the authors explain: it is ubiquitous, pervasive and even inevitable. It occurs across the board in products, ad campaigns, startups, investments, M&As, recruitment, sales, transactions, and projects.

""We not only live with failure, we live in it everyday,"" the authors observe. Hence, dealing with failure begins with respecting it, just as we must respect gravity even as we learn to fly. Failure has also been likened to a vaccine that gives temporary discomfort before long-term success. Failure-savvy leaders condition themselves to be optimistic in the face of failure.

""Fear of failure is failure's force multiplier,"" the authors add. Fear of failure in the near term can lead to larger and even catastrophic failure in the long term. ""Fear of failure greatly compromises an organisation's ability to inspire, retain, reward, recognise, and replace great talent,"" the authors caution.

Fear of failure in the face of the unknown stifles creativity, curiosity, initiative, aspirations, confidence, and the innovation spirit. Fear is failure's strongest ally, the authors warn.

At the same time, the authors caution that one should not tolerate failure as an excuse for incompetence, negligence, carelessness, indifference or laziness. Fearlessness about failure should not be seen as a ticket for recklessness.

""How you deal with failures in your team is the acid test of whether you trust them, and vice versa,"" the authors explain. Trust leads to better employee engagement, willingness to give critical feedback, ability to experiment, and capability to reflect on and rebound from failure along the way.

""In many ways, failure creates the ultimate proving ground for trust,"" the authors add. This depends on how the organisation treats failure personally, professionally and collegially.

""Failure is today's lesson for tomorrow,"" the authors affirm repeatedly. Though understanding failure can be uncomfortable and unfamiliar terrain, it is a fascinating frontier. ""Welcome to the family of the fallible,"" they joke.

Failure isn't the opposite of success, but its companion, sibling, and complement. Failure helps ground vision with reality, according to Google Ventures' Joe Kraus. ""Entrepreneurs who don't have any fear of failure are dreamers,"" he cautions; they usually do not succeed.

The authors explain how failure appears in different organisational phases and how they can be framed and managed (see my summary in Table 1 below). Each stage of growth has different connotations and consequences of failure, and leaders should prepare themselves appropriately in each context.

Startups by nature are fragile, and have a high rate of failure due to their experimental state. Startups spot opportunities in markets driven by tech trends or by spotting failures and gaps in the offerings of incumbent corporates.

There are many examples of failed forerunners and winning successors, such as Friendster and Facebook, and Altavista and Google. Yahoo outpaced AOL but was then passed by Google. Apple employees left to create Nest, which was then bought by Google.

The story of Instagram shows the power of a founding team to listen and learn from customer feedback; they focused only on the photo feature of the app Burbn, and the rest is history. Early e-tailers like Pets.com, eToys and WebVan closed down; timing, context and business models have changed, and Amazon is succeeding in many of their domains.

Unfortunately, many startups repeat the mistakes of premature scaling, dysfunctional chemistry, lack of capital, inadequate product-market fit, untested business models, and inability to cross the growth chasm.

In many countries, most businesses are SMEs, many run by families. Challenges arise in sibling rivalries and inter-generational tensions, but they also have the advantages of moderate risk-taking and long-term planning horizons. They can combine benefits of scale and agility, as compared to startups and corporates.

Many corporates began as confident innovators, but later become stumbling followers and even flameouts, as seen in the case of Sony, Atari and Wang Labs. The authors liken corporates to the ""aircraft carriers of the business naval fleet.""

Though they can exploit global supply and distribution chains for economies of scale, corporates also have more to lose from disruption. They can thus become averse to risk and experimentation, unless they build the capacity for innovation and trust.

It takes commitment to create an ambidextrous culture of innovation as well as standardisation, instead of complacency, conformity, mediocrity and incrementalism, the authors explain. Large firms may be too big to pivot, but they can ""arc"" in a few years.

""Innovation is messy and unpredictable,"" they add, showing how Hyatt Hotels had to push through change while introducing integrated rather than serial coordination for preparing guest rooms.

The most useful part of the book is the authors' framework called the Failure Value Cycle, consisting of seven stages for framing and managing failure (see my summary in Table 2 below). For each stage, the authors show examples of companies that succeeded in tapping the contribution of failure, and those that did not learn from failure.

Many companies do not talk about failure internally, or in their annual reports. They prefer to ""measure what they treasure,"" rather than list failures and measure what they learnt from the failures. Ignoring, denying or defying failure is pointless.

Instead, leaders should set the tone by sharing their own stories of vulnerabilities, even with a touch of humour. Conversations should centre on What did you fail at today? to unearth insights to new approaches, as explained by Spanx founder Sara Blakeley. Language, comfort and candour in such conversations go a long way in boosting confidence in dealing with failure.

""Problems that need solving"" (UAW) and ""issues and challenges"" (Avon) are better terms to describe failures. The field of science uses the frame of experiments and hypothesis testing to assess outcomes. Terms used in other industries are post-mortems (medicine), failure analysis (engineering), and rapid prototyping (design).

There should be a clear demarcation between no-failure zones and no-fault failure zones. Six Sigma works well in routinised domains, Zero Stigma works better in experimental domains. Failure should be de-personalised, the authors add.

Though Kodak had internal champions in digital photography and conductive films, it could not see past its original business model. On the other hand, Indiegogo openly shares what is not working, and asks employees for suggestions for solutions. Avon has a ""Raise your hand"" culture to encourage employees to flag issues.

(Stage 2) Rehearse: an ounce of anticipation is worth a pound of improvisation

The authors distinguish between two types of organisations: high-reliability (eg. airlines, hospitals) and high-resilience (sports teams, startups, jazz bands). They call for rehearsals, checklists, redundancies on the one hand, and adaptability, flexibility, and simulations on the other.

Protection of ""crown jewels"" is a priority (eg. IP, algorithms, design, internal processes). Contingency plans need to be drawn up in case each of them is compromised. Scenarios of different kinds of challenges need to be enacted and even competed upon (""pre-hearsals"").

""Avoid the hearse, take rehearsals seriously,"" the authors joke. In the words of Intel's Andy Grove, ""only the paranoid survive."" Organisations should chart out ""failure horizons"" that include black swan events.

For example, Twitter has extensive discussions on the successes and failures of its projects, and documents them for future reuse. UCSF Medical Centre conducts frequent rehearsals of emergencies.

(Stage 3) Recognise: pick up signals early

When failure is a constant companion, companies should devise early-warning alert systems about product defects, new trends, emerging startups, and changes in customer expectations, competitor offerings and regulations. Companies should ""listen for the running water"" like a beaver does, and repair existing dams or build new ones. Instead of focusing only on the status quo or static quo, leaders should address the future quo, the authors joke.

Unfortunately, many examples have shown otherwise: Target ignored early warnings about data security breaches, and GM ignored early signs of ignition problems. Many incumbents failed to see or change to new business models, as seen in the case of Kodak, Polaroid, Wang, Blackberry, and Borders.

(Stage 4) React: deal with failure

This stage unfolds quickly, and responses will depend on the scale, scope and type of failure. Companies should classify the types of scenarios, as seen in meteorology (hurricane categories), architects (buildings for different Richter scale earthquakes), and firefighters (number of alarms). Resist the knee-jerk reaction to scapegoat, be visible and available, acknowledge and apologise as relevant, and honour your honest failures, the authors advise.

Examples of good recovery include Johnson & Johnson (handling of the Tylenol tampering case in 1982) and Morgan Stanely (evacuation procedure during 9/11 attacks). Those who flunked at this stage include BP (Gulf of Mexico oil spill) and Lulemon Athletica (yoga gear complaints).

During the Apollo missions, NASA's culture had a healthy respect for failure, and continuously rehearsed and reflected on its experiments. This culture unfortunately changed later, with people being ostracised for identifying risks, thus leading to the Columbia and Challenger shuttle disasters.

Interestingly, the authors point out that the phrase ""Failure is not an option"" was a Hollywood scriptwriter's fiction from the movie Apollo 13, and was apparently not uttered by mission director Gene Kranz.

(Stage 5) Reflect: turn failure from a regret to a resource

It is tempting and sometimes easy to resort to finger-pointing, blaming and shaming in the aftermath of failure. While there should be high accountability, those who tried hard and failed despite their efforts should also be honoured, according to Severin Schwan, CEO, Roche.

Elizabeth Kubler-Ross describes five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. This framework can be adapted to organisational failure as well. Mere acceptance of failure leads to incompetence and mediocrity; instead, there should be insightful reflection and corrective plans. Recovery and reflection go together.

The authors recommend different steps to handle ripple effects of failure in four groups: insiders (console and thank those directly involved), outsiders (admit and atone to customers and partners), audience (explain and reaffirm to media and investors), and colleagues (send the right signals, for example, don't fire or abandon employees).

The authors cite Google and Ontraport as examples of companies that do not penalise failures or find fault with people, but instead focus on what went wrong rather than who did it. Open Innovation helps get outside inputs in ideation, as in the case of Boehringer Ingelheim (crowdsourcing algorithms in drug development via Kaggle). Asking others for help should not be seen as an admission of failure, but a quest for more creative solutions.

(Stage Six) Rebound: retake the initiative

The authors identify five responses to failed initiatives: tenacity (rivet rather than pivot), tweak (minor adjustment), turn (abrupt change), turnabout (fundamental reversal), or pull the plug. At this stage, failure lessons have been absorbed and incorporated in the next stage.

For example, Netflix initially bungled the launch and pricing of its parallel Qwikster service for DVD rentals. It apologised to customers, revised pricing, repositioned itself, and cancelled Qwikster to focus only on streaming. Such a comeback can take months or years, the authors explain.

(Stage 7) Remember: embed failure-savvy in your corporate culture

""The worst failure is repeating one you've already made,"" the authors warn. Resilience, competence and confidence of a company in the face of failure need to be reflected in the way it embeds failure lessons in its DNA.

Failure and recovery stories are a rite of passage for startups. Such stories should be personal and authentic. Stories, and not just formal metrics, are a powerful force to shape a more failure-savvy culture, according to BCG's CEO Rich Lesser and partner Roselinde Torres.

Failed products can even have talismanic value. The past should be honoured so as to create a lasting legacy across generations. The solvent WD-40 stands for ""Water Displacement, 40th formula"" - reflecting the past 39 failures. Ford's Model T was named as the successor after earlier Models B, C and so on down the line. Rovio celebrates how it made 51 attempts before finding success with Angry Birds.

Bessemer Venture Partners publishes an ""anti-portfolio"" on its website, of companies that it passed up but went on to become successful: such as Intel, FedEx, Google, PayPal, and eBay. This admission was even done with a touch of humour, and takes guts and humility, according to the authors.

Walmart has a practice called ""Correction of Errors,"" which focuses on problems and solutions. Dental drug firm Henry Schein's recovery from a painful computerisation rollout error in 1988 became a lasting story testifying its resilience, grit and organisation-wide commitment.

Intel made key rings of its flawed Pentium chip for its employees, with the inscription: ""Bad companies are destroyed by crises, good companies survive them, great companies are improved by them.""

The Googleplex campus is built on the headquarters of former heavyweight Silicon Graphics, and has a replica of the T-Rex dinosaur as a reminder that once-mighty kings can become extinct as well.

The book ends with description of a Failure Value Report Card that leaders can use to chart their journey to becoming more failure-savvy by tracking progress across the above seven stages. It has questions about conversations around failure, classification of failure types, environmental scans, core values, rehearsed protocols, internal communication, and failure lessons.

Graders should be drawn from the leadership team, as well as others inside and outside the organisation. There should be provision for anonymous feedback as well. General statements should be backed by specific examples where possible.

Corporate values of trust, teamwork, loyalty, creativity, and confidence are forged in the crucible of failure, the authors sum up. This is evinced at leader, manager and team levels. An innovative and ambitious company should be prepared to deal with the discomfort of failure, which is a natural step in venturing out of the comfort zone.

A fallible but failure-savvy organisation is marked by honesty (in discussing failure), curiosity (to forge ahead despite failure), pride (in overcoming failure), humility (in poking fun at one's own failures), and engagement (no fear of ridicule in the face of failure)."

Trustee Punjabilal Shen and others were named as accused in an offence registered regarding the accident. They were booked along with other accused for culpable homicide not amounting to murder

Shen and other members of the management and staff of the school were travelling in the same bus along with some of their family members. Along with 70 students of the school, the total number of passengers in the bus stood at 107. This was much beyond its capacity.

As many as 25 persons were injured and the cleaner of the bus Balramsinh Bhadoria was killed when he jumped out of the moving bus. The driver of the overloaded bus lost control while negotiating a turn near Paravdi on the outskirts of Godhra, leading to the accident early on Tuesday.

The school had planned a trip to Madhya Pradesh over the long weekend. The bus left the school located in Narol in Ahmedabad on Thursday night. On its return journey, the bus had left Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh on Monday night and was on its way to Ahmedabad when the incident took place. While negotiating a turn on the Indore-Ahmedabad national highway near Paravdi, the driver of the bus lost control and the bus left the road and hit a tree.

The drivers of the bus, owner of the bus Sitaram Sharma and Shen were named as accused in the offence registered on Tuesday. The two drivers and Sharma are absconding. Officials said that they had yet not ascertained which of the two drivers was driving the bus. Shen was produced in a court in Godhra on Wednesday and was sent to judicial custody.

The Godhra taluka police that is investigating the case has also sought help from transport officials regarding the capacity and other aspects of the bus."

A public deputation from village Dhanwalt, Ramnagar in Udhampur district projected certain public importance issues including up-gradation of High School, placing of doctors at Ayurvedic dispensary and laying of water pipes etc.

Similarly, a delegation of JK Reserved Categories Empowerment Alliance (JKRCEA) raised several service related issues of employees of reserved category working in the various Government departments which mainly includes reservation in promotion and others.

Advisor gave a patient hearing to the grievances, issues presented by the delegations and individuals. He assured the people that all genuine grievances would be looked into and be forwarded to the concerned departments for their timely resolution."

The Associa­tion said that the fee was charged after examining and scrutinizing its income and expenses. President JKJCCPS Showkat M Chowdhary said the Fee Fixation Committee, as per the High Court directions, approves the fee for a full calen­dar year and not on monthly basis. He said the schools submit all the documents, income and expenses attested by Chartered Accountant, undertakings and declarations to the Fee Fixation Committee on the basis of which the fee is fixed.

""The private schools hire staff on yearly basis who are provided salary and provident funds for full year. No school hires staff as daily wagers. Accordingly, the schools charge tuition for full calendar year. The schools also make it sure that the teachers and other staff are paid properly. They also upgrade its in­frastructure and other facilities on regular basis in an effort to impart quality education to the students so that they can compete not only at state or national level but at in­ternational level."" About the trans­portation charges, JKJCCPS said the private schools charge for only 10 months even though they provide salary to the drivers and conductors for full year. ""Besides other charges including road tax, insurances are also borne by the schools for 12 months and there is no exemption from any authority or company to schools for the school buses dur­ing winter months. The schools only save fuel during the winter months on the basis of which only 10 months transportation fee is charged from the parents."" JKJCCPS said transport facilities are provided to the students on no profit no loss basis. ""This facility is for the smooth transportation of the students so that they reach the schools and re­turn back home on fixed times. It is neither prudent to say that schools will ply buses on losses.""

JKJCCPS said it is not mandatory for the parents to avail transport facility. ""If parents feel the trans­port is not viable, they can opt out of this facility and drop the students at schools on their own."" It said the Coordination Committee has al­ready given clear-cut instructions to the schools not to charge arbitrarily or make unnecessarily charges.

""We have also urged parents to register their complaints with the Coordination Committee for its prompt redressal."" JKJCCPS urged parents no to resort to media trails instead seek better education for the wards. ""In today's modern world when competition is very high for the students, parents should ex­hort upon the school management to further upgrade infrastructure in terms of latest teaching aids and other facilities which should be in­tegral part of class room.""

JKJCCPS further urged parents' association to sit with coordination committee over the issue and clear doubts, if any, regarding the fee charged from the students.

""We believe that media trials will serve no purpose but only hamper the school functioning and derail our effort to impart quality educa­tion. We will also like to invite me­dia for open discussion and clear any doubts on the matter so that we focus on providing quality education to the students and help parents lay a strong foundation of their children."""

HRD ministry must urgently appoint counsellors.

Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs), the Centre's pace-setting boarding schools, face a serious challenge. An investigation by this paper has revealed that 49 students have committed suicide in the past five years. Half of those who took their own lives were from Dalit and tribal families, raising serious questions over the milieu in these schools, which were envisaged as institutions providing ""talented rural children"" with ""quality education comparable to the best in a residential school system"".

Set up in 1986, the JNVs have earned a reputation for excelling in board examinations. Since 2012, these schools have consistently recorded a pass percentage of over 99 per cent in Class 10 and over 95 per cent in Class 12, which is far better than the CBSE's national average. But the incidents of suicide witnessed in these residential schools since 2013 have cast a shadow. In 2015, the deaths caught the attention of the National Human Rights Commission. It asked the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) -- the autonomous body under the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) that runs the Navodaya schools -- to take immediate remedial measures. In response, the Samiti issued a circular to the management of individual JNVs that seemed to recognise the gravity of the problem. It acknowledged that ""students from varied backgrounds"" take time to adjust to the residential culture of the schools and identified ""home-sickness, depression, adolescence-related issues and the failure to meet parents' expectations"" as the major causes for the suicides. Significantly, the circular also recognised the importance of ""proper counselling"". ""Counselling sessions must be conducted on the spot when unusual behaviour, depression or insult feelings are observed in any student,"" it stressed.

The Samiti's instructions remain largely on paper. Navodaya campuses do not have trained counsellors and the onus of looking after the emotional well-being of the students is on the school principal and the house master. In at least 32 of the 49 suicides, disciplinary action was initiated against either the school principal or teachers. But these are knee-jerk reactions. Already saddled with non-teaching responsibilities -- mess management, for example -- a teacher with no professional training in spotting subtle changes in behaviour is unlikely to notice suicidal tendencies in a student. And, according to the NVS records, less than 2 per cent of the Navodaya teachers have completed the NCERT's course in clinical counselling in the past 15 years. The NVS has requested the HRD ministry to sanction two counsellors for every Navodaya school. The ministry must accede to this request urgently."

The disaster that struck a coal mine at Ksan in Meghalaya's Jaintia Hills district on December 13, trapping at least 13 workers, is a shocking reminder that a fast-growing economy such as India continues to allow Dickensian mining practices. India being home to some of the worst mine disasters, such as Chasnala near Dhanbad in 1975 in which more than 370 people were killed, the full spectrum of mining activity should be tightly regulated. Yet, the Ksan mine, referred to as a rat hole, was allowed to function in violation of not just safety norms but a complete prohibition issued by the National Green Tribunal. Clearly, the administration did not act to stop unscrupulous operators of the illegal mine from exploiting desperate workers, some of them from Assam, who were willing to work the rat hole tunnels because that is the most remunerative employment available to them. Unscientific mining led to a collapse of the chamber and deadly flooding followed. After disaster struck, it was incumbent on the Meghalaya government to launch an immediate rescue effort. But it did not possess the equipment to dewater the stricken mine quickly, and did not show any urgency in requisitioning it from elsewhere, in spite of the involvement of the National Disaster Response Force. The families of the workers are now left hoping for a miracle. Meghalaya has no excuse for not closing down such dangerous mines. What it can and should do now, jointly with the Assam government where needed, is to offer adequate compensation and jobs for the next of kin of the workers without delay.

Official inquiries into flooding disasters at approved mines, including Chasnala, have shown serious shortcomings in safety management. Two years ago, a landslip at an open cast mine in Goda, Jharkhand, killed 23 people, raising questions about the rigour of the technical assessment done prior to expansion of extraction activity. A study on three big flooding accidents published in 2016 by the IIT-Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, concluded that the official approach of fixing responsibility on human error was flawed, since it did not try to identify the root cause. There is little evidence to show that pre-mining surveys and safety protocols are incorporating such advice. The case of illegal mines falls in a different category. Unapproved work, which appears to have led to the Meghalaya accident, cannot continue, and employment should be provided to those who are displaced. Illegal mining has been highlighted by activists, but they have become targets of violence by those operating the mines. In the glare of national attention, Chief Minister Conrad Sangma has acknowledged that illegal mining does take place. His government has been remiss as it failed to act on the NGT's directions. It must bear responsibility for what has happened at Ksan, and work to prevent such tragedies."

An article in The New York Times highlights a recent trend among companies across the globe: allowing employees to tweak their schedules based on when they work best.

One expert, Céline Vetter, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder and director of the university's circadian and sleep epidemiology lab, told The Times' Emily Laber-Warren that as many as 80% of people have work schedules that clash with their internal clocks. These internal clocks are also known as ""chronotypes,"" or your biological predisposition to be a morning person, an evening person, or somewhere in between.Scientists have been studying chronobiology for a while. But the topic has gained more widespread attention recently. For example, in his book ""

A bonus just for you: Click here to claim 30 days of access to Business Insider PRIME

You can tell if your chronotype clashes with your work schedule by asking yourself a simple question: Do you use an alarm clock to wake up? If so, Laber-Warren writes, ""you're out of sync with your own biology.""

Employees who work at companies that mandate the same, strict work hours for everyone may have it rough. But more organizations are starting to recognize the important role chronotypes play in performance, and encouraging people to figure out their own.

For example, The Times article mentions a ThyssenKrupp steel factory in Germany, which assigned shifts based on chronotypes. Researchers reported that employees got more (and better quality) sleep.

And at the Denmark offices of AbbVie, a pharmaceutical company, employees go through a nine-hour training program that helps them figure out when they should tackle tough projects, and then craft their work schedules accordingly.

Still, these practices are hardly the norm. In fact, a 2014 study published in the Journal of Applied Psychology found that managers are typically biased toward early risers: Employees who get in early are generally perceived as more conscientious and receive higher performance ratings than employees who get in later - even if the early-arrivers leave earlier, too.

As Christopher M. Barnes, an associate professor of management at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business, wrote in a Harvard Business Review article in 2015, most companies get chronobiology wrong. ""Many employees are flooded with writing and responding to emails throughout their entire morning, which takes them up through lunch. They return from lunch having already used up most of their first peak in alertness."" (Barnes writes that most people reach their peak in alertness and energy mid-morning.)

Meanwhile, a 2017 study published in the Academy of Management Review focused on the potential of ""chronotype diversity"" in business teams, i.e. groups of people in which some are early risers and some are night owls. The authors write that chronotype diversity can have positive or negative effects, depending on the nature of the work. (In The Times, Laber-Warren contrasts a surgery team, whose members need to be alert at the same time, and a nuclear power plant, where someone always needs to be on.)

To be sure, even organizations that don't explicitly recognize the role of chronotype diversity may support flexible schedules. For example, at web app company Basecamp, employees work wherever and whenever suits them best, as long as they're getting their work done."

Leadership trainer, entrepreneur and author Farshad Asl refers to the American Dream in his best-seller 'The ""No Excuses"" Mindset' when he says, ""we live in the land of opportunities. People come from all over the world to hustle and work their way up to places that they could only imagine or dream of"".

Many have left the Indian shores as well in search of this American Dream and it is time for them to come back. Freedom to dream big and opportunities to achieve them are no less in their own land. Krishnamurthy Subramanian, the newly appointed Chief Economic Advisor of the country will readily agree to this as his journey is one from an 'extremely humble background"" to the coveted office for any economist in the country, that too at a relatively young age of 47.

His father A V Krishnamurthy sold 'papads' (appalam in the local language) on the streets of Tambaram on the outskirts of Chennai to make both ends meet and complete schooling. The senior Krishnamurthy had to leave his hometown in Tiruchirappalli for Chennai after he lost his father at a young age of seven. He did odd jobs and somehow completed schooling. He got a job in Indian Railways but remained in the lower grades for a long time.

Subramanian, who is fondly known as Subbu among colleagues and friends, was the first one to go to college in his family. His father knew the importance of education and wanted the children to have what he was denied due to financial constraints. Subramanian thankfully acknowledges the role played by his father in making him what he is today. His mother, a homemaker, too is a Tamilian, who has her roots in Kerala.

Subramanian and his younger brother Vaidyanathan spent their school days in Bilaspur, now in Chattisgarh. During the Bilaspur days he cultivated a liking for Bollywood flicks and songs. It is interesting to see the other side of an economist, who is a fan of Amitabh Bachchan, who delights in movies like 3 Idiots and loves to hear Kishore Kumar's Jeevan Se Bhari Teri Aankhen from the movie Safar. As most of the children of 80's he too developed a craze for cricket, which declined to die out even during the days of academic rigour.

Being good at mathematics, he gained entry to the prestigious IIT Kanpur, graduating in electrical engineering. He worked with Tata Consultancy Services for three years under a bond after completing graduation. By then, he started to realise that he was not meant to be an engineer. With his passion for mathematics, finance felt like a natural extension. He did his MBA in finance from IIM-Calcutta, where he was named to the Honour Roll of the Institute for being a top ranker in the batch and was awarded the Institute's coveted medal for the most balanced outlook to business problems.

For the next two years, Subramanian worked with ICICI with their derivatives research team. Wanting to go deeper into financial economics, he applied for Ph.D and going by the advice of his mentor and banker Nachiket Mor and former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, he chose University of Chicago Booth School of Business, which is known for its free market economics. It was the time when behavioural economics and other schools of economic thoughts were gaining traction. His guide Luigi Zingales and Raghuram Rajan had together penned 'Saving Capitalism from Capitalists' around that time. An influence of these thoughts have reflected in the banking reform recommendations made in 2014 by the P J Nayak committee, of which Subramanian was a member.

After completing Ph.D, Subramanian served as finance faculty at Goizueta Business School at Emory University in the United States till 2010. By then, he had decided to come back and contribute to the economic growth of his home country. By 2012, his guide Raghuram Rajan also had taken up the prestigious responsibility of heading the Reserve Bank of India.

In 2010, Subramanian joined Indian School of Business in Hyderabad and currently serves as Associate Professor of Finance (with tenure) and Executive Director for the Centre for Analytical Finance. Subramanian's wife Kavita also serves the ISB as its head of Academic Services Administration and Senior Associate Director in Hyderabad. Interestingly, Subramanian's younger brother Krishnamurthy Vaidyanathan is also associated with the ISB.

He is a faculty member in its Mohali campus. He too is a graduate from IIT Kanpur, alumnus of IIM Ahmedabad and has done Ph.D in Finance from Edhec Business School in Paris.

Subramanian also serves as a member of SEBI's Standing Committees on Alternative Investment Policy, Primary Markets, Secondary Markets and Research. He was part of the Uday Kotak Panel, which has made recommendations on corporate governance. He is also on the boards of Bandhan Bank, the National Institute of Bank Management, and the RBI Academy and was also part of the P.J. Nayak Committee, which reviewed the governance of boards of banks in India. He has also done a research in bankruptcy code.

The Chief Economic Advisor technically has to play a key role in shaping the economic policies that guide the government initiatives. Subramanian is an apt choice as Chief Economic Advisor at a time when the banking system is beleaguered by huge non-performing assets and loan defaulting corporate sector continues to be an unresolved puzzle. The timing is crucial as the National Democratic Alliance, hit by the recent losses in the state assembly elections, will need an ""Economic Survey boost"" before going for the Lok Sabha polls next year.

As CEA, the first task for Subramanian would be coming out with a survey that will define the policies of the government aspiring for another term. The task will become even more arduous if the survey has to outline solutions for the vexing problems of the economy while appearing populist. Subramanian believes in expansion of formal economy through taxation and taxing of farmers. After the recent poll results which reflected the discontent among agrarian community and the informal sector, Subramanian may have to keep aside some of his economic theories and get to work on a more populist survey. More than long-term policies, the government would now prefer quick fix solutions.

Subramanian also holds strong opinion in a variety of subjects which sometimes seem radical for a vote-dependent political class. As an independent economist, Subramanian has been quite vocal about the economic and political developments in the country. But diplomacy and restraint are two virtues that come handy when one becomes part of the administrative system, especially when the independence and autonomy of governmental institutions are at stake.

He had expressed his optimism about the state of affairs at a time when Arvind Panagariya was Vice-Chairman of Niti Aayog, Arvind Subramanian the CEA and Raghuram Rajan the RBI Governor. All of them have gone and even the successor of Rajan has quit. An advocate of providing more autonomy for public sector banks and a critic of state interference in the banking system, Subramanian will have a tougher time ahead.

He was among the very few economists who had welcomed demonetisation after the government withdrew the high value notes. While his views drew a lot of flak, he has also openly praised Raghuram Rajan and Arvind Subramanian, who at different points of time, disapproved the government's misadventure. His articles linking subsidies and dynasty rule and dissection of crime data of Uttar Pradesh also drew the attention of readers, especially those who are critical of the current political dispensation at the centre and the state."

For months, Claudia Guebel could only tell family and friends about a traumatising encounter with a colleague in Argentina's Senate.

At the beginning of this year, she said, Pedro Fiorda, a senator's chief of staff, grabbed her violently by the arms like a ""hunter who catches prey"". Then, she felt his tongue inside her mouth. The terror that seized her made those minutes seem eternal, she said.

""I didn't know how to react, I was paralysed,"" said Guebel, a congressional aide who previously worked for the same senator.

In December, she was finally moved to file a formal complaint with judicial authorities after actress Thelma Fardin publicly accused actor Juan Darthes of raping her in 2009 when she was 16 and he was 45. Writers, politicians and journalists expressed support for Fardin on social media.

Advertising

""With Thelma's statements, everything was awakened in me,"" said Guebel, 52.

Fiorda could not be reached for comment by The Associated Press, and Darthes says he is innocent.

But Guebel is now part of a wave of women who have come forward in the South American country with sexual misconduct accusations in what has inevitably been compared to the (hash)MeToo movement in the United States, where the worlds of media, business, entertainment and politics have been roiled by allegations against powerful men.

Women say they are also taking a cue from ""Ni Una Menos"", an Argentine grassroots movement that emerged in 2015 and spread globally. The movement has drawn thousands into massive demonstrations against feminicide and violence against women in Argentina, where a bill attempting to legalise abortion was defeated in August.

""For a while in Argentina we have been witnessing a paradigm shift ... where the voices of women are beginning to be heard, understood and, most importantly, accompanied by others,"" said Fabiana Tunez, executive director of the National Institute for Women in Argentina, who said the accusations by Fardin lent the movement more visibility.

On December 11, the actress announced she had filed a criminal complaint in Nicaragua, where she says she was raped by Darthes in a hotel during a promotional tour for ""Ugly Duckling"", a children's television series. Darthes, who has since moved to his native Brazil, has denied the allegation.

Three other women also have accused him of harassment or abuse.

""We are all very shocked,"" said Sabrina Cartabia, Fardin's lawyer. ""It is opening up the possibility of talking about something very painful.""

In Argentina, there is no national registry of victims of sexual abuse. But a survey found that 45 per cent of the 2,750 students polled at public and private universities in Buenos Aires reported suffering physical or psychological abuse and 9 per cent had suffered sexual abuse. The survey was published in a 2016 report by UNICEF Argentina.

Another poll conducted by the Argentine Management Society of Actors found that 66 per cent of actresses said they had suffered some type of harassment or abuse while exercising their profession.

The wave of women speaking out is now threatening an entrenched machismo culture in a country where women are often catcalled, hissed at and harassed on the street.

In recent weeks, telephone lines that receive reports of gender violence have seen sharp increases -- the largest coming on December 12, the day after Fardin's news conference.

Tunez, who has helped manage the phone lines, said she was surprised by calls from women 70 to 80 years old with stories of childhood abuse. ""They just wanted someone to hear them, because legally nothing can be done,"" she said.

In recent days, alumnae of the ORT Jewish community school, including the daughter of Argentine politician Daniel Filmus, have also publicly accused a school doctor of sexually abusing them when they were between 13 and 14 years old. School authorities announced that they are willing to cooperate with an investigation.

But the reverberations of the larger movement have spread much further. Women from political parties and youth groups like La Campora have started reporting sexual aggression to blogs, social media and press outlets. The main content producer of Argentine television, Pol-Ka, has committed itself to incorporating a protocol for giving assistance in cases of sexual harassment and abuse. And the Senate passed a law that requires the state to provide training to public employees about gender-related topics.

""Argentina is leading the social mobilisation of thousands and thousands of women like never before seen in Latin America, which is having an impact on sister countries,"" said Maria Elena Naddeo, who works at the ombudsman's office in the city of Buenos Aires, referring to similar movements in Uruguay, Bolivia, Ecuador and Chile.

For her part, Guebel, the assistant to lawmakers, says she will continue working to eradicate a culture of patriarchy.

In addition to her complaint against Fiorda, she has filed a complaint against Senator Juan Carlos Marino for allegedly touching her breasts, and against congressional staffer Juan Carlos Amarilla, who she says sexually harassed her. Both Marino and Amarilla have declared themselves innocent. All three have been formally charged by a public prosecutor.

""I am dealing with an incredible level of exhaustion that has caused me many health problems and wear and tear on my soul,"" said Guebel, who has worked in the Senate for nearly 20 years.

""The message that I can give to women is that they become bold,"" she said. ""This is just the beginning, we are becoming more powerful."""

Well, all these adjectives and many more which are there in Oxford Dictionary would fall short if I have to describe Ruksi ...oops Dr. Rukhsana Saifee, The Author.

I have known her for three decades, since I was in 7th grade. In times when we were still struggling to read one full Chacha Chowdhary and Billu comics , she used to subscribe to Reader's Digest. We used to shy away from her because her spoken English was light years ahead compared to us guys, though we were studying in a reputed convent school in those times.

Indeed, she was our first female friend who used to invite us home. We used to call her dining table as Round Table Conference; her mom used to always serve nice coffee or tea while we were there. She used to discuss topics, which we had never heard of. It became regular for us to sit across the ""Round Table Conference"". Ruksi advised me to read English newspapers if I wanted to improve my English and learn how to speak.

Time flew by and as we grew older we secured degrees in our respective disciplines. In an era when everyone was flying West, Ruksi's destiny took her to the base of Mt. Abu, Abu Road. We lost contact until one day, with advent of mobile technology we again came in touch. This was when she shared articles she wrote for the English edition of Times of India.

I remember correctly that the article she wrote for the Times was on local tribe ""Garasiyas"". Once, long back, I visited her at Abu Road and learnt what all she was doing in life - I was awestruck that she is writing, teaching as Professor, pursuing her doctorate...wow!

Perception is that dreams can be achieved only while working in bigger places and cities, but that's not true. Settled in a small town with not much exposure to the limelight, she was preparing for bigger thing in life. She is a motivator. A positive person who can infuse energy into someone who really wants to excel in life .

So, here we are today - she is a published author. Her book is already on the stands. I know this is just a start, however I believe a series of ISBN numbers should be allotted to her in advance.

I am proud that I call her my friend , a mentor and well-wisher. So far I have always read books written by authors whom I don't know personally. Reading ""Personality Management & Communication"" is going to be special."

Context: The year 2018 is ending with spectacular success of Indian scientists and technologists in the space and defence sectors, with a series of high impact missions. Several scientific developments, new techniques and promising technologies -- in fields ranging from nanotechnology to space weather -- made headlines during the year.

A gel that can protect farmers from toxic pesticides: It is a protective gel -- poly-Oxime -- that can be applied on skin and can break down toxic chemicals into safe substances, preventing farmers from going deep into the skin and organs like the brain and the lungs.

World's thinnest material with novel technique: It is a material that is 100,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. Researchers synthesized a two-dimensional material of just one-nanometre in thickness using Magnesium diboride -- a compound of boron. This is said to be the world's thinnest material. It can find a range of applications -- from next-generation batteries to ultraviolet absorbing films.

Gene editing applied to banana genome: Using the gene editing technique -- CRISPR/Cas9 -- researchers at the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute, Mohali, edited the banana genome. This is the first such work in any fruit crop in India. Banana is the fourth most important food crop after wheat, rice and corn in terms of gross value of production. Gene editing could be deployed to improve nutritional quality, agronomical important traits as well as pathogen resistance in banana.

Faster diagnostic tests for tuberculosis: Scientists have developed highly sensitive and rapid tests for detection of tuberculosis infection in lungs and surrounding membranes. Unlike current tests that use antibodies for detection of bacterial proteins in sputum samples, new tests use Aptamer Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA) and Electrochemical Sensor (ECS) for detection of a bacterial protein in the sputum.

New tool developed for autism screening: In many cases, autism is misdiagnosed as mental retardation and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Early identification and interventions may help children with autistic disorders. To help this process, scientists have developed an Indian tool for screening children for autism.

Hope for Alzheimer's and Huntington's patients: Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have figured out the way memory deficit develops in early stages, resulting in Alzheimer's disease. They have found that early breaking down of a protein, fibrillar actin or F-actin, in the brain leads to disruption in communication among nerve cells and consequently memory deficits.

Green technique can address plaster of Paris pollution: A team of scientists at Pune-based National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) has developed a technique that helps recycle plaster of Paris waste from hospitals in an eco-friendly and economical way. The new technique disinfects waste and converts it into useful products like ammonium sulphate and calcium bicarbonate. The technique can also be used to disintegrate PoP waste from idols immersed in water bodies.

Stone Age tools, genetic studies throw new light on early civilisation in India: The Stone Age tools discovered in a village near Chennai suggest that a Middle Palaeolithic culture was present in India around 385,000 years ago -- roughly the same time that it is known to have developed in Africa and in Europe. The discovery pushes back the period when populations with a Middle Palaeolithic culture may have inhabited India, and challenges popular theory that the Middle Palaeolithic was brought to India by modern humans dispersing from Africa only around 125,000 years ago or later.

Sikkim gets real-time landslide warning system: A real-time landslide warning system has been set up in the Sikkim-Darjeeling belt of north-eastern Himalayas which is highly vulnerable to landslides. The warning system consists of over 200 sensors that can measure geophysical and hydrological parameters like rainfall, pore pressure and seismic activities. The system is capable of warning about 24 hours in advance. It has been deployed by researchers of Kerala-based Amrita University and Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority.

Computing capacity for weather forecasting gets a boost: During the year, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) upgraded its computing capacity for weather forecasting and climate monitoring, taking its total high performance computing (HPC) power to as high as 6.8 Petaflop. With this, India rose to the fourth position, next only to United Kingdom, Japan and USA in terms of dedicated capacity for HPC resources for weather and climate proposes.

Scientists use silk polymer to develop artificial vertebral disc: Scientists at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, developed a silk-based bioartificial disc that may find use in disc replacement therapy in future.

Government rejects separate time zone for NE States

Context: Govt rejects demand for different time zone for northeastern states for 'strategic reasons'.

The debate for a separate time zone for the northeast has been in existence for as long as the history of modern India goes. Amidst the pros and cons of having two time zones for the country, no implementable solution has been proposed so far.

Back in October this year, the CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL) and the National Measurement Institute (NMI) of India explored the possibility and also proposed an implementable solution.

The custodian of Indian Standard Time (IST) proposed two time zones IST-I and IST-II for the country as follows:

The borderline between two time zones would have been 89°52'E, the narrow border between Assam and West Bengal. States west of this line would have followed IST-I (UTC +5:30) while states east of this line (Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Andaman & Nicobar Islands) would have followed IST-II (UTC +6:30).

Earth is divided into 360 vertical lines or the longitudes. A shift in every longitude gives a time difference of four minutes; so, the planet is divided into 24 time zones.

Longitude is the angular distance between a point on any Meridian and the prime meridian in Greenwich. The time at Greenwich is called as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

India extends from 68°7'E to 97°25'E, with the spread of 29 degrees, which amounts to almost two-hours from the geographical perspective. For decades, legislators, activists, industrialists and ordinary citizens from India's northeast have complained about the effect of IST on their lives.

Following are the factors which compelled the people from northeast to demand a different time zone:

Loss of daylight hours and excess electricity usage. A different time zone would allow sunsets to take place later, allowing the citizens to better use their daylight hours.

Effect on biological clocks of citizens. The longitudinal extremes of the country are assigned a single time zone which not only creates the loss of daylight hours but also creates problems relating to the biological clock.

India has a huge population; if the country were divided into two time zones, there would be chaos at the border between the two zones. It would mean resetting clocks with each crossing of the time zone. There is scope for more dangerous kinds of confusion. Railway signals are not fully automated and many routes have single tracks. Trains may meet with major accidents owing to human errors. Just one such accident would wipe out any benefits resulting from different time zones in the country.

Partitioning the already divided country further into time zones may also have undesirable political consequences. Moreover, research shows that the energy saving from creating two time zones is not particularly large.

With a time difference of one hour in the mornings and in the evenings, there would be nearly 25% less overlap between office timings in the two zones. This could be important for banks, offices, industries and multinational companies which need to be constantly interconnected. This will be further detrimental to productivity and to the interests of the eastern region.

There is already a sense of alienation between the relatively prosperous and industrialised western zone and the less developed eastern zone. The people in the Northeast sense a distance from the mainland and a separateness in clock time may accentuate it.

Having a separate time zone for the eastern region will provide no energy or other benefits to the rest of the country. Moreover, India will continue to be in off-set time zones, five and a half hours in the west and six and a half in the eastern region ahead of.

Mains Question: Critically analyse the need for multiple time zones in India?

Context: Recently, Chairman of India's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI), Rajnish Kumar, said that loan waivers are not a permanent solution; instead, he argued for an investment scheme to increase the income of farmers on similar lines of Telangana's Rythu Bandhu.

In August this year, Telangana government launched 'Rythu Bandhu' investment support scheme for farmers.

The Rythu Bandhu (Agriculture Investment Support Scheme) takes care of initial investment needs of every farmer.

Aimed at relieving farmers of debt burden and cease them from falling into the debt trap again, the scheme provides a grant of Rs 4,000 per acre per farmer each season for the purchase of inputs like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, labour and other investments in the field operations of farmer's choice for the crop season.

Context: Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MoMSME) has released its Strategy Action Plan on Unlocking the potential of MSME exports.

Despite a reasonable growth story and substantial share in overall exports, MSMEs are often faced with challenges that restrict their entry into the foreign market. Not only do these challenges need to be studied in detail but, an eco-system needs to be created in such a way that these enterprises shall be able to participate in the global value chain on its own and generate enough economies of scale.

Highlights of the strategic action plan proposed:

Aim: The strategy action plan prepared by the Ministry aims to create a sustainable ecosystem for entire MSME development.

The action plan aims to achieve the objectives of - Finance; Access to affordable trade finance; Target of USD 100 billion of exports from India by 2020; Evaluate readiness of MSMEs to export their products and services; Recognize areas where improvements are required in order to be able to export effectively and efficiently; Integration of MSMEs into Global Value Chain.

Governing Council: To ensure efficient and effective delivery of all MSME export related interventions, the Strategy Action Plan proposed to formulate a governing council that shall be chaired by Secretary, M/o MSME and Co-chaired by DC, M/o MSME.

Composition: The council shall comprise of senior officials and members from M/o MSME, Commerce, MSME Export Promotion Councils, Export Development Authorities, Commodity Boards, and other bodies.

The need of the hour is to study challenges in detail and create an eco-system in such a way that these enterprises shall be able to participate in the global value chain on their own and generate enough economies of scale.

Mains Question: For MSME sector, access to credit is one of the most significant challenge amongst the several challenges that the sector faces. Analyze issues related to credit availability for MSME sector and the role government is playing?

For Prelims and Mains: Overview and significance of the Achievements.

Context: The year 2018 is ending with spectacular success of Indian scientists and technologists in the space and defence sectors, with a series of high impact missions. Several scientific developments, new techniques and promising technologies -- in fields ranging from nanotechnology to space weather -- made headlines during the year.

A gel that can protect farmers from toxic pesticides: It is a protective gel -- poly-Oxime -- that can be applied on skin and can break down toxic chemicals into safe substances, preventing farmers from going deep into the skin and organs like the brain and the lungs.

World's thinnest material with novel technique: It is a material that is 100,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. Researchers synthesized a two-dimensional material of just one-nanometre in thickness using Magnesium diboride -- a compound of boron. This is said to be the world's thinnest material. It can find a range of applications -- from next-generation batteries to ultraviolet absorbing films.

Gene editing applied to banana genome: Using the gene editing technique -- CRISPR/Cas9 -- researchers at the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute, Mohali, edited the banana genome. This is the first such work in any fruit crop in India. Banana is the fourth most important food crop after wheat, rice and corn in terms of gross value of production. Gene editing could be deployed to improve nutritional quality, agronomical important traits as well as pathogen resistance in banana.

Faster diagnostic tests for tuberculosis: Scientists have developed highly sensitive and rapid tests for detection of tuberculosis infection in lungs and surrounding membranes. Unlike current tests that use antibodies for detection of bacterial proteins in sputum samples, new tests use Aptamer Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA) and Electrochemical Sensor (ECS) for detection of a bacterial protein in the sputum.

New tool developed for autism screening: In many cases, autism is misdiagnosed as mental retardation and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Early identification and interventions may help children with autistic disorders. To help this process, scientists have developed an Indian tool for screening children for autism.

Hope for Alzheimer's and Huntington's patients: Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have figured out the way memory deficit develops in early stages, resulting in Alzheimer's disease. They have found that early breaking down of a protein, fibrillar actin or F-actin, in the brain leads to disruption in communication among nerve cells and consequently memory deficits.

Green technique can address plaster of Paris pollution: A team of scientists at Pune-based National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) has developed a technique that helps recycle plaster of Paris waste from hospitals in an eco-friendly and economical way. The new technique disinfects waste and converts it into useful products like ammonium sulphate and calcium bicarbonate. The technique can also be used to disintegrate PoP waste from idols immersed in water bodies.

Stone Age tools, genetic studies throw new light on early civilisation in India: The Stone Age tools discovered in a village near Chennai suggest that a Middle Palaeolithic culture was present in India around 385,000 years ago -- roughly the same time that it is known to have developed in Africa and in Europe. The discovery pushes back the period when populations with a Middle Palaeolithic culture may have inhabited India, and challenges popular theory that the Middle Palaeolithic was brought to India by modern humans dispersing from Africa only around 125,000 years ago or later.

Sikkim gets real-time landslide warning system: A real-time landslide warning system has been set up in the Sikkim-Darjeeling belt of north-eastern Himalayas which is highly vulnerable to landslides. The warning system consists of over 200 sensors that can measure geophysical and hydrological parameters like rainfall, pore pressure and seismic activities. The system is capable of warning about 24 hours in advance. It has been deployed by researchers of Kerala-based Amrita University and Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority.

Computing capacity for weather forecasting gets a boost: During the year, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) upgraded its computing capacity for weather forecasting and climate monitoring, taking its total high performance computing (HPC) power to as high as 6.8 Petaflop. With this, India rose to the fourth position, next only to United Kingdom, Japan and USA in terms of dedicated capacity for HPC resources for weather and climate proposes.

Scientists use silk polymer to develop artificial vertebral disc: Scientists at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, developed a silk-based bioartificial disc that may find use in disc replacement therapy in future. The group has developed a fabrication procedure for a silk-based bioartificial disc adopting a ""directional freezing technique"". The disc mimics internal intricacy of human disc and its mechanical properties too are similar to those of the native ones. The use of a silk biopolymer to fabricate a biocompatible disc can reduce the cost of artificial discs in future.

Transgenic rice with reduced arsenic accumulation: To address the problem of arsenic accumulation in rice grains, researchers at Lucknow- based CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute developed transgenic rice by inserting a novel fungal gene, which results in reduced arsenic accumulation in rice grain. They cloned Arsenic methyltransferase (WaarsM) gene from a soil fungus and inserted it into rice genome.

Flowering mustard: TERI School of Advanced Studies has developed an early flowering transgenic variety of mustard.

Mains Question: Highlight the Achievements of Indian Scientists in the year 2018 and their significance for the society.

Context: A recently-declassified study of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) states that mobile towers do not have any negative effect on human health.

In international standards, ""thermal effect"" of radiation refers to the heat that is generated due to absorption of microwave radiation which causes cellular and physiological changes in living beings. This effect may be responsible for genetic defects, effects on reproduction and development, central nervous system behaviour and many similar serious health consequences.

Non-thermal effects of radiation have been shown to be responsible for fatigue, irritability, headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, disruption and other psychological disorders, memory loss and difficulties in concentration.

About International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP):

The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is an international commission specialized in non-ionizing radiation protection. The organization's activities include determining exposure limits for electromagnetic fields used by devices such as cellular phones.

ICNIRP is an independent non-profit scientific organization chartered in Germany. It was founded in 1992 by the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA) to which it maintains close relations.

The mission of ICNIRP is to screen and evaluate scientific knowledge and recent findings toward providing protection guidance on non-ionizing radiation, i.e. radio, microwave, UV and infrared.

Mains Question: Does the radiation from cellphone towers damage human health? Discuss.

The Prime Minister Narendra Modi, dedicated the Bogibeel bridge in Assam, to the nation. Additionally, on the northern bank of the Brahmaputra, the Prime Minister also flagged passenger train passing through the bridge.

Since Dibrugarh is an important centre of healthcare, education and commerce in the region, and the people living north of the Brahmaputra, can now access this city, more conveniently.

Construction of the Bogibeel Bridge was agreed by the government as part of a 1985 agreement to end years of deadly agitation by Assamese nationalist groups.

The Bogibeel project was a part of the 1985 Assam Accord and was sanctioned in 1997-98.

The Bogibeel Bridge, which will have a serviceable period of around 120 years, is India's only fully welded bridge for which European welding standards were adhered to for the first time in the country.

Context: Haryana has renamed child care institutes being run in the state as Jagannath Ashrams.

Why? Since all child care institutions have a similar goal of all-round development of children, it would be appropriate to give a single name.

India's first music museum to be set up in Thiruvaiyaru:

Context: The country's first music museum will be set up with assistance from the Central government in Thiruvaiyaru, Tamilnadu, the birth place of Saint Tyagaraja, one of the Trinities of Carnatic music. The other two of the Trinity are Muthuswami Dikshitar and Syama Sastri.

Carnatic music, is a system of music commonly associated with South India, including the modern Indian states of Andhra Pardesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil nadu as well as Sri Lanka . The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in gyaki (singing) style."

New York, my home, is only the 21 most polluted city in the world, according to a recent study by Eco Experts, which combines data on air quality, noise pollution, and light pollution. Los Angeles, which I've been to a few times, comes in tenth.

That's a far cry from the cities that top the list, where checking particulate matter levels, or PM, is as routine as checking the weather.

I got my first taste of the smog life in April, when I visited Shanghai and Beijing, seventh and third on the Eco Experts' list, respectively.

While the pollution was noticeable - I saw a blue sky only a few times on that trip - I was in town during comparatively the best time of the year, pollution-wise. The winter in Beijing, when millions are burning coal for heat, is when the real pollution rolls in.

But, as I rode in a taxi from the Cairo Airport this past week, it hit me that I'd entered the big leagues. A city of more than 20 million people, Cairo is the

Every highway, road, and alleyway is clogged with cars and motorbikes spewing fumes into the air. The honking never stops: long honks, short beeps, and everything in between. The cars, and their drivers, are in every kind of conversation imaginable. Other noises proliferate, from street-side shouts to the rumble of construction. Every street seems to have a construction site and a building under renovation or being built.

Cairo is the most polluted city in the world, according to the Eco Experts' report. WHO's Global Ambient Air Quality Database, which solely focuses on multiple measures of air quality, ranks Cairo second worst for PM10, or particulate matter that is 10 micrometers in diameter or less. When judging by PM2.5, or particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers or less - the worst kind of pollution, according to the Environmental Protection Agency - Cairo is not quite as bad, but still near the bottom.

Particulate pollution is made up a mix of solid and liquid droplets in the air, including sulfates, nitrates, and carbon. It's largely caused by energy used by homes, automobile traffic, manufacturing, and power plants. Sand or desert dust can add to the air pollution. In Cairo's case, the city is located in a valley and has a large industrial sector, tons of traffic, poor waste management, and a dusty climate, according to Arab News.

""Air pollution threatens us all, but the poorest and most marginalized people bear the brunt of the burden,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director general, said in a statement regarding its most recent report.

On average, residents of Cairo breathe in air suffused with 11.7 times the WHO recommended safe level of PM2.5 and 14.2 times the safe level of PM10. Translation: The air is really bad, and you can feel it.

After a few hours walking around in even one of the more green neighborhoods - the embassy-populated, moderately wealthy island of Zamalek - I found myself severely dehydrated despite having a water bottle by my side the whole time. The taste in my mouth was bitter, my nostrils felt caked in dust, and my eyes had grown itchy. The best way to describe it is that it feels like you are constantly at a construction site, with sawdust or concrete dust in the air. After a few days, I'd found that my skin, unused to the pollution, was breaking out in hives on my face.

And that's just the air pollution.

Cairo's noise pollution is arguably even worse, though it is rarely talked about. Eco Experts' research found that Cairo is the third loudest city in the world, after Guangzhou and Delhi. A report by the Egyptian National Research Center found noise pollution in Cairo reaches a daily average of 85 decibels or, in the words of Eco Experts, ""like spending all day inside a factory."" Even at 3 a.m., the honks don't stop.

The aforementioned honking, shouting, and construction noises are ever-present, no matter where you are in the city. It literally leaves your ears ringing. Even as a New Yorker who lived for years above bars in the rambunctious East Village, I found the noise to be a shock.

Combine that with the light pollution - Eco Experts reported Cairo the third-brightest city in the world, with artificial light 85 times brighter than the natural sky - and it all makes for a bad night of sleep.

Every night, I slept with blackout curtains drawn and earplugs in. And still, I found myself to be getting terrible sleep. Every day, I overslept and woke up groggy. Before you assume jet lag, I was in the region for three weeks and slept fine while in the United Arab Emirates.

All of this after a week. Imagine living in it for a few months, a year, or your whole life.

My partner, who has more sensitive lungs than I do, contracted pneumonia and a respiratory infection halfway through a semester studying in Shanghai. When we visited Shanghai in April, she'd contracted a wheezing cough after a day in the city.

Researchers and scientists are still studying the effects of pollution on humans, but it has been connected to health conditions like asthma, lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, according to WHO and the EPA. Researchers suspect that pollution is connected to obesity, insomnia, depression, as well as effects on the immune, endocrine, and reproductive systems.

One recent study out of Beijing Normal University's school of statistics found that long-term exposure to particulate matter was correlated with cognitive declines in study participants as they aged.

The Egyptian government pushed back on the Eco Experts report shortly after it was published, criticizing the methodology of the study. But there's no denying the pollution in Cairo. It would appear the Egyptian government agrees with that much.

Earlier this year, the government announced a plan to reduce air pollution by 50% by 2023 and began an initiative to plant one million fruit trees in public spaces throughout the country.

A major pollution issue for Egypt since 1997 has been farmers' yearly burning of leftover rice straw from September to November, which can create a ""dark cloud"" over Cairo. To tackle the issue, the government has offered to buy the straw from farmers for $3 a ton, Mohamed Salah, head of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency said in October. ""Today, the dark cloud season is over and all citizens in Egypt are saying that they have not sensed any problem relating to this, unlike what had happened in previous years,"" Salah said.

But, for this American in Cairo, I found the city to be stark reminder of how lucky the US is when it comes to air quality and pollution and how little we bear the burden of global manufacturing and other polluting industries around the world.

When I told one Beijing resident in April that I head to the countryside outside New York City when I want fresh air, he looked at me incredulously. ""You have to understand, we think of New York City air as pristine,"" he said."

Today, a summer intern working in land management who makes $9.25 per hour and spends some of her money this week on mango kombucha. Note: this diary was written last summer and is the last entry in our Your Spending In Your State series.

Occupation: Summer Intern

Industry: Land Management and Development

Age: 20

Location: Kauai, Hawaii

Salary: $9.25/hour

Paycheck Amount (Biweekly): $533

Monthly Expenses

Rent: $0 (I'm living with my parents for the summer back home. It's my last summer before graduating and entering the ""real world,"" and my first one since high school that I've spent at home.)

Spotify Student: $5

Hulu Basic: $8 (I pay for this, my parents pay for Netflix, and we all have access to both accounts.)

Phone: $0 (My parents pay.)

Health Insurance: I'm on my parents' plan until I turn 26. (#ThanksObama)

College: I'm on an academic merit scholarship that covers my tuition, and other outside merit scholarships cover most of my other costs. Since my scholarship renewal is contingent on maintaining a high GPA, grades are very important to me. My parents contribute about $2,500/semester from a college fund to cover basic costs like books and transportation.

Savings: I put $500 into my Roth IRA every six months and am trying to build up my checking account for next semester, as it was decimated during my study abroad semester (I was not permitted to get paid at my internship because of my student visa).

6:30 a.m. -- I wake up and have scrambled eggs with leftover gyoza filling from last night for breakfast, along with fresh mangos from my best friend's farm and figs from our backyard! Being home for the summer makes me appreciate the wonderful things from my island that I took for granted before moving away.

10 a.m. -- Two hours into work, I have a coffee from the office Keurig and a KIND bar.

1 p.m. -- Lunch from home: shiso musubi (rice balls), leftover gyoza, takuan, and ahi poke. My mom just returned from a trip to Japan and is way too excited about using the kawaii bento accessories she picked up.

4:30 p.m. -- I fill up gas at Costco using my mom's card ($23.33). Gas here is so expensive that this is the only place we fill up for the rebate, and I don't have my own Costco card.

5 p.m. -- Finish work and stop at my local juice shop to pick up a mango kombucha. (I get 50 cents off for bringing a reusable bottle!) This company supports a total of 30 local farms on the island and only sells reusable bottles. And their workers are the sweetest! $4.50

5:15 p.m. -- I go for a three-mile run along the ocean. Not paying for a gym, plus killer views, and occasional whale spottings make me wonder why I go to college on the East Coast.

8 p.m. -- Mom and I cook sukiyaki and brown rice for dinner with fresh watercress on the side, and I pack the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

6:30 a.m. -- I wake up and see that my grades from my semester abroad came in! I did well in most of my classes but got one unexpected B. I shoot off emails to the professor and my advisor while eating an avocado and chicken sandwich for breakfast. (The avocados are free from our friend's farm.)

7:30 a.m. -- I call my best friend from study abroad on my way into work to vent about the grade. She's the best and I miss her.

9:30 a.m. -- Office Keurig coffee and leftover KIND bar for snack.

1 p.m. -- Leftover sukiyaki and rice for lunch with a raw egg. A coworker went to a Filipino restaurant nearby and brought back cascaron for dessert, and another coworker brought in homemade matcha ice cream!

5 p.m. -- I meet my dad after work for our favorite hike and we trail run three miles up and down the mountain. He is 56 and still kicks my ass.

7:30 p.m. -- I make beef, broccoli, salad, and brown rice for dinner for my dad, my grandma, and myself. (My mom is working.) Afterwards, I read more of Labor of Love by Moira Weigel, a really interesting book about the history of dating that I'm renting as a free library eBook!

6:30 a.m. -- Wake up and eat breakfast: avocado sandwich on whole grain again with fresh mango.

7:30 a.m. -- I study economics and love that there are so many accessible, well-made, and free podcasts available on the topic! I listen to Planet Money on my way into work.

12 p.m. -- I'm selling a bathing suit that doesn't fit me properly on eBay, so I run to the post office during lunch. I make $152 after fees and spend $28.78 on expedited shipping for the buyer, so I net $123.22.

12:15 p.m. -- I'm tired of Japanese food, so I go to the Costco food court (my happiest place) and get a chicken bake for lunch. I also grab a free strawberry guava juice from the company fridge. $2.33

5:30 p.m. -- There's a swell on the south side of the island, so I meet up with my dad after work and we surf until the sun goes down. When we get out of the water, we realize someone has stolen our car keys! This has never happened to us before on the island, and it's super disappointing. We call a friend to bring us a spare.

9:45 p.m. -- By the time our friend comes and we get back to our side of the island, everything but fast food is closed. I'm starving and exhausted, so I go through the Taco Bell drive-through and get a cheesy potato burrito. $3.68

6:30 a.m. -- Up and at 'em! I have cereal with chopped apples and bananas from our friend's farm and fresh pineapple.

8 a.m. -- Get to work and make a Keurig coffee.

12 p.m. -- I go on a lunch run with my boss and she treats me to a pineapple tea. I eat leftover beef broccoli and brown rice for lunch.

5:30 p.m. -- I stop at my local juice shop to pick up more kombucha. Mango mint jalapeño for me and strawberry guava for my mom. I get a free shot of ginger juice, cinnamon, lemon, and honey. $9

6 p.m. -- I would usually go for a run now, but I'm exhausted, so I FaceTime with my friend instead. He is interning in Silicon Valley this summer, and I try to convince him to use that sweet tech cash to come visit Kauai for a weekend.

7:30 p.m. -- I treat my friend to dinner as a thank you for driving 90 minutes roundtrip to bring us our keys last night. My parents have a date night, so I bring my grandma with us as well. We go to her favorite sushi restaurant and order miso soup, seaweed salad, three rolls, and green tea. $77

8:30 p.m. -- I crack open my AFOQT book for an hour. I'm studying to become an officer in the Air Force after graduating - I want a break after undergrad before hopefully going to law school. I also feel strongly that our military should be more diverse, and I'm ready to put my money where my mouth is.

5:30 a.m. -- I wake up early for a phone interview for a fall internship at a cool start-up. It goes well, and I'm excited about the prospect! Afterwards, I eat a BLT with avocado from our friend's farm and some honeydew melon.

7:30 a.m. -- New Freakonomics Radio episode! The drive to work flies by.

8 a.m. -- Work! My coworker gives me the top of a pineapple we ate yesterday and suggests I try to plant it in my house. I do some research and decide to give it a try.

12 p.m. -- Our office is playing tennis today! And my coworker brought in Chinese chicken salad and homemade banana lumpia for everyone for lunch.

5 p.m. -- I go home and help my mom prep for the dinner party we're throwing to thank our farmer friends for all of the recent goodies - five of our good friends come over and we make slow roasted salmon, garlic risotto, chicken masala, eggplant parm, and a caprese salad! I've typically only come home for a couple of weeks every year since I graduated high school because my college is so far away, so spending time with my family and friends feels absolutely amazing.

8 a.m. -- I wake up and text my friends about breakfast. My friend's roommate from college is visiting Kauai for the first time, so we go to our favorite local diner and order loco mocos, oxtail soup, and banana macadamia nut pancakes to split. $15.08

11 a.m. -- We stop at our favorite local boutique to check out the new arrivals, but I ate too much at breakfast and feel too bloated to try anything on. We go for coffee at another local shop and I get an iced coffee. $3.05

12 p.m. -- I get home and nap, clean, and watch a few episodes of The Handmaid's Tale on Hulu. I read the book a few years ago and loved it, and the show is just as good!

6 p.m. -- It's Bon Dance season -- a Buddhist summer festival that we look forward to every year. I meet a friend and we drive down to the Bon Dance with my grandma in tow.

The gathering, rather, was a ceremony at which he and other senior oil ministry officials asked God to boost oil output.

""This place of peace and spirituality,"" read a release by the Oil Ministry that was later scrubbed from its web site, ""was the site of prayer by workers for the recovery of production of the industry.""

President Nicolas Maduro turned heads in November 2017 when he named a National Guard general with no oil experience to lead PDVSA. Quevedo's actions since have raised even more doubts that he and the other military brass now running the company have a viable plan to rescue it from crushing debt, an exodus of workers and withering production now at its lowest in almost seven decades.

Aside from beseeching heaven, Quevedo in recent months has enacted a series of controversial measures that oil industry experts, PDVSA employees and contractors, and even everyday citizens say are pushing the once-profitable and respected company toward ruin.

Soldiers with AK-47s, under orders to prevent cheating on manifests, now board tankers to accompany cargo inspectors, rattling foreign captains and crews.

Workers who make mistakes operating increasingly dilapidated PDVSA equipment now face the risk of arrest and charges of sabotage or corruption. Military chieftains, moonlighting in the private sector, are elbowing past other contractors for lucrative service and supply business with PDVSA.

In a little-noted reversal of the Socialist government's two-decade drive to nationalize the industry, the lack of expertise among military managers is leading PDVSA to hire outsiders to keep afloat even basic operations, like drilling and pumping oil. To the dismay of many familiar with Venezuela's oil industry, some of the contracts are going to small, little-known firms with no experience in the sector.

Combined, industry veterans say, the steps leave Venezuela's most important company - which accounts for over 90 percent of export revenue - with even fewer means to rebuild the nation's coffers, pay its many creditors and regain self-sufficiency as an oil producer.

""What we are witnessing is a policy of destroying the oil industry,"" said Jose Bodas, general secretary of the Oil Workers Federation, a national labor union. ""The military officials don't listen to workers. They want to give orders, but they don't understand this complicated work.""

Maduro defends the military managers, arguing they are more in synch with his Socialist worldview than capitalist industry professionals who exploit the country for personal profit. ""I want a Socialist PDVSA,"" the president told allied legislators earlier this year. ""An ethical, sovereign and productive PDVSA. We must break this model of the rentier oil company.""

Quevedo, who holds the title of oil minister as well as president of PDVSA, didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. Neither Venezuela's Information Ministry, responsible for communications for the government and senior officials, nor PDVSA's press office returned phone calls or emails from Reuters.

PDVSA and the Oil Ministry disclose scant information about Quevedo, who is 51, according to his social security registration. He seldom makes public speeches. But at an industry event in Vienna last June, Quevedo told journalists PDVSA is aware of its challenges and hoped within months to make up for plummeting output.

""We hope by year end to recover the lost production,"" he said in a forecast that has been missed. ""We have the capacity and we have summoned the strength of the workers.""

Nearly 20 years after the late Hugo Chavez launched his ""Bolivarian revolution,"" much of Venezuela is in tatters. Food and medicines are scarce, hyperinflation has gutted purchasing power for increasingly desperate citizens and roughly three million Venezuelans have fled the country in search of a better life.

At PDVSA, managers long sought to keep the company running, even if the economic meltdown and falling oil prices meant they had fewer resources to invest in exploration, growth and basic maintenance. Despite their efforts, decay led to dwindling production, deteriorating facilities and a progressive loss of skilled workers.

Now, critics say, military officials atop PDVSA have put aside any pretense of running it like a proper business, doing little to stem the fall in production or improve the company's financial, operational and staffing problems.

No matter the dysfunction, PDVSA remains a rare and crucial source of foreign currency in the enfeebled Andean country. For Maduro, who became president after Chavez died in 2013, handing the company over to the military is seen by many as a calculated move to buy loyalty from officers.

""No one will be able to remove the military from PDVSA now,"" said Rafael Ramirez, a former oil minister. Ramirez ran the company for a decade under Chavez before clashing with Maduro, who accuses him and many other former executives of corruption. ""PDVSA is a barrack.""

PDVSA is struggling to fulfill supply contracts with buyers, including major creditors from China and Russia who have already advanced billions of dollars in payments in exchange for oil. Last month, the head of Rosneft, the Russian oil company, flew to Venezuela and complained to Maduro about the delays, Reuters reported.

Demand remains healthy for Venezuelan oil. Operational problems under Quevedo, however, have caused production to drop 20 percent to 1.46 million barrels per day, according to the latest figures Caracas reported to OPEC, the oil cartel, of which it is a member.

Quevedo in January will assume OPEC's rotating presidency for one year. PDVSA's financial problems are likely to demand much of his attention.

The gross value of PDVSA's oil exports is expected to fall to $20.9 billion this year compared with $24.9 billion last year, according to a calculation provided to Reuters by the International Energy Center at IESA, a Venezuelan business school. Exports a decade ago were over four times as much, reaching $89 billion, according to PDVSA's accounts for 2008.

PDVSA didn't publish a 2017 report and hasn't released financial results in 2018.

Little has been publicly disclosed by PDVSA or Maduro's government about the military transformation within its ranks.

A Reuters examination based on confidential PDVSA documents - as well as interviews with dozens of current and former employees, shippers, traders, foreign oil executives and others who do business with the company - shows how Quevedo's National Guard is seeping into every facet of its operations. The documents include employment records, agreements with contractors and internal staff memos.

Quevedo has appointed more than 100 aides and advisors from the military and from a previous post as a government minister to senior positions, according to a person familiar with PDVSA's human resource records.

At its shabby concrete Caracas headquarters, once brimming with suited executives, military officers are now in charge of operations. Workers say offices in Quevedo's penthouse sanctum remain luxurious. But in the run-down halls below, socialist propaganda, including portraits of Fidel Castro and Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, is among the scant decor left on the walls.

The shift toward military management was the result of a purge of PDVSA leadership.

Allegations of corruption have been rife across the Venezuelan government in recent years; Maduro himself is the target of U.S. sanctions for graft and human rights violations, which he denies.

In 2017, the president leveled his own accusations against PDVSA, describing it as a den of ""thieves."" He accused many former executives of skimming from contracts and laundering money and argued that their graft worsened the country's crisis.

He ordered the arrest of dozens of top managers, including PDVSA's two previous presidents, chemist Nelson Martinez and engineer Eulogio Del Pino. Martinez died at a military hospital earlier this month, suffering a heart attack while undergoing kidney dialysis, two people familiar with the circumstances said.

Del Pino remains detained, awaiting trial. Reuters was unable to reach his lawyers for comment. A person familiar with Del Pino's defense said he has yet, after a year in jail, to have an initial court hearing.

At the time of the purge, Quevedo had risen from the National Guard ranks to become a prominent government loyalist.

Quevedo's Twitter profile often features a photo of the general, a stocky and balding man with heavy eyebrows, reviewing paperwork with the president or smiling happily alongside him. His feed consists almost exclusively of retweets of Maduro's posts.

Since 2001, the general has moved between military and civilian positions. He has a longstanding relationship with Diosdado Cabello, the powerful vice president of the Socialist party: The two were classmates as young men at military school.

Those ties led to senior posts for Quevedo at the Defense Ministry and a program created by Chavez for low-income housing, according to official government gazettes and people who know his trajectory.

In 2014, back in a command role with the National Guard, Quevedo led a unit that clashed with demonstrators during protests that shook Venezuela for four months. At least 43 people, on both sides, died during the demonstrations, sparked by the onset of food shortages.

Quevedo was criticized by many government opponents for using excessive force, which he denied. He appeared frequently on state television at the time, donning an olive-green helmet and bullet-proof vest. ""These are terrorist groups,"" he said of the protestors, who eventually dissipated, leading him to declare that ""the coup has been defeated.""

Pleased with Quevedo's performance, Maduro in 2015 named him housing minister. In his two years in the post, he again became a fixture on state television, often wearing the red shirt of the Socialist movement and praising Maduro's ""humane"" housing policies.

Opposition leaders scoffed at what they saw as Quevedo's outsized boasts, including an unsubstantiated claim that the government constructed more than 2 million homes, despite widespread shortages of basic building materials. The housing ministry didn't respond to requests for comment.

In November 2017, intelligence agents arrested former PDVSA chief Del Pino in a predawn raid on unspecified graft charges. By then, Quevedo was Maduro's choice to lead the all-important company. The announcement prompted widespread skepticism in the industry.

Quevedo said he would need little time to get a handle on the oil businesses. ""Give me 10 days,"" he told acquaintances, according to one person who spoke with him at the time.

From the start, Maduro made clear the challenge ahead. In a public address during ""Powerhouse Venezuela 2018,"" a government conference meant to showcase business potential, the president ordered Quevedo to boost oil output by a whopping 1 million barrels per day - roughly a 50 percent increase at the time.

Over the past year, though, Quevedo has failed to reverse the slide.

One of his first challenges, according to people within PDVSA, was to stanch the flow of workers, many of whom deserted the company and Venezuela altogether. PDVSA hasn't disclosed recent employment figures. But estimates by IPD Latin America, an oil and gas consultancy, indicate PDVSA has about 106,000 workers - 27 percent fewer than in 2016.

Because of cost-of-living increases that now top 1 million percent per year, according to Venezuela's National Assembly, PDVSA salaries have crumbled to the equivalent of a handful of dollars a month for most workers.

With no money, and little real work to do at idle and faulty facilities, some employees only show up to eat at the few company cafeterias that remain open. Shippers told Reuters that PDVSA workers at times board vessels to ask for food.

To boost manpower, Quevedo has been staffing some jobs, including posts that once required technical knowledge, with National Guard recruits. The terminal of Jose, a Caribbean port in northeast Venezuela, is one of the few remaining facilities from which PDVSA exports crude oil.

The changes are disturbing buyers here. Some tanker captains complain that young soldiers are woefully unprepared to verify technical details, like whether crude density, a crucial attribute of quality, complies with contract specifications, according to three shippers and one PDVSA employee.

Crews fret a stray bullet from the soldiers' rifles could spark fires and complain that some of the crime afflicting the country is making its way on board. Although Quevedo has tasked the soldiers to help spot graft, some of the low-paid recruits ask for bribes themselves, shippers said, for signing off on paperwork or completing inspections.

""There are many risks,"" one captain told Reuters.

Venezuela's Defense Ministry, which oversees the National Guard, didn't respond to Reuters phone calls or emails requesting comment.

Even with soldiers as substitutes, PDVSA can't find the workers it needs to man many posts. From the processing of crude at refineries to contract negotiations with buyers, the shortage of skilled staffers is hobbling the company.

In a recent internal report, PDV Marina, the company's maritime unit, said staffing was in a ""critical state"" on PDVSA's own tankers, forcing some workers to toil far more than allowed by union rules. The ""alarming deficit of main staff,"" the report read, means ""we cannot honor labor agreements.""

Tensions with military managers are causing even more departures, some workers say.

Consider an incident in June, when two tankers docked at Jose. One prepared to take on heavy crude, the other a lighter grade of oil.

As the tankers loaded, PDVSA port employees noticed a mixup - the two crudes had blended. The mistake, the government said later, forced PDVSA to pay the buyers, because of contractual penalties, $2.7 million.

It would also be costly for nine PDVSA employees.

Shortly after the error, soldiers and intelligence agents arrested the workers, and prosecutors charged them with sabotage. ""This was premeditated,"" said Tarek Saab, Maduro's chief prosecutor, announcing the arrests on television. ""The actions go beyond negligence - there was malice here.""

After three days in an overcrowded military jail, they were released, pending trial. Two workers in the oil industry familiar with their case said poor maintenance, not sabotage, caused the mishap. A faulty valve system, flimsy after years without upkeep, caused the fuels to mix, they said.

Six months later, the government has presented no evidence against the workers.

Reuters was unable to reach the accused or to independently determine the cause of the mishap. Colleagues said the workers are under orders not to speak publicly of the incident.

The arrests have rattled PDVSA employees, especially because soldiers and intelligence agents have also detained workers at other facilities after mistakes.

In July, four PDVSA employees were arrested after crude spilled into a river near an oilfield in the state of Monagas, according to workers and media accounts there. One worker in Monagas told Reuters that faulty turbines caused the spill and that a vehicle shortage kept employees from reaching the site to stem the flow.

""We don't understand how a lack of resources becomes an excuse to accuse workers of negligence or sabotage,"" he said. ""They're being asked to work without safety equipment, tools, even without being able to feed themselves or their families.""

Quevedo has been creating new partnerships that are meant to shore up PDVSA. In August, for instance, the general said the company was ""opening its doors"" for seven private companies to pursue unspecified ""service contracts"" across the country.

The move raised eyebrows here, because it ran counter to longstanding efforts to nationalize the entire industry. Chavez himself phased out similar contracts, arguing that they enriched private enterprise for work that the state should do itself.

According to a document seen by Reuters, the companies obtained six-year agreements to operate oilfields on behalf of PDVSA in return for boosting output, financing investments and procuring equipment.

But the companies are unfamiliar even to veterans of Venezuela's oil industry. None are recognized as having experience operating oilfields. Consorcio Rinoca Centauro Karina, one of those listed on the document, doesn't appear to have a web site. Reuters was unable to reach it or any of the others.

Critics of the arrangements, and government opponents, say the transactions aren't transparent. By keeping details from the public, they argue, the company faces little scrutiny over whom it chooses to do business with.

""PDVSA is looking to maintain its confederation of mafias, its quota of looting,"" said Jorge Millan, an opposition legislator who in September led a push in the National Assembly to denounce the contracts.

While Quevedo's militarization of PDVSA hasn't reversed the company's decline, the government shows few public signs of displeasure. In October, the government announced a PDVSA board shuffle. Among the changes: Jose Rojas, another National Guard general, replaced a civilian director.

Past executives joke that Quevedo knew what he was doing when he prayed for help.

""He's right,"" said Jose Toro Hardy, an economist who served on PDVSA's board of directors in the 1990s. ""A miracle is needed for an increase in these conditions.""

""He's right,"" said Jose Toro Hardy, an economist who served on PDVSA's board of directors in the 1990s. ""A miracle is needed for an increase in these conditions."""

The PIL prayed for appropriate action against the correspondent of RC Middle School, a government-aided institution, for allegedly compelling students to clean toilets.

However, the school management shifted the blame on her and alleged that it was she, who forced children to clean toilets and that was why she was removed from service.

Undeterred by the action of the management, she continued to petition the Collector to take appropriate action against the correspondent and ensure that such cleaning works are done only by sanitary workers.

New and promising scientific technologies in fields ranging from nanotechnology to space weather made headlines this year.

The year 2018 is ending with spectacular success of Indian scientists and technologists in space and defence sectors, with a series of high impact missions. But that's not all Indian scientists achieved in 2018. Several scientific developments, new techniques and promising technologies - in fields ranging from nanotechnology to space weather - made headlines during the year. Here is a collection of 15 such stories that gives a glimpse of important developments reported by Indian scientists during the year.

Most farmers do not wear any protective gear while spraying chemicals in fields, which often leads to pesticide exposure and toxicity. Scientists at the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Bengaluru have developed a protective gel -- poly-Oxime -- that can be applied on skin and can break down toxic chemicals into safe substances, preventing them from going deep into the skin and organs like the brain and the lungs. The research group plans to develop a mask that can deactivate pesticides.

Pushing the envelope in nanotechnology, researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar have developed a material that is 100,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. They synthesized a two-dimensional material of just one-nanometer thickness (a human hair is about 80,000 nanometer wide) using Magnesium diboride -- a compound of boron. This is said to be the world's thinnest material. It can find a range of applications -- from next-generation batteries to ultraviolet absorbing films.

Using the gene editing technique -- CRISPR/Cas9 -- researchers at the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute, Mohali have edited the banana genome. This is the first such work in any fruit crop in India. Banana is the fourth most important food crop after wheat, rice and corn in terms of gross value of production. Gene editing could be deployed for improving nutritional quality, agronomical important traits as well as pathogen resistance in banana.

The National Brain Research Centre (NBRC) at Manesar has figured out cellular and molecular mechanisms that show how Zika virus causes microcephaly or small head size in babies. Researchers discovered that envelop protein of zika virus affects proliferation rates of human neural stem cells and promotes premature but faulty neuron formation. Another study led by scientists at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad, has identified a key protein which helps dengue as well as Japanese Encephalitis viruses replication inside human body by inhibiting anti-viral cytokines. This finding could pave way for development of targeted drugs for dengue and JE. For detecting Chikungunya, a group of researchers from Amity University, Noida, Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi and Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, have developed a biosensor using molybdenum disulphide nanosheets.

Scientists at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi have jointly developed highly sensitive and rapid tests for detection of tuberculosis infection in lungs and surrounding membranes. Unlike current tests that use antibodies for detection of bacterial proteins in sputum samples, new tests use Aptamer Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA) and Electrochemical Sensor (ECS) for detection of a bacterial protein in the sputum.

Till now arsenic was a major problem in West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Chhattisgarh. It was also known that there is arsenic contamination in groundwater in Punjab. Now a new study done by New Delhi-based TERI School of Advanced Studies has found that that Punjab's floodplains are severely affected by arsenic contamination. In some wells, arsenic levels were found to be 20 to 50 times higher than WHO prescribed limit.

A team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata have dismissed the speculation that the upcoming sunspot cycle is going to be stronger, based on calculations using a model developed by them. The near-Earth and inter-planetary space environmental conditions and solar radiative forcing of climate over the upcoming sunspot cycle 25 will likely be similar or marginally more extreme relative to what has been observed during the past decade over the current solar cycle. The method makes it possible to make predictions almost a decade before the next sunspot cycle activity peaks in strength.

In many cases, autism is misdiagnosed as mental retardation and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Early identification and interventions may help children with autistic disorders. To help this process, scientists at the Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, have developed an Indian tool for screening children for autism. The Chandigarh Autism Screening Instrument (CASI) is designed to help community health workers to carry out initial screening for autism.

Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have figured out the way memory deficit develops in early stages, resulting in Alzheimer's disease. They have found that early breaking down of a protein, fibrillar actin or F-actin, in the brain leads to disruption in communication among nerve cells and consequently memory deficits. This knowledge can be used to develop early diagnosis test in future. In another study done in fruit flies, researchers at Department of Genetics at Delhi University South Campus found that it was possible to restrict the progression of Huntington's disease by increasing insulin signaling in the brain neuronal cells.

A team of scientists at Pune-based National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) has developed a technique that helps recycle Plaster of Paris waste from hospitals in an eco-friendly and economical way. The new technique disinfects waste and converts it into useful products like ammonium sulphate and calcium bicarbonate. The technique can also be used to disintegrate PoP waste from idols immersed in water bodies.

The Stone Age tools discovered in a village near Chennai suggest that a Middle Palaeolithic culture was present in India around 385,000 years ago -- roughly the same time that it is known to have developed in Africa and in Europe. The discovery pushes back the period when populations with a Middle Palaeolithic culture may have inhabited India, and challenges popular theory that the Middle Palaeolithic was brought to India by modern humans dispersing from Africa only around 125,000 years ago or later. In the North, population genetic study has revealed that the Rors who inhabit modern Haryana came to the Indus Valley when it was flourishing during the Bronze Age and inducted West Eurasian genetic ancestry.

A real-time landslide warning system has been set up in the Sikkim-Darjeeling belt of north-eastern Himalayas which is highly vulnerable to landslides. The warning system consists of over 200 sensors that can measure geophysical and hydrological parameters like rainfall, pore pressure and seismic activities. The system is capable of warning about 24 hours in advance. It has been deployed by researchers of Kerala-based Amrita University and Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority.

During the year, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) upgraded its computing capacity for weather forecasting and climate monitoring, taking its total high performance computing (HPC) power to as high as 6.8 Petaflop. With this, India rose to the fourth position, next only to United Kingdom, Japan and US in terms of dedicated capacity for HPC resources for weather and climate proposes.

Scientists at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, developed a silk-based bioartificial disc that may find use in disc replacement therapy in future. The group has developed a fabrication procedure for a silk-based bioartificial disc adopting a ""directional freezing technique"". The disc mimics internal intricacy of human disc and its mechanical properties too are similar to those of the native ones. The use of a silk biopolymer to fabricate a biocompatible disc can reduce the cost of artificial discs in future.

To address the problem of arsenic accumulation in rice grains, researchers at Lucknow- based CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute developed transgenic rice by inserting a novel fungal gene, which results in reduced arsenic accumulation in rice grain. They cloned Arsenic methyltransferase (WaarsM) gene from a soil fungus and inserted it into rice genome. In another study, TERI School of Advanced Studies has developed an early flowering transgenic variety of mustard.

In other significant developments, the Department of Science and Technology launched a national mission on Cyber-Physical Systems with an outlay of Rs 3,660 crore for five years. The Indian Institute of Astrophysics in Bengaluru commissioned India's first robotic telescope to keep an eye on the dynamic cosmos, while the ambitious India Neutrino Observatory (INO) project got a go ahead from the National Green Tribunal.

The incident occurred on Friday evening when the boy went alone to the second floor of Mantri Square on Sampige Road. Police are, however, yet to make any arrests in the case.

The victim is Vijay Kumar, a resident of Sriramapura and an SSLC student in a private school in Rajajinagar. His father Anand works at a garment store.

A senior police officer said the boy told the police that on Tuesday evening he had gone alone to the second floor at the mall to play games and after a while, he went around looking for a power socket to charge his phone.

Some customers who were on the same floor had also kept their mobile phones for charging there. The security staffers, who noticed Vijay near a charging point, suspected him to be a mobile phone-lifter and started slapping him. Even as he tried to explain that he was only looking for a charging point, they bundled him to the cellar and assaulted him with wooden logs and electric wires for over an hour.

Vijay Kumar cried for help, but the security guards continued to beat him. They later threw him out of the mall. The boy reached home and narrated the incident. He was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of his injuries and based on medical report, Anand filed a complaint with the police.

Malleswaram police have registered a case against the security staffers under IPC Sections 341 (wrongful restrain) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt). ""We have asked the mall management to provide the identity of the security guards and one of them has been detained. Efforts are on to track the others.

This Stanford leadership programme is for the LGBTQ","The New Indian Express",FALSE,"Laws and judgements are not enough for a societal transformation -- scholars and thinkers agree on this. But no one seems to really know what the right 'next step' is when we talk about transformation. But Stanford University's LGBTQ Executive Leadership Programme seems like the sensible next step.

The exclusive programme for LGBTQ individuals is now in its third year and has already spawned one of the school's most active alumni networking groups and inspired programmes in other countries. The curriculum combines conventional management education subjects, such as design thinking and leading teams, with those more aimed at fostering inclusion, such as the ""authentic leadership"" lesson, in which students are coached to be their ""genuine self"" in the workplace. In the design thinking class, a method of thinking innovatively in small teams is taught as part of many leadership courses, but in this context, it's focused on how students can strengthen LGBT networks within and between organisations. The learning process is through a combination of classroom teaching, group discussions, team exercises and personal assessment.

The curriculum mainly includes executive presence for the LGBTQ leader and introduction to design thinking. Mid to senior-level executives with a minimum of 10 years of professional experience and five years of management experience are eligible for the course. Executives with significant levels of managerial responsibility -- from any company, any industry and any country -- can apply.

One of the main differences that Deepthi Rao, an alumnus of Stanford Graduate School of Business, noticed after she joined the course, was that she became a more vocal and active participant on Facebook and outside of it for LGBTQ related causes. ""It wasn't that I was hiding before, but this course made me more courageous. I am in the Bay Area where I work for Facebook. So, I am essentially in the gay Mecca of the world,"" says Deepthi. ""I couldn't have asked for something better in terms of being in a more open and inclusive environment. Despite that, if I was not very sure if I should be vocal, I can imagine how someone in India could be feeling. Being your authentic self and bringing your whole self to work is energising and liberating.""

The network encourages the students to form smaller networks to constantly motivate each other. ""We are celebrating the things that happen in our country. We met people from all over the world -- Brazil, Australia and India. Now, we are more aware of what's happening in other countries, their culture and more,"" says Deepthi.

The curriculum says that it looks at management through the lens of identity. But it's not directly LGBTQ focused. ""I think it was intentional because LGBTQ is your identity, but that doesn't change the actual principles of management. So, maybe going in I was thinking it was more of a direct 'how to be an LGBTQ leader' sort of a course, but it was more of 'let's learn how to be a good leader, while also keeping into consideration your authentic identity', and exploring some of those nuances,"" Deepthi adds. But the course does not have a cultural component that talks about the problems people working in places like India face. ""I think there were some discussions like the marginalisation of LGBTQ employees, but there was nothing India focused at all. That might be something that should definitely be explored and added to the curriculum especially if they are planning to have more Indian students coming,"" explains Deepthi, ""I think growing up in India is different as your family is a big part of your life and people are more close-knit with their relatives and also the society has more of a say in your life. That would need to be augmented in the course."""

The B.Des at JKLU is a 4-year full-time, graduate degree programme, recognized by UGC, Government of India. The Programme provides an opportunity for students to experience industry in their classroom, making them ready to create experiences for people once they complete the program.

To complement its programmes in Engineering, Technology and Business Management,the B.Des degree at the much acclaimed Jaipur-based academic institution will provide specialisations in product design, interaction design and interdisciplinary design.

""We are aiming to bring about a fresh, new, approach to design education, which is collaborative in nature and integrative in process. It is both unique and relevant for the neo-designer, somebody who is at-ease working in the studios, experimenting at the labs and in presenting at board rooms. To achieve this, we are re-imagining the curriculum to make way for new skills, new methods of working, and new pedagogy. The programmes are curated such that they can transform the students into designers who are future-ready and adaptive. Creating a new paradigm in design education, JK Lakshmipat University has set to break the conventional design ideology that works on aesthetics to step on towards a contemporary ideology revolving around sustainability and user experience."" says Prof. A Balaubramaniam, Dean, Institute of Design, JK Lakshmipat University while throwing light on the design education a student will get at the University.

The launch of the institute was marked by Dr. R.L. Raina , Vice Chancellor, JK Lakshmipat University where Mr. Jay Dutta, Sr Vice President-User Experience, MakeMyTrip Group, Bangalore, addressed the audience through Skype.

The inauguration ceremony has also been followed by the addresses of Mr. Abhimanyu Nohwar , Product Designer; Founder & Principal Designer, Kiba Design, Noida andSanjeev Bothra Educator & Researcher, Appropriate Design, Jaipur

On the occasion of launch Mr. Asheesh Gupta, Pro Vice Chancellor , JKLU added that with experiential learning already at the core of its Institute of Engineering & Technology and Institute of Management, the introduction of the Institute of Design comes as an initiative that can bridge and fuse all the three disciplines. The design curriculum at JKLU sits at the cross roads of technology, business, society, culture and people. Designers, therefore, need to be aware, if not proficient in all the sectors. To do that, designers will be building a mindset that is broad and agile, during the course.

Created by one of the most well-known names of the Indian design industry Prof. A. Balasubramanian , the design courses at JKLU ensure an academically-enriched yet industrially-relevant learning for its students joining in the academic year 2019.

The Institute promises a holistic development wherein they will be exposed to a collaborative approach of knowledge construction .The design curriculum at JKLU sits at the cross-roads of technology, business, society, culture and people. It is focused at making the students creative, mature, independent, empathetic, sensitive, conscious, resourceful and communicative designers.

Not only the students will share their learning journey, but also get an opportunity to be assessed by their peers, along with being evaluated by the industry experts in the end of each semester. While learning design at JKLU, the students will have the liberty to choose their own subjects, thus making them independent and in complete control of their programme .

The country today needs a new generation of user-centric and empathetic professionals who can look into the need of the consumers and bring it to reality, and JKLU is ideally placed to do this. JKLU aims to nurture and create sensitive designers, who can envision and accept the future, and not just become job-ready graduates. Hence, it has not only reimagined the design sphere, but has also reinvented it to suit the needs of the changing trends of the industry.

The B.Des programme at JKLU has been designed by one of the most known faces of Design in India with a good blend of academics, industry exposure and personal mentoring by industry professionals."

According to an FIR lodged at the Godhra taluka police station, the bus was hired by the Vivekanand Hindi Higher Secondary School, situated in the Narol area of Ahmedabad.

The mishap took place when the bus, packed with 107 passengers, including school children and teachers, was returning to Ahmedabad from Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, where they had gone for a picnic.

While the cleaner of the bus, Balram Bhadoria, died in the accident, its driver fled the spot, said Panchmahal District Superintendent of Police Leena Patil.

What Does The Primary Investigation Reveal?

Primary investigations by the police revealed negligence on part of the school management as the bus was carrying 107 passengers, way beyond its capacity, said Patil.

""The bus driver fled from the spot after the accident. The bus was indeed over-crowded. Apart from students, there were teachers and their family members in the bus. We have lodged a case against the driver and others,"" said the SP.

Based on a complaint filed by one of the parents, Radheshyam Prajapati, the Godhra taluka police lodged the FIR against the unidentified driver, bus operator Sitaram Sharma and the school owner, Panjabilal, said the police.

They were booked under various sections of the IPC, including 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 279 (rash driving) and 337 (causing injury by rash act).

According to PSI Jotana, the capacity of the bus was just 58, against which 107 people, including 70 students, were in the vehicle at the time of accident.

""The bus stopped only after hitting a tree. To save his life, the cleaner jumped from the bus when it started slipping into a pit along the road.

A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and P Rajamanickam passed the interim order on a plea by Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK)'s Cheyyur town secretary M Thiagarajan seeking action against the correspondent of RC Middle School, a government aided institution for allegedly compelling students to clean the toilet.

This apart, the petitioner also wanted the court to set up a district level committee of officials known for their integrity and commitment to cause of student welfare to inspect all government and government-aided schools to ensure adequate toilet facilities are provided along with sanitary workers.

According to the petitioner, his wife Parvathi was working as a science teacher in the school for the past 10 years on consolidated pay. But after the incident came to light and the petitioner sent representations to various authorities seeking action against the management, his wife was terminated without any reason, he said. It was purely to take revenge against him, the petitioner submitted. The management claimed it was the petitioner's wife who made the children clean toilets and that was why she was sacked.

The petitioner further submitted that undeterred by the action of the management he continued to petition the collector to take appropriate action against the correspondent and ensure toilets were cleaning only by sanitary workers.

The act of the school management not only amounted to abuse of children against the Constitution it also meant forced manual scavenging as they were compelled to clean the toilets without any safety gadgets, the petitioner submitted.

As the authorities failed to take any action on his representations he approached the high court. When the plea came up for hearing, the bench directed the collector to file the report and posted the plea to January 25 for further hearing."

Some are so obvious you'll kick yourself for not already doing them, and others are so weird you just have to try them.

Only answer email once or twice a day

From Kara Cutruzzula, who writes a fantastic daily newsletter about work, productivity and life in general:

What's the most efficient way to fill a water glass? Turning the tap one centimeter and letting a slow drip top you off? Of course not. You crank that faucet and let the water flow.

That's what batching emails feels like. Instead of responding one at a time to the forever trickle of your inbox, email batching -- responding to as many as possible during a specific time frame -- is incredibly satisfying.

One of my resolutions this year was to spend less of my life in Gmail. Solution? Now I answer emails twice a day, first around noon and then again at 6 p.m. Knowing I have to get through dozens of important messages makes my replies quicker and crisper; I can also delete the ultimate enemy (junk mail) all at once. Plus, there's a sense of accomplishment in setting discrete boundaries on an infinite task. Batching emails is like finding the end of pi.

Of course, this idea doesn't hold water if your job demands immediate responses, but it's still possible to jump on messages that are urgent, and to corral less important messages for later in the day. Give it a shot!

Quit being the flaky friend; it's not cute

From freelance writer Rae Witte:

We all have one. They say yes to everything, they never mean it and when they do show up, they're late.

While they may waver on whether they back out last minute, or simply don't show at all, they consistently do not follow through with plans they've agreed to or even initiated. Their aloofness makes you question whether you can depend on them for anything, whether it's grabbing dinner or picking up your call when you need them.

Flaky friends suck. Don't be the flaky friend. If you are, stop.

There are two keys to freeing yourself from flaky friend status: self-awareness and learning to say no.

First, examine why you say yes to things you have no intention of following through on. Is it poor time management? Do you have crippling social anxiety? Do you hate disappointing people? Do you struggle with saying no to people?

Once you've determined why you flake, the fun begins: Say no, assertively and often. Happy hour? No. Spin class? Pass. Dinner reservations for 10 p.m.? Not happening. Find comfort in declining invites and doing exactly whatever you do when you flake. Conversely, try very hard to agree only to things you will actually show up to and go on time.

Here's some advice on learning to say no effectively.

By building on this foundation of newfound self-awareness and comfort in saying no and holding yourself accountable, you'll be able to shed your flaky skin. (Ew. But, seriously.)

Try a tipsy grocery store shopping trip

From Beca Grimm, a writer in Atlanta and co-founder of Dope Girls:

Here's a miracle of modern life I recently discovered: grocery store bars. Yes, bars in the grocery store. Stick with me.

Finding time to maintain friendships as an adult only gets harder as we age. Family and work obligations often take precedence over other relationships, so one of the keys to fitting socialization into a slammed schedule is to find ways to hit multiple activities at a time.

Here's my secret: Invite pals to join you for chores you're obligated to tackle, like grocery shopping.

Everyone's gotta eat, right? More supermarkets across the country now feature bars, sometimes serving only beer and wine, but that's just fine. These watering holes -- like what's colloquially known in my city of Atlanta as ""KroBar"" (formally Kroger Marketplace at Glenwood) -- serve as a super convenient meeting place for you to down a healthy pour of house Malbec and catch up with another busy friend before you both tend to your respective shopping lists.

Grocery-based bars are unpretentious; even in a Whole Foods bar featuring 16 craft beer taps, it's unlikely you'd also find Edison bulbs buzzing over patrons. What could be better: booze, buds and tending to the foundation of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, all at once.

And really, who wouldn't find delight in navigating an aisle with a shopping cart and a light buzz?

Can't make the party? Don't apologize

From Scaachi Koul, a writer and author of the book ""One Day We'll All Be Dead And None Of This Will Matter"":

There is no greater joy in this world than being unable to go to a get-together, a baby shower, a gender reveal, an engagement party or a karaoke party. Most people secretly love canceling plans, so when you do invariably bail, enjoy it and, most important: Don't send that message apologizing for your absence.

There are limits to this. If you're expected at a dinner where the table is reserved for a certain number, you have to tell someone you're not coming. But if it's a gathering of any size larger than what one might describe as intimate, your silence is the best gift.

No one cares that you can't come! Really! Unless you're the mother of the bride, the birthday boy, the pallbearer or the accused, it's unlikely anyone will even notice you didn't show up.

In fact, sending apologies for not attending an event gives the host more responsibility: Not only do they have to put out an appropriate cheese spread and make sure no one spills wine on their hosting slippers, they have to accommodate your excuse and apology.

Just stay home, don't send the ""omg so sorry but I have work!!!"" lie-text, and sit in the dark, silent, hoping people keep inviting you to things you don't want to attend.

Don't worry about leaving the house at the same time as your partner

From Rachel Sugar, a writer in Brooklyn:

I dislike being rushed. I leave for the airport early, and I like to be at the movies with time to spare.

It's not because I am a punctual person by nature -- I am not -- but rather because I am both slow and easily stressed. Part of adulthood is knowing oneself, and what I have learned so far is that, under pressure, I am happiest moving at the pace of an arthritic retriever.

My boyfriend is the opposite. He loves rushing. The more rushed, the better, he says. He walks at a respectable marathon pace. He loves the thrill of impossibly tight train connections, because it makes him ""feel like Jason Bourne.""

For years, this was a source of tension. Then we discovered the answer: Leave at different times. ""I'm going to get a head start!"" I'll say, and leave for the restaurant, while my boyfriend is still showering. And then I go, at my pace -- a pace ideal for noticing new storefronts, or attractive dogs -- and he shows up at his pace, and no one is angry or stressed or secretly resentful.

When we tell friends about our system, they are often baffled: You leave at ... different times? To go to ... the same place? Yes. That is exactly what we do. And you can, too! It is even (sort of) romantic, in a way. As the old saying goes: If you love something, set it free and then meet it at the movies.

Some fights are necessary; what time to leave is not one of them.

Order a cocktail without annoying the bartender

From Leigh Kunkel, a food and drink writer and former bartender in Chicago:

You know the feeling: a bartender places an intimidating cocktail menu in front of you with words you've never heard before. Panicked, you want to order something you think will be simple, giving the bartender few instructions so she can simply work her magic.

""Can I just have something with gin?"" you ask. Or something ""strong."" Or worse yet, the phrase every bartender hates: ""not sweet,"" which can mean anything from ""I love citrus but not strawberry"" to ""I really just want cold vodka in a glass,"" making it impossible to tell what you truly want.

Instead of asking your bartender to read your mind to discern your tastes, try reversing your thought process: What do you like in a drink? Things like ""tropical"" or ""spirit-forward"" give the bartender much more to work with, because they indicate flavor profiles that can be developed in multiple different ways, from spirit choice to the addition of syrups and bitters.

Style is also essential: If you don't like the bitter, boozy gin Negroni, you might still love another gin cocktail, like an easy-drinking gimlet. If you tell your bartender that you love ginger beer, she'll likely steer you toward a Moscow Mule or a Dark and Stormy; if you use words like ""bubbly"" or ""effervescent,"" she'll know that an Air Mail is a safe bet.

When all else fails, use this simple formula: strength + flavor. For example, ""I'd like something light and tart,"" or ""I'm looking for a strong, herbaceous drink."" Just a few extra words will make your night -- and your bartender's -- much more enjoyable.

Listen to video game music while you work (really!)

From Angelica Frey, a writer in Brooklyn by way of Milan:

You know when you just can't stick to a task that takes deep concentration because you keep getting distracted? Here's something that might help: music, but not the often-recommended Mozart or Beethoven.

Rather, my solution is video game music, which is designed to help players remain involved in singular task for an extended period of time. The melodies are pleasant to the ear but, crucially, not overbearing. Just like I've endured training my characters for more than an hour listening to the same tune, with video game music I can stick to the most boring aspects of my work for extended bursts of concentration. This is my recipe:

Choose between ambient and rhythmic

Whether you prefer atmospheric or rhythmic tracks, video game music offers great options for both categories. I'm a fan of melodies with a slight ""oompah,"" as they give my workflow a rhythm to follow. Here is one of my favorites, and here are some other great options: Waltz for The Moon (rhythmic), Star Maze (rhythmic), Forest Interlude (ambient) and Arrival (ambient).

Find tracks you associate with good memories

Pavlovian reflex comes into play here. Water themes can be beautiful, but they remind me of depleted oxygen bars. Mid-tempo tracks of grassland, beach and sometimes desert levels put me in the right mind-set. Here are some examples of those: Artisans Home, The Road of Trials and Gerudo Valley.

Take these melodies beyond your desk!

If you're looking to fuel your workout with video game tracks, here are the best places to start: Rainbow Road, Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There and Slider (for that final sprint).

Just be a better listener

From Jen Soong, a writer in Davis, Calif.

Good listeners are far and few between, and the endless distractions calling us away from conversation -- hello, smartphones -- aren't helping.

""When we fail to listen to one another, we can't reach any meaningful dialogue or resolution,"" said Dr. Helen Riess, founder of Empathetics and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.

Disturbed by a listening deficit in hospitals, Dr. Riess developed a program to teach doctors how to better tune into their patients and save lives. Here, she shares simple strategies from ""The Empathy Effect"" to hone your empathetic listening skills at work and at home.

Mind your body. Make eye contact and maintain your gaze. Keep your face relaxed and lean slightly forward to show you're alert and attuned to the conversation. Open postures convey approachability. Don't cross your arms, as that can be seen as being defensive. Be receptive by adopting a quiet, inviting tone of voice.

Be an emotion detective. Pay attention to people's faces because they provide a road map of emotions. Subtle signs like a raised eyebrow or lip turn can reveal feelings of disgust, anxiety and joy. If you don't watch closely, you can miss important clues to their state of mind.

Make a connection. Be present, ask open-ended questions and most importantly, don't interrupt. Show genuine curiosity in the story being shared. After all, as humans, we all want to be heard.

So go ahead, put down your phone and have a real conversation. Doctor's orders."

The batch has already contributed Rs 60 lakh, and the rest would be raised in another one month. The batch was keen on naming a discussion room after Debarshi Roy Choudhury, one of their batchmates who passed away last year.

Sarin Saures, an alumnus from the batch, said: ""Thousands of students who walked through the campus doors have benefited immensely from the education and faculty guidance they received at IIMB, and carry fond memories of times on campus. Our batch is eager to support areas that the institute thinks is important, and to causes that contribute to long term value creation.""

G Raghuram, director, IIMB, said: ""IIMB has been at the fore front of management research in India and I am happy to say that we are producing many Fellows every year who join other IIMs as faculty and continue to contribute to cutting edge research. I am glad that alumni are recognizing the efforts of IIMB in this space and are coming forward to support our commitment to producing world class research scholars. Alumni are coming forward to support so many other causes thereby generating tremendous goodwill and contributing to the growth of the institute.""

K Kumar, dean of Alumni Relations and Development, IIMB, said: ""We consider our alumni to be our assets and ambassadors and we are constantly exploring new ways of engaging with alumni across the world. The trend of alumni giving back to the alma mater has seen a rise in the last few years and this is largely on account of a vibrant and engaged alumni network.""

Likewise, the batch of PGP 2008 celebrated their 10th-year reunion at the IIMB campus, also in early December. More than 100 alumni, from various parts of the world, attended the reunion, along with their families. This batch has endowed Rs 35 lakh towards providing financial assistance to the children of staff working on the campus. The higher education scholarship would help fund up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 every year towards high school and college education subject to the student maintaining a minimum academic performance.

""We are very excited to be launching the 'Class of 2008 Higher Education and Welfare Fund' in collaboration with our Institute, that will provide scholarships to children of staff at IIMB, an initiative proposed by our batch itself. We are happy to have used our 10th-year reunion as the anchor for this Giveback initiative.

The objective of the Pharma Leadership Summit was primarily to bring together leaders from the Indian pharma industry to collectively engaging in various aspects of GC&E implementation - from identifying opportunities, to recognising gaps, getting acquainted to collaborative models and enabling platforms, to exploring emerging tools and solutions for advancing the implementation of GC&E practices in the industry.

The session commenced with two keynote addresses by Dr David Constable, Science Director, ACS- Green Chemistry Institute, who shared a global perspective on GC&E implementation and sustainability in the pharma industry; followed by Sai Sethuram, Head, Product & Portfolio Development, Pfizer Healthcare, who spoke on the importance of sustainability in the Indian pharma industry for emerging as a robust and sustainable supplier to the global pharma industry.

The talk by Dr Guy Humphrey, Distinguished Senior Investigator, MSD (Merck) US, shared insights on the business-case for green chemistry and how over the years, Merck has been strategically and systematically investing in the field of green chemistry for their products. This outlook was reinforced by Dr Rajappa Vaidyanathan, Group Director and Head, Chemical Development and API Supply, Bristol Myers Squibb, in his talk, wherein he elaborated on various case-studies citing examples on how BMS has been integrating the application of green chemistry principles in early phase development processes.

Dr Sudhir Nambiar, President - R&T, Hikal spoke on his company's journey towards GC&E implementation, and outlined the events leading from identification to implementation of GC&E practices at Hikal. This was pertinent as Hikal is the first Indian pharma company which is now on-board with the ACS-Green Chemistry Pharmaceutical Roundtable (GCIPR) as a Member Company.

This session was followed by Dr Vilas Dahanukar, R&D Director, Bioxera Research India who pointed out various gaps and opportunities of implementing GC&E practices in the pharma sector, further emphasising the need to develop a mind-set for greener and simpler processes, and newer approaches to problem solving.

Speaking in the last session of the summit, Dr Juan Colberg, Senior Director, Pfizer, US spoke about green chemistry and manufacturing technologies at Pfizer. He remarked that the challenges in resource and environmental sustainability requires more efficient and benign technologies for chemical processes and emphasised that the importance of manufacturing products through green chemistry means that these can potentially addresses such challenges.

Workshop on bio-catalysis in pharma API industry

The objective of this workshop was to have focussed deliberation on exploring the real-time potential of bio-catalysis in pharma API synthesis. The content of the workshop was designed to expand the technical understanding of bio-catalysis, while also learn from successful case-studies and explore relevant bio-catalytic solutions vis-à-vis the pharma API industry's challenges and requirements.

The session commenced with a keynote address and half-day technical workshop by subject expert, Prof Nicholas Turner, Professor of Chemical Biology, School of Chemistry, Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, UK. In his session, he provided an introduction to biocatalysis in the pharma industry, illustrated with examples the various biocatalytic pathways that can make manufacturing of pharma APIs greener, and posited a need to increase application of biocatalysis in discovery chemistry.

The next session was conducted by Dr Guy Humphrey, Distinguished Senior Investigator, MSD (Merck), US, who discussed the role of biocatalysis in green and sustainable development. He opined that enzymes specificity, selectivity, ability to be evolved are key propertiesthat create aspirational opportunities and the answer to the chemist's question ""do you have an enzyme that can do x, y or z?"" is no longer 'Yes' or 'No'. It's increasingly 'Yes' or 'Not yet'. The biocatalysis case-studies as presented by Dr Humphrey were reportedly shared for the very first time in a public forum and the workshop participants were fortunate to be able to learn from these very exciting projects being done at Merck, US. Similarly Dr Juan Colberg shared relevant case-studies from Pfizer to illustrate the advantages of bio-catalysis in pharma synthesis while Dr Ishwar B Bajaj, Senior Scientific Manager, Biocon shared case-studies on the application of biocatalysis in syntheses of complex APIs.

In the last session of the workshop, presenters shared pharma API relevant technologies and solutions in the bio-catalysis space. Suresh Kumar from Advanced Enzymes Technologies, discussed the viability of enzymes as ""Green Catalysts in the Pharma Industry,"" and presented case-studies where AET enzymes have shown break-through results in complex API synthesis. The last presenter, Saravanan Jothi, Iosynth Labs, deliberated on white biotechnology and its application in chiral synthesis. He stated that bio-catalysis is an effective tool for achieving chiral purity, which is critical in the pharma industry.

Besides the presentations, participants at the workshop also continued with offline interactions and focussed discussions in the break hours with experts like Prof Nick Turner present throught the conference.

GCIPR workshop on essential tools and techniques

The workshop was designed to facilitate learning from the collective efforts of GCIPR towards performing several PMI benchmarking exercises of chemical processes across different development stages over the last one decade within the member companies of the Green Chemistry Institute's Pharmaceutical Roundtable (GCIPR). The workshop highlighted on how smarter decisions on solvents (including water) and raw materials using the solvent and reagent selection guides can result quickly in significant reductions of wastes, and enhance greener and more sustainable processing.

The first session was conducted by Dr Guy Humphrey, who introduced the objectives and background of the GCIPR model, and set the context for sustainability in the pharma industry. He stated that GC&E enables lowest cost API production, helps mitigate supply-chain risks and presented examples on how GCIPR catalyses innovative approaches to improving process efficiency in the sector.

This was followed by a session by Dr David Constables on PMI metrics, with extensive examples and hands-on exercises. After a detailed introduction on the solvent and reagent selection guides, he demonstrated how R&D teams could integrate these tools on a day-to-day basis.

Industrial experts like Dr Bhuvaneshwari Sridhar, Head of API & R&D, Pfizer Healthcare India, Dr Rajappa Vaidyanathan, Group Director & Head, Chem Dev & API Supply, Bristol-Myers Squibb, India and Dr Guy Humphrey, Distinguished Senior Investigator, MSD (Merck), US shared relevant and real-time examples of integrating GCIPR tools and techniques in making conventional synthesis 'greener'.

Mehta, Conference Convener and Co-founder, Green ChemisTree Foundation, concluded the session by acknowledging the GCIPR for their generous support and partnership in forwarding the ""Green Chemistry Initiative for Pharma Industry"" in India over the years. He also reiterated the importance and relevance of the GCIPR tools and techniques for the pharma industry in India.

Tools, technologies and solutions in GC&E

The seminar on 'Ready-to-Implement' Technologies and Solutions, was designed to bring together GC&E solutions at the door-step of participating companies. Combined with case-study presentations and demonstrations, the presentations in the seminar introduced emerging tools, technologies and environmental solutions which have the potential to address industry's immediate environmental and process-related challenges. The seminar was categorised into two distinct categories, with the first half being dedicated to tools and technologies applicable at the R&D stage and the second session about those available for process, manufacturing and operations stage.

The first session was commenced with a keynote address by Dr Rakeshwar Bandichhor, Director and CoE Chemistry Head - API R&D, Dr Reddy's Laboratories who provided a consolidated insight into the array of GC&E tools and techniques which R&D teams can incorporate at various process-development stages. The next presenter, Dr Satya Lakshmi Oruganty, Director - LifeSciences - Enterprise Analytics and Intelligence, PerkinElmer, further discussed the various lab informatics tools as developed and offered by PerkinElmer.

The talk by Dr Sivakumar, Technical Services Manager, Johnson Matthey, discussed the use and applications of homogenous hydrogen and through case studies and examples highlighted how optimised homogeneous catalytic system can offer safer, milder conditions (lower temperature and/or pressure), increased chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance (e.g. to halogens). He also explained how these catalysts help in creating simpler work-up procedures and most importantly help in reducing waste generation (as compared to hydrides).

The next presenter, Virendra Chouhan, GM, Equinox Software & Services discussed an innovative Multi Batch Distillation System (MBDS) software technology for carrying out distillation using a stand-alone advanced and effective tool. The MBDS is a user friendly tool developed by Equinox in association with Stochastic LLC (US). He shared examples highlighted the functioning of this tool, and how it can handle both batch and continuous distillations.

Prathamesh Kulkarni, from ACS International India discussed the CAS' SciFinder Tool, which is a research discovery application that provides integrated access to the world's most comprehensive and authoritative source of references, substances and reactions. With the help of case studies, he explained the functioning of CAS SciFinder Tool to find green synthetic routes for API molecules, various green reactions and 'green' solvent reactions; and various other parameters as required.

Dr Shailaja Donempudi, Senior Principal Scientist, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) in her talk briefly shared the journey of 75 years and the focus areas as evolved over the years at IICT. She also shared various case-studies and examples where-in the institute demonstrated development of sustainable and robust 'green' solutions in the areas of multistep and asymmetric synthesis, flow chemistry, parallel synthesis, biotransformations, bench scale level to pilot plant facility, technology for organo-fluoro chemistry, reactors for gas and liquid phase reactions, photochemical reactions, and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction.

The second session on GC&E solutions and technologies for process manufacturing and operations level, included four presentations, starting with Pratas Baruah, National Sales Head - ACC Geocycle who spoke on the efficacy of 'co-processing' as a sustainable and compliant waste management solution for the pharma API industry. Dr Prashant Waske, Mettler Toledo, presented Mettler Toledo's expertise in offering process safety and process optimisation engineering solutions while Ankur Turakhia discussed a 'green' approach to ZLD, Sugam Pariyavaran Vikalp's innovation ZLD solution of ""Constructed Geological Filter System"".

The last presentation in the seminar was by Megha Shanbhag, Business Development Manager, Newreka Green Synth Technologies who discussed their RecycleSource solutions for API and the pharma industry. He elaborated on the current reality of this industry generating multiple effluent streams with widely differing quantities and characteristics. Taking into account this reality, Newreka's platform technologies are developed for recycling effluent streams in early stage pharma synthesis, particularly for those API molecules which are high in volume and thus high in effluent. With relevant examples and successful case-studies, she shared Neweka's platform technologies and the customer-friendly business model.

The conference was followed by one-day workshop for teachers and students on ""Essential Tools and Guides for Green Chemistry Education and Research,"" held at K J Somaiya College of Science and Commerce, Mumbai."

New office hours to suit your body - Times of India","The Times of India",FALSE,"A few years ago, scientists conducted a real-world experiment at a ThyssenKrupp steel factory in Germany. They assigned the day shift to early risers and the late shift to night owls.

Soon the steel workers, many of whom had been skeptical at the outset, were getting an extra hour of sleep on work nights. By simply aligning work schedules with people's internal clocks, the researchers had helped people get more and better rest.

""They got 16% more sleep, almost a full night's length over the course of the week,"" said Till Roenneberg, a chronobiologist at Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich, who headed the study.

PERFECT BALANCE: By simply aligning work schedules with people's internal clocks, the researchers had helped people get more and better rest.

In recent years, American educators have been paying increased attention to their students' sleep needs, with growing debate about delaying school start times. Now a number of businesses are following suit, encouraging their employees to work when their bodies are most awake.

""It's a huge financial burden not to sleep properly,"" Dr Roenneberg said. ""The estimates go toward 1% of gross national product,"" both in the US and Germany.

Emerging science reveals that each of us has an optimal time to fall asleep and wake up, a personalised biological rhythm known as a ""chronotype."" When you don't sleep at the time your body wants to sleep you don't sleep as well or as long, setting the stage not only for fatigue, poor work performance and errors but also health problems ranging from heart disease and obesity to anxiety and depression.

Around 80% of people have work schedules that clash with their internal clocks, said Céline Vetter, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado.""If we consider your individual chronotype and your work hours, the chances are high that there's quite a bit of misalignment,"" Dr Vetter said.

Studies on workers in the call center of a mobile phone company, a packaging manufacturer and an oil transportation company show that these employees are more stressed and may experience more work-related discomfort and pain. A 2015 Harvard Medical School study found that for night owls, working during the day increases diabetes risk.

Among the companies seeking to remedy the problem is Southwest Airlines, which allows pilots to choose between morning and evening flight schedules. The US Navy traded an 18-hour submarine shift schedule for a 24-hour one that more closely matches sailors' biological rhythms. And at some pharmaceutical, software and financial companies, managers expect employees to come to the office for only a few hours in the middle of the day -- or to work off site entirely.

A survey released last year found that 97% of workers have at least one risk factor for fatigue, with 27% reporting having unintentionally fallen asleep on the job in the previous month and 16% that they had experienced at least one safety incident because of fatigue.

Dr Roenneberg has collected data from 300,000 people and found that chronotypes plot as a bell-shaped curve, with a few individuals at each extreme and most falling somewhere in the middle. According to Dr Roenneberg, the most frequent chronotype -- held by 13% of the population -- sleeps from midnight to 8am. Around 31% of people have an earlier natural bedtime, and 56% have a later one. That means for at least 69% of the population, getting to the office by 8 or 9am requires waking up before their body is ready.

Chronotype also orchestrates predictable peaks and troughs of energy over the course of the 24-hour day. The ""window of circadian low"" -- the hours when the body is least adapted for wakefulness -- occurs between 2am and 6am.

A 2018 survey by the Society for Human Resource Management, which represents 300,000 HR professionals in 165 countries, found that 57% of its members offer flexible hours, 5% more than in 2014.

For many, the answer may be delaying work start times. Since many are in the middle of the chronotype continuum and wake naturally around 8 or 9am, such a modest shift could provide widespread relief."

""However, he was crushed to death under the wheels,"" said the PSI

One person was killed and 24 school students were injured when an overcrowded bus returning from a picnic in Madhya Pradesh met with an accident Tuesday morning in Gujarat's Panchmahal district, said police. The private luxury bus, hired by an Ahmedabad-based school for picnic, fell into a roadside pit after the driver lost control over the vehicle at Parvadi village near Godhra, around 130km from here, said Police Sub-Inspector M V Jotana.

According to an FIR lodged at the Godhra taluka police station, the bus was hired by the Vivekanand Hindi Higher Secondary School, situated in the Narol area of Ahmedabad. The mishap took place when the bus, packed with 107 passengers, including schoolchildren and teachers, was returning to Ahmedabad from Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, where they had gone for a picnic. While the cleaner of the bus, Balram Bhadoria, died in the accident, its driver fled the spot, said Panchmahal District Superintendent of Police Leena Patil.

""The bus slipped into a roadside pit after the driver lost control over the vehicle. While 24 students received minor injuries, the cleaner died as he jumped from the moving bus to save his life,"" said Patil. The injured students were shifted to the Godhra Civil Hospital for treatment, she said. Primary investigations by the police revealed negligence on part of the school management as the bus was carrying 107 passengers, way beyond its capacity, said Patil.

""The bus driver fled from the spot after the accident. The bus was indeed over-crowded. Apart from students, there were teachers and their family members in the bus. We have lodged a case against the driver and others,"" said the SP. Based on a complaint filed by one of the parents, Radheshyam Prajapati, the Godhra taluka police lodged the FIR against the unidentified driver, bus operator Sitaram Sharma and the school owner, Panjabilal, said the police.

They were booked under various sections of the IPC, including 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 279 (rash driving) and 337 (causing injury by rash act). According to PSI Jotana, the capacity of the bus was just 58, against which 107 people, including 70 students, were in the vehicle at the time of accident. ""The bus stopped only after hitting a tree. To save his life, the cleaner jumped from the bus when it started slipping into a pit along the road.

It has been republished from The Quint's archives on the anniversary of the deadly tsunami that hit Chennai in 2004.)

A brown stained building with a roof torn and windows shattered stood in Keechankuppam, a small fishing hamlet in Nagapattinam.

After the tsunami waves had calmed down and people came out of their safe shelters, they were rattled by sight in front of them. It took a long while for families to pick up the broken pieces of their lives and start over. Help poured in from everywhere and people began moving away from the coast into homes built by the government. New utensils and books were bought and memorials were built.

But this school in the village was left abandoned because the building was ruined beyond repair. There was a sense of fear looming over it.

80 children who studied in the school died in the tsunami.

I was 10 when the tsunami struck. We ran away and returned when everything was normal again. I wondered what the school would be like. The then Principal sent word to all friends of the kids who died in the tsunami, so I went to school and my teachers told that most of our friends had died... My best friend Sathyavani too. Even today I cannot forget her face.Kokila, who is now working as a teacher in the same school

Fast forward to 2017 - The school which was once in ruins has been recognised by the Tamil Nadu government as one of the best schools in the state with the highest number of children joining every year.

The Fear Is Real

Situated between the river and the sea, the people in the village feared sending their children to this school again.

The scene of giant waves gobbling up the school haunted them. Gradually, the strength of the school went down to just 92 in 2012, from 428 in 2004.

The school had to be renovated and so a teacher working in a village nearby was called in to give the school a second lease of life.

When the Going Gets Tough

A new school building came up in 2008. But still there were no kids joining school. Balu joined as the Principal of the school in 2013 and he took it upon himself to transform the lives of the children.

People of the village told him that if the school had facilities like no other, then they would fight their fears and send their children to school.

To begin with, he installed a projector and turned one of the classes into a smart classroom. By the next year, the entire school was turned 'smart' and everyone started looking up to Balu's school.

In 2015, 134 kids joined and the school was recognised by the Tamil Nadu state government as the school with the second largest number of children joining school in the state.

To overcome fear, we brought in smart classes and made the school worth coming to. Once the school got the reputation, many children came in. Today, at the cost for 45 lakhs, given by officers and the village, the school has become what it is today.R Balu, Principal

Balu got tsunami ravaged discarded furniture from banks and offices, repaired and polished them. Today, every classroom has tables with drawers and lockers.

Making wealth out of waste, literally, and a small reminder of the hardships they've endured.

Putting Private Schools to Shame

The school today has everything that a private school offers in terms of infrastructure. The classrooms are Wi-Fi enabled, it has science and computer labs, RO drinking water facilities, clean toilets, a huge playground, greenery all around, interactive classes, laptops and even a rooftop garden !

In the book, there will be only one picture, but here we have so much more. We can see places where we can never go in real life. For example, we usually see only one picture of Taj Mahal from the outside, but now we get to see what the roof looks like, what stones it us made of. I want to come to school without bunking a single day. Tamilarasi, Student

They have a recognised Parent Teachers' Association and conduct regular meetings to address grievances. The management works in the way Parliament does - the Principal is the President, teachers are the chief ministers and the children are in charge of departments like sanitation and hygiene.

For the Village, by the Village

The school's transformation was possible owing to the overwhelming support from the villagers, service organisations and government departments.

The village was impressed with the efforts of the Principal and so requested him to give a list of items that they can donate to the school.

Just like a wedding where the family goes on a procession with gifts for their daughter, the villagers prayed at the local temple and walked to the school with fruits, vegetables, tables, chairs, stationery, black boards, skeletons, equipment for the labs and whatever each one could donate.

One of the fisherfolk who didn't have the money to donate, gave a box of chalk pieces as a token of gratitude for building such a remarkable school.

But the Principal has bigger plans - at least five laptops for each classroom, exclusive computer science and physical education teachers, and school buses.

Showering Laurels

The PU school is one among 11 in its category in the State, and 100 in the country, to receive the Swachh Vidyalaya Puraska. The school got the coveted ISO stamp and was honoured with the Kamarajar Best School award by the Tamil Nadu state government.

Balu was awarded the Best Teacher National award by former President Pranab Mukherjee.

Memories Linger On

The school has a memorial set up for remembering those children who lost their lives to the tsunami.

The children who were traumatised by the deaths of their classmates are today serving as teachers in the same school.

Dear children, had you been alive, we would have given you such good education. Today you have not died, you have sowed the seeds of prosperity. Soon the children here will someday become IAS, IFS, IRS officers and you children should bless them all with such big dreams. An ode from Principal R Balu to the children who died in the tsunami

Engineering college students came up with many interesting ideas like identifying which company is manufacturing more plastic from the garbage that the company generates or how citizens can file a complaint with the authorities to solve pothole problems in their area.

The 'Project Deep Blue' encourages engineering and management students to solve real-life social problems using their technological skills. The mandate for the students is to come with meaningful technical solutions over a course of three months for the problems that they have identified which have an impact nationally and internationally.

Third Year students of DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering Juhi Shah, Rahil Sarvaiya and Shomil Shah chose the challenges of implementing the plastic ban as a problem and came with their solution.

Shomil Shah, one of the student said, ""This project is focused on profiling the plastic waste and litter which is disposed of in our nearby garbage dumps. Citizens simply need to click pictures of garbage and upload onto the software that we are making. Just by clicking a mere picture of a garbage dump, the algorithm can identify wrappers, packets etc. and also identify the product brand and backtrack it to its respective manufacturer. Through this, we can create a graph, which can tell us which manufacturers are the major contributors to the plastic waste in our country.""

Another student explaining their project on citizen's problems, Aniruddh Chandratraye, from NMIMS Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management and Engineering, said, ""The intent of our solution is to build a centralised platform wherein citizens from a particular zone can report about problems arising in their area, such as, potholes by simply taking a picture from their mobile device and uploading it to our system using the website or the application. The system will use its technologies to determine the severity of the road damage and will come up with an estimated cost of repair. This can be then verified by real humans and the repair work can be completed. ""

A review of the work completed can also be done after the pothole repair is completed, informed Chandratraye."

The past decade has witnessed an exponential rise in the adoption of smartphones, internet connectivity and e-commerce. This has subsequently opened up the entire country to smaller retailers and manufacturers.

In this backdrop, with the rise of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) adopting e-commerce, the next pillar of sustained growth will be to tap into global markets. Invest India, the National Investment Promotion and Facilitation Agency of the government of India (under the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion), partnered with Yes Bank Transformation Series, will present this challenge to the brightest minds across B-schools and tech institutes for crowd sourcing perspectives and solutions on how MSMEs can build momentum on growth and capture opportunities presented by global markets.

Yes Bank Transformation Series, which has emerged as an idea crowd sourcing platform has partnered with national institutions over the last three years, seeking to find answers to nationwide challenges. In 2016, the platform had partnered with the ministry of new and renewable energy, government of India, with students tackling the challenge of increasing the usage of roof top solar and making it viable. Last year, in partnership with Atal Innovation Mission, NITI Aayog, the platform sought ideas on the Indian government's ambitious goal of doubling farmer income by 2022 through technology interventions.

The Grand Finale of the 7th edition of Yes Bank Transformation Series witnessed 41 students comprising 15 teams from top educational institutes address themes on how to increase B2C exports from India, initiatives to promote India as a leader in MSME exports, and how Indian MSMEs can further leverage global opportunities. The solutions were presented to an eminent advisory council comprising subject matter experts and senior representatives from Invest India.

The sizeable impact of e-commerce on India's MSME sector supplemented by policy, market and technology interventions are the need of the hour to ensure prosperity for associated industries and the Indian economy as a whole. The forthcoming national e-commerce policy aimed at levelling the playing field for foreign and domestic players, offers significant opportunities for the MSME sector.

Rana Kapoor, managing director and chief executive officer, Yes Bank, said: ""Over the last five years, this platform which we created as a case study challenge has now become an innovator's club -- visualizing and actualizing innovations not only for us and our partner organizations but also for national challenges set by government agencies. Some of the ideas presented today, if implemented, have the potential to be game changers in the MSME space, and this is a matter of great pride for us. For us and for tomorrow's leaders who are an integral part of the Transformation Series, the challenge next year would be to co-create solutions using emerging technologies like AI/ML, blockchain, big data, which can directly be implemented across sectors.""

At the finale, Deepak Bagla, managing director and CEO of Invest India, said: ""MSMEs are the pillar of India's economic growth, contributing over 28% to India's GDP (gross domestic product). Today, MSMEs are embracing e-commerce as an opportunity to increase their geographical reach and access at minimal costs. Proactive support from the government and increased awareness will help create an online presence with access to a global audience. I believe the Yes Bank Transformation Series is a great initiative to catalyse growth of this sector by leveraging the brightest minds towards ensuring that MSMEs can benefit from the undeniable advantages of online platforms.""

The significance of the journey of over 100 days filtered into the morning session of the Grand Finale 2018 on 28 November. The top 15 teams arrived and presented exhaustive solutions to the advisory council. After an intensive round of debate, discussions and deliberation, it was decided that three teams had finally conquered.

'B Squad' from IIM-Bangalore edged out 'A Team Has No Name' (Indian Institute of Foreign Trade) and 'Cryptonite' (SJSOM, IIT Bombay) to win the Yes Bank Transformation Series 2018 award. ""At the finale, I was amazed by the ideas and the depth of the solutions presented by all participating teams. The judging panel was very diverse with industry experts from multiple domains. The questions asked by the panellists were very thought-provoking and also helped us in realizing the possible areas of improvement and further research, which we hadn't even thought of. And lastly, it was an amazing feeling when I realized that we had won,"" said Farhan Ansari, a member of the winning team from IIM-Bangalore.

The winners were awarded ₹5 lakh, the runner-up received ₹3 lakh, and the second runner-up won ₹2 lakh.

Samanvay, an ecosystem to bring together disconnected bodies, processes and policies. The platform will be fortified with a comprehensive micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) e-export policy to ensure coordination between government bodies, private companies and MSMEs in driving business-to-consumer, or B2C, e-commerce export growth.

Project Disha will be the on-boarding and pull initiative under Samanvay at the district level, aimed at assisting micro, small and medium enterprises to develop internet/e-commerce literacy.

This would enable on-boarding of MSMEs (generating awareness of required approvals/licences), sustainability (via single-point nodal body for all issues), and support through creating awareness on best practices, quality standards and technology.

Project Vihaan, regulated by the MSME Export Council, will provide targeted marketing assistance based on country of export and category of export, make cluster-specific marketing policies and provide brand building assistance.

First Runner-Up: A Team Has No Name, IIFT

For promotion of cross border e-commerce, the team recommended a four-pronged strategy to be implemented by the government-consolidation of rules and regulations through a single government policy for e-commerce, aggregator-led MSME cluster development model, amendments to foreign trade policy and simplification of customs, set-up e-commerce pilot zones to offer integrated services such as customs clearance, registration of goods, and bonded warehousing.

The team also proposed an e-commerce initiative called UnboxIndia, a campaign for an assorted gift box of authentic local Indian products to customers abroad, packaged as an experience.

Second Runner-Up: Cryptonite, Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management, IIT-Bombay

The team proposed a single national digital platform for MSMEs to obtain information and submit documents, and to provide them with the facility of bonded warehouses to allow storage, distribution and logistics operations of goods awaiting clearance from customs duties in the destination country.

Another salient solution presented includes leveraging and scaling the infrastructure of Indian postal system to provide a coordinated, interoperable monitoring platform for tracking shipments."

Indian cricket has many legends and Vangipurapu Venkata Sai Laxman, or VVS Laxman, as he is more popularly called, easily finds a place among them. His famous knock of 281 at the Eden Gardens Test match made history and it is this landmark game that forms the title of his biography, ""281 and Beyond"" that released last month. Fans of the now retired player get a glimpse of his life, dreams and relationships, all of which have made him the man he is, reports Ram Teja and Sumit Singh.

Indian cricket has been marked by many milestones, but there is one that stands out in particular, the famous Eden Garden test of 2001 between India and Australia. At the heart of the match was V.V.S. Laxman's knock of 281, which has been described as the catalyst that changed the way India played the game in the years afterwards.

Earlier, Australia's Steve Waugh had vanquished the Indians in Mumbai and was on the verge of conquering the ""final frontier"" with the team looking for a record 17 consecutive test wins. The situation looked grim for India in the second test too as the team folded for 175 in the first innings. It was then that Laxman went on to play one of the finest innings of his career and not unexpectedly, it is with this that he introduces us to his book ""281 and Beyond"" which he has co-authored with R. Kaushik.

A part of the famous ""Fab Four"" of Indian cricket, consisting of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly, who formed the bedrock of the team, Laxman was the last entrant into this quartet and perhaps the likeliest one to take the fall if the team failed, in his view.

Laxman dwells on his childhood in the 1970s in a family that prioritized education over any other career. His father being a doctor, it was presumed he would follow suit and study medicine. But he had other ideas and his uncle, who encouraged him to play cricket, enrolled him in a nearby academy. As Laxman made his mark in the under age-group cricket, he realised that the sport was his calling and he would soon give it his all. Former India captain, Azharrudin was already a popular player in the Hyderabad circuit and Laxman's idol.

Finding fault with the fact that Hyderabad cricket was misconstrued as ""lazy and laidback"" in the domestic circuit in the 1990s, he recalls his determination to erase that image and make the Hyderabad team on par with the elite teams of Mumbai, Karnataka, and Bengal.

He also talks of his anguish at missing out on the Ranji trophy in the 1999-2000 season, where he amassed 1,415 runs at an average of 108 in nine matches, notching up eight hundreds. Hyderabad went on to lose to Mumbai in the final and Laxman found no solace in being the top run-getter without the Ranji trophy, although he set a record that is till today the benchmark for any domestic cricketer. His account takes you back to times when Hyderabad was actually a force to reckon with and not the pale shadow of its former self that it has become today. Laxman recollects that he even pondered quitting the game when he failed to make it to the team for the 2003 World Cup in South Africa. Although the disappointment left a deep impact on him , he soon managed to overcome that dull period and go on to have a purple patch in the one-day format in the triangular ODI series that followed against Australia and Zimbabwe Down Under.

His relationship with most of his coaches has been well documented in the book and there is nothing that catches an ardent follower of the game off guard. John Wright, who was the coach from 2001 and oversaw the integration of Laxman into the team, is spoken of with high regard and so is Gary Kirsten, well known for his man-management skills. The bond the team shared with Kirsten was evident in Cape Town in 2011, when he invited all the players to his home for dinner. When Gary announced that the 2011 World Cup would be his last assignment with the Indian team, all the players pleaded with his wife to allow him to stay on, indicating their great appreciation for him.

Laxman's tumultuous relationship with Greg Chappel, however, has a similar ring to the one Sourav Ganguly shared with the Aussie. While complaining about his lack of man-management skills and his way of functioning, Laxman offers objective criticism, saying he had the utmost respect for Greg the batsman, but not the coach. ""He was brusque and abrasive, highly opinionated and rigid in his thinking. His man-management skills were non-existent. He quickly sowed further seeds of discontent in an already diffident team,"" he recalls.

His admiration for his teammates stands out as he dedicates a separate chapter to them, describing the camaraderie he shared with his contemporaries, Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly.

The decision to retire was apparently made with no second thoughts although he could have gone out after making one last appearance in his home ground of Hyderabad after the disastrous tour of Australia in 2011-12.

Laxman signs off speaking of his dream to manage a school for underprivileged children, indicating he has already moved on to the next innings of his life.

281 is a 'very, very, special' number

It was an evening of nostalgia and much back thumping as one of the greats of Indian cricket, V.V.S. Laxman released his autobiography, 281 and Beyond, in the city on Thursday in the company of other greats, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and Javagal Srinath.

In the audience too were legends like Gundappa Vishwanath, Roger Binny, Syed Kirmani and Dodda Ganesh. Former Karnataka batsman and local boy, Robin Uthappa was also present with his wife, Sheetal.

Noted journalist from Bengaluru, R Kaushik, who has co-authored the book, wasn't present at the event because he was in Australia reporting on the ongoing India-Australia series.

Said Laxman about the book, ""281 is a very satisfying number although a lot of people feel that I should see it as my unlucky number because I got out on it. 281 and Beyond is about what took place after that experience in my career and before, which includes my childhood and early days of playing cricket. It's important for parents to identify the unique talent of their children. If you encourage that, the sky is the limit and nothing is impossible. In the family background that I came from no one would have dreamt, including I, that I would be playing for India one day.""

Recalling the momentous day at Eden Gardens when he partnered with Rahul Dravid, Laxman added, ""It was kind of living in the present because we were 274 runs behind and we didn't have the chance to think about what had happened or what was going to happen. The reality was it was a terrible situation for us to be in. So we broke it down into small goals. As individuals, we wanted to play each and every ball to its merit and at the end of each over we would encourage each other to play the best we could in the next.""

Commenting on Laxman's fascinating journey, Dravid recalled, ""Laxman already had a reputation when he came to play for the under -19. For me it was an incredible experience to watch him bat. He was known to be the next big thing from Hyderabad after Azharuddin. To have someone like Laxman, who is so disciplined in our team, challenged me to up my game.""

Kumble admitted he had missed watching the Kolkata 281 match. ""But I was fortunate to watch the Adelaide test, where they scored 300 and I also probably had a great feeling that we were going to win the test match at that point in time,"" he smiled."

The private luxury bus, hired by an Ahmedabad-based school for picnic, fell into a roadside pit after the driver lost control over the vehicle at Parvadi village near Godhra, around 130km from here, said Police Sub-Inspector M V Jotana.

According to an FIR lodged at the Godhra taluka police station, the bus was hired by the Vivekanand Hindi Higher Secondary School, situated in the Narol area of Ahmedabad.

The mishap took place when the bus, packed with 107 passengers, including schoolchildren and teachers, was returning to Ahmedabad from Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, where they had gone for a picnic.

While the cleaner of the bus, Balram Bhadoria, died in the accident, its driver fled the spot, said Panchmahal District Superintendent of Police Leena Patil.

There are more than 4.5 million manual scavengers in India and till 2013, there were about 22327 reported cases of death. Vimal has created a robot called Bandicoot that can get into manholes and clean them. It uses jets of water to clear blockages in the sewage system. Vimal's company also trains manual scavengers to operate the machine. ""I hope with time the problem of manual scavenging will be eradicated,"" he said.

""Story telling is a part of our tradition. Even the social media platforms are used to share stories."" Dharani stressed on the importance of audience-artist connection and gave an example of how an old lady in the audience forgot that what she was watching was but a make-believe play and she rushed to comfort a child on stage who was crying out to his mother for food! Dharani said he wanted to inspire more people to involve themselves with theatre.

He urged the audience to understanding their region, experiment, explore and evolve for a sustainable tomorrow.

After a short performance she spoke about passion, ambition and fame. ""I think diligence is more important than passion. It is not about money or reaching a particular goal.

The diapers ad that shows up on your computer when you are expecting a child. The coupon on your smartphone for a fast-food chain you just walked past. The sneaker offer appearing in your mailbox after you sign up to run a race. For years, marketers and technology companies have crept further into the homes and habits of Americans, arguing all the while that there is a fair and voluntary exchange taking place. The more we know about you, the argument goes, the more we can show you products you actually want instead of ads that just annoy you. Consumers, they say, are happily trading very specific information about their lives in order to receive this kind of personalized advertising and marketing -- relevant ads, as the industry calls them.

Joseph Turow, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has studied the topic for years and vigorously disagrees with that interpretation. Research by Turow and his colleagues has found that most Americans give up data for relevant ads not because of convenience, but resignation. Rather than participating in a rational exchange, he argues, consumers are giving up their personal information with ""a feeling of futility.""

""People are very uncomfortable with surveillance but they don't know what to do,"" Turow said about the research, which involved a telephone survey of about 1,500 people across the country this year and in 2015. ""In the real world, not having a frequent shopper card at the supermarket means you're going to lose 15 to 20 per cent on purchases. It's very difficult for people to give up Facebook if all their friends are on Facebook."" He added, ""It's that calculus people have, rather than, geez, this is a rational decision I'm making because I know this is what I have to do.""

Turow is among the academics, privacy advocates and regulators who have long been critical of how companies extricate vast amounts of personal information from consumers in the digital world. In 2018, it became harder for the tech and media industries to ignore those voices, with more consumers and lawmakers discovering how extensive, secretive and unstoppable data collection can be. This year has seen a string of revelations about how Facebook mishandled data from its users, even sharing their private messages with large corporations like Spotify and Netflix. Tech executives have regularly appeared before Congress and been grilled about their companies' practices. European lawmakers passed a sweeping privacy law in Europe, known as the General Data Protection Regulation. That was followed by a California state law on privacy, which its advocates hoped would serve as a model for the nation.

New questions emerged around how Google allows outside companies to scan and share data from consumers' Gmail accounts. Companies were found to be using our smartphones to watch our every step. The rise of internet-connected devices in the home has turned everything from televisions to children's thermometers into tools for targeted advertising. And that's just a sampling.

""We know we've got work to do to regain people's trust,"" Steve Satterfield, director of privacy and public policy at Facebook, said in a statement. ""Protecting people's information requires stronger teams, better technology, and clearer policies, and that's where we've been focused for most of 2018.""

Google did not respond to a request for comment.

The topic didn't suddenly materialize this year -- The Wall Street Journal broke major ground on digital surveillance with its award-winning series ""What They Know"" in 2010. But at that time Facebook was not yet public, and Google was a fraction of its current size. Digital tracking has since become far more pervasive and intertwined with peoples' daily lives -- advertisements follow them from their computers to their phones and even their TVs -- and often, it can feel inescapable. Recently, Facebook told Gizmodo that even if people opt out of location sharing with the social network, it can still determine their location and use it for targeted advertising.

""There are so many aspects of how companies deal with the public that obfuscates what actually goes on and so many attempts to placate people using jargon,"" Turow said. ""I've spoken to lawyers who write privacy policies who admit -- they admit -- that they aren't written for the public.""

In their survey this year, researchers led by Turow found that most Americans did not understand privacy policies on websites. More than half did not know the correct answer to this true-or-false statement: ""If a website has a privacy policy, that means the site won't share user information with other sites or companies without permission."" (The statement is false.) The researchers also found that most Americans did not know that companies can legally collect and keep personal data on 13-year-olds as if they are adults. Companies are able to do that because the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law, only extends to children who are 12 and under.

""I would argue that's because people can't imagine that the law would allow this kind of attitude,"" Turow said. The researchers conducted national surveys in 2015 and 2018, working with two polling companies to interview a representative sample of Americans on their landlines and cellphones.

The findings are particularly notable as tech companies and marketers argue that individuals should be responsible for understanding and navigating all of these policies and their privacy settings. Some people may delete Facebook, but what about Instagram and WhatsApp? Avoiding Google for search purposes is one thing. Then try avoiding Gmail, YouTube and Waze. Advertisers are watching closely as Americans question these services. They are the ones, after all, paying to use all this data to send messages to the right consumers. There is a stark difference between targeting consumers who are eagerly sharing their information for so-called relevance, and targeting those who have given up, and who may not even understand how, exactly, their data is being collected and interpreted.

Still, little has been said publicly. While some ad agency executives have criticized Facebook in recent weeks, other executives have sought to neutralize those remarks. Last month, Rishad Tobaccowala, chief growth officer of advertising firm Publicis Groupe, questioned Facebook's moral compass in an interview with The New York Times. Shortly after, Facebook distributed more conciliatory comments from Arthur Sadoun, chief executive of Publicis. Sadoun acknowledged the company's issues but added, ""We believe that the management is taking the right decisions that are going in the right direction.""

A similar reaction emerged after the chief executive of the agency Initiative said in a LinkedIn post that he would advise his clients to halt advertising on Facebook based on its ""egregious behavior"" involving consumer data. Michael Roth, chief executive of the Interpublic Group, which owns Initiative, quickly told The Wall Street Journal that the company would continue to ""work closely with our media partners,"" including Facebook.

""There's no question in my mind that Americans see privacy as an important issue,"" Turow said. ""The question is: What do you do about it?"""

Bustling streets, narrow lanes, enormous flocks of people and animals moving together in synchrony, loud chatter and a perpetual aroma of delicious biryani and kebabs are some of the highlights of the Hazrat Nizamuddin Basti in Delhi.

This description more often than not would translate to chaos, however in case of this basti, these are the very aspects that are strangely welcoming and uplifting. The locality is predominantly a Muslim one with a small percentage of Hindus and Christians. The gallis are cramped with hawkers selling garlands, incense, bags and shoes, jewellery and silver utensils among other products.

The basti is named after the Sufi saint, Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya, who is buried in the heart of the village in a dargah. People from all faiths come here for its calm, peaceful ambience. An old man at the dargah, who was diagnosed with cancer, found renewed energy here, and testifies to the many others who arrive 'sick' or 'possessed', and find healing here.

Buried here is also, Amir Khusrow, the saint's favourite disciple. The baoli here is not without memories for children who have see it change, from the clear water to the murky state it exists in today. A legend that is often heard is of the making of the baoli, which was being built around the same time at the Tughlaqabad fort, commissioned by Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq, in the 14th century. Labourers would work both at the fort and the baoli, much to the ire of the Emperor. To put an end to this the king banned the sale of the oil which was used to light lamps that aided the workers to work at night in Nizamuddin. It is believed that as a response the saint set fire to the water in the baoli, which provided enough illumination for the workers. It's believed that Tughlaqabad was cursed, and it faced issues of construction and water shortage.

Sukanya Amir, who came to the basti as a child, says that the reason for the large population in the area was because people wanted to be physically close to the saint. Her father was one such believer. The desire to be close to the saint extends beyond living near the dargah. People also wish to be buried near him. It is for this reason that Mirza Ghalib, the famous 19th century poet and a known devotee of the saint, was buried close to the dargah.

Walking through the lanes, one finds scattered, unidentified tombs probably across centuries. It is also not uncommon to have graves inside homes. Upon being asked if it feels odd to live with a tomb inside a home, Sukanya said, ""Jaise aapke ghar mein sofe aur tv normal hain, waise hamare liye kabar. Bachpan se dekhe aa rahe hain aur ab aadat pad gayi hai. (Sofas and TVs are normal in your home. The same way, tombs are in ours. We've seen them around us since our childhood and now we are used to them).""

The Hazrat Nizamuddin Basti has seen nearly 700 years of tradition and cultures. People from different regions have come and settled around the dargah bringing a little of their own heritage. It is important that the amalgamation of these diverse cultures, which has been adopted in the area, is preserved and protected alongside the monuments and history of the region. The Aga Khan Foundation is engaged in a robust restoration programme in the locality since 2007.

Among the several initiatives, a major one is the annual Apni Basti Mela which was organised from December 21 to 23. It celebrated the food, art and music of Nizamuddin. Organised in the Outer Park of the basti, this is not a location Google maps recognises. One must navigate through the lanes of the village to find their way from the dargah to reach the park.

Colourful handmade decorations on trees and poles provided the perfect aesthetic for a bright and lively village fair. Several stalls selling handicraft items, local ayurvedic products, wooden utensils, Urdu calligraphy frames and mouthwatering Mughlai food could be found. The large number of school students kept themselves engaged with games such as live snakes and ladders and hop-scotch.

A stall attracting large crowds and attention was the Insha-e-Noor stall. Insha-e-Noor is an NGO which encourages the women living in basti to be financially independent by involving them in the making and selling of products such as diaries, key chains, earrings, dream catchers, table clothes and other such artefacts. These can be made at home or at their collective workplace. The degree of flexibility and independence provided finds many takers in the basti.

A stage was also set up where school children enacted plays on social issues. One of the topics was 'good touch and bad touch', which was very relevant and informative considering the large number of children present at the fair.

Other initiatives taken up by the Aga Khan Foundation include Zaika- E- Nizamuddin to supply nutritious food to people. A workshop was organised on the nuances of the local cuisine. Sanitation, education, health, computer training, waste management and heritage awareness initiatives were also held.

Sair-E- Nizamuddin is another project which trains locals about their neighbourhood and its history allowing them to conduct tours for outsiders. At the moment, tours are available for the basti, Humanyun's tomb and Sunder Nursery. The white marble monument, Chausath Khamba, with its lit up facade created the appropriate mood for the evening performances."

Sirsa has issued a show cause notice to GK's close confidant and former DSGMC media adviser Parminder Pal Singh and removed him from post.

In the notice, Sirsa raised question on the bills raised by a PR agency which were approved by the former media adviser. He ordered the removal of Parminder Pal on Saturday and sent him a notice, stating that bills of PR firm 'Mahajan Communications' appeared fake, fabricated and exorbitant. In fact, the notice even implicated GK, as it mentioned that these were approved first by Parminder Pal and then by the DSGMC president last month. Giving time of three days, Sirsa asked him why should action not be initiated against him. Sirsa also constituted a two-member committee to investigate the ""fake bills"" and got the office of media adviser locked.

Parminder Pal on his Facebook posted that the notice was issued to him in ati-utsah (hurry). He said the PR firm was engaged for projection of various tasks undertaken by DSGMC and he signed the bills only after seeing the results produced by the firm. Denying any wrongdoing, he said, ""My three kids are studying in a DSGMC school and they were entitled to a fee-waiver for being amritdhari (an initiated Sikh initiated into the Khalsa) but I never availed that and paid fee of Rs 15 lakh to the school for six years. I provided my services on honorary basis and never drew a single penny for that."" Asked if it was the result of tussle between GK and Sirsa, he refused to comment.

GK, other office-bearers and executive members have already resolved to hold elections three months before the schedule. The DSGMC chief has handed over the charge to vice-president Harmeet Singh Kalka, while Sirsa is holding his office. Ten days back SAD president Sukhbir Badal had also dissolved party units in Delhi, Rajasthan and UP.

In his reply submitted to Kalka and Sirsa, that the notice was ""false, misconceived and devoid of any merits"" and amounted to ""misuse of power"", He also pointed out that no letter or notice was sent to him earlier.

In the evening a circular, dated December 22, 2018, and signed by the DSGMC general manager, was also sent to mediapersons which mentioned that Parminder Pal had been removed from the post and all statements would now be issued by Sirsa or Kalka. Meanwhile SAD office secretary and spokesperson Charanjit Singh Brar confirmed that Parminder Pal had been removed from the post of national spokesperson of the party.

GK has said that he would not hold office of religious body till he is cleared of allegations of corruption levelled against him. He had also said that he was setting a precedent."

UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey told PTI that he is aware of the reports that some schools are asking for Aadhaar cards for student admission. ""This is not right. This is not as per the provisions of law...school admission and other facilities to children cannot be made conditional to production of Aadhaar,"" Pandey said.

""Schools should admit children without Aadhaar and ensure that children are given Aadhaar once they are in schools by arranging special camps for them,"" he added.

UIDAI has asked the school authorities and their management to ensure that no child is denied admission for lack of Aadhaar. Pandey added, doing so would be considered as ""contempt of court"".

The word of caution from UIDAI comes at a time when admissions to nursery and entry-level classes have just begun in over 1,500 private schools in Delhi.

In September this year, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar but clipped the scope of the biometric identity project, ruling it was not mandatory for bank accounts, mobile connections or school admissions.

The apex court held that Aadhaar would remain compulsory for filing of Income Tax (IT) returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN), as well as welfare schemes.

The SC verdict emphasised that it would not be mandatory for school admissions, as also for the examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for medical entrance and the University Grants Commission."

However, now he is bullish on insurance and is aiming to grow the business through mergers and acquisitions. Other areas of interest include real estate, angel investment, and senior living and hospitality. Singh said he will decide on new business ideas after the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.

Edited excerpts:

When we met two years ago, you were very bullish on the healthcare business. What has changed?

Frankly, its a time-in-life question...between two years ago and now, the business arena has moved very substantially. Every sector and every business is more competitive and in every sector margins are under stress...in every sector, talent availability is also becoming a challenge, retention is becoming a challenge...basically, any successful business is seen with a new level of challenge and toxicity of its own kind. So, basically we started to think about how we must balance our portfolio. You cannot do everything with the same level of commitment and same level of growth. In that sense, the business, which is the most demanding in terms of capital, in terms of time, to maintain adequate margin is healthcare...It is still not an organized sector...therefore, scale is very important. Scale means capital investment. So, we have to take a call...And, if we deploy the level of capital required to get the scale in the healthcare sector, we are talking about a minimum of 1,000-2,000 beds. So, if you take the rule of thumb number of even ₹1 crore per bed, which is always not the case, in cases of neuro, cardiac and oncology it can go up to ₹3 crores a bed...1,000 beds means ₹2,000-3,000 crore. We do not have that sort of capital available with us. Besides, if I take a look at the succession plan in terms of the management team available, I don't have now 10 years available of life to be able to focus on building Max healthcare to take it to the next level. We are very practical about these things, we are very aware about these things.

So, what happens to your legacy? You wanted to exit the insurance business but that didn't happen. You spoke about real estate, education, manufacturing, etc. We have not seen much action there either.

One year ago we decided not to (venture into) the education business. We were very keen....in 1999-2000...there were four sectors that we had identified--healthcare, insurance, education and hospitality. About six months ago, we decided not to go ahead with education, even after spending two years and having started a team who were going to help us. The truth of the matter is that regulatory forces in the country didn't help us get off the ground in the education space, because if you buy real estate at commercial prices, you can provide education, but you cannot have education business. If you get into any society structure or any existing education institution, you try shutting a school with 500 people you go to jail. Therefore, we dumped education. Manufacturing, I never said. I always said we will be all services sector company and we will hold one manufacturing business for cash...that's what we said and that's what we are doing...we are not going to grow the packaging film business.

What are your priority areas going forward?

Life insurance, real estate, investing, senior living and hospitality.

Hospitality is in your personal capacity, right?

To begin with, even telecom I started as a personal venture....that is simply a question of a capital structure...we started hospitality as a personal business because at that time the demerger of Max India had not happened. And, as a listed company, which had interests in healthcare and insurance, if I had announced that we are getting into hospitality, the stock price would have tanked by 50%. Now that we are building some scale in hospitality...who knows it can continue to be private or may become...a little bit of both. That's just a matter of capital, convenience and timing. And, as you know, our whole history has been to live a life of a listed company--be it in governance, compliance, disclosures, whatever it maybe. So, I am not afraid of listed companies...we like listed businesses. We will run our private businesses exactly the same as we run our listed companies.

What's your overview of the insurance business? You wanted to exit because you thought that the space was too cluttered.

Since the HDFC merger failure we have grown 25%. We are the largest non-bank private life insurance company. So, if you ask me I don't know why the other 18 exist...I can tell you....why we exist... Agency business is growing at 33 -40% month on month. We have just engaged into a renewal refresh exercise with New York Life... They have given us branding support and New York Life just recently acquired 2% of Max financial services. Life insurance is only going one way, which is up.

You have made a name for yourself by creating value, your shareholders have always benefitted...

Right now what I have stated... Let the election come and go... Let some more hiccups happen then we will tell you what are the new things. Life insurance, real estate, investing, senior living and hospitality. There is a huge opportunity in real estate and the key differentiator in real estate is going to be 2-3 things....execution., efficiency, openness, transparency and honesty. Openness, transparency and honesty has not been a feature of a real estate industry. In the investment business, I can be quiet successful because I understand the country, I understand the market and I know people like them. Senior living is exactly like health insurance when we started health insurance for the first 5 years health insurance was a dead duck now why it is climbing up because people have begun to realize that they need health insurance. Senior living will be the same.

What sort of legacy you want to leave behind?

I want to leave a positive legacy and I quote it saying I don't want to leave a legacy of Ranbaxy, Fortis and Vijay Mallya."

A globalised market place, disruptive technological innovations, changing consumption patterns and evolving consumer behavior has led to challenging the existing paradigms.

The premise of education in the current times, especially in the management domain, rests on shifting sands.

Thus, the biggest challenge that B-schools today face is developing learning modules and curriculum that are topical enough to groom the managers of tomorrow.

To address this uncertainty and transformation, the very simple mantra adopted by pro-active B-schools is research. Knowledge dissemination without knowledge creation is no longer conceivable, and hence a structured research strategy is at the helm of most leading B-schools functioning.

However, the dictate of developing contemporary thought and frameworks is not easy. The best of B-schools face constraints which may be in terms of funds or manpower, or both. Further, in case one is examining new phenomena like reverse consumer socialisation (the child mentors the parents/adults about novel practices such as mobile wallets and shopping) or revisiting established paradigms, most B-school may be at a loss to address the complexity of the phenomenon.

However, to tweak an existing cliche - complexity is the mother of invention and innovation. As one examines closely the current management thought that is gaining ground with Academicians and practitioners alike is that collaboration rather than competition is the way forward.

The first level of collaboration that B-schools need to look at is on home-ground, in terms of collaborative efforts across functional domains. The reason for this is that new and altered business scenarios are essentially complex and multi-dimensional.

For example, contextual or content-based marketing models have to be understood from the consumer behavior perspective as well as basic digital marketing strategies. At the same time one cannot ignore the IT interface that is the platform on which this occurs. Thus, to deliver comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon, research needs to be quintessentially cross-functional. This also goes for areas such as management of pricing across aggregated business models.

The other form of collaborative research that B-schools need to undertake is industry-academia interface to comprehend new/altered phenomena. This, in fact, is not a new practice and has been there since the 1900s. Change management practices focused on impact of new strategic business relationships such as alliances, joint ventures, aggregator and outsourced functional models cannot be tabled unless the practitioner and academic partner come together to comprehend the novel phenomenon.

The third level of collaboration is equally critical as this prima-facie is institutional. Each school develops its own research focus and agenda. However, each entity in isolation - both geographically and basis orientation - will be able to conceptualise theories that at best may be restrictive.

Thus, cross-institutional research collaboration is the only approach to deliver generalisable results. For example, to study Technology Adoption Behavior or Talent Management or Entrepreneurship Models; collaborations amongst B-schools across countries or regions will be able to collate information from diverse populations and therefore develop seminal models.

To summarise, the three C's of collaborative research mantras for B-schools:

* Concentrated or complimentary: Collaboration can be concentrated in a single area and school and contribute seminal thought or be based on allied school and domain collaboration.

* Cultural homogeneity or cultural heterogeneity: Collaboration is needed to assess behavior patterns e.g. Fantasy Sports Gaming that may be culturally uniform versus Investment Patterns that may have a contextual underpinning.

* Conceptual framework or concrete application: Whether the knowledge imperative is to develop conceptual models for disruptive innovation strategies or to work out on-ground multi-channel distribution strategies, the complexity demands that research be carried out in the zone of collaboration to deliver both comprehension and implementation.

Thus, collaborative research is no longer a choice but a directive for B-schools today.

The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency told a news conference that another tsunami is a possibility because of the continued volcanic eruptions of Anak Krakatau.

""Recommendations from [the] Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency are that people should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while,"" he said.

""A lot of the children are sick with fevers, headaches and they haven't had enough water,"" said Rizal Alimin, a doctor working for NGO Aksi Cepat Tanggap, at a local school that was turned into a temporary shelter. ""We have less medicine than usual...It's not healthy here for evacuees. There isn't enough clean water. They need food and people are sleeping on the floor.""

"270","1026056213","2018-12-25","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/north-corpn-to-merge-20-of-its-schools-to-create-10/articleshow/67237441.cms","North Delhi Municipal Corporation to merge 20 of its schools to create 10 - Times of India","The Times of India",FALSE,"NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation will close down some its primary schools and merge them with other similar institutions run by it. A proposal for 20 such schools with low enrolment was cleared by the north corporation's House meeting on Monday. These will give rise to 10 new schools.

Located mostly in the Karol Bagh, Narela and Rohini zones, these schools are currently running at places like Inderpuri, Pyare Lal Road, Shahbad Daulatpur, Nimari Colony, Shiv Nagar, Pratap Kunj, Avantika, Sangam Park, Molar Basti, Old Ranjeet Nagar, Azadpur Colony and Auchandi.

A senior corporation official attributed the decision to low enrolment, poor finances, and proper utilisation of resources. He gave the example of the proposal to merge Municipal Corporation Primary School (MCPS) Pyare Lal Road 2 and MCPS New Dev Nagar Co-ed School. ""Keeping in view better management, saving of posts and the poor economic condition of north corporation, it would be feasible to merge schools in case of availability of accommodation,"" he said.

The proposal also argues that more and more parents want to educate their wards in morning-shift schools. ""MCPS Pyarelal Road has 202 kids while the Dev Nagar school has 265. After merger, a school with 467 kids and 12 sections will be formed,"" the official said.

He added: ""There are many vacancies in other schools and the staff from the schools being closed down can be sent there. At the same time, we will be able to use the buildings and other infrastructure for purposes such as sports academies.""

The merger of the two schools alone would lead to a surplus of a principal, five teachers and two Class IV employees who could be reassigned. The official also said that 29 schools with low enrolment had been similarly shut down two years ago. But education experts have been criticising the corporations for their failure to enrol more children.

Khagesh Jha, a Supreme Court lawyer and education activist, remarked, ""If the corporation has extra land, why not add to the capital's school infrastructure so that more kids can be brought in the school system? There are more than 20 lakh kids outside the school system in the city. Besides, children from unrecognised schools too need to be brought to government schools.""

The north civic body runs 714 municipal primary schools, in which children, mostly from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, study. Enrolment in all corporation-run schools, however, has been declining steadily. Around 70,000 students have opted out of north schools since the 2012 trifurcation. It then had 3,70,648 students in its primary schools. This figure slid to 3,50,611 in 2013-14 and 3,14,022 in 2016-17. At present, around three lakh students are on the rolls."

Every morning, she felt fatigued, didn't want to get out of bed and go to work. At work, she would become anxious faced with the tasks she had to do and would head to the bathroom to cry. ""I felt like I was wasting my life on things that didn't matter. I wanted to win awards, to excel at my work, but I felt too tired and felt like I wasn't going to achieve much in life,"" says the 32-year-old. Much as she tried, she couldn't pinpoint what was wrong.

When the feeling didn't go away for a month, Sahar consulted a psychologist and found that she was experiencing the classic symptoms of a burnout. ""I was too emotionally attached to my work environment and was a workaholic. All my happiness was attached to achievements in my job,"" she says, ""so much so, that I had forgotten how to live.""

Burnout is a syndrome that results from chronic stress at work and can happen to anyone. Sessions with her psychologist made Sahar realize that she couldn't go on like this -- she needed a break. She broached the subject with her senior manager and was surprised at the support. ""He had gone through the same thing early in his career. Taking time off would help, he assured me,"" she says.

Personal stress busters

A recent study released earlier in 2018 by management consulting firm, Gallup, of nearly 7,500 full-time employees found that 23% of them reported feeling burned out at work very often or always, while an additional 44% reported feeling burned out sometimes. In high-stress environments, what matters the most, according to the study, is to be social, have supportive relationships and keep in good health through exercise and enough sleep.

To de-stress, you need what Kedar Tilwe, psychiatrist, Hiranandani Hospital in Mumbai, calls personal stress-busters. ""Be it a playlist or a physical activity like running or a hobby that works for you, do something that's not about your job,"" he says. The reason for this is that in the daily grind of doing your job, chasing deadlines and constantly working, you forget the reasons you are doing the job.

Chartered accountant Ankit Sharma, 25, experienced a loss of purpose in a high-pressure job early in 2016. ""At work I didn't have anyone to talk to, I would go for lunch alone, take breaks alone,"" says Sharma. The extended hours -- up to 12 hours a day -- and the indifference of his colleagues led him to feel like he would never be happy again. A break-up from a five-year relationship didn't help. He had a breakdown and had to leave his job. In the middle of 2016, he moved back to his home town, Jaipur, and started his own chartered accountancy consultancy. He has never looked back since then.

""It's good to stop every once in a while and remind yourself of your aims and goals to reinforce your decision so you remain motivated,"" says Dr Tilwe. If a job doesn't work, quit, do something else. It's just a job. Keep a clear mind, establish your priorities and remember that there's a life beyond your work, he advises.

You definitely need to have more to you and your life than your job and job title, says Neelesh Hundekari, 50, partner, AT Kearney, a global management consulting company. ""If your entire happiness depends on your job, that's a recipe for disaster as there will be ups and downs in any profession."" Hundekari speaks from experience. Over the 18 years that he has been in the stressful consulting business, he has developed a strategy that helps him avoid the burnout, in spite of leading a hectic life which includes long weekdays and frequent domestic travel.

The first rule he has made for himself is that his weekends are sacrosanct. He spends time with his family, a group of old school friends and practices classical music on weekends. Then there are regular breaks every quarter, which helps him de-stress. ""As a family, we take four vacations during the year and talk and share a lot,"" he says. Regular breaks away from the job, a close network of old friends and hobbies together form his stress busters that allow him to face clients positively during the week. ""I avoid early morning flights, sleep well, relax with my family and through hobbies and all this, make sure I keep going with my job, which bring me happiness too,"" he says, adding that he hopes to continue to do the same till he's 75.

In addition, keeping his body in shape has helped Hundekari tide through the stressful times. Along with proper sleep, he makes sure he goes to his gym four times a week. A 2015 study from the University of New England in Australia, found that exercise increases well-being while reducing stress and burnout.

Reflecting on her early career, Sahar feels she had the burnout coming. For the first five years of her career, every morning she would leave for work at seven and get back home at nine in the night, only to login to work again. When she experienced the burnout, she was putting somewhere between 65-85 hours a week, without a break, with a negligible social life or hobbies. ""I had been planning my life around work, rather than seeing work as part of my life,"" she says.

Four years on, now a co-founder for a startup in Bengaluru, Sahar has consciously led a more balanced life. After working hours are over, she leaves the laptop in her office, socializes with her cousins, goes for movies, reads books and swims regularly.

Don't be burnt-out

It's easy to forget the reasons you chose the job in the first place. Remind yourself of your aims and goals in life and how this job will help you get there.

Anticipate deadlines and start early. Even half an hour more in the morning can help you deal with most things that are stressing you out. Anticipate deadlines at work and plan accordingly, so you're not overwhelmed.

Work will never be over. Keep a clear mind, establish your priorities and focus on the essential tasks. Once they're over, get out.

Get physical. Exercise reduces stress and stimulates endorphins, the chemicals that are the body's natural painkillers and mood elevators.

Learn to say no. It's okay to take a break and not take on too much on your plate.

Find some stress busters. Be it a hobby or a playlist, do something that's not your job and keep a work-life balance.

If you feel like you're moving through every day in a daze, without engagement and can't find a solution, don't be afraid to reach out to professionals or family."

Paragon Centre in Singapore is home to sparkling Christmas decorations this month, and special commemorative artworks at its galleries and studios, such as Lumas, White Space Art, Liuli and Lladró.

Art brand Lladró specialises in outstanding handcrafted porcelain figurines made in its factory in Valencia, Spain. See YourStory's interview with Lladró CEO Ana Rodriguez here. The company's first artworks were made in 1953 by three brothers, Juan, José and Vicente, who studied at the Valencia School of Arts and Crafts.

The themes of its artworks today are global, spanning Western, Indian and East Asian culture. There are brand stores in Indian cities such as Bengaluru and Chennai, and we feature works from the Singapore store in this photo showcase.

The artworks are made after detailed studies of local art sensibilities and have a strong aspirational appeal as well for a growing class of buyers in Asia. The choice of porcelain for luxury art elevates the material from functional to decorative medium.

Over the years, Lladró has perfected techniques such as single-firing, pastel tones, and new materials such as gres and matte porcelain. There are 32 different kinds of porcelain and 4,000 colours in use, and some works have up to 400 components.

Its international expansion began in 1965, and the Lladró Collectors' Society was founded in 1985, with more than 100,000 members. Stores in Asia were opened from 1986 onwards, in Japan, China, Singapore and India. India reportedly accounts for 7 percent of its total revenues for figurines, lighting, home accessories, decorative sculptures and jewellery.

The company has received a range of awards for internationalisation, brand management and design. As shown in this photo essay, the artworks span period scenes, fantasy themes, floral compositions, fauna, and spiritual idols, and appeal to art lovers from a wide variety of religions.

Now, what have you done during festive seasons to spread good cheer to all those around you, and push for a diverse, colourful and happy world?"

There are cubes and cylinders here. But this is no maths class. There are bugs and a big scorpion too, yet this is no forest. Buddha and Christ almost facing each other, not in any place of worship though. This is Bengaluru's most famous cake show, that happens at St Joseph's Grounds every year, in this season. If you are a Bengalurean or have been here for a couple of Christmas seasons now, chances are that you would have visited this show.

It was sheer chance that saw me near the gates of St. Joseph's School on a Thursday evening this December. Seeing an arrow pointing to the Cake Show venue, I walked up to the counter and bought myself a ticket costing Rs. 70/-.

As I stepped into the temporary tent-like construction, I was welcomed by the front façade of the iconic Red Fort with the Indian tricolour gently fluttering in the breeze. I was to learn later that the entire model was made completely of sugar. Right next to it was an elaborate multi-tiered wedding cake which has been designed by C Ramachandran of the Nilgiri Dairy Farm. As I walked further in, I got to see 20 other cakes.

Penguins on Snow, Genie, Chinese Pagoda, Butterfly Fairy Doll, Wishing Well, Sewing Dhaaga, Buddha - Water and Succulent Garden, Joker for Joy / Jack in the Box, Christmas Snowman, Moana Wave, Natural Disaster, Christ the Redeemer and more, all fitting this year's theme, 'Water and Earth'.

The history of the cake show is interesting. The first ever cake show was held at the Nilgiris Department Store on Brigade Road in 1970. It consisted of a single 14-inch high sugar model of the Eiffel Tower made by Ramachandran C. A confectioner himself, Ramachandran got inspired by sugar models on display in Europe (Belgium and West Germany) and tried something similar in Bengaluru.

The number of visitors to the store to see the model resulted in the cake show becoming an annual feature at the shop with the number of cakes and sizes increasing gradually. Later it got shifted to St Joseph's grounds. This year it is the 44th cake show in progress.

Each show has one big centre-piece and 20 odd relatively smaller cakes. The former is made completely of sugar and is to scale. The biggest model ever made was in the year 1995 -- the 25th year of the cake show. It was of the Vidhana Soudha - 70 feet long, 35 feet wide and 22 feet high. Made completely of sugar, it was built without any support.

The centre piece has often been also an ode to some event. For example, Twin Towers (USA) was the main exhibit in the year of 9/11. The movie Titanic was released during the end of 1997 and the centre piece the following year was the ship.

Centre pieces in the past have included a Vintage Car, a Merry-go-Round, a Giant wheel, a 10-foot high Eiffel Tower, the Public Utility Building (1986), the London Bridge (1991), Taj Mahal, Mysore Palace, Bangalore Palace, Charminar, a Church, a five-sided (pentagon shaped) building depicting unity among different religions, etc.

M/s Gopalakrishnan Chenniappan and Ramachandran C from the family established the erstwhile Nilgiri's Supermarket Chain in 1905. According to Gopalakrishnan C, the annual cake show ""...is an event in Bangalore for the public to go to. Bangalore did not have much of entertainment in the earlier days and this was a big event (during Christmas season) for people to go and spend some time.""

Ramachandran C is the architect of the cake show and was the one who visualised the show in the late 1960s. He liked working with sugar from when he was in high school. ""We had our own bakery. Those days, we had some bakers and confectioners who had been working during the British time. They continued to work with us. I learnt sugar art from them,"" he said, reminiscing about the early days.

What does it take to preparing for the show? He said: 'We normally used to start three months ahead of the exhibition. One centre-piece and the other exhibits, 15 - 20 items, would be decided upon based on different interests. Weather is often a problem. Sugar is hygroscopic and absorbs moisture. We use heaters to keep the exhibits warm so that no moisture is absorbed by them. Otherwise, we have not had any major problems. Transportation could be a problem - one or two pieces may break. We always make something extra keeping this in mind.""

The family has continued the tradition of the cake show through their current venture Nilgiris Dairy Farm Pvt. Ltd. post the sale of Nilgiris to a UK-based firm in 2006. An event management company organises the show nowadays. The cakes were made by the bakers at Nilgiris till such time it was sold and for a few years thereafter.

Since 2011, most of the cakes are made by the students, teachers and trainers of the Institute of Baking and Cake Art (IBCA), Bengaluru, with some guidance from Ramachandran. At least one cake made by him is displayed each year.

While it was passion that drove Ramachandran to start the cake show, the reason for IBCA partnering with him was the commitment to its students' learning. Manish Gaur of IBCA shared how the Institute has been an integral part of the show since 2011.

Manish Gaur says: 'We have been teaching sugar art and sugar craft quite extensively. We have always challenged ourselves to excel in the learning and passing the same to our students. We saw this as an extension for the student learning - to express their art in a form which can be much larger than the usual cakes which is dealt with in the class. When they go larger, the challenges are different. The students find an amazing lot of learning as the challenges are larger. That was the reason we picked it up.""

Elaborating on this, he added, ""We started with the smaller cakes. Now we are starting to go with the larger ones. We are challenging ourselves every year with new development. This year we have flexible edible fabric - it is 100% edible and made out of sugar. It is flexible and is as thin as cloth. We are able to get textures. We are able to do block printing as close to garments printing as possible. Deepika and Ranveer's caricature is one example. We have tried paper punches. We try to experiment with materials of various kinds and see how close we can get to realistic presentation. In the cake on Natural Disaster, the cyclone effect we gave on top is an Indian sweet (chiroti).""

Talking about the process involved in conceptualising the show, the theme, the number of cakes, and other matters, Manish Gaur said: ""Right now I am doing a little bit of research for 2019. The ideating starts right after the cake show. We start planning and working 4 - 5 months ahead. My team and I sketch the ideas, break them into different designs, design the components and decide on the scale of the models, plan how the components are to be made and arranged. And when we start making the components, we keep them in a dry place in order to prevent sugar from becoming sticky or melt."" The place needs to be full of lights, which gives the warmth the sugar requires to stay firm and dry.

There is an element of learning in every cake. The kind of materials they use, the way the materials are made, and more. Manish gives an example. ""Our edible lace could be on a Chinese Pagoda, it is there on Mr. Ramachandran's creation of the cake, it is there in the King's Table, and maybe on Moana's dress... There are these textures and techniques which we have tried putting across in each cake.""

The materials used to make the cakes this year include sugar paste, royal icing, rice crispy cake, fondant, gum paste, edible fabric, wafer paper, an Indian sweet, flexi sugar fabric, flexi-edible fabric, chocolate, flexi pour, Jelly water and pastillage sugar clay dough.

Structural material has been used where needed in order to support the cakes. According to the information provided by IBCA, 'Sugar Cake creations are made using sugar dough forms that include Fondant, Gum paste and Pastillage. Sugar dough is used for creating an art piece that's both sweet and edible. They can be modified to cater to different forms like sheeting, rolling, molding, shaping, embossing, cutting, drying, colouring and more.'

Around 2.5 - 3 lakh people come to view the cake show annually. They include locals, people from neighbouring cities and towns, and foreigners too. Needless to say, the number of people at the venue spikes during weekends and holidays.

All cakes on display are destroyed after the exhibition, largely through decomposition - these cakes cannot be consumed because of the dust that would have gathered during the show.

The way out was through a space adjacent to the cake show, much larger though, and which had various things on sale. Cake sale has become a standard feature for over a decade now ever since Nilgiris (and subsequently N Dairy Farm) entered into an agreement with the National Consumer Forum in 2004.

The show is usually held during the Christmas season, from the 3rd week of December to the 1st / 2nd of January.

As one walks out from the venue, I couldn't help but pick up from the cake stall a true-blue Christmas cake, and a couple of marzipan packets. These goodies brought back many]beautiful memories as they are, in a way, an ode to my growing up years."

A month back Saraswati Mandir Education Society, Mahim removed their signboard announcing Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) affiliation (proposed) school. One of parents got suspicious and applied a Right to Information (RTI). The reply revealed that the school didn't have CBSE board affiliation.

After removing the signboard from the main gate of the school, the school has conducted a meeting with the Parent Teacher Association. But not all parents are aware of the status about CBSE affiliation as the school has decided to inform about the same in January month next year.

One of the parents, said, ""The school represented themselves in front of child rights commission and also in Bombay high court as CBSE board affiliated school despite not getting any affiliation from the board which is illegal. We took admission for our children thinking its CBSE affiliated school and now school says they have not yet received affiliation. This amounts to cheating the parents. The RTI reply has revealed that the school is not affiliated with the central education board.""

Another parent of the school, said, ""We are in the dark about the affiliation of the school. After removing the signboard the school has still not clarified anything with all the parents. We have taken admission in school thinking the school is CBSE board and we are charged fees also accordingly. What will school mention in the report card of students, to which board they are affiliated to? Will our children get admission in other schools if this is the case.""

The Principal of the school which is now named as Saraswati Mandir Education Society (English Medium) Madhavi Wagle, said, ""In 2017 when our school reached upto class VI, our school management applied for CBSE board affiliation. Since this year our school has reached upto class VIII our documentation process with CBSE board has been completed. We are now waiting for the affiliation to come from the board. It takes a lot of time to get affiliation. In case our students reach class X and if we don't get affiliation, then we can make our students give board examination from another CBSE board centre."""

There are no trained counsellors on campus, and it's largely left to ""overburdened"" teachers to look after the welfare of students. And yet, it's the teachers and staff who have ended up facing the flak for the 49 student suicides reported over the last five years from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs).

An investigation by The Indian Express has revealed that in at least 32 of the 49 suicides reported from 2013 to 2017, disciplinary action -- censure, increment cut, suspension and transfer -- was initiated against either the school principal or teachers or both.

Of the 32 cases in which disciplinary action was taken, only 10 could be directly attributed to the actions of employees who were punished, according to data obtained by The Indian Express under the RTI Act and verified separately with vidyalayas from where the suicides were reported.

The Indian Express reported Monday that the reasons behind the suicides in JNVs range from family problems, unrequited love, depression, homesickness, academic pressure, humiliation by teachers and fights between friends.

However, the onus of spotting behavioural changes, suicidal tendencies and depression in a student is on the school principal and the House Master (HM) at these institutions run by the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS), an autonomous body under the HRD Ministry tasked with running all 635 JNVs.

READ: Navodaya Vidyalayas Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh: 'Have proposed that govt deploy two full-time counsellors in each school'

Such an approach fixes the blame and not the problem, say JNV principals, who spoke to The Indian Express on the condition of anonymity.

""The Samiti's instinctive reaction to a suicide is to act against the House Master and principal, even if they are not responsible for it. Principals are already under a lot of pressure to deliver good board results and teachers are overburdened with non-academic work. To expect us to also know what's going on in every child's mind is unreasonable,"" said the principal of a JNV in north India that witnessed a suicide in 2017.

An HM is a school teacher tasked with leading a 'House' that consists of a group of students. There are usually eight Houses for boys and two for girls in a JNV. The HM is suppose to be ""a parent, guide, philosopher and friend"" to each member of the House.

According to an 11-page circular issued by the Samiti in 2016 -- when suicide figures hit double digits (12) for the first time -- the HM and AHM (Assistant House Master) are supposed to interact with students regularly to assess their emotional well-being, gauge their family history through informal chats and involve the school principal if they notice behavioural changes.

Counselling sessions can be arranged ""on need basis"" for a student with suicidal tendencies, the circular states. It warns of stern action, stating that ""any negligence/ indifference/ laziness in terms of the implementation of these guidelines will be viewed seriously and the responsibility will be fixed on the employee concerned"".

However, an evaluation of the Navodaya system by Niti Aayog, released in March 2015, shows that JNV teachers are already overworked and overstressed. The study, which covered 112 teachers in 56 schools across 16 states, states that teachers are overworked because of ""house mastership and mess management"" responsibilities, which ""severely eats into the teaching time"".

Dr Rajesh Sagar, a psychiatrist with AIIMS-Delhi, says asking teachers to look for early signs of suicidal tendencies in students is not an effective preventive measure. ""Unless you are trained to spot subtle changes in behaviour, a teacher who is already pressed for time may not be able to see it,"" he said.

According to Samiti sources, roughly 200 JNV teachers, or less than 2 per cent, of the total strength of 16,000, have completed the NCERT's PG diploma course in clinical counselling over the last 15 years.

Defending the disciplinary action taken against employees in case of suicides, NVS Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh told The Indian Express: ""We are not victimising anyone. Action has been taken only in those cases where a systemic failure or error was noticed after an inquiry.""

In the last one year, the Samiti has tried recruiting wardens for boys' hostels since it was noticed that a majority of the suicides were by boys. Also, it recently submitted a proposal to the HRD Ministry to have two full-time counsellors in each school -- while that is being discussed, another eight suicides have been reported so far this year."

I recently read an article in The Atlantic, about the way dating apps have (and haven't) revolutionized love in the last half-decade.

Author Ashley Fetters cites two expert opinions on a hotly contested topic: whether online dating has ruined long-term love. Both suspect it has not. That's because, once you're in a happy relationship, you tend to become less interested in other potential partners, even if they're only a swipe away in your pocket.But online dating has, one expert suggested, made it easier to leave unhappy relationships. According to Eli Finkel, a psychologist at Northwestern University and a professor at the Kellogg School of Management and the author of ""

Now, Finkel said, ""you can just tinker around, just for a sort of a goof; swipe a little just 'cause it's fun and playful. And then it's like, oh - [suddenly] you're on a date.""

Presumably, Finkel is referring to more neutral apps like Tinder and OKCupid, and not services like Ashley Madison, which is designed explicitly to facilitate affairs.

So is online dating (and technology in general) ruining our chances of getting into a happy relationship in the first place? Probably not.

Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist and the chief scientific adviser to dating site Match, has told The Atlantic that, contrary to popular opinion, ""the vast majority of people on the internet, even on Tinder, are looking for a long-term, committed relationship."" They're just being cautious about choosing a partner.

The 29-year-old, who has shown his work twice at the Lakme Fashion Week and was named one of the finest GenNext fashion designers, is content to work from Saharanpur and not move to a bustling big city. Mazhar justifies his choice by saying he finds his narratives and context here, he resists accepted notions of a high-profile career, and, above all, has the courage to put this small town on the fashion map of the country.

It all started when as a class nine student, Mazhar set up a boutique with his senior in school. The senior's father had a boutique.

In 2017, Mazhar's first collection, called Dhobi Ghat, evoked nostalgia about his hometown. The washerwoman Sakina Begum, a regular visitor at his home, used to make a small mark on the clothes. The whites of his collection had these marks that Sakina, along with 30 other women, pressed on to the clothes to make a design. The next collection used darn or the craft of the rafugars.

""My inspiration is the Indian artisan, especially those indirectly contributing to the fashion industry like the dhobi or the rafugar,"" he says.

Saharanpur is known for wooden handicraft and Mazhar's family is one of the many engaged in this business. ""Coming from a conservative Muslim family, it wasn't easy to say that I wanted to be a designer,"" he adds.

Today, he runs his label under the national rural employment guarantee programme and more than 70 people work for him. In his design, the visual language is distinctly made up of small-town life and the ways of the artisans there.

Rahul Mishra invokes his village, Malhausi, in his collections on display at the Paris Fashion Week. Just like Mazhar, nostalgia is the primary moving force in his designs too. The broken door, where his mother used to hang a white curtain with its daraz work filtering the afternoon sunlight symbolising a diffused state of being with those white curtains shielding him against the world. His intimate relationship with the things of his childhood-pillow cases, curtains, table cloth, the white of his grandmother's dhoti, the little pond, dew drops and the white and blue checks of the lungis of the weavers and the butchers in his sleepy village in UP-are all part of his storytelling as a designer.

While India's fashion story is shaped by designers who come from little towns and villages and set up shops in Delhi and Mumbai like Samant Chauhan, who is from a small place near Jamalpur in Bihar, or Sanjay Garg of Raw Mango, who hails from Mubarikpur, there is also another set of designers who are choosing to live and work in their small towns and reaching out to the world with their crafts via social media and e-commerce. Like in Kochi, Kerala, 32-year-old Sreejith Jeevan says he is moving towards ""unfashioning"" and it is the joy of slow-paced life that inspires his designs and collections. ""We're moving so fast that sometimes we have absolutely no time for little things such as raindrops and birds.

Though being far from the fashion capital of the country comes with its own drawbacks, there is nothing like the feeling of being home, doing the work you love in a place you know. ""Today, fashion is everywhere and is no longer limited to the metros,"" says Jeevan, who studied at the National Institute of Design (NID), Ahmedabad, and then at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs (ENSAD), Paris. He launched his label Rouka in 2013. ""My stories have a local flavour for a global audience,"" he says.

Dream Merchant: Jeevan at Origins, a collaborative project with locals to make designs for Chendamangalam Kaithari, a weaving cluster (Photo: Bandeep Singh)

After the devastating floods in Kerala this year, Jeevan, along with some other designers, helped the weavers of Chendamangalam, near Kochi in Kerala, who had lost their livelihood, get on their feet with the launch of Origins.

""How can my people make fashion for the world-that's what I ask myself,"" he says.

With sustainable fashion and craft becoming the buzzwords of the industry, it is no surprise that designers are looking back at their experiences and creating a new design vocabulary, along with social consciousness and an urgency to be innovative with local crafts and contexts. Take, for instance, Bihar-based social entrepreneur and designer Praveen Chauhan, who set up MATR-Motherly. Luxury. Artistry, a social enterprise in Bodh Gaya, his native place. The National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) alumnus collects discarded flowers from the Mahabodhi Temple and transforms them into natural dyes with Kathy Williams, who is from Australia and the founder of 'Because of Nature', a sustainable clothing label. Together, they have founded the Happy Hands Project. ""I always tell artisans that it is your right to expect from us. You are the people who kept our art, craft and culture alive. The artisans have taken me to a different level of creativity. So many people from other countries approach me to study traditional Indian textile and handicrafts,"" he says.

""Thousands of people visit the Mahabodhi Temple every day and offer hundreds of kilograms of flowers. Though this project is at its early stage, we have been able to employ 30 women from the surrounding villages,"" he says.

The Happy Hands Project is an initiative started as a collaboration between the Bodhgaya temple management committee, MATR and Because of Nature to bring sustainable employment to the people through natural dyes on khadi made in Bihar. The project aims to promote the skills of artisans to produce high quality khadi and garments for national and international designers and retail brands that utilise traditional skills.

People used to make fun of him, saying that he was studying tailoring at a high cost after joining NIFT. His father, a contractor, supported him against all odds. Today, Chauhan is credited with reviving khadi, along with other ventures.

Forty-eight-year-old Vijayalakshmi Nachiar grew up in a 'Kutchi' family and was introduced to the world of embroidery and textiles at a young age: Her family had been cotton traders for generations. She graduated in textiles and clothing from the SNDT Women's University, Mumbai.

After marriage, she moved to Pollachi on the outskirts of Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, an agrarian town with a rich tradition of woven cotton sarees.

Her husband started growing ecological cotton through his contract farming initiatives in 2005. And, in 2008, Nachiar set up a handloom studio and co-founded Ethicus in 2009.

""I think I can do what I am doing today with Ethicus only because I come from a small town. This would have been impossible in a big city. I have an in-house production facility and local craftsmen work here. Living in a rural area has enabled us to work from farm to fashion,"" says Nachiar.

When they launched Ethicus, there were very few handloom brands and the challenges were many. ""Customers were willing to pay high price for silk but not for good cotton,"" she says.

Woman Power: Vijaylakshmi Nachiar at her studio in Pollachi

Today, her venture is listed by the textile exchange as one of the few brands worldwide using 100 per cent sustainable raw material and adopting a sustainable method of production. It has been awarded the 'Future Shaper' prize by textiles exchange in 2012 and the 'Pride of Tamil Nadu' award in 2017, instituted by the Round Table of India, as an emerging retail brand.

Naushad Ali's story is similar. ""My dad was a textile merchant and I grew up with all kinds of fabric around me. We used to have bundles of fabric from all over India stocked up in our living room, and I used to help my father tag them all. That was my introduction to textiles and fashion,"" says Ali, 33. Unsure of being accepted as a designer, Ali gave himself five years when he launched his label at Puducherry. ""The lifestyle, landscape, culture and people I meet every day have all been great inspirations for the label and shaped me as a designer. 'Made in Pondicherry' has given me an identity in the industry,"" he adds.

""We are committed to being a sustainable label, with a difference. Being part of fashion, the second most polluting industry in the world, I want to take my decisions carefully and consciously-from the choice of materials to what we make out of them. I believe in slow fashion, creating something that lasts and is also something meaningful,"" he says.

Slow and Steady: Naushad Ali at the beach in Puducherry (Photo: Bandeep Singh)

Born in Vellore, Ali spent his growing up years in Chennai and Bengaluru, before his parents moved to Puducherry. He wanted to be an astrophysicist and was also good at botanical drawings. But once he got through NIFT, Chennai, he knew he would do something entirely different.

In 2014, he set up Studio Liam in Auroville to revisit and transfer the expertise of Indian craftsmen to contemporary fashion. His definition of fashion: there is no hurry, there are no seasons, there's only time and commitment. In 2017, three years after he launched his label, he received the prestigious Grazia Young Fashion Award (Sustainable Wear category). And in 2018, he was chosen to represent India for the first IFS biennale at London Fashion Week, 2019, supported by the London College of Fashion and Somerset House.

Pankaja Sethi, 39, spent her childhood at different places-from Itanagar to Chennai-as her father was the chief medical officer with the CRPF. A graduate in botanical science and a NIFT alumnus, after working for export houses, she was asked by a former teacher to help document the folk arts and narratives of Jharkhand. That was the beginning of her foray into indigenous textiles. She relocated to Odisha to help with design intervention and work with tribal weavers.

Rare Tribe: Pankaja Sethi with adivasi women at the Lakme Fashion Week, Mumbai.

It was not an easy task to enrol artisans to create textiles because some of them had fallen in the trap of mass production and many of them did not want to create contemporary concepts, fearing it wouldn't last, she adds.

""Being located in Bhubaneswar, I now see the merits of living in a place that is pollution-free and with much less traffic on the roads compared to metro cities. Moreover, I am close to the weavers and the tribals, who create indigenous textiles and crafts. And, above all, I see the importance of local traditions at the global level,"" she says."

She was four-months-old when her family left Kashmir in 1990s. She lives for her mother tongue, Kashmiri and Kashmiri culture in the United States and promotes it on the internet.

Since the displacement of Kashmiri Pandits, a lot of stories of love and hatred between the Kashmiri Muslims and Pandits crop up every now and then but Rippy Koul, a young Kashmiri Pandit girl, has taken to humour to reach out to her friends and fans.

Rippy, in her twenties, did not pay heed to the controversial stories and events between the two communities, which in the past fuelled tensions in the Valley but instead chose to share love of her motherland.

Born in Sombrun village of south Kashmir's Anantnag district, Rippy was four-months-old when her family shifted to Jammu.

She turned to the internet to unite herself with the friends in her motherland, its language, culture and the memories which her parents left about the place with her.

In most of her videos on the YouTube, which are shared by thousands of her followers, Rippy speaks mostly in the 'Anantnag accent'.

""I am getting a good response from the people. I hope they continue to enjoy my videos for long. I suggest them to work for the community and not hurt anybody. I ask them to spread love not hatred,"" she says.

Most of her videos are on Kashmiri comedy.

""If one can bring a smile on someone's face it is a big contribution,"" says Rippy, who did her early schooling from Viswa Bharti Higher Secondary School Akharpor Jammu. ""Kashmiri language is rich and I want to contribute to my mother tongue and safeguard it.

Rippy, who currently lives in the United States and works as an IT data analyst, was awarded 'Miss Comedian' 2017 by Athrot, an NGO based in Jammu.

She is working to promote Kashmiri language with the help of online conversations and videos.

""We communicate effectively only if we speak in our mother tongue,"" she says.

To avoid homesickness, she makes videos on Kashmir's culture, cooking, travel, tradition and language.

""My family and relatives live in Jammu. They speak in Kashmiri to me every time. What happens most of the people don't know the pronunciation of their own language? But we should try our best,"" says Rippy who did her B.E from the University of Mumbai and wishes to preserve and promote Kashmiri language and discover new words for it.

From her early childhood, she wanted to be in the entertainment industry but her family did not support her to pursue her dream.

She continued her studies and did not look back and before moving to the US in 2016, she worked in Mumbai for 4 years.

""Due to homesickness in the US, I thought I should stand and do something which people remember,"" Rippy says.

She did her Masters in Management Information Systems from Florida International University, USA and often sidelines herself from the political issues and believes ""charity begins at home"".

""We shouldn't blame one another because everyone wants to become a leader but no one wants to work for the community,"" Rippy says. ""We should try to contribute to our society by bringing changes at the grass root level.""

She believes that the media everywhere had resorted to exaggeration and turned more of propagandistic.

""Once I was travelling in the US in a cab and the cab driver asked me where from I was. I replied I was from Kashmir. He replied where bombs were dropped and people were carrying guns,"" Rippy says.

Hearing the cab driver's reply, Rippy felt upset and tried to present the real picture of Kashmir to him.

She says it was for the first time that she had come across such a story outside India.

""I believe Kashmiri people never hurt anyone and I want their prosperity,"" she says. ""Yes, there are existing problems but we should try to avoid the negativity.""

She says she wanted to become a ""change agent"" with the help of her videos.

""My thoughts can't change the entire society but if only one person is influenced that is enough and will give relief,"" Rippy says.

Rippy has been to Kashmir twice and her family has appreciated her efforts to bring the Kashmiri Muslims and Pandits closer.

She seeks their permission to upload videos.

""Sometimes I have to cut footage in my videos. My family is my censor board,"" Rippy says amid laughs.

She says if she gets a chance to return to Kashmir, she would love to do that.

""I wish I could return back to my motherland,"" Rippy says. ""Money isn't a big deal as I get a good package in the US but I am passionate to promote my culture, and language, as in many parts of the world, people don't know about the Kashmiri language, food, traditions and culture.""

She started posting videos on YouTube from April 2017.

Rippy usually captures videos after her office hours and then edits them on weekends.

She loves travelling and strongly believes that she has not found a place more beautiful than Kashmir."

The year 2018 is ending with the spectacular success of Indian scientists and technologists in space and defence sectors, with a series of high impact missions. But that's not all Indian scientists achieved in 2018. Several scientific developments, new techniques and promising technologies -- in fields ranging from nanotechnology to space weather -- made headlines during the year. Here is a collection of 15 such stories that give a glimpse of important developments reported by Indian scientists during the year.

A gel that can protect farmers from toxic pesticides

Most farmers do not wear any protective gear while spraying chemicals in fields, which often leads to pesticide exposure and toxicity. Scientists at the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Bangalore have developed a protective gel -- poly-Oxime -- that can be applied on the skin and can break down toxic chemicals into safe substances, preventing them from going deep into the skin and organs like the brain and the lungs. The research group plans to develop a mask that can deactivate pesticides.

World's thinnest material with novel technique

Pushing the envelope in nanotechnology, researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar have developed a material that is 100,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. They synthesized a two-dimensional material of just one-nanometer thickness (a human hair is about 80,000 nanometers wide) using Magnesium diboride -- a compound of boron. This is said to be the world's thinnest material. It can find a range of applications - from next-generation batteries to ultraviolet absorbing films.

Gene editing applied to banana genome

Using the gene editing technique -- CRISPR/Cas9 -- researchers at the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute, Mohali have edited the banana genome. This is the first such work in any fruit crop in India. Banana is the fourth most important food crop after wheat, rice and corn in terms of gross value of production. Gene editing could be deployed for improving nutritional quality, agronomically important traits as well as pathogen resistance in banana.

Discoveries to tackle Zika, dengue, JE and chikungunya

The National Brain Research Centre (NBRC) at Manesar has figured out cellular and molecular mechanisms that show how the Zika virus causes microcephaly or small head size in babies. Researchers discovered that envelop protein of zika virus affects proliferation rates of human neural stem cells and promotes premature but faulty neuron formation. Another study led by a scientist at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad has identified a key protein which helps dengue as well as Japanese Encephalitis viruses replication inside human body by inhibiting anti-viral cytokines. This finding could pave way for the development of targeted drugs for dengue and JE. For detecting Chikungunya, a group of researchers from Amity University, Noida, Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi and Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, have developed a biosensor using molybdenum disulphide nanosheets.

Faster diagnostic tests for tuberculosis

Scientists at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi have jointly developed highly sensitive and rapid tests for detection of tuberculosis infection in lungs and surrounding membranes. Unlike current tests that use antibodies for detection of bacterial proteins in sputum samples, new tests use Aptamer Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA) and Electrochemical Sensor (ECS) for detection of a bacterial protein in the sputum.

Arsenic found in Punjab groundwater

Till now arsenic was a major problem in West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Chhattisgarh. It was also known that there is arsenic contamination in groundwater in Punjab. Now a new study done by New Delhi-based TERI School of Advanced Studies has found that that Punjab's floodplains are severely affected by arsenic contamination. In some wells, arsenic levels were found to be 20 to 50 times higher than WHO prescribed limit.

Space weather warning model rules out 'mini ice age'

A team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata have dismissed the speculation that the upcoming sunspot cycle is going to be stronger, based on calculations using a model developed by them. The near-Earth and inter-planetary space environmental conditions and solar radiative forcing of climate over the upcoming sunspot cycle 25 will likely be similar or marginally more extreme relative to what has been observed during the past decade over the current solar cycle. The method makes it possible to make predictions almost a decade before the next sunspot cycle activity peaks in strength.

New tool developed for autism screening

In many cases, autism is misdiagnosed as mental retardation and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Early identification and interventions may help children with autistic disorders. To help this process, scientists at the Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, have developed an Indian tool for screening children for autism. The Chandigarh Autism Screening Instrument (CASI) is designed to help community health workers to carry out initial screening for autism.

Hope for Alzheimer's, Huntington's

Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have figured out the way memory deficit develops in early stages, resulting in Alzheimer's disease. They have found that early breaking down of a protein, fibrillar actin or F-actin, in the brain leads to disruption in communication among nerve cells and consequently memory deficits. This knowledge can be used to develop early diagnosis test in future. In another study done in fruit flies, researchers at Department of Genetics at Delhi University South Campus found that it was possible to restrict the progression of Huntington's disease by increasing insulin signalling in the brain neuronal cells.

Green technique can address Plaster of Paris pollution

A team of scientists at Pune-based National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) has developed a technique that helps recycle Plaster of Paris waste from hospitals in an eco-friendly and economical way. The new technique disinfects waste and converts it into useful products like ammonium sulphate and calcium bicarbonate. The technique can also be used to disintegrate PoP waste from idols immersed in water bodies.

Stone Age tools, genetic studies throw new light on peopling of India

The Stone Age tools discovered in a village near Chennai suggest that a Middle Palaeolithic culture was present in India around 385,000 years ago -- roughly the same time that it is known to have developed in Africa and in Europe. The discovery pushes back the period when populations with a Middle Palaeolithic culture may have inhabited India, and challenges popular theory that the Middle Palaeolithic was brought to India by modern humans dispersing from Africa only around 125,000 years ago or later. In the North, a population genetic study has revealed that the Rors who inhabit modern Haryana came to the Indus Valley when it was flourishing during the Bronze Age and inducted West Eurasian genetic ancestry.

Sikkim gets a real-time landslide warning system

A real-time landslide warning system has been set up in the Sikkim-Darjeeling belt of the north-eastern Himalayas which is highly vulnerable to landslides. The warning system consists of over 200 sensors that can measure geophysical and hydrological parameters like rainfall, pore pressure and seismic activities. The system is capable of warning about 24 hours in advance. It has been deployed by researchers of Kerala-based Amrita University and Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority.

Computing capacity for weather forecasting gets a boost

During the year, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) upgraded its computing capacity for weather forecasting and climate monitoring, taking its total high-performance computing (HPC) power to as high as 6.8 Petaflop. With this, India rose to the fourth position, next only to the United Kingdom, Japan and USA in terms of dedicated capacity for HPC resources for weather and climate propose.

Scientists use silk polymer to develop artificial vertebral disc

Scientists at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati developed a silk-based bioartificial disc that may find use in disc replacement therapy in future. The group has developed a fabrication procedure for a silk-based bioartificial disc adopting a ""directional freezing technique"". The disc mimics internal intricacy of a human disc and its mechanical properties too are similar to those of the native ones. The use of a silk biopolymer to fabricate a biocompatible disc can reduce the cost of artificial discs in future.

Transgenic rice with reduced arsenic accumulation, flowering mustard

They cloned Arsenic methyltransferase (WaarsM) gene from a soil fungus and inserted it into rice genome. In another study, TERI School of Advanced Studies has developed an early flowering transgenic variety of mustard.

In other significant developments, the Department of Science and Technology launched a national mission on Cyber-Physical Systems with an outlay of Rs 3660 crore for five years. The Indian Institute of Astrophysics in Bangalore commissioned India's first robotic telescope to keep an eye on the dynamic cosmos, while the ambitious India Neutrino Observatory (INO) project got a go-ahead from the National Green Tribunal.

Bengeri was conferred with 'Kala Nandana' title by Nandana Performing Arts Centre during its 18th Annual Nritya Nanda-2018 programme held at Ramabai Govind Rao Memorial auditorium in Ganabharathi recently.

Speaking after doing the honours, former Karnataka Nataka Academy Member and Sri Rajarajeshwari Vasthralankara Founder B.M. Ramachandra said that these days there are many incidents occurring which are inimical to the Guru-Shishya relationship. This will have an adverse impact on the student's mind and learning and this should be set right. He lauded Dr. Bengeri for her contribution to music since several decades and said that it was very appropriate that she had been honoured.

Hundreds of students of Dr. Vasundhara Doraswamy and Vidu. M.L. Varija Nalige, who have learnt dance from them have settled abroad. It is because of achievers like these that our culture and art is still alive, he said.

Aniketana Seva Trust President K.V. Mallesh, Dr. Vasundhara Doraswamy, Nandana Performing Arts Centre Director M.L. Varija Nalige and Treasurer Ramalingu were present. Dr. Bhuvaneshwari compered.

Later, a dance programme was presented by artistes Sneha, Rakshita, Swathi Gudi, Sheetal, Sanjana, Prerana, Sankeertana, Nagashivani, Brinda, Bhumika Muddappa, Nandana Ram, Mokshalakshmi, Prajna V. Bhat, Yukta, Anagha V. Bhat, Dhruthi, Ragini, Sakshi, Ganavi Nayak, Aishwarya, Tanvi, Dhanya, Raj, Anuranjani, Srinjana and Sanvi.

She is a free-spirited woman who has always chosen her own path to travel. Her wide ranging interest and dedication to whatever she takes up is quite well-known. This lady is Dr. Manik Bengeri, who has made Mysuru her home since the last many decades.

A multi-faceted woman, she made a career in banking. But has immense knowledge of Hindustani Music, as she learnt it from Rauncha Vijapura whom she still considers her guru. She firmly believes that God has given everyone 24 hours but some use it wisely and achieve a lot while others feel that they do not have time at all. Hence, she says that one should learn time management. Dr. Bengeri was born in Belagavi and so she naturally speaks and writes Marathi. Her father was a good singer and hence knowledge of music is in her genes. She still teaches music and many foreign students are getting trained in her school.

""All kinds of pressures disappear when one is immersed in music. Both the performer and the listener have a great experience as it gives them peace of mind. Learning music helps a student develop concentration and it is the only medicine to end cruelty in the world,"" says Dr. Bengeri firmly.

During Dasara festivities, she has performed at Chamundi Hill, Mysore Palace, Dasara Exhibition Grounds, Nada Mantapa in Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Ashrama and in other music auditoriums and won the hearts of the connoisseurs. One of her major achievements is setting music to Adi Sankaracharya's Philosophy in Hindustani tune.

She has translated Dr. D.R. Bendre's Marathi play into Kannada and she considers interviewing Shehnai Maestro Ustad Bismillah Khan as one of the highpoints in her life. She has got a doctorate on the thesis titled ""Chayavadi Kaviyonke Drishti Mein Naari."""

Substance abuse, Insolvency, banking fraud, ethical hacking, terrorism negotiation were introduced across Indian universities this year.

From cybercrime to criminal justice and technology, forensic audit to de-addiction - in the passing year 2018, many courses related to crime was launched by Indian institutions. While earlier such programmes were meant for those working with defence or police, in recent years there is a surge in demand and universities are coming with unique programmes to detect cyber frauds.

These courses are open for everyone showcasing how important is for students to learn to safeguard and defend themselves and others.

The Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) launched a certificate course in forensic accounting and fraud detection. Within few months of its launch, the course has already registered over 6,000 people. This course was aimed for only ICAI registered CAS but due to high demand, employees of IOCL and HPCL got registration. The ICAI has launched Data Analytics/ Forensic Analytics Labs at Noida, Hyderabad, Kanpur, Chennai, Kolkata and Chandigarh already.

ICAI president, Naveen ND Gupta, said, ""The course is created by experts from the field of accountancy and law keeping in mind the emerging economic scenarios. Specialisation in this area is much sought-after considering increasing incidents of cybercrime and fraud detection. It is the practice of utilising accounting, auditing, CAATs/ Data Mining Tools and investigative skills to detect frauds.""

There was a rise in cyber crimes this year. A total of 30 people were arrested in cyber crimes out of which 12 were juvenile, according to the National Crime Bureau report. The data collected is till August 2018. According to NCR crime in India 2016 report, there has been a rise of 3 per cent in crimes committed 2014-15 3 per cent and a 2.6 per cent rise in crimes committed in 2015-16, showing a continuous uprise.

A total of 31,396 cases were registered against juveniles in 2015, almost double the number in 2001.

Keeping this scenario in mind, Punjabi University at Patiala started a course on substance abuse in October this year. So far, 35 candidates have registered. The university also conducts a course in HIV awareness which had witnessed the maximum strength up to 26 students. Those who enrol in substance abuse courses will be sent to do field work in which they will be asked to spread the message of prevention against drug abuse.

On completion of the course, one can work at a rehab centre or as a psychotherapist in government, private and not for profit organisations.

Naina Sharma, assistant professor, Punjabi University said, ""The course was introduced keeping in mind the spreading epidemic of substance abuse. To our surprise, a large number of school teachers enrolled for the course showing how deeply rooted the issue is and the need for early intervention.""

Managing director of a corporate security and risk consulting firm - Netrika, Sanjay Kaushik, highlighted while there is an increase in number of courses related to physical, digital and social security in India, most of them are introduced as short-term and additional level, however, a formal and in-depth training is required in the fields. ""India still lacks formal training in security-related courses. Even today, people do not consider it to be a full-term primary career choice.""

Netrika launched several programmes including certified anti-terrorism specialists, crime prevention specialist. PEACE interview and investigation technique, corporate security management specialist among others. There has been a rise in enrolment up to 17 per cent for these courses. While Netrika has global association including the forensic investigation services, Unites States of America, Gujarat Forensic Sciences University is the only Indian university to tie-up with the India-based firm.

""While the crime keeps increasing at a high rate, the pace of defence is not as high. Every organisation including corporate houses host such mandatory coaching, the approach remains theoretical. It is important to teach students in an artificial atmosphere how to handle an adverse situation,"" he adds.

Among most unique crime courses was 'Insolvency Associates' launched and designed by Ministry of Skill Development, the course is not yet open to learners. The ministry is in talks with the University of Delhi (DU) to initiate the course. The aim of the course is to impart knowledge about insolvency law and catch financial frauds. DU this year had also launched a centre for cyber crimes. The centre provides a postgraduate diploma in cybersecurity and law.

Even the giant teddy bear at the mall entrance wasn't spared, said Ma Jun, who works at a tutoring company in the building.

""Everything is gone and cleaned,"" she said.

Christmas continues to be a shopping festival across most of China, with huge trees adorning shopping malls in Shanghai and Beijing, but a growing emphasis on traditional culture by the ruling Communist Party and the systematic suppression of religion under President Xi Jinping are imperiling Santa Claus's position.

At least four Chinese cities and one county have ordered restrictions on Christmas celebrations this year, according to official notices and interviews. Students, teachers and parents from 10 schools around China said Christmas celebrations have been curtailed.

""The ongoing local reaction against Christmas is part of the wider sentiment since Xi took power,"" said Zi Yang, a China expert at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

Xi is trying to broaden the appeal of the Communist Party by casting it as a crusader for Chinese tradition in a fast-changing world, he said. ""Therefore, foreign cultural elements such as Christmas are placed on the chopping block.""

The seasonal humbug follows similar outbreaks of anti-Christmas rhetoric in 2014 and 2017. It appears not to be centrally organised, but rather a spreading resistance to foreign festivals by local authorities seeking to align themselves with the growing tide of cultural nationalism.

The squeeze on Christmas is an example of how efforts to ""normalise"" thinking bleed into the everyday lives of many Chinese. That push exploded into view this year through re-education camps for Uighur Muslims and a crackdown on Christian churches that has continued with force in recent weeks.

In Nanyang, about 950 kilometers (600 miles) west of Shanghai, government officials stopped by the office and shopping complex on 16 December to say that Christmas decorations would have to come down, said Ma, the tutoring company employee.

An official from the city's urban management bureau hung up when asked for comment.

Nine hours by car south, Hengyang, a city in Hunan province, said in a 19 December notice posted on an official government social media account that anyone caught holding Christmas sales or celebrations that blocked the streets would be punished. Communist Party members, the notice said, should avoid foreign festivals and instead be ""models of adherence to Chinese traditional culture."" Hengyang police posted a video on their official social media account of locals discussing the importance of Chinese culture and plans to avoid ostentatious Christmas celebrations.

Langfang city, just south of Beijing, banned Christmas stage performances and merchandising promotions, according to a notice circulated on social media.

Shop windows were to be stripped of Christmas stickers and streets kept free of Christmas banners and lights. Law enforcement patrols were to be stepped up 23-25 December to prevent illegal signs of celebration.

The Langfang urban management bureau declined comment. The state-run Global Times newspaper argued that Western media are exaggerating China's crackdown on Christmas and reported that the restrictions in Langfang were aimed not at Christmas but at cleaning up roadside stalls and migrant vendors in hopes of winning a ""National Civilized City"" award from the Communist Party.

Some 270 kilometers (167 miles) west, Fuping county, also in Hebei province, issued a similar clean-up notice. Though the 21 December announcement mentions Christmas eleven times, an official from the Fuping urban management bureau said the rules were aimed at street vendors generally, not Christmas.

Police in the Panlong district of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province in southern China, circulated a notice that hotels, karaoke parlors, internet cafes, bars and other crowded places must prohibit Christmas-related decorations and activities.

""It is forbidden to hang Christmas stockings, wear Christmas hats, place Christmas trees, and so on,"" the notice read.

It wasn't clear if the notice applied to all of Kunming city, though a police officer told the AP that the order to circulate it came from city officials.

Reverend Jonathan Liu, founder of the Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, a California nonprofit, said the pushback against Christmas reflects Xi's efforts to ""Sinicize"" religion.

Preachers are coached on how to convey Communist Party core values in their sermons and national flags and songs have been injected into some church services, he said.

Liu provided the AP with a notice sent to churches in Zhoukou, a city to the east of Nanyang in Henan province.

It tells churches to vet Christmas plans with the government, forbids minors from participating in Christmas events and caps expenses at 2000 yuan ($290). ""I wish you all a happy Christmas! God bless you,"" read the notice, which Liu received from a pastor in China.

An official at the United Front Work Department in Zhoukou referred queries to the religious affairs bureau, which could not be reached for comment.

Before becoming president, Xi went to Finland in 2010 and was photographed with Santa Claus. That kind of chumminess appears to be a thing of Christmas past, experts say.

The central government issued guidelines last year for a cultural revival project that calls for a marked boost in the international influence of Chinese traditional culture by 2025.

""You have a culturally conservative ethos in the country that has definitely been encouraged by the central party-state,"" said Guo Yingjie, a professor of Chinese studies at the University of Sydney. ""It's not hard for university presidents or officials to say, 'OK celebrating Christmas can easily be seen as de-Sinification or promoting Western culture.'""

Students have taken to social media to complain about restrictions on Christmas celebrations at their schools.

At a top Shanghai university, a student union had its Christmas plans cancelled for the first time, an organizer told the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing rebuke.

The students came up with a solution: By replacing ""Christmas"" with ""New Year's"" in their activity proposal and changing the date from 25 December, it sailed past school administrators.

Students in the city of Qingdao were reprimanded for hosting an event about gratitude on Thanksgiving Day and warned not to celebrate Christmas publicly, according to a student, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution.

Liu Kaiming, president of the Institute of Contemporary Observation, a civil society group in the city of Shenzhen, said that despite the drumbeat of official discontent, Christmas cheer continues to spread in China.

""The sound of resistance is more powerful on the surface, but it has no practical effect,"" he said. ""Young people's enthusiasm for the festival is ever-increasing.""

For a first, Justin Jose, an MCA graduate from Kottayam created eTalenter, a system which automates and manages competitions, regardless of the event and institution.

This newly launched software is beneficial; competitions can be easily conducted without further hassles. The software has already been implemented to conduct seven successful events for churches and schools, the first one being in Thiruvananthapuram. Introduced in Kerala, Justin is the sole mastermind behind eTalenter. ""Competitions are difficult to organise nowadays with paper sheets. With the help of eTalenter, work is easier and quicker with no loss of time or difficulty. Such a software has not been developed before,"" says Justin, senior software engineer.

The software aims to limit the usage of paperwork and to digitalise details. Hours of manual work can be minimised and technical knowledge will not be a worry. The benefit of using this software is that no one can hack into it by faking results and the final result will be published on the website by the co-ordinators. The software is accessible both mobile and laptop. Events are created by the developer himself and a unique ID and password would be given to the event coordinator to control the whole event who would be able to edit it accordingly.

Time management and the token system are two primary features of the software. A token announcement calls out the participants ID or name with the help of a recorded voice before the competition begins and also alerts the judges or the coordinators along with a warning bell and stop bell. Judges can score marks through the online scorecard thereby easily marking them under each category and publishing the results instantly. ""eTalenter shines with its simple interface and makes talent management easy for all users,"" says an event coordinator.

The software is steadily gaining popularity and has been booked in advance, by schools, organisations and communities. eTalenter can easily make its mark in events like the school kalolsavam and university events, as they are the largest competitions in Kerala with numerous participants. Justin is looking forward to expanding the software across the whole country and does not want it to have a limited outreach."

I was running late. Pressed for time, I took the wrong exit at the notorious Hebbal flyover, known for its insane traffic snarls. Even so, I kept my calm and continued driving. As it was a Sunday afternoon, the traffic was light, and I arrived at the venue before Shama. The road was narrow, dusty and crowded. I sat on the steps of the Vodafone store nearby waiting for her to arrive. She soon arrived in a taxi and beckoned to me from the other side of the road. I crossed over.

Shama, who belongs to coastal Karnataka and hails from Udipi, is an absolutely fascinating woman, with an equally fascinating story. She grew up in Bengaluru and like most people from coastal Karnataka was good at math and accounting.

Shama studied community organisation at the University of Maryland and Non-Profit Management at Harvard Business School. She had worked for over a decade in California in the social impact field, although she could have just as easily have passed off as a successful Senior Executive at an MNC.

Shama later returned to Bengaluru due to some family compulsions. Back in India, she was introduced to Shiv Kumar, who is an influential leader in the field of social impact and community transformation and highly respected for both his work and his humble persona. At the time, Shiv Kumar, who had raised more than a billion dollars from various foundations, was looking for a professional CEO to run one of his organisations, SHC, and Shama was the perfect choice.

In the true spirit of community empowerment, Shama was also interviewed by Pushpalatha R, President of Swathi Mahila Sangha (SMS) or Pushpakka as she is fondly called - the woman Shama and I were to meet at Ramamurthynagar.

I was very curious as to how this interview may have gone. Curious because Shama was the sophisticated western educated woman while Pushpakka was the archetype daughter of the earth who spoke the local language, just about understood English, but had the native smartness.

Shama had asked me to come to Ramamurthynagar to meet this incredible woman Pushpakka! When I met her, my knowledge of Kannada helped break the ice quickly. Out of sheer curiosity, I asked her, ""So, you interviewed Shama! What did you ask her?""

Her response was quick and sharp, ""I asked her if she knew Kannada? I asked her what she thought of sex work and sex workers. And, I asked her if she empathised with them.""

""How did you know she was being honest in her responses and wasn't fibbing to get the job?""

She replied,

""If you have been a part of this community for as long as I have been, you know when someone is lying and when someone is speaking the truth. You become an astute judge of human character.""

Pushpakka started as a peer educator at an NGO Samraksha and was then promoted to Supervisor. Samraksha was funded by Tata Trust, McArthur foundation and KSAPS. It ran a clinic that provided several services for women including treatment for HIV. KSAPS started as a state government body related to the National Aids Control Organization in 1998.

Pushpakka travelled to Bangladesh and Kolkata to study how such organisations worked there. On returning to Bengaluru, she started the Swati Mahila Sangha (SMS). She had to go through immense struggles and many near-death moments. Shiv supported her through these difficult times. When narrating her story, Pushpakka would break down from time to time. She remembered every detail and date.

Pushpakka had learned management and her organisation was managed by a board of eleven directors. Most board members were professionally qualified but still considered it a privilege to work for Pushpakka!

She even negotiated the tripartite agreement with SHC and the Gates Foundation. Bill Gates had come to meet her at her spartan and unpretentious office in Ramamurthynagar and had sat on the floor for more than an hour meeting her team.

A year earlier, when I had met Shama and Shiv Kumar in connection with a book I was putting together on 'India's quest for prosperity,' I was fascinated by the way they were mobilising different communities and helping them address some of their issues.

When police harassment and violence against sex workers in Bengaluru were at its peak in Bengaluru, the women tried several things and nothing seemed to work. Pushpakka, inspired by the popular Bollywood film Lage Raho Munna Bhai, decided to protest in the 'Gandhigiri' style that the film had popularised.

This 'filmi' style action got public attention, and this followed up with a deeper dialogue with the police. Over time, police violence reduced significantly. Once violence was out of the way and their self-esteem was restored, they began focusing on health and financial security.

SHC worked closely with this community for the next ten years and it grew from a 13-member group into a 13,000-strong organisation. It set up its own bank, and disbursed more than $2 million in loans and ran it profitably, winning several international awards for running an effective community organisation.

SMS provides several services to its members, with counselling being the most basic service. I got to hear of some incredible and touching stories. Most family members of women in sex work, including their husbands, are not aware that they are in the field. They do this under financial stress. Some of the women get discovered by various people including auto-rickshaw drivers who then start threatening and blackmailing them. Sometimes, their husbands and children get to know and things could get very nasty. This is where counselling, police help, and legal support from SMS help. Violence on the streets has come down because soliciting has moved away from the streets to phones and WhatsApp.

SMS also provides health checkups. Most of the women are prone to sexually transmitted infections including AIDS. Many of the clients refuse to wear condoms and the women don't have much of a choice. SMS educates them and removes some myths. In the process, it has helped reduce the incidence of AIDS from 20 to 6 percent.

The organisation also provides loans for the education of their children, for de-addiction, and for others. The bank runs through deposits and contributions from members.

I asked Pushpakka what was the nature of the relationship between SMS and SHC (Shama's organisation). Pushpakka was very clear. While SMS understood what was happening in the trenches and had a deep understanding of the community, SHC had a deep understanding of what it took to scale and convince international donors like the Gates Foundation.

SHC also understood strategic issues and the interdependence between multiple social impact programmes as well as long-term perspectives. Together, they have formed a great partnership. She explained to me that partnerships were never just about a contract. It was about making it work on the ground. There was bound to be conflict and it was important that the differences be settled based on mutual trust.

It was amazing listening to her thought process. I had spent more than three decades evaluating human nature and I had no doubt I was listening to a true leader.

I didn't expect to understand every aspect of life of Bengaluru's murky underbelly in one short meeting. I didn't expect to understand the complex social compulsions and nuances either. Nor did I expect to be moved sufficiently to start contributing my bit.

I certainly expected to come out learning that one shouldn't judge people by what their circumstances had forced them to do. One should admire them for trying to seek out dignity amidst all odds."

The conference, anchored by the Centre for Human Resource Development (CHRD) of XLRI, was co-chaired by Prof. Michael Arthur (Suffolk University, USA), Dr. Anneleen Forrier (KU Leaven, Belgium), and Dr. R K Premarajan (XLRI, India).

The two-day long conference witnessed eminent scholars from India and other countries and industry practitioners brainstorm on the changing nature of careers through paper presentations, expert talks and panel discussions.

Elaborating about the conference, Dr. R K Premarajan, Chairperson, Centre for HRD, XLRI and Co-chair of the Conference said, ""A woefully inadequate focus on industry-academia collaboration is indeed holding back effective interventions premised on sound theory in the field of career and talent management. With this Conference, we sought to balance inspiration and implementation by linking practitioners from the world of corporate careers and scholars from the world of academics to share their ideas and experiences.""

The event kick-started with the inaugural session, where delivering the Welcome Address, Fr. E. Abraham S.J., Director, XLRI expressed hope that the conference would provide the platform to re-invent traditional career and workplace models, thus making it easier for people to utilize new skill-sets and leverage new roles within organizations. In his address, he said, ""Discussions about the employment impact of change have often been polarized between those who foresee limitless opportunities in newly emerging job categories and prospects that improve workers' productivity and liberate them from routine work, and those doubting Thomases that foresee massive labour substitution and displacement of jobs. Academics, chief executives and labour leaders hold strong and diverse views on the debate, as do policymakers. While forecasts vary by industry and region, momentous change is underway. Ultimately, it is our actions today that will determine whether that change mainly results in massive displacement of workers or the emergence of new opportunities in the workplace.""

Dr. Anneleen Forrier, Professor, KU Leaven, Belgium and Co-chair of the Conference delivered the Keynote Address and spoke on 'Employability in a Shifting Global Employment Arena'. In her address, she said, ""The nature of the employment relationship itself is becoming more short-term and flexible, leading to the emergence of contingent work and the so-called 'gig economy'. Hence, the Conference aims to examine how these changing work relationships impact careers.""

On the occasion, there was a book signing event by Michael Arthur of his recent book 'An Intelligent Career Taking Ownership of Your Work and Your Life' co-authored with Svetlana N. Khapova, and Julia Richardson.

The first day of the conference held multiple Paper Sessions, where researchers and academicians from India and other countries presented papers on topics - 'Cities, Clusters and Careers', 'Women's careers: Opting in versus opting out' and 'Career Transitions in unpredictable times'.

The Practitioners Sessions provided platform for Industry experts to exchange views and share their experiences. The first session on the topic 'Multiple Perspectives on Career and Talent Management' was participated by Gaurav Lahiri- Partner, Deloitte, Madhu Veeraraghavan- Director, T.A. Pai Management Institute, Sumit Neogi- VP, HR, Reliance Industries, and Shatrunjay Krishna- Korn Ferry; Nishith Mohanty- CHRO, Manipal Group while the second session, on the topic 'Career and Talent Development Challenges in a Gig Economy' was participated by Dipti Sharma- Accenture, Ajay Sonkar- Adobe, Arinban Gupta- Aon Consulting Pvt. Ltd., Tooba Modassir- Citi Bank, Sachin Vohra and Nitin Nangia- Quess Corporation and Sandeep Olkar, Wipro.

It's necessary to practise what you preach. And, it's just as important to preach what you practise, especially where sustainable living is concerned. For, there is an element of resistance in almost all of us to it. We would rather take the line of least resistance, settling for the convenient, than act keeping in mind, the interests of future generations.

Four city residents seem to have grasped this truth, instinctively, and they have been zealously promoting the eco-friendly practices that have done wonders for their immediate neighbourhoods. The four -- Sumitra Srikanth, Ganga Sridhar, K.L. Bala and C.R. Ashok -- have chosen school students as the target group. After all, it is these children who will lead out planet into the future.

The four have been making a difference, individually in their neck of the woods, and their paths have crossed due to their engagement with many sustainability groups, which include Solid Waste Management - People's Forum and Kapaleecharam.

In this new volunteering work, the four would like to be identified as EcoKonnectors. At present, they are guiding students of five schools -- P.S. Senior Secondary School, Chettinad Harishree Vidyalayam, Vidya Mandir, Chennai Corporation Public School and Vana Vani Matriculation Higher Secondary School (which is situated on the campus of IIT-Madras). They want to engage with more schools across Chennai.

""Ours is team work. We chart out a plan, approach schools and create awareness. Having nature and eco clubs in schools is a great way to get started on sustainability practices. We play the role of mentors, and as such, we provide them with guidance and also chart out an action plan for them to work on,"" says Ganga Sridhar.

At P.S. Senior Secondary School, with the support of the teachers, Bala has helped the students set up an eco-club. Divided into multiple groups, the students enforce eco-friendly practices and monitor them. For their art projects, they fashion models out of discarded and recycled material such as newspapers, plastic pipes, straws and mats.

The school principal Revathy says there are simple as complex layers to the awareness drive. An example of effective change in simple things. ""For their birthdays, students are urged to plant a sapling on the campus and avoid bringing candies wrapped in plastic packaging. This iniative has been a success. The students not only bring and plant saplings on their birthdays, but also mantain the organic garden at the school where they have them planted. The students also segregate waste in colour-coded bins placed on the campus.""

At Chettinad Harishree Vidyalayam too, students actively segregate and compost the waste generated on the campus. Recently, the students visited Thiruveedhi Amman Koil Street in Mandaveli and met the members of TAKSRA to learn more about waste management, says Bala.

Sumitra Srikanth is greatly engaged with Vidya Mandir in its sustainability journey.

""When the school set up the terrace garden, I provided them with grow bags and seeds and offered my expertise through power-point presentation and videos. The teachers and students have taken an active interest in maintaining the garden and I am very happy to see the progress they have made,"" says Sumitra.

The terrace garden is the result of the hard work and dedication of our students and staff, says Vidyshree Sarath, a teacher at the school. The school also has organic gardens on the campus that are maintained by students.

""We grow fruits and vegetables and also compost the waste on the campus. In fact, last Monday, we harvested bananas from a plant in the terrace garden,"" she adds.

Recently, the school gifted 75 cotton saplings to Coast Gaurd personnel and also gifted saplings of various plants to the Class XII students who would be leaving the school next year.

""All the saplings were raised by our students. We try to be as creative as possible. This summer, I asked the students to plant the seed of the sweetest mango they had eaten, and they have all grown into saplings now,"" says Vidyashree.

Recently, C.R. Ashok helped Vana Vani Matriculation Higher Secondary School, where he is an alumnus, conduct a 'green carnival.' ""We tried to avoid plastic as much as possible. We asked the vendors to bring in biodegradable plates and glasses instead of disposables. We held poster competitions for children on environmental themes,"" he says.

Ganga Sridhar shares her knowledge and expertise with students and staff of the schools.

The 'EcoKonnectors' are urging more schools to come forward to take up green initiatives on their campuses and are willing to adopt schools to help them"

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is all set to conduct Class 12th Board Examination 2019 from the month of February. Most of the students feel nervous before it and it is quite normal.

Students should keep in mind that irregular and a non-systematic study can lead to loss of marks in the examination.

According to the date-sheet, the students will have to take the board exam for Physical Education on March 30, 2019.

As per the latest notification, the pattern of question paper for Class 12 Physical Education Board exam 2019 has been amended by CBSE.

The paper will now be divided into three sections-

Section A: 7 out of 11 questions are to be attempted

Section B: 5 out of 8 questions are to be attempted

Section C: 5 out of 7 questions are to be attempted

Have a look at some tips to score well in CBSE Class 12 Physical Education Board exam 2019!

1. Focus:

Students should focus on the syllabus prescribed by CBSE. Moreover, they should refer to one or two books only as referring to so many books can confuse the students during the preparation.

According to Ajay Vashist, Senior PGT (Physical Education), Delhi Public School, Bulandshahr, ""Being a physical education teacher I have observed that students do not pay attention to the subject. Maximum of the students do not take first ten months seriously even during their pre-board exam but when exam approaches, they start worrying and then they start their preparation just a few weeks before the board exams.""

2. Work on your weakness:

Students should work on their weaknesses. In order to improve their performance, they need to compare their previous performance with previous performance and find out your weakness and workout on those.

3. Time management:

After revising the whole syllabus, solve the sample papers available on the internet or available in the market. Doing enough practice of sample papers boosts the level of self-confidence in students.

Apart from this, practising the sample papers also teaches the concept of time-management to the students.

4. Chapter-wise revision:

One must do the revision frequently and should identify the important questions accordingly. Students should try to make their own notes from every chapter in the form of a summary.

5. Presentation:

The short and long answer type questions should be written in a proper format. An introduction should be given before writing the core answer. One must give emphasis on the presentation.

Underline the important sentences and try to write clearly with good handwriting, give examples when it is necessary, draw figures (if required), use specific and suitable terms while writing the answer and stick to the word limit.

First fifteen minutes of the exam must be utilized in a meaningful manner. Students should try to attempt the paper in a proper sequence.

So, these were some important tips for the students to score well in Class 12 Physical Education Board Examination 2019.

All the best for your board exams!

""Independence of the RBI is very important. But that does not mean they can't be criticised,"" Dr Arvind Subramanian, former chief aconomic advisor and professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, tells Advait Rao Palepu and Abhijit Lele.

You have said in your new book (Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy, Penguin) that demonetisation was a draconian policy. Was it an instance of post-truth policy, given there was no justification for it? The outcomes are also inexact, to say the least

In my book, I propose two puzzles.

I don't think it's a strictly post-truth puzzle, as it is part of a much larger phenomenon.

The first puzzle: In the US, people ask why white men vote for President Donald Trump, even though they need the welfare state while he is dismantling it.

Why do people act apparently against their self-interest?

This is a profound psychological politico-economy question.

I have a controversial hypothesis on this: Large costs inflicted on the economy were a feature of demonetisation, not a bug in the policy.

Maybe it was intrinsic to the political success of demonetisation.

The second puzzle is why even with 86 per cent of the currency demonetised there was hardly any impact on gross domestic product.

Growth did slow down, but there was also the effect of the goods and services tax.

So it's difficult to know how much exactly the effect of the note ban was.

I met Paul Krugman and Kenneth Roggoff in 2016, and both agreed that if you withdraw 86 per cent of the currency, GDP will collapse.

But, in India, it did not.

We still have a lot to learn about the Indian economy and politics, how cash works, the informal economy's resistance to policies, and if we are yet to see the full impact, which could be a measurement issue.

We have to question the disconnect between 'severe', 'draconian' or 'bold' policies.

The latest GDP numbers for Q2 of FY19 show a slight slowdown from Q1. Have we entered a low-inflation and low-growth cycle?

The macro-economic stresses -- high interest rates, rupee depreciation and capital flows -- have receded now.

Interest rates have come down, inflation is down and the rupee has bounced back.

If oil prices continue at this level, there will be no vulnerability.

Growth is a different story for several reasons.

Financial tightness will affect consumption.

Till now, bank credit was being offset by NBFC credit.

But now, even that is being affected.

The international environment is not that conducive as well.

Growth is slowing.

With trade war fears (between the US and China), we will have to navigate all of this carefully.

The European Union has slowed down, so have China and Japan.

Consumption and exports will be challenged.

Investment will depend on how we address the twin balance sheet problem.

So I think we should brace and prepare ourselves for a period of slower growth.

In agriculture, despite good rain -- after two droughts -- farm incomes are coming down. This might be a long-term challenge. Demonetisation might have made a structural change.

Also, direct transfers are needed to cushion farm incomes. This has to be done through cooperative federalism like the GST Council. Mr Jaitley (Finance Minister Arun Jaitley) has also mentioned this.

What are your thoughts on the RBI's capital framework?

There is a whole technical discussion on this.

Four economists, including me, have addressed these in a paper for the Economic Political Weekly.

I feel there are excess reserves.

I have been saying this for three years.

However, I have also said this should only be used for purposes such as recapitalisation of banks.

And, that too, only if sufficient reforms are carried out.

It should not be used to finance deficit.

These reforms include changes to the bank nationalisation Act and giving more powers to the RBI to regulate public sector banks.

Giving the RBI more powers will not solve all issues.

RBI's supervision of private banks and non-banking financial companies has been inadequate.

The government and the RBI need to do things together.

The government should live up to its part of the bargain -- banking reform.

Using excess capital to finance deficit would be like raiding the RBI.

What's your opinion on the independence of institutions such as the RBI, especially in the light of the recent spat between the central bank and the government?

It is in our interest to have strong, effective and credible institutions.

In India, the RBI would be one of the top institutions, with very good reason.

We have had very good governors and deputy governors, very good management and they have broadly done very sensible things.

I think it's very important to have people of high technical quality and integrity running the system.

Independence of the RBI is very important. But that does not mean they can't be criticised.

I have been very vocal in my criticism when it comes to excess reserves, on the inflation framework, and now there is a major problem with NBFCs and IL&FS.

Also, independence credibility is not incompatible with cooperation, consultation and openness.

There needs to be balance.

The government should not politicise the RBI.

There will always be some tension -- 'creative tension' -- between the RBI and the government.

What do you think of the banks's complaints about Basel-III, given that compliance with the capital-conservation buffer has been pushed ahead by a year?

There are two parts to the Basel-III framework.

The first: Capital-conservation buffer.

For the CCB, there are two questions:

1. When do you build it?

2. When do you use it?

The principle is that in good times, you build the CCB; in bad times, you spend it.

The second thing is Basel Plus on tier-I capital ratio.

We have chosen to keep the buffer at a higher level.

I think there are many issues.

The first is our non-performing asset situation has warranted high buffers.

The second thing is these things affect the ratings of the bank papers.

There is argument about why PSBs need it, especially when they are anyway going to be capitalised by the government.

But, we need to have a level playing field between public and private banks.

Basel is complicated, but if you want to run a credible banking system it is necessary.

Many emerging economies have also implemented a Basel Plus framework.

For the broadder financial system, the implication is that we are almost eight-nine years into this financial crisis and we are still so far away from resolving it.

And now, we have this new NBFC problem.

The Insolvency or Bankruptcy Code is a fabulous policy, but resolutions are going much slower than expected.

I do not think we can as a country afford to delay addressing this twin balance sheet problem and we can't keep kicking the can down the road."

""The ongoing local reaction against Christmas is part of the wider sentiment since Xi took power,"" said Zi Yang, a China expert at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

Xi is trying to broaden the appeal of the Communist Party by casting it as a crusader for Chinese tradition in a fast-changing world, he said. ""Therefore, foreign cultural elements such as Christmas are placed on the chopping block.""

The seasonal humbug follows similar outbreaks of anti-Christmas rhetoric in 2014 and 2017. It appears not to be centrally organised, but rather a spreading resistance to foreign festivals by local authorities seeking to align themselves with the growing tide of cultural nationalism.

The squeeze on Christmas is an example of how efforts to ""normalise"" thinking bleed into the everyday lives of many Chinese. That push exploded into view this year through re-education camps for Uighur Muslims and a crackdown on Christian churches that has continued with force in recent weeks.

In Nanyang, about 950 kilometers west of Shanghai, government officials stopped by the office and shopping complex on December 16 to say that Christmas decorations would have to come down, said Ma, the tutoring company employee.

An official from the city's urban management bureau hung up when asked for comment.

Nine hours by car south, Hengyang, a city in Hunan province, said in a December 19 notice posted on an official government social media account that anyone caught holding Christmas sales or celebrations that blocked the streets would be punished.

Communist Party members, the notice said, should avoid foreign festivals and instead be ""models of adherence to Chinese traditional culture."" Hengyang police posted a video on their official social media account of locals discussing the importance of Chinese culture and plans to avoid ostentatious Christmas celebrations.

Langfang city, just south of Beijing, banned Christmas stage performances and merchandising promotions, according to a notice circulated on social media.

Shop windows were to be stripped of Christmas stickers and streets kept free of Christmas banners and lights. Law enforcement patrols were to be stepped up Dec. 23-25 to prevent illegal signs of celebration.

The Langfang urban management bureau declined comment. The state-run Global Times newspaper argued that Western media are exaggerating China's crackdown on Christmas and reported that the restrictions in Langfang were aimed not at Christmas but at cleaning up roadside stalls and migrant vendors in hopes of winning a ""National Civilized City"" award from the Communist Party.

Some 270 kilometers west, Fuping county, also in Hebei province, issued a similar clean-up notice. Though the December 21 announcement mentions Christmas eleven times, an official from the Fuping urban management bureau said the rules were aimed at street vendors generally, not Christmas.

Police in the Panlong district of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province in southern China, circulated a notice that hotels, karaoke parlors, internet cafes, bars and other crowded places must prohibit Christmas-related decorations and activities.

""It is forbidden to hang Christmas stockings, wear Christmas hats, place Christmas trees, and so on,"" the notice read.

It wasn't clear if the notice applied to all of Kunming city, though a police officer told the AP that the order to circulate it came from city officials. Reverend Jonathan Liu, founder of the Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, a California nonprofit, said the pushback against Christmas reflects Xi's efforts to ""Sinicize"" religion.

Preachers are coached on how to convey Communist Party core values in their sermons and national flags and songs have been injected into some church services, he said.

Liu provided the AP with a notice sent to churches in Zhoukou, a city to the east of Nanyang in Henan province.

It tells churches to vet Christmas plans with the government, forbids minors from participating in Christmas events and caps expenses at 2000 yuan (USD 290). ""I wish you all a happy Christmas! God bless you,"" read the notice, which Liu received from a pastor in China.

An official at the United Front Work Department in Zhoukou referred queries to the religious affairs bureau, which could not be reached for comment.

Before becoming president, Xi went to Finland in 2010 and was photographed with Santa Claus. That kind of chumminess appears to be a thing of Christmas past, experts say.

Even the giant teddy bear at the mall entrance wasn't spared, said Ma Jun, who works at a tutoring company in the building. ""Everything is gone and cleaned,"" she said.

Christmas continues to be a shopping festival across most of China, with huge trees adorning shopping malls in Shanghai and Beijing, but a growing emphasis on traditional culture by the ruling Communist Party and the systematic suppression of religion under President Xi Jinping are imperiling Santa Claus's position.

At least four Chinese cities and one county have ordered Christmas decorations banned this year, according to official notices and interviews. Students, teachers and parents from 10 schools around China told The Associated Press that Christmas celebrations have been curtailed.

With major irregularities coming to surface in large entities, some of which had prided themselves as the flag bearers of the corporate governance movement, the myth of a direct relationship between size and governance standards exploded.

Whistle blowers began to find their voice, and the commentariat found adequate opportunities to express informed and uninformed opinions on issues, real and imaginary. Those that lived in denial came up short, and the transgressors found that no longer could excuses masquerade as explanations.

In the midst of the episodic excitement and entertainment that such events produced, the lessons were obvious and compelling.

Some of the cornerstones of corporate governance became no more than rebuttable presumptions in marquee companies.

Independent directors and indeed whole boards moved up to the top spot in the merit list of non-performers, with auditors coming a close second. Those deemed the defenders of the faith got shown up as disbelievers.

Top Of The Demerit List

The board of directors deserves the highest place in the pecking order of those that let the side down.

This collection of individuals - presumably chosen for experience, maturity, wisdom, a sense of balance, and fair play - proved through action, and inaction, that they were no more than clapper boys or cheerleaders for chief executive officers who were considered infallible, invincible, indispensable and immortal.

The highly questionable performance of boards was best illustrated by the manner in which a chairman bolted out of a boardroom, at a pace which Usain Bolt would have envied, to mount a public defence of a CEO whose conduct was in question.

When The Music Stopped

Independent directors have for some time been the punching bag of those who seek to find villains on occasions of corporate misfeasance.

Protestations of being part-time non-executive functionaries, and at the disadvantageous end of information asymmetry, have not convinced anyone that they did not rest their conscience, their thought processes and their voice when they were in boardrooms.

Statutory stipulations regarding the role and responsibilities of independent directors were at best seen as read, but not absorbed and acted on.

Part of the blame clearly lies at the doorstep of those who over prescribe in the mistaken belief that more laws and regulations necessarily lead to better conduct.

The icing on the cake continues to be the attempt to define director independence in quantitative or monetary terms. We seem to be only one step away from seeking to define integrity in monetary terms.

The simplistic perception that compensation and independence have an inverse relationship is striking at the root of the institution of independent directors.

Legislative and regulatory excess is worse than the perceived excess in compensation of independent directors.

The auditor community has also legitimately received a fair share of the blame attached to financial crimes and misdemeanours. With stakeholders placing complete faith in the observations of the auditors, and hoping to make investment decisions based thereon, auditors have sought refuge in increasing disclaimers and complexity of language to escape the responsibility of stating what subsequently has become obvious at least in a few cases.

With an independent statutory disciplinary body, NFRA, now in place, there is reason to hope that auditing conduct will improve and that auditors who wrongly perceive management as their employers, will not pull their punches if irregularities, or worse, are noticed.

Many Challenges In The New Year

2019 is on everyone's mind as the year in which India goes to the polls. At the same time corporate India is expected to witness a significant churn in the composition of the boards, with the first five year term of many directors, after the implementation of the Companies Act, 2013, coming to an end.

Sensing the opportunity that a potential influx of new directors will give rise to, there are attempts to create a revenue model for an institute that will be tasked with assessing the suitability of new appointees to board positions.

There is no clarity yet on how attributes such as collegial behaviour (as distinct from collusive behaviour), independence and integrity will be determined by an institute through an assessment process. The outsourcing of the statutory responsibility of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee to a bunch of academics is a highly questionable move.

2019 will also see the position of chairman of the board being occupied by a number of new entrants to the board, especially with the position becoming non-executive in the near future.

The presumption that every chairman will hit the ground running and will need no orientation to provide leadership to the board deserves to be set aside.

Programmes are required to be designed to handhold new chairmen to clearly understand their role as leaders of the board, and to help create an enabling environment for board members to contribute effectively in exercising superintendence, direction and control.

Breaking Up Unwieldy Boards

The size of the board is also a cause for concern. Unwieldy boards with a large number of executive members, many of whom do not express views other than on their functional areas, is a problem that needs to be addressed.

Simultaneously, the fear factor that drives independent directors out of boardrooms has to be taken cognizance of, so that the corporate sector is not denied the benefit of their wisdom.

The answer presumably lies in a two-tier board structure that has the independent directors on the supervisory board, and the executive directors on the fiduciary board.

This approach will provide relative safety for independent directors while factoring in the legitimate aspirations of functional business leaders to become board members. An abundance of executive directors on a unitary board also negates the board-management distinction.

An Evaluation Mechanism

If boards and their constituent directors are to add value on a continuing basis, it is necessary to have a robust no-holds-barred evaluation system put in place. The mutual admiration societies that come into being, as a result of what passes for peer evaluation within the boardroom, should be a thing of the past.

The salutary example of the United Kingdom which provides for evaluation by an external agency at least once in three years would be a good starting point. Due disclosure here: Excellence Enablers, with which I am associated with, functions as an external board evaluation consultant.

The Ideal Package

Boards that are right in size and content, and have role clarity, board committees that are correctly constituted and contribute meaningfully, constructive tension between boards and managements, auditors that seek and state the truth, retail shareholders that ask questions, institutional investors that practice activism -- and do not stray into adventurism -- and proxy advisory firms that distinguish the grain from the chaff, is the package that Santa should hopefully bring this month.

The lessons have hopefully been learnt. The solutions are in sight. What is needed is clarity, courage and conviction to put in place a meaningful pragmatic value-adding structure, supported by appropriate procedures, to ensure that 2019 will be the turning point in India's corporate governance history.

No longer must it be said that when the going got tough, the tough got going from the boardrooms, and the stakeholders got burnt at the stake.

Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman said there were ""profound evidentiary problems which would have made it highly unlikely that any criminal charge could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.""

In a statement, Freeman said that after an investigation by Minneapolis police and a review by four senior sexual assault prosecutors, it was clear his office could not meet its burden of proof, and therefore could not bring charges.

""Because we do not want to re-victimize the young woman, we will not be going into detail,"" Freeman said.

The 45-year-old Liu, who grew JD.com from a humble electronics stall to an e-commerce giant with 2017 net revenues of $55.7 billion (roughly Rs. 3.8 lakh crores) and maintains tight control of the company, was released without charge about 17 hours after he was arrested on August 31.

He quickly returned to China, where he has continued to run the company. His representatives have maintained his innocence after the woman from China studying at the University of Minnesota accused him of rape.

Liu said in a social media post he felt ""utter self-admonishment and regret"" for the ""enormous pain"" his ""actions on that day"" caused his family, especially his wife, internet celebrity Zhang Zetian.

""I immediately confessed to her the truth, and hope she can accept my most sincere apologies,"" he said in a statement on the Weibo platform.

Liu said the decision by prosecutors not to press charges proved that he had not violated any laws ""from to start to finish"".

He said he had been unable to defend himself earlier despite ""misleading information"" and could not respond to comments in social media and news reports because he did not want to obstruct the investigation and judicial process.

JD.com shares extended gains on Friday after news spread of the decision not to prosecute, and closed up 5.9 percent.

The case has attracted extreme interest in China. Liu could have faced up to 30 years in prison under Minnesota law if convicted of first-degree criminal sexual misconduct.

'Story will be told'

On Friday, Freeman said the three months it took his office to review Liu's case was not unusual for a sexual assault investigation, especially one in which no one was in custody.

""It had nothing to do with Liu's status as a wealthy, foreign businessman,"" Freeman said in his statement.

A lawyer for the student who accused Liu criticised the decision, saying it showed why victims of sexual assault feared coming forward, and questioned why prosecutors waited to issue a release until late on the Friday before Christmas.

Investigators ""never met this victim; they never spoke to this victim; they never sought to meet with her lawyers,"" the attorney, Wil Florin, said in a statement.

""Her story will be told. On her behalf we will not permit her dignity to be simply swept under the rug.""

The Hennepin County Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Florin's statement.

An attorney for Liu said they welcomed the decision, and hoped that it would dispel ""misinformation and speculation"".

""Mr Liu was arrested based on a false claim, and after a thorough investigation, with which he fully cooperated, the declination of charges vindicates him,"" Liu's attorney, Jill Brisbois, said in a statement.

Florin said his client will file a civil lawsuit, saying they looked forward to a civil jury hearing the ""full and complete story"" and determining whether Liu, JD.com and their representatives should be held accountable.

Reuters previously reported details of what happened while Liu was in Minneapolis, including a description of the alleged attack and the events around it given by the now-22-year-old student.

Usually based in Beijing, Liu made the US trip for a week long residency program at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management, which runs a doctor of business administration program with China's elite Tsinghua University.

The University of Minnesota said it had no comment on Friday's announcement.

The decision to not prosecute followed criticism of Minneapolis authorities, including Freeman's office, for what some see as a failure to pursue sexual assault cases adequately.

This Bengaluru based NGO has come out to help India achieve its aim by 2020 by feeding at least 50 lakh children across the country every day.

Only such giant leaps can make a difference, feels the management of The Akshay Patra Foundation which runs what it claims is the world's largest school lunch programme to end child hunger and to support education.

For this foundation, feeding 50 lakh school students is not a distant pipe-dream but an attainable challenge as it already feeds 19 lakh (1.9 million) students every school day.

In its over 40 kitchens across 12 states in India -- with most centralised kitchens having the capacity to cook up to 100,000 meals -- around 7,000 people from different castes and creed work together to serve hot cooked meals to students, says Ratnagada Govind Das, President of the Rajasthan unit of The Akshaya Patra Foundation.

Home to over 46 million malnourished children as per the Global Nutrition Report 2018, India ranks 103 among 119 countries in the Global Hunger Index.

The Global Hunger Index 2018 report says that at least one in five Indian children under the age of five is wasted (having extremely low weight for their height), reflecting acute under-nutrition. The only country with a higher prevalence of child wasting is the war-torn nation of South Sudan.

Das says the foundation hires people from all castes and religions to work under one roof with a single aim so as to ensure that no child in India is deprived of education because of hunger.

Mukesh Mali, who has been working in one of the Akshay Patra kitchens in Rajasthan for the last five years, says, ""We ensure that cleanliness and hygiene standards are followed in our kitchen. I and my other co-workers love cooking as it brings in a sense of satisfaction that we satiate the hunger of so many kids. The food from this Jaipur kitchen goes to distant places.""

Just as hunger doesn't discriminate, one can also find true diversity not only in The Akshaya Patra Foundation's (TAPF) kitchens where people from different castes and religions cook prasadam (a devotional food offering made to a god that is later shared among devotees) together, but also in students who come from different castes and religions and receive that prasadam in the form of mid-day meals.

Sharing the reason why this food is called prasadam, Das says that after being cooked, it is first served to the Lord and then it reaches schools.

B.D. Kumawat, administration head in Ajmera's Tikamchand School where students' mid-day meal comes from TAPF, says most students in the school come from the Katchhi Basti (an underprivileged neighbourhood) nearby.

""They come from poor backgrounds and hence this food being served here is like a blessing to them. The quality and the taste is good. Hence they love coming to schools. In fact, the school attendance has gone up after the distribution of this meal,"" he says.

Started in the year 2000 in Bengaluru, TAPF's mid-day meal scheme is the largest programme to serve meals in schools in India. In Rajasthan alone, it feeds over two lakh children from its 11 kitchens.

""The organisation is looking forward to the goal of feeding 50 lakh children each day by 2020,"" Das says.

He adds that the biggest challenge in cooking for millions is maintaining the quality and delivering the food without it going bad.

If any lapse is detected, it becomes a big challenge to immediately stop the same lot of food from getting distributed and evaluating the reason for the problem and making sure it doesn't happen again.

Das says the parents of the beneficiary students are also very happy with the programme.

""As we are mainly working on feeding underprivileged kids, their parents feel relieved that at least this one nutritious meal is being served to their children for which they don't have to worry,"" he says.

Divya Jain, regional quality head at Akshay Patra, says the foundation ensures that the food suffices the dietary requirements of the students.

""We follow the ISO 22000 standard that is the highest standard in food safety and hygiene. The food we cook here is precisely made and the menu is well-designed too. It is least hand-handled and comes with nice nutritional value. Kids love this meal as the taste is good,"" he says.

""We serve a three-course menu, including chapati, pulses, vegetables, rice and soups,"" he adds.

Das says it also makes parents push their children to attend school regularly and to study. ""As per a survey, it has been seen that the attendance in these government schools where they get mid-day meals has increased tremendously,"" Das adds.

""Hunger, malnutrition, ill-health and gender inequality are constraints to attaining an education. Through this mid-day meal programme, we have tried to tackle these problems. Further, these meals provide a sociable environment where children from different backgrounds interact and break barriers of the caste system,"" he says."

The sooner-than-expected departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis shifts the focus to President Donald Trump's appointment of an acting Pentagon chief and plans for a permanent replacement.

It also signals an acrimonious end to a tense relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Mattis that had eroded in recent months. A fracture developed last week over Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and worsened after Mr. Mattis' public disagreement with Mr. Trump, aired in his resignation letter.

Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan will take over as acting secretary on Jan. 1, Mr. Trump announced in a tweet Sunday. He had worked for more than three decades at Boeing Co. and was a senior vice president when he became Pentagon deputy in July 2017.

In the new year Mr. Trump wants to focus on streamlining purchases at the Pentagon, an issue on which Mr. Shanahan has already been working, a White House official said. The official asked not to be identified publicly discussing personnel matters.

U.S. officials said they didn't know if Mr. Shanahan would be Mr. Trump's nominee to replace Mr. Mattis. During a lunch with conservative lawmakers Saturday at the White House, Mr. Trump discussed his options. They were ""not all military,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who was among those attending.

Mr. Shanahan's biography on the Pentagon's website does not list military experience for the longtime Boeing executive. He earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington, then a master's degree in mechanical engineering as well as an MBA from the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In addition to work in Boeing's commercial airplanes programs, Mr. Shanahan was vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems and of Boeing Rotorcraft Systems. In a March 2016 report, the Puget Sound Business Journal called Mr. Shanahan a Boeing ""fix-it"" man who was central to getting the 787 Dreamliner on track after production problems in the program's early years.

An acting defense secretary is highly unusual. Historically when a secretary has resigned, he has stayed on until a successor is confirmed. For example, when Chuck Hagel was told to resign in November 2014, he stayed in office until Ash Carter was confirmed the following February.

Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, had been expected to retain his position as Pentagon chief through February. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, not the president, notified Mr. Mattis of Mr. Trump's decision to put in place Mr. Shanahan, said a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity to discuss personnel issues.

The sudden change stripped Mr. Mattis of any chance to further frame national security policy or smooth rattled relations with allies over the next two months. But U.S. officials said the reaction to Mr. Mattis' decision to leave it sparked shock and dismay on Capitol Hill annoyed Mr. Trump and likely led to pushing Mr. Mattis out.

""When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mr. Mattis, I gave him a second chance. Some thought I shouldn't, I thought I should,"" Mr. Trump tweeted Saturday, foreshadowing his displeasure and the Sunday announcement. He also fumed over the media coverage of his Syria withdrawal order, suggesting he should be popular for bringing troops home.

""With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!"" Mr. Trump tweeted.

A White House official said Mr. Trump decided Mr. Mattis should leave the administration earlier than planned to avoid a drawn-out transition when someone on hand whom they consider a qualified deputy capable of running the Pentagon in an acting capacity. The official asked not to be identified publicly discussing personnel matters.

While Mr. Mattis' resignation followed Mr. Trump's announcement that he would soon pull all of the approximately 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria, officials said that the decision was the result of an accumulation of disagreements.

In a stunning resignation letter, Mr. Mattis made clear he did not see eye to eye with a President who has expressed disdain for NATO and doubts about keeping troops in Asia. Mr. Mattis was also unhappy with Mr. Trump's order to develop plans to pull out up to half of the 14,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

Earlier Sunday, Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff said that Mr. Trump had known for ""quite some time now"" that he and Mr. Mattis ""did not share some of the same philosophies ... have the same world view.""

Mick Mulvaney told ABC's ""This Week"" that the president and his defense chief ""just could never get on the same page"" on Syria, adding that Mr. Trump had said since his presidential campaign that ""he wanted to get out of Syria."" Mulvaney said the president ""is entitled to have a secretary of defense who is committed to that same end.""

Asked whether Mr. Trump wanted a Pentagon leader willing to challenge him or someone in lock step with his views, Mulvaney said ""a little bit of both.""

""I've encouraged him to find people who have some overlap with him but don't see the world in lockstep with him,"" Mulvaney said.

Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., joined leading Republicans on foreign affairs in urging Mr. Trump to reconsider his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and called it ""a premature and costly mistake."" They asked Mr. Trump to withhold a final decision for 90 days to allow time to study the impact of the decision, but Mulvaney told ABC that Mr. Trump wouldn't change his mind.

Just after tweeting the announcement about Mr. Shanahan, Mr. Trump said he had had ""a long and productive call"" with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr. Trump said they discussed IS, ""our mutual involvement in Syria, & the slow & highly coordinated pullout of U.S. troops from the area. After many years they are coming home."""

""We need a second independence movement. We have to clear the cobwebs in our own brain first,"" says Salil Shetty, former secretary-general of Amnesty International and previously director of the United Nations Millennium Campaign.

Back in India after spending most of the year as a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School, Shetty was in Mumbai last week to speak at IIT Bombay's Techfest on technology and freedoms for India's poor.

A graduate from the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad and the London School of Economics, Shetty is a human rights campaigner with decades of experience.

In conversation with Rediff.com's Archana Masih, he discusses the anti-human rights discourse in the country and his plan to start a movement with India's youth, independent of religion or politics.

What have been the glaring examples of human rights violations in the last few years?

Encounter killings, lynchings, attack on civil society, silencing of the media, attempts to compromise the judiciary etc.

The thing we don't talk about is the highly discriminatory and ineffective criminal justice system.

Half a million people are in prison and 70% on detention without trial -- mostly Dalits, minorities. Two thirds are petty offenders.

It is a well known fact that even if you are not a criminal if you spend long years in jail you come out being one.

Rich people don't spend time in prison. The poor, low castes don't have money to pay for bail.

How has the State failed in protecting citizen rights?

The State's job is to protect people's human rights. Perpetrators in India are individuals, government, religious bodies and corporations.

Extractive corporations are worst because they function in the tribal belt. Greenpeace is constantly under attack in India because they raise their voice in the tribal belt.

If Greenpeace is attacked they fight back, but what when a Dalit or Muslim is attacked?

What are the challenges that human rights activists encounter that they did not face before?

The last few years has been exceptionally hard for human rights activists.

They are creating an anti-human rights discourse. The idea is to sow a seed of suspicion or doubt in those who are neutral.

We are in a desperate situation that need desperate measures. You have to campaign for the values you stand for and make people think hard before they cast their vote.

The killing of a police officer showed the impunity with which a mob could kill an officer of the law.

The Bulandshahr killing was exceptional. The killing of a police officer by Hindu fundamentalists which is in line with the current government's approach towards hypernationalism.

Hindutva politics is not new in this country, but these people have taken it to a different level.

The country needs urgent attention on more serious things -- education, health and water. The farmers, the poor in this country, are in a crisis and so much energy is going into all this.

Lynching is a major assault on human rights. How do you explain this phenomena because it is not only about the cow, but people have been lynched because they have been thought to be child lifters?

Once you open this can, then you lose control over it.

In UP over 1,000 encounter killings have taken place in nine months after Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Ajay Singh Bisht aka Yogi Adityanath) took over, which include 32 deaths.

If you ask people on the street they would probably say that something needed to be done as people are getting away with all sorts of crimes, so basically this leads to normalising such killings and actually makes it acceptable.

In a country that claims to be a democracy one has to follows due process even if that person has committed a crime.

People have lost faith in the mainstream system and are looking for shortcuts.

A couple of weeks after Human Rights Day, how do you see the situation in India today?

I left India in 1995. Twenty three years later what has changed and not can be classified into two -- freedom from want and freedom from fear.

Human rights is not one or the other. Often, people think of human rights as civil-political rights. There have been many important achievements and we shouldn't belittle them -- reduction in poverty, enrollment of girls.

Even on freedom from want, much as we have achieved, we are yet so far behind on global indices.

On the human development index, the most important human metric, when I left we were 139, we are still in the 130s out of 170, 180, in spite of this so-called macro economic growth.

Unfortunately, the trickle down logic has never worked in this country.

On the civil-political side -- I was in school when the Emergency was declared under Indira Gandhi. That was the fight of a lifetime. We thought we had won back all those freedoms.

It is the first time since then that we are seeing a flashback of that kind of behaviour.

Critics of that belief say you can freely criticise the PM which you could not do during the Emergency.

If we took the benchmark we can take away 1 or 2 differences, but there are far too many similarities. I hope we don't have to use 1975, 1976 as a benchmark!

The ambience is that you are not allowed to dissent in this country.

There is a systematic onslaught of trying to reframe what this country is about.

Has the human rights movement in India been marginalised? Are organisations not pushing hard enough like PUCL, PUDR did in the past?

It is being done systematically. India has never had a strong human rights NGO movement. It has had a few important ones. Each and every one has been under attack. They have managed to silence a lot of them.

I don't think human rights groups are not pushing for the cause of human rights, but they are small and weak to start with and have become even more smaller and weaker.

Anti-human rights narrative is much more mainstream, it is partly also global thanks to Trump.

Has the narrative of aggressive nationalism created a climate of hostility towards activists?

The mythology of ultra nationalism is that the only way they can create a Hindu identity is from a vote bank perspective. The only way to shore up your side is by having 'the other' who you can show as 'the other'.

Human rights organisations are a scapegoat to show that they are anti nationals and we are national -- and it seems to be working perfectly.

The question is: Can they sustain it?

You can't sustain a campaign of hate. You can't go on creating division and rhetoric of hate. It comes to roost. We are seeing the first glimpses of that in the state elections.

And it is not only about Hindutva. The violence against women -- rapes -- there are over 100 rapes a day of which more than one quarter are minors. The shocking part is that only one out of four cases lead to convictions.

What is the solution?

We need a second independence movement. A lot of independence is in our head. We have to clear the cobwebs in our own brain first.

There are people who are extreme right wing Hindutva and there are others who believe in the values of the Constitution, but there is a massive number in the middle that is totally confused, who can be pushed this way or that.

These are young, mostly educated, mostly unemployed and have a lot of frustration, anger so they are being pushed this way or that.

We have to work with them. It is a crucial moment for a pan India youth movement which is not political or religious -- for saving India.

How can ordinary Indians be more vocal about assaults on human rights? The Congress has also been silent on human rights violations.

Electoral politics can deliver only so much on fundamental, cultural and social change. It has to be an independent movement which has to attack frontally.

This country needs a youth movement not based on religion or politics but based on the ground of saving India.

What are the dangers to India's future by the attacks on minority human rights?

There are 200 million plus Muslims in India, the second largest Muslim country after Indonesia.

If you start attacking them through the NRC (the National Register of Citizens of India), lynchings, through commando TV channels, it is playing with fire.

What are your thoughts on the MeToo movement in India?

The status of women in India is a serious concern. I am delighted they are speaking up and all power to them. This is the tip of the iceberg. I don't know of a single woman who has not experienced this in India.

In the West it is 1/3rd of the women, here it is 100% who face sexual abuse. Imagine a MeToo movement of domestic workers -- if women start speaking up they will shake up the foundations of the country.

You can't let the State go scot-free in MeToo. It is also the State's responsibility to safeguard women.

No State can function if society and religion is sanctifying the women as second class."

""Hundreds of two-wheelers and autorickshaws rule the stretch. Metro construction work is going on in the area and the carriageway of the road has reduced. To make matter worse, cab drivers often take the wrong side of the road and block the traffic towards Kasarwadi,"" said Rane, who regularly commutes along the road.

Amol Badre, a resident of Pimple Saudagar, said wrong side driving was rampant in the area and the traffic police have failed to control the offenders. ""All kinds of vehicles, mostly cabs, drive on the wrong side. The situation is alarming near the U-turn at the Govind Yashada Chowk,"" he said.

The situation is similar at Wakdewadi, a stretch on the DP Road close to Paranjape high school in Kothrud, on East Street near George restaurant and M G Road in the Pune Camp area, on Pune-Alandi road in Dighi and Vishrantwadi and Shivajinagar.

A cab driver was on December 14 arrested for attacking a traffic policeman and misbehaving with a woman constable after he was intercepted for wrong side driving on the stretch between Sasanenagar and Kalepadal in Hadapsar. The arrested cab driver had flouted the no entry norm to reach Sasanenagar.

The wrong side driving menace resurfaced in the city after a speeding sedan came hurtling down the wrong side of Shivarkar Road in Fatimanagar on December 21 and collided with two scooters, killing a pillion rider of one vehicle and injuring two others.

Traffic police officers said the cab drivers tend to violate the road rules particularly in the early hours of the day and after 10 pm.

Deputy commissioner of police Tejaswi Satpute, ""We do not have the exact number of cases where cab drivers were penalized for wrong side driving. But we frequently catch them while driving on the wrong side across the city. It seems that they do this in an attempt to take a shorter and faster route to destinations.""

She added that the officers in charge of the traffic divisions have been conducting awareness drive, exclusively for cab and autorickshaw drivers. ""We will soon launch a new awareness campaign for the drivers to intensify our action,"" Satpute said.

Citizens, however, are not much convinced with the traffic department's performance and said the police should crack the whip on all motorists and two-wheeler riders violating the road rules. ""Mere deployment of policemen at some traffic junctions will not resolve this issue."" said software professional Kishor Raskar.

""We often find personnel monitoring traffic snarls at the junctions to prevent signal jumping. But what they need to do more is to pay attention to more serious issues, such as wrong side driving. It is rampant across the city. The traffic department needs to have a proper strategy in place for this,"" he said.

A section of traffic activists and police officials claimed that many cab drivers were ""not educated enough"" and ""did not pay much heed to the traffic rules"". An officer said, ""The customers need to ensure negative feedback for traffic rule violations.""

DCP Satpute said the traffic department has appointed about 600 personnel to monitor 1,350 junctions across the city. She said, ""Maximum manpower is utilized for monitoring traffic at these junction. It is difficult to deploy our personnel on each and every road. Active participation of the citizens is important to improve the traffic management.""

Guru Katti, the president of the Swarjya Vahan Chalak Sangatna that has over 2.5 lakh cab drivers registered across the state, said, ""Poor infrastructures often prompt several cabbies to resort to wrong side driving. But this is not the solution. We are working on the issue, but several drivers do not abide by our instructions. We are working in tandem with the traffic police to curb the menace.""

An Ola official told TOI over phone, ""We regularly conduct traffic awareness drives for our drivers. We penalize them based on the customers' feedbacks. In cases such as fatal accidents and frequent traffic violations involving our drivers, we terminate their contracts.""

TOI tried to contact Uber for its comment on the issue. However, a reply to a mail sent to the company was awaited until the filing of the report."

The deafening silence of the aftermath of the Kumbh Mela gripped the atmosphere. A rather bereaved Vikas Khanna, who was mourning his father's death, sat in a corner on the Manikarnirka Ghat in Varanasi when a young girl approached him for money. Soon into the conversation, the Michelin star recipient learned that she was a tightrope walker and was begging so that she could actually go to school one day. The conversation was so brief, and yet so moving that Vikas was convinced he had to share it with the world. After two and a half years, the audience will get to see a rendition of this young girl in Chhoti, the protagonist of his upcoming debut film The Last Color.

The Last Color is not only the debut of the celebrity chef's foray into filmmaking, but also a testament that there is nothing that Vikas can't do. Talking about his latest project which is based on the book of same name, which, he published years ago, Vikas elucidates, ""For 30 years you are working on one thing, and suddenly you feel that there is a story so compelling that you want it to be celebrated. Then, I thought let's show it in a visual form to the world and show the majestic story of colours. I realised that only I knew the heart of the story, so I should direct it and make it very organic and give it an un-filmy look.""

Based in Varanasi, the film explores an unconventional friendship between a young flower seller and a tightrope walker Chhoti (Aqsa Siddiqui) and an old widow Noor (Neena Gupta) who has been living in abstinence of worldly pleasures for a long time. With stellar vignettes of the ghat-laden landscapes of Varanasi and dramatic sequences, its vivid symbolism of colours is what makes this film unique. In a scene, where Noor, dressed in white from head-to toe, smiles at the camera in the backdrop of Holi celebration, the chef-writer-director's harks at the plight of widows who are subdued under the dogmatic and archaic superstition and beliefs. ""For a chef, colours are everything. How things grow, how they are cooked, and to how they are served, everything is about colours. And to take colours away from someone is heartbreaking,"" rues Vikas.

Hence to play such an intense yet sublime character, the restaurateur believes that only Neena could have pulled it off, as she rightly did. ""I don't think there is anyone who could have portrayed this role better than Neenaji. I even titled the first draft of the movie as Neena. We met quite a few times, and I had her in my mind for this role. Her observation, her attitude, her simplicity, everything was just perfect,"" Vikas gushes. He adds about the character, saying, ""Neenaji's character is not a bichari (helpless). She has layers of depth. Her love for Tagore, her grandfather who empowered her and she has multiple layers to her, as it gets revealed through the dialogues. I know I fought for dialogues. Everything was fought for, it could not have been filmy.""

Besides the fondness for Neena's character, it is the character of a trans woman Anarkali in the film who the writer-director holds close to his heart. Like every character in the film, Anarkali is also a dramatised representation of Vikas' real encounter with a transgender Munna who used to protect street girls by giving shelter to them in the night. ""When I heard the story, I was so moved and saw power of a different level. I told him that you are not a Munna, you have the power of Shiva, and the heart of Lakshmi,"" says Vikas. With Anarkali's character, not only is the director breaking the traditional depiction of trans woman in movies, but also setting up an example of inclusivity in the movie industry by casting the trans woman-activist Rudrani Chhetri to play the role. Talking about the pivotal character, he says, ""Anarkali is so heart warming and raises Chhoti as a protector. She is abused socially, and even condemned by the cops who abuse her badly. But, we have treated her as any other female character, and not even one time do we mention that she is a transgender."" Moreover, as revealed by Vikas, Rudrani even got emotional during the shoot and thanked him respecting the transgender community. ""And I felt so happy, she made my role more powerful as a director,"" he says.

Having taken the Indian cuisine on a global platform with his high-end restaurant Junoon in New York, Vikas is quite rightly the tour de force behind Indian cuisine. So for a celebrated chef to venture into making a movie might seem painfully difficult and contrasting, but for Vikas being on the set and holding such a big team, was akin to being in the kitchen. This dawned on the restaurateur when the crew had to light up 3000 lamps in 20 minutes for a scene that would last 20 seconds. ""In that moment, I felt like I was running a kitchen. The game is all about management and discipline. Everything in the kitchen is not going to go okay and service is going to go haywire, if the kitchen has not been briefed. The kitchen thing came when I briefed everyone at twilight that we have to light up all the lamps in 20 minutes. That is when I realised that shooting and being in the kitchen are the same, it's about management and discipline,"" concludes Vikas."

Effective midnight, Friday, December 21st, there is a partial federal government shutdown in effect.

Earlier this week, the National League of Cities (NLC) called on federal leaders to do their jobs and find a bipartisan solution to avoid a shutdown and keep every federal agency open.

""Cities expect our leaders in Washington to meet their most basic obligation and keep the federal government open,"" said NLC President Karen Freeman-Wilson, mayor of Gary, Indiana. ""A federal shutdown would impact programs that grow local economies and build more resilient communities. Instead of wasting $6.5 billion a week on a shutdown, let's put that money to good use -- by investing in America's cities.""

This would be a ""partial"" shutdown because Congress met the deadline to approve five of the twelve total appropriations bills. In addition to all ""mandatory"" spending programs, federal discretionary grant programs administered through the following agencies will not be impacted by the partial shutdown:

For city leaders, this means residents can expect uninterrupted operations and payments from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. VA Hospitals and other service providers for veterans should remain open. Before and after school programs funded by the Department of Education's 21 Century Community Learning Center grants should not be interrupted.

Unfortunately for city leaders, the federal agencies that will be shutting down to various degrees are those that administer most federal grants allocated directly to municipal governments, including:

According to this detailed Q&A from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, when a funding lapse results in the shutdown of a federal agency, the government must discontinue all non-essential discretionary functions until new funding legislation is passed and signed into law. And according to this White House Shutdown FAQ, all normally, routine, ongoing operational and administrative activities relating to contract or grant administration (including payment processing) cannot continue when there is a lapse in funding. Moreover, federal agency employees who are paid with annual appropriations and who perform an activity associated with contract or grant administration (including oversight, inspection, payment or accounting) should generally not continue work during a lapse in appropriations.

In other words, federal discretionary grants that are administered to local governments from unfunded federal agencies, including HUD's CDBG and HOME grants, DOJ's COPS grants, DOT's TIGER grants, EDA's economic development grants, SBA's small business loans, and USDA's rural loans and grants, will be unavailable for reimbursement to local governments, and agency staff will generally be unavailable to answer questions or offer technical assistance throughout the duration of the partial government shutdown. Any local employees funded by federal grants may also be required to stop work.

The White House Office of Management and Budget maintains a list of each agency's plans here. Additional contingency information may be posted on individual agency websites as well.

A short shutdown of a week or less will have little to no impact on cities (although it will cost the federal government plenty to furlough employees, mothball offices, and reopen even a short time later). The effects of a longer shutdown would multiply quickly, including inaccessible federal funding, project delays and potential layoffs. As federal funding for services dry up, residents usually expect local governments to step in with supplemental funding. Eventually it will fall on cities and states to bear the cost of the shutdown on the broader economy, which will result in less tax revenue for all levels of government.

The federal law that prohibits agencies from incurring obligations in advance of appropriations, the Antideficiency Act, also requires an ""orderly shutdown"" when there has been a lapse in appropriations. Of course, actual government shutdowns are anything but orderly, and there will be exceptions and inconsistencies across the board, known and unknown.

Among the known exceptions and inconsistencies, if there is a partial government shutdown:"

With the country heading for elections in 2019, this edition of IE Thinc looks at the possible impact of fake news. Will the crisis worsen? Will fake news sway opinion and decide electoral fortunes? On the panel are Ashutosh, former TV journalist and former AAP leader; Chandra Mani Shukla, Executive Council Member of the platform Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC); Jency Jacob, Managing Editor of the fact-check portal Boom; Tom Goldstein, founding Dean and Professor with Jindal School of Journalism and Communication; and Sudha Pai, political scientist. The discussion was moderated by Seema Chishti, Deputy Editor, The Indian Express.

The big concerns relating to fake news

Tom Goldstein: In the very loose use of the term, United States President Donald Trump has defined fake news as something he thinks is not accurate, something negative towards him -- that is far from being intentionally false. Last week, in a tweet, Trump wrote, 'A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News'. I watch a lot of news and I am hard-pressed to single out stories that are purposely false and inaccurate. When asked for specifics, Trump ducked the question. What is he talking about? It is not the media that is irresponsible, it is he who is irresponsible and he is getting away with it... One reason that Trump -- and by extension other demagogues in other countries -- is so effective that he skilfully exploits long-standing conventions that govern the media. He puts in a blatantly absurd accusation about mainstream media out there. There is no single individual or group of spokespeople of the media of equal weight to Trump to refute the charge. So his relentless dishonesty works.

'Fake news' shimmers with double meaning. There is not so much news falsifying reality as this news about false claims. He scapegoats the news, a very old tactic -- trying to kill the messenger. We would all with be better off if we dropped the use of the confusing phrase 'fake news'.

The responsibility of the messenger

Ashutosh: We need to understand the context in which fake news has become so important today, and it can impact elections. From 2013 onwards, when Narendra Modi was elected the prime ministerial candidate, a lot of things have been happening on social media. And once he has become the PM, this country has been continuously at war. There is a war over who can manipulate minds and capture minds, who can manipulate people to vote on their behalf. In that sense, the BJP or Hindutva-wadi forces have been consistent on this. The other forces, who should be challenging them, have woken up very late. Now it is like an even kind of thing. Now there is fake news from the left-liberal side -- Congress, Left and others -- and there are challenges from the other side also. Before 2014, there was only left-of-the-centre media, now there is right-of-the-centre media also. It is a fight between these two ideologies which is creating so much tension, which is creating so much fake news, because both of them are trying to manipulate minds with a political intent to affect elections. We have to understand this. Otherwise fake news is not new. Fake news has suddenly become so important, as rightly said, thanks to Mr Trump.

The challenge of spotting fake news from multiple sides

Advertising

Jency Jacob: Six months back if you had asked me this question, I would have said yes, the right wing was dominating the narrative. Now, there is an increase in the number of Facebook pages and Twitter handles coming up who are bringing in that narrative from the other side as well. So there is no more a right versus left in terms of who is dominating it. There is a pattern where both sides have realised that you have to capture the minds of voters very early, before elections come closer. Over the last two months, I have seen pages generating 15 lakh followers, 20 lakh followers. Now, where are these pages coming from? So there is clearly a market for these kinds of stories, images and videos that are being put out, and each post has a large number of shares. People are blindly sharing it because it clearly appeals to their thought processes and ideologies; they don't even bother to check whether there is any reality in it or not. It is a serious problem that we will realise only when something like a lynching incident happens. That is when the government woke up and questioned why WhatsApp is being misused to put out these images and videos that are resulting in people dying. Unfortunate as it may sound, until something like that happens, I don't think people are realising what is happening on the platform.

Why this technology appeals to the voter

Sudha Pai: We need to look at both political parties and society. Parties mobilise along the lines of social cleavages, and as a result they create polarisation, differences, othering of communities. Political parties have been very responsible for this; that is where fake news finds a very fertile ground. There is heightened competition, parties will do anything to win, and use of social media has become very important. Parties do data mining; from that data they make messages, which are then sent to various regions depending on the kind of messages, and therefore you influence voter behaviour.

Why are people consuming it? We are living in a post-globalisation situation where there is a very consumerist ideology; you consume news -- and pass it on... Society today, in this post-globalisation period, is also a process where there is a lot of anxiety, a lot of aspiration. For example, there is disappointment that there are no jobs, and the farmer thinks his son is going to become a saab but ultimately he doesn't get anything -- these people are very receptive to fake news. There is also consumer bias. If you read a bit of news and it goes with your ideas, you don't vet it and pass it on. And then there is a cascading effect. Journalism of a particular kind has also contributed.

Whether professionals who deal with political parties are playing on this

Chandra Mani Shukla: We see it [the work by professionals] as increasing the efficiency and bringing structure to the outreach that the party is doing, whether online or offline. We see it as bridging the gap between the leader and the masses. We see it as professionals going on the ground and interacting with voters, understanding what their aspirations are, coming up with the right manifesto which can become part of the incoming government's priorities. In terms of the social media tools, use or misuse depends on which hands the tools fall into. Tools can either be unstructured or structured -- let's talk about the unstructured part and where it comes from. There are followers of all parties which spread misinformation, whether or not it is in the knowledge of the leader. Over the last two years, when these instances have come to the light, all platforms -- Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp -- have taken certain measures where it becomes very difficult to make bots and fake accounts or to disseminate misinformation centrally, and we have a certain amount of awareness with fact-checking sites coming up, with media groups helping out with regular fact-checking facilities. With all of these, the role of professionals in politics does not tie to increasing the availability of fake news in the market.

Whether putting out facts can act as a counter to fake news

Tom Goldstein: The press, at least in the United States, has been too timid. They have been terrified of those in power, who are getting away with stuff. They have got to fight back and get the truth out. It is not going to be easy, but I think... the Press Council of India -- I don't know how effective it is -- the United States does not have one; it should.

If the business of good news will eventually flush out fake news

Ashutosh: Fake news distribution and dissemination is done from the top. There are offices, money is spent, people are recruited, and everyday it is monitored and a report is sent to the top management. Accordingly the fake news is generated and sent. Secondly, it is not Facebook but WhatsApp that has become very important these days. WhatsApp has become more dangerous than Facebook because WhatsApp is not a public platform. Someone is getting the information, he has no way to check it up, he just reads it and gets inside. From my experience, political parties are majorly focusing on WhatsApp.

About good and bad journalism -- we have seen in the last few months that a few fake news instances came up on a TV channel and there was a discussion on this. This doesn't mean that journalism has gone astray. In fact, now people are not relying on social media but are relying more on reliable sources. Good journalism will prevail as people understand the game-plan of these people.

When dark information comes one-to-one rather than on a public platform

Jency Jacob: Between September and October, every time we did a fact-check story, we also tagged the piece of misinformation that is on the platform itself, so that Facebook's algorithm could kill the distribution. There is some amount of work going around in Facebook. WhatsApp is one big problem. We figured out that between WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook, there is a very clear cycle of information that goes around... The reason why you won't see a lot of verified handles pushing out some of the stuff is because they are worried that they can be caught. As far as WhatsApp is concerned, it's an open game.

Advertising

Yes, it is important to put out facts. All those verified handles of ministers who used to put out data without checking it, every time we have called them out, they have realised that there are people who are checking them and they have actually reduced the number of data points they are putting out. That's one good thing that has happened due to this fact-checking universe. As far as WhatsApp is concerned, I don't really think anyone of us have figured out what the solution to that is."

After a phone conversation with Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan, Trump said Sunday morning in a tweet, that, ""we discussed ISIS, our mutual involvement in Syria, & the slow & highly coordinated pullout of U.S. troops from the area"". But, he added, ""they are coming home"".

President Trump announced earlier in the week, also after a phone call with President Erdogan, that the US will be pulling out its 2,000 troops stationed in Syria to fight the Islamic State (which is also called ISIS -- Islamic State of Iraq and Syria). No timelines had been offered since.

But the stunning decision, which was opposed by most of the president's senior aides and advisers and was not discussed with allies, was greeted by a storm of criticism at home and abroad.

Secretary Mattis, who had opposed the decision, resigned in protest after failing to persuade the president to change his mind. He should get himself some one who was more ""aligned"" with his own thinking, he told the president in a resignation letter that has received widespread attention, and irritated Trump.

So much that he wants him out sooner than February till when Mattis had offered to stay to enable the president to look for a successor. Trump announced on Twitter that Shanahan, who is currently serving as deputy secretary of defense, will take charge from January 1. ""Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing. He will be great!""

Before moving to the Pentagon, Shanahan had served as senior vice president for supply chain and operations at Boeing, starting at the company in 1986, according to his biography on the US department of defense website. His assignments there included a stint as vice president and general manager of the 787 Dreamliner, leading the programme during a critical period.

Shanahan holds a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington, and two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering, and an MBA from MIT's Sloan School of Management.

Mattis, his predecessor, was a celebrated US marine general.

Shanahan is now the third senior member of the Trump administration charged with an ""acting"" assignment, following -- acting chief of staff of White House Mick Mulvaney and acting attorney general Matt Whittaker (Trump has named William Barr to assume full-time charge when confirmed by the senate)."

Dias and Manjrekar have shared four wickets among themselves with all-rounder Dube picking up the other Saurashtra wicket to fall.

Meanwhile at Shimoga, hosts Karnataka secured crucial first innings lead as they bundled out Railways for 143 in their first essay.

Karnataka were 41/0 in the second innings as their overall lead stood at 112 runs at close of play.

At Raipur, Chhattisgarh took the first innings lead with Amandeep Khare (108) and Ajay Mandal (106 not out) hitting centuries.

At Nagpur, for hosts Vidarbha, veteran Wasim Jaffer slammed 125 as they ended the second day at 238/3 against Gujarat, still adrift by 83 runs.

Brief scores: Mumbai 394 (Jay Bista 127, Vikrant Auti 57, Siddesh Lad 108, Shivam Dube 39; J Unadkat 4 for 71, C Sakariya 3 for 86, D Jadeja 3 for 95) versus Saurashtra 213 for 5 (Sheldon Jackson 95, Prerak Mankad not out 56; Roystan Dias 2 for 32, Minad Manjrekar 2 for 46).

Anuj Rawat hit a brilliant counter-attacking hundred to nullify Avesh Khan's six-wicket haul as Delhi looked set for an outright win against Madhya Pradesh in a Ranji Trophy group league encounter in Delhi.

Wicket-keeper batsman Anuj scored 134 off 183 balls as Delhi scored 261 in their first innings in reply to MP's modest 132.

A first innings lead of 129 may well ensure full points for the home team. ""The innings came a few days late,"" he smiled sheepishly.

""I felt bad but IPL snub has taught me that I need to work a lot harder. This is by far my best innings in senior cricket,"" said the former India U-19 keeper.

Delhi were reduced to 36 for 5, courtesy Avesh (6/51), who worked up brisk pace to unsettle the likes of Kunal Chandela (0), Dhruv Shorey (0), Nitish Rana (0) and Hiten Dalal (0).

Rawat is now getting a longer rope as Rishabh Pant is busy on national duty.

""Even if Rishabh Pant comes back, I want to score as many runs so that I can be picked purely as a batsman,"" said Rawat.

Another former U-19 player, who hogged limelight during the first half was Avesh, who is having a dream Ranji season so far with close to 35 wickets.

""The key to my success has been workload management. The support staff is ensuring that I don't bowl too much in the nets and have kept me fresh for matches,"" said the Delhi Daredevils pacer, who wasn't picked for India A this year.

""The selection is not in my hands, performance is and that's what I am focussing on,"" he said.

Manipur crushed Arunachal Pradesh by 112 runs to wrap up the issue inside one and a half days in an early finish to their Ranji Trophy Plate Group fixture.

A day after 23 wickets tumbled at the 22 Yards School of Cricket Ground at Saltlake, Manipur made 253 in their second essay to set a 273-run target for Arunachal Pradesh.

Shot out for their lowest total of 66 in the first innings, Arunachal Pradesh put up another insipid show with the bat to fold for 160, succumbing to their fifth defeat in six matches.

That their Number 11 batsman Deendyal Upadhyay top-scored for 52 summed up the batting plight of Arunachal Pradesh.

Ankit R Kalsi closed in on his third first class century as Himachal Pradesh put up a strong batting show to extend their lead to 117 after ending day two of their Ranji Elite Group B fixture against Tamil Nadu at 340 for five.

Kalsi (99 batting), Raghav Dhawan (71) and Rishi Dhawan (71 batting) helped Himachal Pradesh seize the advantage after their side lost early wickets. Tamil Nadu had scored 225 in their first innings.

Research suggests so","Business Standard",FALSE,"Breaking taboos: How a 23-year-old's effort is empowering women in slums

Women holding top leadership positions in the country are not particularly fond of taking risks, findings from a recent study suggest.

The study, which surveyed women leaders in companies across the National Capital Region (NCR), notes that 95.3 per cent of them do not use risk engineering or risk management tools.

The numbers, however, do not clearly analyse the general use of risk management tools in these companies. Hence, it is difficult to clearly state if the attitude impacts their companies too.

The study -- commissioned by Raheja QBE Insurance with a management school Bimtech -- among 165 women in corporate leadership roles in listed, unlisted and start-up companies, is, however, at odds with more careful ones done on women and risks.

Similar studies by the University of Exeter show women can be just as risk taking as men, and, in some cases, even more. But the QBE-Bimtech study on risk behaviour by women leaders is on a par with other recent studies that show India's corporate sector need to accelerate their internal process of risk management.

Experts from Singapore Global Convention, 2018, quoted in the story by PTI, said, ""Improvement in business operations (on risk) among Indian companies is slow and needs to be on a par with the American and European standards.""

While it one can infer that the trend for risk aversion comes from the fact that the women in these companies are often from the same families as promoter directors, the numbers invalidate that.

While there are only 98 promoter women directors in the study, representing 16 per cent of the NIFTY 500, yet among them 50 per cent are ""driving the company in a leadership capacity. The data invalidates any concerns that a sizeable portion of (these) new women directors belong to the promoter family and are being appointed in a non-executive capacity just to comply with the regulations"".

India is one of the first developing countries to have enforced a quota ensuring at least one woman director in the board of companies. Data, as in the second half of December 2018, shows the percentage of women in the 1,789 NSE listed companies have reached 15.94 per cent. The figure remains way behind European and the US markets.

Women make up the largest new cohort entering leadership positions in corporate India the corner rooms. So, the lack of a robust risk awareness among them makes the job of making Indian companies more aware of on the issue, daunting.

Carissa Hickling, Technology Global Consultant at Siemens Technology, India, said, ""The low level of awareness about liability insurance was a disappointment. For me, it is such a given that one evaluates the risks and this must be included.""

Since the NCR is among the fastest developing place in the country, an aversion among its new leaders to address risks is a cause for concern, especially as Indian companies are rapidly sailing into areas where reputation risks and cyber threats are multiplying. For instance the study notes, ""71 interviewees (about half of those in the study) were not sure whether they are fully aware of reputational risks and the extent to which it could damage their business."""

Fight on for 1st innings lead after Saurashtra restrict Mumbai

Table toppers Saurashtra and former champions Mumbai were involved in a keen tussle for the first innings lead on day two of their Elite Group 'A' Ranji Trophy match at the Wankhede Stadium, in Mumbai, on Sunday.

Saurashtra bowled out Mumbai for 394 in the first innings in the morning and then replied with 213 for five wickets at close,still adrift of the home teams total by 181 runs after weathering an early collapse that saw them slumping to 37 for three.

Mumbai struck in the final over by picking up the prize wicket of Saurashtras experienced batsman Sheldon Jackson, who was out five short of a well-deserved century after facing 144 balls in which he struck 8 fours and 3 sixes.

At stumps, Prerak Mankad (56 in 106 balls) was at the crease after putting on a stand of107 runs for the fifth wicket with Jackson who was dismissed by Minad Manjrekar with the penultimate ball of the 65thover.

Dias and Manjrekar have shared four wickets among themselves with all-rounder Dube picking up the other Saurashtra wicket to fall.

In the morning, Saurashtra captain Jaydev Unadkat and his new-ball partner Chetan Sakariya polished off the bottom half of the Mumbai first innings for 60 runs in 18 overs after Mumbai resumed at the overnight 334 for 5.

Unadkat summoned the second new ball straightaway in the morning and provided the important breakthrough by dismissing overnight unbeaten batsman Dube (39).

The Mumbai all-rounder had added just five to his last evening score when he fell that broke the stubborn sixth wicket stand between him and skipper Siddesh Lad, not out 84 overnight, after the addition of 112 runs.

Sakariya took out Akash Parkar, while Unadkat got rid of Tanush Kotian in successive overs to leave Mumbai at 362 for 8.

Lad completed his well-deserved century but was ninth out for 108, falling to Sakariya, after facing 146 balls and hitting 1 six and 16 fours.

Unadkat trapped last man Manjrekar LBW to terminate the Mumbai innings with Roystan Dias unbeaten on 20.

Unadkat grabbed 4 for 71, while fellow left-arm pacer Sakariya and left-arm spinner Dharmendra Jadeja picked up three apiece.

Dias, with his left-arm medium pace, then brought cheers to the Mumbai ranks by striking twice in successive overs to pack off Saurashtra opener Harvik Desai and no. 3 Vishvaraj Jadeja.

Another medium pacer Manjrekar picked up a fine return catch to dismiss Snell Patel to leave the visitors tottering at 37 for three.

Saurashtras mainstay Jackson and Arpit Vasavada (20) stemmed the rot with a stand of 69 when the latter chased a wide ball from Dube and nicked to keeper Aditya Tare.

Jackson, playing fluently till he was hampered by hamstring trouble, and Prerak Mankad, who has hit 10 fours, held the Mumbai hopes at bay with a stubborn partnership till the former departed in the last over to provide Mumbai a shot in the arm going into Day 3 of the four-day match.

Meanwhile at Shimoga, hosts Karnataka secured crucial first innings lead as they bundled out Railways for 143 in their first essay.

Karnataka were 41/0 in the second innings as their overall lead stood at 112 runs at close of play.

At Raipur, Chhattisgarh took the first innings lead with Amandeep Khare (108) and Ajay Mandal (106 not out) hitting centuries.

The duo not only pulled the home team out of trouble but also ensured that they went past Maharashtra's first innings total of 239.

At Nagpur, for hosts Vidarbha, veteran Wasim Jaffer slammed 125 as they ended the second day at 238/3 against Gujarat, still adrift by 83 runs.

Brief scores: Mumbai 394 (Jay Bista 127, Vikrant Auti 57, Siddesh Lad 108, Shivam Dube 39; J Unadkat 4 for 71, C Sakariya 3 for 86, D Jadeja 3 for 95) versus Saurashtra 213 for 5 (Sheldon Jackson 95, Prerak Mankad not out 56; Roystan Dias 2 for 32, Minad Manjrekar 2 for 46).

At Raipur: Maharashtra 239 (Rahul Tripathi 102, Anupam Sanklecha 66, Vishal Singh 4-59) versus Chhattisgarh 332/5 (Amandeep Khare 108, Ajay Mandal 106 not out, Anupam Sanklecha 4-55).

At Shimoga: Karnataka 214 and 41/0 (Dega Nischal 25 not out, D Padikkal 11 not out) versus Railways 143 (Manish Rao 52 not out, Prashant Gupta 35, Ronit More 5-45).

Rawat century puts Delhi in command vs MP

Anuj Rawat hit a brilliant counter-attacking hundred to nullify Avesh Khan's six-wicket haul as Delhi looked set for an outright win against Madhya Pradesh in a Ranji Trophy group league encounter in New Delhi.

Wicket-keeper batsman Anuj scored 134 off 183 balls as Delhi scored 261 in their first innings in reply to MP's modest 132.

A first innings lead of 129 may well ensure full points for the home team.

The day belonged to left-handed Anuj, who played by far the most impressive innings of his nascent career so far.

The way he attacked under pressure, Rawat felt the pinch having missed out on an IPL contract.

""The innings came a few days late,"" he smiled sheepishly.

""I felt bad but IPL snub has taught me that I need to work a lot harder. This is by far my best innings in senior cricket,"" said the former India U-19 keeper.

Delhi were reduced to 36 for 5, courtesy Avesh (6/51), who worked up brisk pace to unsettle the likes of Kunal Chandela (0), Dhruv Shorey (0), Nitish Rana (0) and Hiten Dalal (0).

Coached by Rajkumar Sharma (Virat Kohli's coach), young Rawat showed admirable temperament and proper game sense as he first consolidated with Lalit Yadav (25) in a 60-run sixth wicket stand.

Once Lalit was dismissed, Rawat found an able ally in Shivam Sharma (39), adding 118 runs for the seventh wicket.

Once Delhi got the lead, Rawat batted more freely hitting on both sides of the wicket.

He repeatedly reverse-swept leg-spinner Mihir Hirwani off the rough and for good measure hooked Kuldeep Sen for a six. He also hit a couple of sixes off left-arm spinner Kartikeya Singh.

Rawat is now getting a longer rope as Rishabh Pant is busy on national duty.

""Even if Rishabh Pant comes back, I want to score as many runs so that I can be picked purely as a batsman,"" said Rawat.

Another former U-19 player, who hogged limelight during the first half was Avesh, who is having a dream Ranji season so far with close to 35 wickets.

""The key to my success has been workload management. The support staff is ensuring that I don't bowl too much in the nets and have kept me fresh for matches,"" said the Delhi Daredevils pacer, who wasn't picked for India A this year.""

""The selection is not in my hands, performance is and that's what I am focussing on,"" he said.

Brief Scores: MP 132 and 7/0.

Kalsi, Dhawan duo steer HP to strong 340/5 against Tamil Nadu

Ankit R Kalsi (99) closed in on his third first class century as Himachal Pradesh put up a strong batting show to extend their lead to 117 after ending day two of their Ranji Elite Group B fixture against Tamil Nadu at 340 for five, in Dharamsala.

Kalsi (99 batting), Raghav Dhawan (71) and Rishi Dhawan (71 batting) helped Himachal Pradesh seize the advantage after their side lost early wickets. Tamil Nadu had scored 225 in their first innings.

Raghav (191 balls, 11X4) held firm after the hosts resumed at 25 for 1, as the visitors looked to pick up quick wickets. G K Singh (8) was the first to go this morning as T Natarajan had him caught by B Indrajith.

Ankush Bains fell after after putting on 26 runs with Dhawan as he was bowled by Abhishek Tanwar for 8 to leave HP at 57 for 3.

Opener Raghav and N R Gangta (43) forged an important partnership for the fourth wicket to steady the ship. They added 74 runs in over 23 overs.

The exit of Gangta brought Raghav and the left-handed Kalsi together. They started cautiously but grew in confidence to thwart the Tamil Nadu bowlers. Their 90-run association for the fifth wicket brought the host back into contention as the TN bowlers tried hard to pull things back.

Later, the unbroken 119-run stand between Kalsi and Rishi, who has featured in ODIs and a T20 International for the country, took the game away from Tamil Nadu

After a period of circumspect batting, Kalsi and Rishi, especially the latter, took the attack to the rival camp.

Rishi looked in good touch, slamming 13 fours in his 82-ball knock of 71. Kalsi, on his part, has hit 15 boundaries so far.

Tamil Nadu skipper Indrajith tried seven bowlers but the HP batsmen were more than adept in handling their challenge.

Brief Scores (at end of day 2):

Tamil Nadu 225 all out in 78.4 overs (B Aparajith 53, Abhishek Tanwar 44, Dinesh Karthik 31, Pankaj Jaiswal 3 for 45) vs HP 340 for 5 in 88 overs overs (Raghav Dhawan 71, A R Kalsi 99 batting, Rishi Dhawan 71 batting, M Mohammed 2 for 67, T Natarajan 2 for 71).

At Visakhapatnam: Bengal 300 all out in 111.3 overs (Manoj Tiwary 90, Writtick Chaterjee 76, Pradipta Pramanik 43, Agniv Pan 39, K V Shasikanth 5 for 55) vs Andhra 108 for 2 in 43 overs (C R Gnaneshwar 64 batting, Jyothisaikrishna 43).

At Hyderabad: Hyderabad 317 all out in 109.3 overs (Tanmay Agarwal 60, Akshat Reddy 77, Himalay Agarwal 79, Mayank Markande 6 for 84) vs Punjab 202 for 4 in 68 overs (Anmolpreet Singh 85, Mandeep Singh 46 batting).

Manipur maul Arunachal Pradesh inside two days

Manipur crushed Arunachal Pradesh by 112 runs to wrap up the issue inside one and a half days in an early finish to their Ranji Trophy Plate Group fixture, in Kolkata.

A day after 23 wickets tumbled at the 22 Yards School of Cricket Ground at Saltlake, Manipur made 253 in their second essay to set a 273-run target for Arunachal Pradesh.

Shot out for their lowest total of 66 in the first innings, Arunachal Pradesh put up another insipid show with the bat to fold for 160, succumbing to their fifth defeat in six matches.

That their no 11 batsman Deendyal Upadhyay top-scored for 52 summed up the batting plight of Arunachal Pradesh.

The Arunchal Pradesh frontline seamer Upadhayay stood in their highest partnerhsip of 74 runs with Licha Tehi (26 not out) before being cleaned up by Thokchom Singh.

Upadhayay's stroke-filled 52 came off 50 balls with nine boundaries.

This was Manipur's third victory from six matches as they have 18 points, while Arunachal Pradesh who are yet to win a match have three points.

Earlier, resuming the day on 192/3 on a breezy Sunday morning, Manipur lost wickets at regular intervals and could add just 61 runs to their overnight total.

Debutant opener Hrithik Kanojia, who was overnight 79, missed a century by nine runs after being dismissed by Licha Tehi (3/74).

""I should have stayed longer. But luckily for us Arunachal Pradesh did not do well in the second innings too. I am happy that we won. But a century on debut would have been special,"" the 19-year-old from Delhi said.

Kanojia's 98-run partnership with captain Yashpal Singh (51) on the first day was a game changer in the low-scoring fixture.

""I think that was the turning point. Till then it was anybody's match,"" he added.

Thokchom Singh who clinched a careerbest 5/16 in the first innings for a match haul of seven wickets was adjudged man-of-the-match. Singh also chipped in with valuable 19 and 18 runs in the low-scoring tie.

Manipur coach Shiv Sundar Das said it was good to bounce back with a win after being bundled out for 88 in the first innings.

""The first two sessions on Friday was difficult. They have just started and have no experience of playing under these trying conditions. It's a good learning curve for the boys. Also Hrithik (Kanojia) and Yashpal Singh's partnership played a huge role. Hrithik batted really well and I am very happy for him,"" he said.

Surprised that the match ended before tea on the second day, Das said: ""It came as a surprise. But we will not complain.""

Choosing to bat at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekna Cricket Stadium, Uttar Pradesh rode on a double century by middle order batsman Priyam Garg (206).

Garg hammered a listless Tripura attack all over the park as he stuck 23 boundaries and one six in his 371-ball knock, which helped the hosts pile up a mammoth first innings total.

Uttar Pradesh skipper Aksh Deep Nath (106) and Rinku Singh (149) also struck hundreds as the hosts dominated the second day of the four-day match.

Nath stuck 12 fours and two sixes, while Rinku Singh hit 17 boundaries and 1 six as Tripura bowlers were hit all round the park.

Upendra Yadav (25) and Saurabh Kumar (27) also chipped in with valuable scores as the hosts declared at 552/7 in 149 overs.

For the visitors, Saurabh Das (4-164) was the pick of the bowlers.

But in their first innings, Tripura had a disastrous start with their openers B B Ghosh (7) and J R Banik (9) falling cheaply.

From 2-16, they were struggling at 4-33 as another two wickets fell in quick succession.

Tripura have a mountain to climb as they are still 519 runs and Uttar Pradesh will eye an innings victory.

Fight on for 1st innings lead after Saurashtra restrict Mumbai

Table toppers Saurashtra and former champions Mumbai were involved in a keen tussle for the first innings lead on day two of their Elite Group A Ranji Trophy match at the Wankhede Stadium here Sunday.

Saurashtra bowled out Mumbai for 394 in the first innings in the morning and then replied with 213 for five wickets at close,still adrift of the home teams total by 181 runs after weathering an early collapse that saw them slumping to 37 for three.

Mumbai struck in the final over by picking up the prize wicket of Saurashtras experienced batsman Sheldon Jackson, who was out five short of a well-deserved century after facing 144 balls in which he struck 8 fours and 3 sixes.

At stumps, Prerak Mankad (56 in 106 balls) was at the crease after putting on a stand of107 runs for the fifth wicket with Jackson who was dismissed by Minad Manjrekar with the penultimate ball of the 65thover.

Dias and Manjrekar have shared four wickets among themselves with all-rounder Dube picking up the other Saurashtra wicket to fall.

In the morning, Saurashtra captain Jaydev Unadkat and his new-ball partner Chetan Sakariya polished off the bottom half of the Mumbai first innings for 60 runs in 18 overs after Mumbai resumed at the overnight 334 for 5.

Unadkat summoned the second new ball straightaway in the morning and provided the important breakthrough by dismissing overnight unbeaten batsman Dube (39).

The Mumbai all-rounder had added just five to his last evening score when he fell that broke the stubborn sixth wicket stand between him and skipper Siddesh Lad, not out 84 overnight, after the addition of 112 runs.

Sakariya took out Akash Parkar, while Unadkat got rid of Tanush Kotian in successive overs to leave Mumbai at 362 for 8.

Lad completed his well-deserved century but was ninth out for 108, falling to Sakariya, after facing 146 balls and hitting 1 six and 16 fours.

Unadkat trapped last man Manjrekar LBW to terminate the Mumbai innings with Roystan Dias unbeaten on 20.

Unadkat grabbed 4 for 71, while fellow left-arm pacer Sakariya and left-arm spinner Dharmendra Jadeja picked up three apiece.

Dias, with his left-arm medium pace, then brought cheers to the Mumbai ranks by striking twice in successive overs to pack off Saurashtra opener Harvik Desai and no. 3 Vishvaraj Jadeja.

Another medium pacer Manjrekar picked up a fine return catch to dismiss Snell Patel to leave the visitors tottering at 37 for three.

Saurashtras mainstay Jackson and Arpit Vasavada (20) stemmed the rot with a stand of 69 when the latter chased a wide ball from Dube and nicked to keeper Aditya Tare.

Jackson, playing fluently till he was hampered by hamstring trouble, and Prerak Mankad, who has hit 10 fours, held the Mumbai hopes at bay with a stubborn partnership till the former departed in the last over to provide Mumbai a shot in the arm going into Day 3 of the four-day match.

Meanwhile at Shimoga, hosts Karnataka secured crucial first innings lead as they bundled out Railways for 143 in their first essay.

Karnataka were 41/0 in the second innings as their overall lead stood at 112 runs at close of play.

At Raipur, Chhattisgarh took the first innings lead with Amandeep Khare (108) and Ajay Mandal (106 not out) hitting centuries.

The duo not only pulled the home team out of trouble but also ensured that they went past Maharashtra's first innings total of 239.

At Nagpur, for hosts Vidarbha, veteran Wasim Jaffer slammed 125 as they ended the second day at 238/3 against Gujarat, still adrift by 83 runs.

Brief scores: Mumbai 394 (Jay Bista 127, Vikrant Auti 57, Siddesh Lad 108, Shivam Dube 39; J Unadkat 4 for 71, C Sakariya 3 for 86, D Jadeja 3 for 95) versus Saurashtra 213 for 5 (Sheldon Jackson 95, Prerak Mankad not out 56; Roystan Dias 2 for 32, Minad Manjrekar 2 for 46).

At Raipur: Maharashtra 239 (Rahul Tripathi 102, Anupam Sanklecha 66, Vishal Singh 4-59) versus Chhattisgarh 332/5 (Amandeep Khare 108, Ajay Mandal 106 not out, Anupam Sanklecha 4-55).

At Shimoga: Karnataka 214 and 41/0 (Dega Nischal 25 not out, D Padikkal 11 not out) versus Railways 143 (Manish Rao 52 not out, Prashant Gupta 35, Ronit More 5-45).

At Nagpur: Gujarat 321 (Kathan Patel 105, Dhruv Raval 79, Karan Patel 55, A A Sarvate 4-71) versus Vidarbha 238/3 (Wasim Jaffer 126, Faiz Fazal 46, S A Desai 2-71).

Ankit Kalsi, Rishi Dhawan duo steer Himachal Pradesh to strong 340/5 against Tamil Nadu

Ankit R Kalsi (99) closed in on his third first class century as Himachal Pradesh put up a strong batting show to extend their lead to 117 after ending day two of their Ranji Elite Group B fixture against Tamil Nadu at 340 for five, here Sunday.

Kalsi (99 batting), Raghav Dhawan (71) and Rishi Dhawan (71 batting) helped Himachal Pradesh seize the advantage after their side lost early wickets. Tamil Nadu had scored 225 in their first innings.

Raghav (191 balls, 11X4) held firm after the hosts resumed at 25 for 1, as the visitors looked to pick up quick wickets. G K Singh (8) was the first to go this morning as T Natarajan had him caught by B Indrajith.

Ankush Bains fell after after putting on 26 runs with Dhawan as he was bowled by Abhishek Tanwar for 8 to leave HP at 57 for 3.

Opener Raghav and N R Gangta (43) forged an important partnership for the fourth wicket to steady the ship. They added 74 runs in over 23 overs.

The exit of Gangta brought Raghav and the left-handed Kalsi together. They started cautiously but grew in confidence to thwart the Tamil Nadu bowlers. Their 90-run association for the fifth wicket brought the host back into contention as the TN bowlers tried hard to pull things back.

Later, the unbroken 119-run stand between Kalsi and Rishi, who has featured in ODIs and a T20 International for the country, took the game away from Tamil Nadu.

After a period of circumspect batting, Kalsi and Rishi, especially the latter, took the attack to the rival camp.

Rishi looked in good touch, slamming 13 fours in his 82-ball knock of 71. Kalsi, on his part, has hit 15 boundaries so far.

Tamil Nadu skipper Indrajith tried seven bowlers but the HP batsmen were more than adept in handling their challenge.

Brief Scores (at end of day 2):

Tamil Nadu 225 all out in 78.4 overs (B Aparajith 53, Abhishek Tanwar 44, Dinesh Karthik 31, Pankaj Jaiswal 3 for 45) vs HP 340 for 5 in 88 overs overs (Raghav Dhawan 71, A R Kalsi 99 batting, Rishi Dhawan 71 batting, M Mohammed 2 for 67, T Natarajan 2 for 71).

At Visakhapatnam: Bengal 300 all out in 111.3 overs (Manoj Tiwary 90, Writtick Chaterjee 76, Pradipta Pramanik 43, Agniv Pan 39, K V Shasikanth 5 for 55) vs Andhra 108 for 2 in 43 overs (C R Gnaneshwar 64 batting, Jyothisaikrishna 43).

At Hyderabad: Hyderabad 317 all out in 109.3 overs (Tanmay Agarwal 60, Akshat Reddy 77, Himalay Agarwal 79, Mayank Markande 6 for 84) vs Punjab 202 for 4 in 68 overs (Anmolpreet Singh 85, Mandeep Singh 46 batting).

The most serious type of AMD, known as wet AMD, develops when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the macula stops functioning as well as it used to. AMD patients experience blurred distorted vision, difficulty seeing in dim lighting and problems reading.

Current treatment for wet AMD is a series of monthly injections which reduce the growth of new vessels which limit vision loss. Following treatment, patients attend regular hospital check-ups where clinical staff monitor the macula by taking photographs and doing vision tests, checking whether any follow-up treatment is needed.

Most patients will not require follow-up treatment, but about 30 per cent do. Hospital check-up appointments are important for preventing further loss of vision. However, these check-up appointments put a huge strain on already-stretched resources, and limit the capacity for seeing new patients who, if not seen urgently, are at high risk of losing their vision. Check-up visits are also very inconvenient for patients and their friends or family members who may have to take time off work to provide transport to these appointments.

Barnaby Reeves, Professorial Research Fellow in Health Services Research from the Bristol Medical School: Translational Health Sciences and co-chief investigator of the MONARCH study, said: ""We are excited to be collecting data from the apps automatically, via the internet. These kinds of methods, with data flowing directly from the data source to the study database, should increase both the accuracy of the data and the efficiency of their capture.""

Dr Ruth Hogg, from the Centre of Public Health at Queen's University Belfast and co-chief investigator of the MONARCH study, explained: ""Injections for AMD have been very successful, with about half of patients retaining vision sufficiently good for driving. However, the burden on the NHS and patients has been considerable due to the need for frequent injections and intensive monitoring throughout the follow-up period. In Belfast, evening and weekend clinics have been added, yet it's still not enough.

""We urgently need to rethink how services are offered as the current setup isn't sustainable. AMD is a huge burden to the NHS through time spent by clinical staff monitoring patients of whom the majority do not require treatment.""

The study aims to find out whether monitoring vision by patients themselves at home could potentially alleviate some of the burden of AMD on the NHS, as well as be more convenient for patients, without compromising their safety or wellbeing. If home eye tests can detect when treatment is needed, it would mean that patients might only need to attend hospital appointments to have treatment.

Patients participating in the study will be provided with three different eye tests for them to do at home, comprising a paper-based booklet of reading tests and two tests (""apps"") that run on an iPodtouch. Patients will be asked to do all three tests weekly at home. The results of the tests are sent automatically via the internet to the Study Management Centre in Bristol.

Throughout the study participants will attend their normal hospital check-up appointments and the results of the tests done at these appointments will be compared with the results from the home eye tests.

Patricia Strong, an AMD patient, added: ""Since completing a course of treatment for wet AMD, I've had regular appointments to check my vision and get photographs taken and I've occasionally needed further injections. I spend quite a lot of time getting to the hospital and the cost of transport does add up so being able to check for myself at home would make a real difference for me, saving time and money.""

The study aims to recruit 400 participants from five different hospitals around the UK. Patients will be provided with equipment and support to do the three home eye tests weekly over a period of one to two years. It is hoped that the data gathered will lead to a shift in services provided to AMD patients, so that only those who require treatment will be required to attend hospital appointments.

The MONARCH study is funded by National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme and is currently recruiting participants who have AMD."

Nongpok Sanjenbam village, about 15 km east of Manipur's capital city Imphal, is clean, with a lot of greenery. Spread over ten acres of land, a weaving unit and a poultry farm provide employment to most of the villagers.

The village in Imphal East district was mired in poverty, lacking basic facilities. Most of the villagers worked as agricultural laborers. Presently it is a model in development, as it ensures sustained economic growth through various programmes, involving the community.

Bringing community together

Nongpok Sanjenbam has about 135 households, with a population of about 500. It has Khunou, Khullen, Sangsabi and Kambongput colonies. As a pilot, Langei project adopted the Khunou colony. Telem Arunkumar (42), a native of Nongpok Sanjenbam village, who had a successful business in Imphal, returned to his village to develop the same. He brought the villagers together and initiated the Langei project, langei meaning pool of wealth. The motto of the project is 'together we can'.

Initially, many villagers thought that he had an ulterior motive, when he discussed his ideas for developing the village into a sustainable development model. Being a native of the same village subsequently helped him connect with the village administration council and the community. Once convinced, the villagers started participating in the project. The village council donated ten acres of unused community land for the project. The villagers helped the Langei project take off, by helping with all the planning and construction activities.

Weaver women

Around 200 women were at the looms in a huge hall, weaving the phanek, the traditional women's wear, besides other traditional clothes. The women need no training, as they are skilled traditional weavers, their skills having been passed down through generations. Langlei chose loin loom weaving as the primary income generation activity, as the women are adept at weaving on the loin looms. This not only generates income, but revives the traditional weaving, that was slowly disappearing, with the onslaught of modern technologies in weaving.

Moreover, the products are in good demand. ""One phanek fetches around Rs 2,000,"" one of the weavers told VillageSquare.in. Dyeing and making yarn have also been integrated into the weaving unit.

Earlier every household had a loin loom but not now. In the Langei unit, there are more than 150 traditional looms. ""We make about 40 phaneks everyday,"" said Arunkumar. This are sold in and around Manipur, sometimes in other cities as well.

Rearing poultry and cattle

Close to the weaving unit, at the foothills, there is a large pond with about 5,000 ducks. Close by is a chicken farm, where an equal number of chickens are being reared. The farm has separate hatching units with incubators. Every day, the farm supplies about 1,000 eggs to Imphal, bringing sustained income.

The farm provides employment to about 30 villagers. Though most of the villagers are engaged in the Langei works, the project envisages independent economic activity for the men, specifically livestock rearing.

Water and sanitation

The village did not have drinking water facility. At present, a reverse osmosis plant that can treat 2,000 liters per hour supplies drinking water. The water is supplied to every household free of cost.

If a household needs more water, as in the case of functions and the like, a token amount is charged, to prevent misuse. ""This is the first of its kind drinking water supply model in Manipur,"" Arunkumar told VillageSquare.in. In line with Swachh Bharat Mission, residents of Nongpok Sanjenbam village take up sanitation and cleanliness drive voluntarily, in addition to waste management. Biodegradable wastebaskets made of cane and bamboo are kept at roadsides and key places. The village is free of open defecation, claimed Arunkumar.

Safety and security

Nongpok Sanjenbam has a solar street light system in the Khunou colony and the lanes of the village. A total of 350 streetlights have been installed, to ensure safety and security. The street lights have a central control system. ""In villages, people, especially women, do not venture out in the dark , so this helps in better mobility of the villagers,"" said Arunkumar. In order to ensure safety and security, Langei project has installed CCTV cameras in key locations. The village has 32 such CCTVs that monitor the entire village round the clock. This has reduced social ills such as alcoholism, and theft.

Public address system has been installed for communication and information sharing. This is also used for mobilizing the public. A series of loud speakers installed at key locations is connected to the main administrative office. This helps in emergency situations. ""When we observe something unusual in the CCTVs, we make a call through the PA system,"" said Arunkumar.

Social development

Under the Langei project, a Langei Sports Academy has been started. More than 100 youth in the age group of 8-18 years are enrolled in the sports academy, half of them being girls. ""The objective is to nurture young talents,"" Arunkumar told VillageSquare.in. ""All those enrolled in the academy have been adopted by the Sports Authority of India, under their 'Come and Play program'."" Three of the players from the academy play in the under-19, East Bengal football team.

The village has a large playground for the youth. Every day a bus takes the young sportspersons to Khuman Lampak Sports Stadium in Imphal, so that they can hone their skills under expert guidance. Future plans for the village includes a school, a primary health center, a biogas plant and creation ecotourism centers.

""...by the way Rahul Gandhi cannot be a prime minister because he is a citizen of Britain and his Indian citizenship will be cancelled, he won't even be an MP,"" he claimed.

Swamy had in 2016 made the allegation and, after it was raised in the Parliament Ethics Committee, Gandhi, in his response in March that year, had rejected the charge, saying it was a move to malign him.

The BJP leader had alleged that Gandhi declared himself a British citizen to occupy the post of the director of a company there.

The creation of State Open School Board -- where an array of skill-based subjects and other vocations made a foray into mainstream education -- was exalted by teachers and students alike. Now, in a further boost to this phenomenon, the state education department has given it equivalence to Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE). Every student engaged in open schooling will be considered on a par with those who take the traditional route and will be awarded state board's certificate at the end of it.

A final decision in this regard had been pending since the state announced inclusion of open schooling in 2017, with work on the syllabus underway, being carefully scrutinised by the board. They had ascertained that final certificates will bear no difference, and subsequently, this decision was formalised through a December 21 government resolution.

Kale, chairman of MSBSHSE, said, ""An amendment or resolution was important to impart the equivalent status to open schooling. According to the new diktat, students who will appear for classes X and XII exams through open schooling will get the same certificates from the state board.""

The process of setting up open schools is in its final stages with two centres all set to function -- one each in and jurisdictions. A third centre will be disclosed in the coming week, after which enrolments are expected to commence. Also, students will now be allowed to take up home schooling, for which they will have to attempt exams for classes V, VIII, X and XII.

The syllabus will include Marathi as a compulsory subject with other choices being perched in a wide spectrum of vocations -- like Indian classical music and 13 skill-based subjects -- all approved by NCERT. The catalogue of skill-based subjects boasts of courses on beauty, baking and confectionery, printing, agriculture, water management, computer repair, art and craft among others.

The inclusion of such subjects, deemed the core of open schooling, was done with the objective of favouring those students who cannot go to a regular school due to keen interest in extra-curricular activities or sports. Furthermore, there is no upper age limit for enrolment (minimum being 10), the schooling will benefit children with special needs, senior citizens and others who lagged behind on education. They will be able to bag secondary and higher secondary board degrees through experiential learning.

Nonetheless, this announcement is still snagged with doubts as a handful of parents wonder if open schooling will of higher education for their children. For instance, Yamini Dhopavkar, a parent of fiveyear-old, who has been enrolled in an activity centre and planning for board for final examination, emphasised that these tests matter apart from experiential learning. ""It is important that even after imparting open schooling, the child should be able to apply for various higher education courses. If this open schooling gives equivalence to state board then definitely it will be one of the choices,"" she added."

In June, Deepak Malghan, an associate professor with the Centre for Public Policy at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, made an unusual appeal to the institute's placement committee and environment club. The email - part request, part withering criticism - asked them to ""disinvite"" Hindustan Unilever from the job placements for management students in October.

In 2001, a thermometer factory owned by the corporation in Kodaikanal had dumped toxic mercury in the local environment of the popular Tamil Nadu tourist spot. The factory was subsequently shut. Earlier this year, activists alleged that the company's trial remediation of soil contaminated by mercury at the site in November 2017 had failed, possibly mobilising more mercury into the environment that it had recovered because it deployed a substandard process. They say that the company has refused to apply the standards follows in the United States. Hindustan Unilever has denied these claims.

The email was part of Malghan's larger mission to remind the Indian Institutes of Management, which are among the country's top business schools, of their responsibilities as public institutions even though they sit close to private business interests and influence. These institutes became degree-granting institutions with the passage of the Indian Institutes of Management Act in 2017.

""Disinviting them...will send out a powerful message that management institutions can actually walk the talk about corporate responsibility,"" Malghan wrote in his email. ""Disinviting Unilever from placements requires us to act like we are a real place of higher learning - with real students and professors in a classroom rather than customers and service providers. It requires us to act like a real university would - not like a glorified placement agency masquerading as a place of higher learning.""

Malghan's email elicited a ""censure order"" from the director of the institute on October 17 asking him to retract it. The note said Malghan must ""develop greater sensitivity"" towards colleagues and ""institutional stakeholders both internal and external"". Malghan retracted his letter on November 28 but ""under protest"" and after appealing to the board of governors. ""Thinking through the complex intersections between corporations, society, state, market, and the biophysical environment is an important learning objective for budding managers,"" he wrote. The retraction was shared with over 1,000 students. A week later, both the retraction and the original email became public.

This was not Malghan's first attempt to remind an Indian Institute of Management that it is a public institution. In 2017, he and doctoral student Siddharth Joshi co-authored a paper and a number of articles on the negligible social diversity among faculty members in the Indian Institutes of Management, arguing for affirmative action in the doctoral programmes that serve as a ""talent pool"" for faculty recruitment.

In the paper, Malghan had also criticised the culture of the Indian Institutes of Management to pay faculty members extra for a range of activities - such as conducting admission interviews - that in any other public university are standard academic functions teachers are expected to perform. The Indian Institutes of Management call such payments ""incentives"", but Malghan calls them ""bribes"". He has been unsuccessfully filing queries under the Right to Information Act, 2005, to obtain compensation structures of faculty of the Indian Institutes of Management.

In 2015, Malghan became the first ecological economist - studying the ""intersections between the human economy and the biophysical system that contains and sustains it"" - to win the VKRV Rao Prize, a top award for social scientists under 45. He has taught at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, his first faculty position, for nine years. He spoke to Scroll.in about the role of these institutes as public institutions, the response to his criticisms and what the institutes must do to arrest their decline into the role of a ""customer service provider"".

""Business schools are the first departments on any university campus worldwide that are captured by vested interests including crony capitalists,"" Malghan said.

Edited excerpts follow:

Is there space for this form of activism in the IIMs? All professional education institutions seem to discourage it.

The short answer is that the limited space that exists is rapidly shrinking. My specific censure order is only symptomatic of much deeper structural problems. A more important question is should there be space for this form of activism, rather than is there space. The answer to this normative question is self-evident. What is a university that does not allow a free and open exchange of ideas? IIMs pride themselves as being crucibles for thought leaders - one of those vacuous terms that has its antecedents in the public relations industry. I think it is not the university's job to train shills for the elite. A university's mission ought to be to foster thoughtful individuals including voices of dissent.

Had you written about IIM policies before the paper you co-authored on faculty diversity? What prompted you to look at the IIMs?

My collaborative work with Siddharth [Joshi] is indeed the first time I have written publicly about IIM policies. The initial impetus for our work came from the fact that anecdotally everybody in the IIM system knew that IIMs have long been guilty of an unconscionable neglect of questions of diversity and inclusion in our doctoral programmes. The dubious methods used by IIMs to skirt constitutional and statutory mandates surrounding affirmative action were well-known internally. Like a lot of other contemporary Indian institutions, IIMs are an almost exclusively upper caste, and also mostly an urban upper class preserve. Based on imperfect data, we conservatively estimate that about 95% of all IIM faculty members are drawn from upper caste Hindu groups. Out of over 640 faculty members across 13 older IIMs, there are four faculty members from the SC [Scheduled Castes] groups and only one from ST [Scheduled Tribes] groups. The social composition of faculty at IIMs might as well have been produced by an apartheid regime.

Much of the credit for beginning this difficult conversation must go to Siddharth. Besides being a first-rate scholar, he is also a committed rights activist. I am a faculty member with tenure and really had little to lose materially. Siddharth was a graduate student yet to defend his dissertation when he first started work on the IIM social diversity project. Siddharth bravely withstood a variety of attacks and derision.

What was the response to the paper?

Initial reactions were predictable - when you are accustomed to privilege, any conversation on equity feels like oppression. As a sympathetic colleague pointed out, there was deflection. There was obfuscation. There was trivialisation. There were concerted attacks from colleagues ganging up. Finally, there was some personal vilification, too. Siddharth and I were largely able to tune out the negativity because there were a bunch of incredible colleagues and students across different IIMs who supported us in more ways that I can recount here.

Some among the IIM alumni have supported the sort of reform you have written about. Are there other faculty members who share your views?

I have to set the record right here. IIM alumni have not issued statements in support of the reforms that Siddharth and I have written about. If anything, we have reacted to enlightened alumni articulating the critical need for faculty social diversity at IIMs. If you have seen some limited reforms at most IIMs (except IIM Ahmedabad), the entirety of the credit must go to the global alumni network that has tried to remind us about Ambedkar's vision for the republic. The alumni have been at the vanguard of marginal changes (but revolutionary by IIM standards) that you have seen sweep the IIM system in the last couple of years

Siddharth and I have received some very important support from faculty members across IIMs. From over a dozen faculty colleagues that have openly supported us, I must single out Professor Mira Bakhru, a former faculty member at IIM Bangalore. Professor Bakhru was the first faculty member to write about social diversity deficit at IIMs. Many faculty colleagues around the country, across different IIMs have worked hard in the last two years to think through operationalising meaningful affirmative action in the doctoral programmes at IIMs.

What effect does this lack of diversity have on teaching, research and students?

The most important diversity that must be treasured by a university is intellectual diversity. I do not wish to suggest that intellectual diversity is somehow correlated with social diversity (ethnicity, gender, etc). However, there is strong evidence that a diverse faculty and student body with varied life experiences are crucial to the educational mission of a modern university. Actually, the IIM leadership recognises how diversity contributes to better outcomes for students and faculty alike. It is only that not all diversity axes are created equal. For example, IIMs have made tremendous progress on the gender diversity front at all levels - MBA students, doctoral students, and most significantly faculty body. However, there has been more reluctance to extend the gains from increased gender diversity to say social group diversity. Caste is the most significant axis of social heterogeneity in India, not to mention the most pernicious axis of stratification. Unfortunately, much of the reluctance to address deep-seated caste inequities can be attributed to a wholly misguided and indefensible notion of meritocracy that smacks of entrenched privilege.

In the two-year MBA programmes, however, IIMs do admit a very socially diverse class. But students from historically underrepresented sections of India do not find role models in their classroom. I can bet that a class on infrastructure management is going to look very different if the faculty body had adequate representation of Adivasi and Dalit groups who have borne the brunt of a rapacious infrastructure industry. Instead we now have classes on infrastructure that are taught by faculty members who serve on boards of crony capitalist firms. For example, at IIM-B [Bangalore] the infrastructure management class is taught by somebody who is on the board of an Adani company.

Finally, IIMs are elite public institutions with considerable normative influence on the national discourse. It is unconscionable that elite institutions are as skewed as IIMs are in terms of their social representation. This problem is not unique to IIMs or even to public universities in general. For example, my own guess is that the social composition of elite media houses is as skewed as IIMs. Some of the duplicity surrounding affirmative action policies including reservations at IIMs stem from misconstruing affirmative action as a welfare or poverty alleviation measure. Affirmative action at elite institutions is anything but. It is about representation at the elite decision-making tables.

You point out that IIMs have demanded autonomy but not exercised it for ""critical engagement with business practices"". In which direction do you see the institutions going under the new IIM Act passed last year? The new law has granted even greater autonomy to the institutions.

Yes, egged on by a consumptive urban upper class, the IIMs have used the unprecedented autonomy granted to these institutions (even before the new Act) for largely self-aggrandisement. IIMs do not see themselves as enlightened public universities. Autonomy for IIMs has largely meant abdicating their social contract as a public university. The social diversity deficit at IIMs is only one of the most egregious symptoms of these institutions abandoning their public mission. I believe the new Act will only exacerbate this trend even though it also provides a framework to recover the public mission. The litmus test for any university is this: does it use the autonomy to promote an environment where the life of the mind is nurtured and treasured? Available evidence suggests that IIMs fall short of this ideal by quite a bit.

You have mentioned the ""powerful faculty bodies and board led by corporate honchos"" that run the IIMs. How have they - and IIM-Bangalore in particular - responded to your criticism?

Individual colleagues and many students have supported or at least defended the exercise in self-criticism. The leadership has been much more, shall I say, sceptical if not hostile. Of course, several colleagues have also been very critical and a colleague has even described me as being obnoxious and a hypocrite. In general, the intellectual culture at IIMs (and I can speak most authoritatively only about IIM-B) is not open to critical inquiry. The problem is structural. Business school academia is focused not on understanding the world but on manipulating it. IIMs really are not an exception. Business schools are the first departments on any university campus worldwide that are captured by vested interests including crony capitalists. Quite often it is the case of not being able to criticise the very hand that feeds you. When students are reduced to fee paying customers, the professoriate has to debase itself into a customer service provider guild. The only exception to this otherwise bleak picture that I have painted is the doctoral programme that has been my refuge.

Why did you describe faculty members receiving incentives for research as ""bribes""? How did your colleagues react to this?

Many of my faculty colleagues have been upset with Siddharth and I going to town with IIMs' worst kept secret - the fact that faculty members at these institutions need special incentives to write academic papers, and ""upset"" is putting it very mildly.

There are three fundamental problems. First, we have made a fundamental category error - incentives and integrity are two very different objects. The idea that you can fix what is fundamentally an integrity problem with incentives betrays a certain kind of studied illiteracy. How can a professoriate that is so confused about incentives and integrity lecture in an MBA classroom about business ethics? If faculty have to be paid to do admission interviews, we really cannot complain about MBAs that are paid those vulgar bonuses to run the casino economy.

The immediate corollary of this category error is that faculty demand to be bribed to do anything at all - from reading and writing to admission interviews and supervising master's thesis project. An improved incentive structure will do nothing to fix this fundamental flaw with our system. Unless we recognise that we cannot bribe our way into making up for our original sin - jettisoning our innate integrity - we are doomed. Yes, we need a set of shared norms but not metrics that reduce the deans at IIMs wholly into a bean counter.

Second, IIMs are a public university - at least in theory. We have (if only an implicit) social contract with the Indian republic. Our current compensation arrangements are in breach of this compact. Every major public university (including business schools at public universities) has an open and transparent faculty compensation structure. Unless we are willing to publicly defend who and what we pay ourselves, the present regime is simply illegitimate. In the past few months I have filed several RTI [Right to Information] requests at various IIMs asking them to reveal their faculty compensation structure (the generic structure) but all of them have come up with the flimsiest of reasons to deny this information.

Third, we are a faculty body that has lost any sense of proportion. At a public university, compensation structure ought to be benchmarked against the means of the larger society. We are being non-transparent about our compensation structure because we are paying ourselves incentives that are patently indefensible. We may come up with any number of excuses to pay ourselves. My favourite is the one offered by several colleagues - we need to pay ourselves because we now aspire to send our children abroad (read Western university) for undergraduate education. We are perfectly within our rights to harbour such aspirations but it is not any Indian public university's remit to pander to these aspirations.

It takes a certain kind of entitlement to believe that being on 98.4 percentile of the income distribution in our country (this is at the beginning assistant professor level) as a public university teacher means living a life of abject poverty.

How has your own experience at IIM-Bangalore been?

On the balance, my time at IIM-B has been most fulfilling. I must especially single out the superb doctoral programme at IIM-B that has provided me an opportunity collaborate with, and learn from young scholars in disciplines ranging from social anthropology to hydrology. The dozen or so doctoral projects that I have been involved with have been the most important source of intellectual sustenance at IIM-B. Doctoral programmes at IIMs operate outside the din and media glare associated with the bread-and-butter MBA programme. While much of the IIM system is focused on celebrating corporate titans of the world, I have been happy to inhabit a much less glamorous space that has produced many outstanding scholars."

Appalled over the allegations, Justice N Anand Venkatesh has directed the police to file a status report of the case.On July 27, the police had arrested van attendant Baskaran and another person in connection with the crime.

However, parents of the boy claimed involvement of more persons with the connivance of the school management, as they were threatened to withdraw complaints against the school. ""My son informed us that he was sexually harassed by various people, including those of white skin,"" the petitioner said. ""Apart from this, a former panchayat union president of Kolappakkam, along with some rowdies, threatened us to withdraw the complaint"", he added.

Noting that the investigation officer had failed to follow the provisions of Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act while pursuing the case, advocate V Kannadasan submitted that the sexual assault was carried out not only by theaccused, but several others also. He told the court the he could not ascertain on what basis the Tiruvallur Mahila court had granted bail to the accused despite it being a matter of such heinous crime against children.

Taking serious note of the submission, Justice Venkatesh directed the trial court to report the exact stand taken by the prosecution when the bail applications were considered and posted the plea to January 3 for further hearing."

Also, do you think readers are slowly shunning physical copies and preferring e-books? Wait, the Hyderabad Book Fair will prove you wrong. From commoners to connoisseurs, the book lovers are thronging the book fair venue which is witnessing an increasing footfall day-by-day.

Almost all of the visitors to whom we spoke share that the touch and feel of the physical copy can't be replaced by an e-version of the same. ""Visual media is just to watch and enjoy but reading books will improve your thinking and thereby imaginative power,"" says Shantha Rao, a theatre activist. He adds that reading a physical copy will lead to hand, head, and heart correlation, which is very important to make an informed decision.

Phani Palavajala, a youngster who was at the fair to buy biographies, expresses a similar opinion when he says that while reading a hard copy, there will be no deviation, unlike an e-book. He adds that catching hold of a book gives immense pleasure. A tenth standard student, M Srija Sree shares that the experience of reading a book is unmatched and they were encouraged by their school management to read books.

Sheik Sadiq Ali, who is an organiser of a stall named Thopudu Bandi, says that it is not true that the reading habit is vanishing. ""Old and young generations, especially school children, love physical books, only those in between seem to prefer digital copies. And, reading a physical copy is more eye-friendly than going for a digital one,"" he shares.

Ali adds that some of the schools are encouraging their students to read and, thus, inculcating the habit of reading among children. ""I have seen a student purchasing books worth Rs 3,500 saying there are no better friends than books,"" he says.

A film actor and writer Paruchuri Venkateshwara Rao observes that visual media is momentary but reading is not. He says, ""Once you develop a habit of reading, it will stay forever."" The veteran actor also feels that the youngsters are fed up with the repetitive visual content and books are providing them with something fresh and new.

Eshwar Kavali, a civil services aspirant who is a regular visitor of the annual Hyderabad Book Fair, says that hard copies have a tangible feeling of touch and smell which will be missing in e-books. E-copies can supplement one's reading experience at the most, but not completely substitute. Eshwar also notes that the place has become an intellectual hangout where one can interact with fellow book lovers and students can also go beyond regular textbooks.

There is much more happening at the fair which is also a platform to develop and improve reading habit, mainly for the children with events such as story-reading, story-writing, one-minute Telugu, etc. ""Exercises such as these will help in building curiosity among children and also in reinterpreting what they read,"" says Shantha Rao who is also the person in-charge of 'Bala Vikas' which is looking after these exercises.

At the 32nd edition of the Hyderabad Book Fair, which is on till December 25 at NTR Stadium in Hyderabad, the organisers are expecting a footfall of around 10 lakhs. With 10-day exclusive events being organised for school children, the team behind the fair is eyeing at 2-3 lakh more visitors this time.

The organisers of the annual book fair are confident that the reading habit has not totally gone and this book fair will prove those who think so wrong. ""Holding a book and reading it are like going back to the mother's lap. Whatever we do and wherever we go, we will finally reach our mother,"" says Rajeshwar Rao, the treasurer of Hyderabad Book Fair.

""As there are more events for school children, we are expecting more numbers with children and their parents visiting the book fair,"" he shares.

""There was a complaint during the last edition that there were fewer books of other languages; we rectified it this year by sending our representatives to other book fairs and bringing other language publishers to the fair,"" says Rajeshwar, adding that the stall owners are very happy with the response they have been receiving."

The state government refused to regularise her job as there was a stay on approvals as per the 2012 state decision. But the court held that jobs given on compassionate grounds were not fresh jobs and hence, not in want of approval by the state.

A division bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dangre was hearing the petition filed by Samita Desai seeking directions to the state to regularise her post. The petition also sought directions to the state to pay her the dues accrued to her while working as a peon in the school.

According to the plea, Desai's husband, Sameer, worked as a peon in the school and his post was an approved one with his salary being paid by the government. However, he died on November 2, 2011 and Samita was left with two minor children. On March 26, 2012, the school management decided to appoint her in place of her husband on compassionate grounds.

The school sent an application on August 7, 2012 to the education department to regularise Samita's job, which was refused on grounds that there was a ban on approving new staff since May 2, 2012. Thereafter, Samitai and the school approached the court.

Public prosecutor, Shruti Vyas, argued that there was a ban on approvals and the post had not been sanctioned as per the 2013-14 staffing pattern for the school.

The court, however, rejected the contentions and stated that Samita's appointment was done as per a December 2, 2002 state order which superseded the 2012 ban."

If we talk about the continuous rise in trends of the market, mushrooming media and the internet research, Humanities is one of the most favorable streams among students in India or in abroad as well. Education is the most important factor for the development of human civilization, not only because it helps a person to give a start to his personality. Professionals and experts working in this field are also high in demand among big Corporates and are also getting high pay scale and respectful place in the job market too.

Students are opting for higher education at a foreign destination enthusiastically, and the number is growing tremendously. Universities internationally offer a variety of degree courses at Under Graduate Level. Good exposure, State-of-Art Infrastructure and world recognition of the degrees earned by these foreign universities give a head start to the career of any student. Have you ever given a thought that why Indian Students prefer to move abroad for higher students in Humanities?

Active learning through various activities like class participation, exchange of dialogues, case studies and practical off and on campus experience through live projects make learning fun and more meaningful. Indian students going abroad for higher studies were restricted to Engineering, Medicine and Law, but with education loans becoming easier to access and many new scholarships opportunities, Indian students are going abroad for undergraduate courses in humanities.

International education provides equal options for all streams, be it Science, Commerce or Humanities. Humanities as a stream are rising among students. Studying humanities in class XI-XIIth allows students to choose from a multitude of courses at graduation level, paving the way for a range of career choices in India or Abroad too. International education provides a holistic environment which helps a student to learn and grow in his/her area of specialization.

A Bachelor degree program in Humanities provides a study of the principles of Economics. Some of the topics and themes common to these programs include fundamentals of global economics, Social and cultural awareness, Political awareness and policies and languages. Upon graduation, students might pursue management careers in business or Government. Relevant certifications are offered through the International Export-Import Institutes. There has been an increase in the number of Indian students enrolling for a degree away from their home country. The major reason behind their choice is the fact that the Indian job market recognizes a degree from an International university more than any degree from an Indian university.

International Education offers a variety of courses to students who want to pursue an undergraduate program. These courses may be offered as a major or minor within humanities. The most popular fields in Humanity are as follows:

* Journalism or Mass Communication for news channels on TV and the internet, advertising agencies and movie studios.

* Content Writing for newspapers, magazines, social media website, marketing for various companies on full-time/part-time basis or as a freelancer

* Civil Services such as IRS/IPS/IAS/IFS officers after cracking civil service exams

* NDA Army Wing after clearing CDS (Combined Defence Services) exam

* Human Resource Manager(HR Manager) in various companies and enterprises

Various Government Sectors

Students who wish to stick to humanities would typically apply for a Bachelor in Arts, Bachelor in Economics or in Psychology and Mass Communication.The world subject rankings table does not offer a separate subject option for humanities and lists entries under Liberal arts, Fine arts and vocational courses is also one of those courses which is coming up really fast. Some of the major destinations for International Education for pursuing bachelors in humanities degree:

Stanford University

When the university was established, the Stanford family said that their aim was to educate ""cultured and useful citizens"" and the university still counts its humanities courses as the ""soul"" of a Stanford education. The School of Humanities and Sciences awards 63 per cent of all Stanford undergraduate degrees and almost 40 per cent of doctorates. Undergraduates are taught by faculty who are pioneers in their field.

Massachusetts Institute

of Technology

Although well known as a leading university in science and technology teaching, the university also provides courses across the arts and humanities. These include anthropology, history, linguistics, literature, media arts and sciences, and music and theatre arts. The School of Architecture and Planning was the first of its kind in the US and is known for commissioning progressive buildings on campus.

University of Oxford

As another of the world's most prestigious institutions, the University of Oxford is hugely respected across all disciplines. The humanities division includes the faculties of music, history, classics and English language and literature, among others. There are about 20,000 students at the university, more than a third of whom are international.

Students belong to a college, where undergraduates take the majority of their classes with just a few of their peers and a college tutor. In line with the British higher education system, students entering Oxford are admitted for a specific course, in contrast to US institutions, where students can take a variety of courses before declaring their major.

University of Cambridge

The University of Cambridge is regularly ranked as a top university across a wide range of subjects. As one of the oldest universities in the world, its colleges and traditions are famous in the UK and beyond. The university is based near London and attracts top scholars and distinguished visitors. More than 18,000 students are enrolled at the university across 31 colleges. The School of Arts and Humanities teaches a variety of subjects, from Asian studies to the history of art.

Harvard University

Harvard is the oldest university in the US and one of the most prestigious in the world. The arts and humanities division offers classes on topics ranging from Celtic myths and Jazz Age novels to Plato and video art. It has the world's largest university library system, consisting of 79 individual libraries containing more than 18 million volumes.

Admission to any college abroad is through SAT for most of the undergraduate courses.

Swamy, however, did not give any specific details about the ""corruption"", an allegation he had made in the past as well.

""The new governor of (RBI) is highly corrupt. I got him removed from the (Finance Ministry). I am calling Shaktikanta Das as a corrupt person. I am surprised that the man I got removed from the Finance Ministry for corruption was brought in as governor,"" Swamy said at an interactive session at the Indian School of Business here.

Later, when reporters asked Swamy who he thinks should head the RBI, the Rajya Sabha member named Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, professor R Vaidyanathan.

""Professor R Vaidyanathan, former professor of finance (IIM-B), would have been much better. He is also (an) old Sangh man. He is our man,"" he said, adding that bringing S Gurumurthy on the RBI board was a mistake.

""He (Das) was removed from the Finance Ministry because he tried to interfere in my corruption case against (senior Congress leader) Chidambaram. He is Chidambaram's 'chela' (disciple). When he was in Chennai, he was involved in a lot of corruption,"" Swamy said.

Das, who spearheaded the post-demonetisation normalisation of the economy, was named the new RBI governor on December 11, a day after incumbent Urjit Patel quit the post.

On being asked about the 2019 general elections, Swamy asserted that the saffron party would come back to power as ""there is no anti-incumbency"" against the Narendra Modi government.

To a question on Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Swamy alleged he held a British citizenship and cannot become a prime minister, a charge already rejected by the former.

""By the way Rahul Gandhi cannot be a prime minister because he is a citizen of Britain and his Indian citizenship will be cancelled, he won't even be an MP,"" he claimed.

Swamy had in 2016 made the allegation and, after it was raised in the Parliament Ethics Committee, Gandhi, in his response in March that year, had rejected the charge, saying it was a move to malign him.

The BJP leader had alleged that Gandhi declared himself a British citizen to occupy the post of the director of a company there.

On the Ram temple issue, Swamy said, ""There is a widespread desire, even in Tamil Nadu, that a Ram temple must be built (in Ayodhya). And we will build it...""

Swamy said he had given a proposal to the Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha on the Ram temple. He added that he would the fight Ayodhya issue ""as he has fundamental right to pray there""."

India's fourth Test against Australia at Sydney, starting January 3, 2019, will be the team's last assignment for six months and the BCCI is likely to prepare a road map for the longest format specialists.

There is a possibility that some of the senior India players may play against England Lions (A team) when they tour India for a full-fledged series in end January-February.

Once India finishes its Test engagements against Australia, it will next play the five-day format in July, 2019 against the West Indies in a two-Test series as part of the World Test Championship.

However, a few like Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane might have precious little to do once the Ranji Trophy ends in the last week of January.

""The fast bowlers workload management is a different issue but in case of some of the Test specialists, we might play them against England Lions. England Lions are coming for a full series where they will play four day Tests as well as List A and T20 matches,"" a BCCI source privy to the development told PTI Saturday.

It is learnt that the selectors might look at Pujara, Rahane and Prithvi Shaw (expected to be fully fit by then) to play the longer format matches.

As of now, Pujara is expected to feature in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals, starting January 15, as Saurashtra is currently on top of its group with 25 points.

In case of Mumbai, the chances of qualification are bleak. Rahane, who is not a part of India's limited overs scheme of things will next play the Mushtaq Ali Trophy followed by IPL for Rajasthan Royals.

Once Saurashtra's Ranji engagements finish, Pujara will have nothing to do as he has not been picked by any IPL franchise. There is the Mushtaq Ali Trophy but with the IPL auctions over, it will not hold the same kind of importance like last edition.

It's not that Pujara will need to prove anything to anyone but there is a school of thought that serious match time won't do any harm to him or for that matter Rahane."

Swamy had in 2016 made the allegation and after it was raised in the Parliament Ethics Committee, Gandhi, in his response in March that year, had rejected the charge, saying it was a move to malign him. The BJP leader had alleged that Gandhi declared himself a British citizen to occupy the post of the director of a company there.

On the Ram temple issue, Swamy said, ""There is a widespread desire, even in Tamil Nadu, that a Ram temple must be built (in Ayodhya). And we will build it..."" He said he had given a proposal to the Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha on Ram temple, but did not elaborate.

""The new governor of (RBI) is highly corrupt. I got him removed from the (Finance Ministry). I am calling Shaktikanta Das as a corrupt person. I am surprised that the man I got removed from the Finance Ministry for corruption was brought in as governor,"" Swamy said."

Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday called for a complete revamp of the school education system to ensure that children enjoy schooling and become life-long learners.

Addressing students of Jubilee Hills Public School, Hyderabad, at their annual day function, the Vice President said the school curriculum should be oriented to make students think rationally, independently and express cogently.

The education system needs to focus on making a child curious, creative, caring, communicative, confident and capable. It should prepare each child to be an active, caring citizen ready to participate in the world of today and capable of shaping the world of tomorrow.

Such an environment will instill confidence in children, apart from inculcating a spirit of tolerance and accommodation in them, he added.

Pointing out that education was the foundation for all efforts to improve the quality of our lives, Shri Naidu said: ""Our life is multi-faceted and so must education be."" He said life encompassed a range of activities which help us to acquire new knowledge and skills, make us physically strong and healthy, please our hearts and bring out the finest qualities lying dormant in each one of us.

Stressing that it was important to ensure that students do not confine themselves to academics alone, he said: ""Studies are important but equally important are sports, fine arts, dance, music, art and culture. In fact, I have been advocating that students should spend 50 per cent of their schooling hours outside classrooms and that sports education should be accorded greater importance by educationists and parents"". He added that the school curriculum should include sports, yoga and physical education.

Referring to the great Indian tradition of Guru ShishyaParampara, Shri Naidu said teachers and students used to live together and engage in a constant dialogue. These discussions were recorded and have been handed down to us from the ancient past in the form of Upanishads.

""We have always believed that true learning takes place through observation, reading, discussion, reflection, analysing and synthesizing"", Shri Naidu said and wanted this great tradition to be reflected in our modern education system as well. He advised school managements to take children on excursions to rural areas so that children get to understand the life of people living there.

Emphasising that there should be a constant dialogue between students and teachers, he said teachers must guide students not just in academics but also enable them to develop life skills, which are essential to successfully navigate in the increasingly complex world of today.

He said that an education which balances the head, heart, body and spirit alone can be called a truly holistic education. The child should not only be able to acquire and absorb knowledge, but also be able to apply the knowledge in real life situation.

Pointing out that knowledge was expanding exponentially and disruptive technologies were changing the way we live, communicate with each other and work, the Vice President said""Vigyana"" was growing at an unprecedented pace.

The values we live by and the ideals that serve as our guiding stars were equally important to channel our thoughts and actions in a purposeful direction. ""That is what we call ""Viveka"" or wisdom, the ability to separate the 'good' from the 'bad' and develop the ability to choose the 'good'. ""Vigyana"" must be blended with ""Viveka"".

We need an education system that promotes excellence, equity and empathy, he added.

The Vice President lauded the management of the school for imparting training in traditional values in tune with the school's motto; ""Tradition and Technology""."

He launched a scathing at Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu by recalling the latter's days of deception when he deception when he backstabbed his father-in-law, late CM NTR, soon after the TDP founder was elected to the Assembly from Tekkali in 1994.

YS Jagan said the local minister Atchannaidu was a complete failure in addressing public issues in the last four years. ""The TDP minister, it is said, is the big boss of the sand mafia in Amudala Valasa, Narasapuram and other places in the region. All government contracts are awarded only to the minister's brother Hari Prasad,"" he said parroting the locals' woes.

All the rivers in the region have been exploited in the name of Neeru-Chettu program while the TDP leaders demand commissions for building toilets, providing pensions and Anganwadi jobs.

The Leader of Opposition said 1,500 people in this constituency had to approach the Courts to get their pensions after the TDP leaders deliberately removed their names. The locals said Atchannaidu encroached government lands to build godowns.

Any one who wants to get a new granite quarrying license and NOC should pay Rs 25 lakhs to the associates of Atchannaidu. A land belonging to the RTC in Tekkali has been registered in the name of Atchanaidu's relative.

In Chandrababu Naidu's rule, the electricity charges for polishing units have been increased by Rs 8 per unit. Employees of Metkore Ferro Alloys were staging a protest against the management demanding payment of salary dues, while I was passing by, he said.

Speaking about the protests against Kakarapalli power plant, YS Jagan recalled that in 2014 Chandrababu Naidu promised to cancel permissions for the plant. Fishermen were losing their livelihood while 51 villages were living in danger. In Bhavanapadu Port project, the farmers' lands were acquired for cheap prices only to benefit the rich and powerful.

YS Jagan said the locals who were affected by cyclone Titli are still awaiting compensation. Fake cheques have been in circulation in the aftermath of the cyclone, he said reading out anonymous names owho were said to have been awarded the compensation.

Chandrababu released just Rs 520 crores while the damage evaluated in the Titli cyclone was Rs 3,400 crore.

The Opposition leader mocked Chandrababu's claims of controlling the ocean currents in cyclone Phethai. While the cyclone was on, Chandrababu took a special flight to the swearing-in of chief ministers in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.

Does Chandrababu's Real Time Governance System predict the cyclone effect better than that of IMD and ISRO? Did you send a satellite into the space for estimating weather conditions? he asked Chandrababu. YS Jagan recalled that late Chief Minister Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy signed an MOU with ISRO in 2006.

Doesn't the RTGS system remind Chandrababu on the pending Rs 87,600 crore farm loans?

Doesn't the RTGS stystem remind Chandrababu on the pending loans of the women's self help groups?

""Only Nara Lokesh was employed with a minister's post in the last four years.""

In Chandrababu's rule, the electricity charges, fuel prices, RTC bus charges, house tax , school fees etc. have skyrocketed. Chandrababu, who promised to provide nine hours of electricity to farmers, did not keep his word. Besides, the TDP is collecting huge revenue in the form of electricity bills, he said.

In 2014, Chandrababu vowed to ban all liquor shops in the state. But, after four years of his rule, he has ensured that every village had a liquor shop, YS Jagan said.

Chandrababu's opprtunism and antics have touched new heights with his friendship with the Congress. After having abused Congress leaders post-bifurcation, he is now befriending the Congress. He had planned on spending crores of Rupees to buy out MLAs in Telangana. In the process, he was caught red-handed in note for vote case. His friendship with the Congress is only to protect himself from facing prosecution in the cases and corruption charges.

Just a few months back, the Congress leaders released a book on Chandrababu's deceptions and corruption charges. Chandrababu took a massive U-turn in demand for the Special Category Status (SCS) after accepting the special package.

YS Jagan recalled the golden days of Dr YSR. He lashed out at Chandrababu Naidu for ignoring the interests of lakhs of students with the scrapping of fee reimbursement.

After coming to power, we are going to transform the lives of the poor in the State, he said while explaining the benefits of Navarathnalu."

Or me. Most urbanites (I grew up in Bengaluru) have had some experience of Bharat-the other 69 per cent of Indians who live in the hinterland. I have vivid memories of visiting my maternal grandfather in Bhagamandala, in the foothills of Talacauvery in Kodagu where the mighty Cauvery bubbles forth as a tiny spring.

From 1965 onwards, I regularly went to Cherangala, his village, to stay with him while he was alive and to pay res­pects at his grave after he died. We had to go by foot to his house from the bus stop in Bhagamandala. It was a five kilometre walk through lush paddy fields bisected by the gurgling Cauvery, which was more of a stream than a river. The house did not have electricity and we lit kerosene lamps at night. Food was cooked using firewood-the akki (rice) rotis baked on them were delicious. We plucked cashew fruit from the garden, roasted the seeds on burning wood and ate the kernel piping hot. We bathed in a pond surrounded by a thatched enclosure. There were no toilets, we took refuge in the nearby bushes, always watching our backs for snakes and other wildlife. It was only in the early 2000s that change became visible in the village. We did not have to walk to the house any more, we could use the motorable road that passed right by it. Electricity poles had come up and, when the lights failed, the hum of gensets echoed across the hills. Houses with thatched roofs were replaced by ones using cement, concrete and tiles. When I last visited two years back, my relatives cooked food using LPG cylinders. The houses had attached toilets and bathrooms with water coming from the taps. Everyone had smartphones and stayed in touch on WhatsApp. They kept abreast of cashew, coffee and cardamom prices in India and the world on the internet. The issues they faced, though, were no different from what my grandfather complained about when he was alive. The price at which they sold the surplus paddy they grew remains unremunerative. Rates for coffee, the main plantation crop, continue to fluctuate widely even as finding labour to tend the plants has got costlier. Loss of tree cover and climate change are making agriculture a risky venture, forcing some members of the family to find work in town and supplement the family income.

TRADITION VERSUS MODERNITY: A farmer couple cultivates land near Udaipur in Rajasthan. (Photographs by Purushottam Diwakar)

Welcome to the New Bharat which, like Kodagu, has experienced transformational change along with extreme contradictions since india today magazine came into existence 43 years ago. Even as it prospered, the countryside experienced equal distress, particularly on the farm front. The paradoxes are evident. In these four decades, the Central and state governments have combined their resources to build a record 30 lakh kilometres of black top roads that now connect the 640,867 villages to the nearest town. By last year, virtually 100 per cent of India's villages had been electrified, and almost 83 per cent of rural households now have electric bulbs lighting up their nights. Under a scheme to provide housing for the needy in villages, 1 crore houses have been built in the past four years, a six-fold annual increase from before. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has seen over 9 crore toilets being built since 2014 and 5.3 lakh villages have been declared open defecation free. With 5.8 crore new LPG connections given since 2016, cooking gas is fast replacing kerosene stoves and coal- or wood-fired chulhas in kitchens, covering almost 50 per cent of rural households. Mobile phone coverage and usage have reached the poorest of the poor. Joining the white revolution that saw India become the world's largest producer of milk are the silver (poultry) and blue (fisheries) revolutions. And the number of those living below the poverty line (BPL) in rural India has dropped dramatically, from 50 per cent in 1993-94 to 25.7 per cent today.

TRADITION VERSUS MODERNITY: Farmers in Rajawas village in Jaipur district. (Photographs by Purushottam Diwakar)

Yet, even if the transformation has been nothing short of revolutionary in many areas, on key welfare indicators such as health and education and on the economic front, the situation remains grim. While infant mortality levels have dropped significantly since Independence, they are still at a higher level than in neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh. Almost 35 per cent, or one out of three, children in villages still suffer from malnutrition. In education, while enrolment in primary and secondary levels is near universal, dropout rates for high school are extremely high and only 11.6 per cent pursue an undergraduate course. Even for those enrolled in schools, several studies have exposed how poor the standards of learning are. In agriculture, production levels have reached record levels in foodgrains and pulses, making India self-sufficient in food. But this has triggered a problem of plenty that has seen farmers across the country rise up in strong protest against the low returns. Farmer distress is compounded by the huge slowdown in manufacturing and industry in the country. That has resulted in not enough jobs being generated to absorb the underemployed from agriculture. Agricultural workers now constitute 54 per cent of India's total work force, but their productivity is only half that of their urban counterparts.

So, to paraphrase Charles Dickens, it is the best of times for village India and also the worst of times. Why do we still call it Naya Bharat when much of it could still be described as the old India with all its familiar woes? The big difference is that no more are those living in village India willing to resign themselves to their fate. Or depend on doles from the government to lift them out of the abyss. That change is visible, particularly among rural women, who are looking to go beyond being homemakers or work as subsistence farm labourers. In what is possibly the world's largest self-employed movement, over 10 crore women have formed 717,689 self-help groups (SHGs) and now collectively engage in a wide spectrum of economic activity that gives them income and, more importantly, an identity of their own. They organise themselves in clusters to leverage small loans from banks to fund the jobs they are engaged in, whether in livestock management or in tailoring. They have a strong record of repaying loans. And they are bringing about a silent but profound revolution.

All across the country, as India Today correspondents found, there are inspiring examples of how villagers have worked against debilitating odds to bring about change, not only in their lives but for others as well. Ruma Devi, who features on our front cover, got married at the age of 17 with few skills other than stitching and embroidery. To supplement her income, she formed a self-help group to make handicrafts. When its members found that rather than rely on middlemen, they could directly buy their raw material and sell their finished products, they took a bank loan and expanded their business. Ruma Devi then joined an NGO called Gramin Vikas Evam Chetna Sansthan that trained artisans and rose to become its president. It now operates in 75 villages and has trained over 11,000 artisans. Ruma Devi inspired her team members to diversify into making tops, skirts, dupattas and salwar suits using traditional motifs. Their work caught the attention of top designers who have started purchasing the clothes they make. At 30 years of age, Ruma Devi is an outstanding example of the success of empowered women. In the following pages, we feature many more such heart-warming stories.

The recent rising tide of farmers' protests is also an expression of rural self-assertion and awareness. Farmers are now demanding more than band-aid solutions like loan waivers that make them look like villains and benefit only those who can game the system. Their demand is for an INCOME REVOLUTION, not a green, blue or white one. They are not taken in by the promises from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to double farm incomes. They insist on speedy delivery and fundamental reform. They also want ""ease of doing agriculture"" rather than just seeing all the government's concessions go to industry. This tragedy could have been averted if agricultural practices had also seen a paradigm shift with the economic reform process that began in 1991. It didn't happen. Policy-makers continued with the single-minded focus on production and self-sufficiency. They were averse to taking major risks for fear of offending India's largest vote bank. In contrast, China ushered in major reform so that only 18 per cent of its population now is dependent on agriculture as compared to India's 43 per cent.

Among India's follies was the failure to amend the various land acts. As a result, the fragmentation of land holdings has reached critical levels, with a majority of farmers working less than one hectare of land. With no enabling legislation being passed towards easing the land crisis, contract farming, innovative technologies and economies of scale have not taken hold. What was also neglected was agricultural logistics, post-production processing and marketing of products. For instance, the shortfall in cold-chain infrastructure for storage and transport of high-value crops such as fruits and vegetables is anything between 85 and 95 per cent. There were other mistakes. There is a clear need to link agriculture to domestic and industrial consumption and diversify crops based on need. But the mindless focus on foodgrains saw close to 50 million tonnes being stored under the Public Distribution System-more than twice the ann­ual food entitlement of all the BPL families in the country. To cite another example, we need only 25 million tonnes of sugarcane for domestic consumption, but we produce 30-36 million tonnes. Yet, till July this year, government policy restricted its diversion to non-food uses like ethanol production. No matter which party comes to power in 2019, one must hope its manifesto will include undertaking major agrarian reforms to end the farmers' agony.

In the other key areas impacting rural progress, both the Central and state governments have thankfully learnt from past errors. Providing rural housing for the needy is one such. Housing programmes have been around since 1985, but their implementation has been tardy, and corruption rampant. When the NDA government under Narendra Modi came to power, it rev­am­ped the programme and ren­amed it the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana. The size of the houses to be built was increased from 20 square metres to 25 square metres and the grant increased from Rs 70,000 to Rs 1.2 lakh. But what was critical was how corruption was curbed using digital and communications technology. At the time of the payment of the first instalment, the recipient has to upload his photograph along with pictures of the plot of land his house is to come up on. Then, the person has to send photographs of each major stage of construction stipulated to get the next instalment. The subsidy money is transferred directly to the recipient's bank account, ensuring it is not diverted. This has cut down corruption by local officials from 50 per cent to around 12 per cent. It has also seen a record number of houses being built in the past four years. One fallout: with no slush money coming to them, many of the panchayat-level officials are not pushing the programme too enthusiastically.

Another welcome development has been the move to integrate the various services under diff­erent schemes. So, under the housing scheme, a person can also avail of the subsidy for toilets under Swachh Bharat, get a cooking gas connection under the PM Ujjwala Yojana and an electricity connection under the rural electrification programme. With all money transfers going to bank accounts, the opportunities for corrupt officials to withhold or divert payments has been dramatically reduced. It remains critical to ensure that, having provided these amenities, the quality of service is not compromised. It is not enough to bring electricity poles to a village, there must also be quality supply of power. In subsidised LPG, cooking refills have to be made easily available and not given as a premium.

In the PM Gram Sadak Yojana, an important innovation is that, apart from building the roads, there is a built-in five-year maintenance contract the constructor has to abide by. He has no choice then but to ensure that good quality material is used for making the road. Some of the other government schemes have provided amazing results in the past too. When M.G. Ramachandran was chief minister of Tamil Nadu in 1982, he introduced the mid-day meal scheme. I had written an article about it for the magazine at the time, dismissing it as a populist scheme. But its impact turned out to be revolutionary. Infant mortality rates in the state began to drop significantly a few years after the scheme was introduced. Then the government cleverly extended it to pregnant mothers who came to drop their children to school. They were not only given a meal package but also medicines to ensure a safe pregnancy. It was followed up with post-natal care and benefits. That saw maternal mortality rates drop perceptibly in the state. And to the astonishment of social planners, Tamil Nadu's total fertility rates began to fall significantly within a decade, reaching levels only achieved by Kerala.

Maternal care has been another success story. When I visited Rajasthan in the 1980s for a health story, only two out of 10 babies born were institutional deliveries. The other eight were delivered at home with the help of the rudimentary equipment used by traditional midwives or dais. Today, eight out of 10 babies in Rajasthan are born under institutional care.

Yet, while these are laudable success stories, it is not enough for governments to be content with providing the basics alone. In the mid-1980s, the then prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, launched the rural water mission. The government improved the quality of the hand-pumps being installed and had them mass produced. It then made provisions for speedy boring of wells and installation of pumps. There were still issues as to how many wells had to be sunk in each village, including separate ones for Dalits and Muslims. But it transformed water availability in rural areas where women had to walk long distances to fetch water. I travelled across several states during the great drought of 1987 and found that the hand pumps provided major relief and enabled the Rajiv government to successfully tackle the crisis. While villagers then were willing to gather around hand-pumps to collect water, now they are all clamouring for piped water supply to their homes, having seen their urban counterparts enjoy such facilities. Yet, this is not going to be easy to deliver both in terms of costs and availability. The situation calls for innovative solutions and people's involvement and cooperation to accept and implement them.

There were good reasons why my parents left their respective villages in Kodagu to work for a living in professions other than agriculture. Reasons that continue to send droves of migrants from villages in search of jobs to urban India. For the new Bharat to prosper, there will have to be major reforms in every aspect of the lives of the 83.3 crore who live in it. That remains India's biggest challenge."

The three teenager's students are: Kavya Kopparapu and Rishab Jain who are an Indian-American and Amika George who is a British-Indian. These three Indian origin teenagers are among the group who have come to be motivations for youths around the world due to their remarkable accomplishments through their effort and desire.

Indian-American Rishabh Jain, who is eighth grade has established an algorithm that can probably be a solution or can treat pancreatic cancer.

While on the other hand Kavya Kopparapu, an Indian-American teenager is a freshman at the Harvard University. She established a deep learning computer structure that can examine slides of tissue from brain cancer patients regarding for variances in thickness, colour, surface, texture and cellular configuration that are distinctive to that actual person's example.

She established the structure after learning that from the past 30 years the survival rate of glioblastoma (an aggressive brain cancer) has not improved till date and it need to be improved. Considering this this in mind she created the computer system in order to provide help and bringing advancement in the medical technology.

According to the Time magazine who have asked her about her goal on which she replied that her goal is ""to develop targeted therapies that are also unique to the person.""

British-Indian teenager Amika George aim is to persuade officials to end the absence of menstrual products to poor girls and women due to lack of money. In her term she called it ""period poverty"". She says that by raising funds, the dispersal of menstrual products to women who don't have enough money to afford it.

She tells the Time magazine that ""It really upsets me"" of knowing that a lot of girls in the UK were regularly missing school for the duration of their periods as they could not have enough money to buy menstrual products.

She also added by saying, ""The government knew this was happening on their watch, but they were refusing to find a solution.""

She launched a movement called the #FreePeriods movement as a response, collecting nearly 200,000 initials on her appeal to help in eliminating period poverty. The undertaking finally gathered the funding and support of many UK policymakers, stimulating the administration and management to assign funds to the matter for the first time."

The 33-year-old was present at the unveiling of the Junior Super Kings inter-school championship trophy. Not only had Rayudu come out with flying colours for CSK, but he is now a strong contender for a middle-order spot in the team for next year's World Cup.

""The IPL stint was a good experience. Everybody trusted me and I always wanted to repay the faith that they had in me. I worked on my game and I am happy that I could make the most of my opportunities,"" remarked Rayudu.

The Indian team management has been rotating players and trying them out in different slots to get their combination right for the World Cup. So where does the Hyderabadi think he will fit in in the scheme of things?

""I am basically not looking at any number as such. I am just concentrating on the series coming up in Australia. I am not really thinking too far ahead. International cricket in itself is a challenge. So Australia will not be different. I am focussing on it in the way I should. All I can say is I am preparing well.""

The right-hander's success in IPL was because of his shot-selection and attacking instinct. ""Playing aggressively, and playing aggressively with confidence are entirely different things. I had the confidence to go out there and express myself. Once people back you, the job becomes a lot more easier.""

Rayudu revealed that his decision to retire from first-class cricket to focus on white-ball cricket was not sudden, but a calculated move. ""The only thought process (to was to preserve my body as far as possible. I am 33. I have had a knee injury. I really wanted to make efficient use of my body in terms of the cricket I play.""

Medium-pacer Mohit Sharma, who was also roped in by the Men in Yellow for Rs 5 crore, said he was delighted to be back with the franchise.

""It is always good to return home. Like you go to office and then return home every day, it is the same feeling with CSK.""

Mohit too has been one among those whose IPL experiences have catalysed their national sojourn. He hasn't been in that reckoning for a while. But this time around, he insists that he's just looking at delivering for the franchise.

""To be honest, I am not thinking that much at the moment about returning to the national side. I will keep trying to do my best for CSK. If that helps me bag a recall, I am fine with it. But the focus is to do well for my team.

The 30-year-old is raring to have another crack at the IPL, irrespective of the venue as there are speculations of the event happening outside India.

""In the shorter format, one needs to have variations to be effective. But I believe more in the theory of how and when to use them. In case the IPL is moved to South Africa, we are mentally prepared."""

The Indian School of Public Policy (ISPP) is an upcoming school founded by eminent leaders and philanthropists. Offering a one-year master's equivalent programme in policy, design and management, it will be launched in August 2019 in New Delhi, to fulfil the need for an upcoming home grown programme that prepares policy professionals of the future.

""India will continue to have in the next decades, the largest young population in the world. As societies become more and more knowledge based, rules and institutions that shape local, national and global engagements will have to change to meet the aspirations of the youth in India,"" says Dr. Shubhashis Gangopadhyay, Dean, ISPP.

Pressing need

He feels that India needs its own policy programmes that are affordable as compared to the world's top policy schools based in the U.S. and Singapore. He says, ""In a democratic, rule-of-law society, public policy is both a science and an art. It requires scientific knowledge and understanding of how complex societies work; at the same time, the art of implementation requires a deep understanding of how diverse political forces can be brought together to serve a common purpose. While the science of public policy could, at a stretch be generalisable, the art surely is best learnt in the environment in which it will be practised. Hence, the school is being set up in India"".

According to Mr. Gangopadhyay, there are many schools of policy making but the reason for establishing a new public policy school is twofold: ""The demand for trained personnel is well beyond what the current set of schools are producing; Globalisation and digitisation are making markets more complex. Public policy specialists need to learn new methods to be able to adapt to the evolving economic and social reality,"" he explains.

Unique approach

ISPP will be unique because the programme is not derived from what is taught elsewhere but designed to directly address India's pressing issues such as health, education, disparity, technology, environment, and so on. Through year-long workshops, students will develop ideas that translate into innovative, and specific, recommendations for addressing these issues.

""We are essentially going to ease them into the industry where internships will be not just another activity that they perform but an integral part of their curriculum and understand the world of policy making from within,"" he says.

On the selection of candidates, he says, ""The School will look for students who want to, and can, do public policy. Obviously, some of them will not have the means to pay for the training. The School has a policy of moving towards a steady-state set-up where 20% of the students will be on scholarships."""

The programme featured films like Repetitions (Marie Andre), Die Afrikanische Frau (Alexander Kluge), The Coming Society (Susanne Kennedy, Richard Janssen), and Roi Soleil (Albert Serra), among others. He also held forth on the subject of archives and the production of memory by museums, emphasising on the need to not be nostalgic. He also spoke about how the time when declarative statements about what art is good and what art is bad were made, has long ended.

Here is the talk Dercon gave, reproduced in full:

You have spoken about rethinking the notion of a museum several times. What do you think of the possibilities of rethinking the concept of an archive today?

For me, the concept of a museum is the production of memory. And today, I think we all know that collecting is becoming incredibly difficult, because the prices on the market are so high, even for the newest stuff. I must also say there is so much stuff around, so many contemporary art objects, which I think are unnecessary to collect. Then there are also many artists who don't make collectibles at all; many artists in the East, the West and Asia, in Europe and in the United States, started to work with immaterial productions.

What is at stake is this: The museum has to rethink what it is to produce memory.

In any case, memory is not only the past but also the present and the future. Memory is a very productive kind of attitude. So-called private museums, which are like mushrooms, are blossoming everywhere - in China, but also in this country. Of course, there are some exceptions. Most of these private museums are more concerned with the here and the now than with the notion of the future. I wrote several essays on the problem of the private museum, and I understand that we need private museums where there is no government putting things in place. But when you speak to the owners of private museums, they use all sorts of words except one, which is 'the future'. We have to make a difference when we talk about a museum of the future in terms of the production of memory, between public museums and private museums because the task of the public museum is to create ownership for the public and not just for one person or a family. There, the whole notion of the archive is becoming quite important, because even if we admit that today the contemporary art object is in a crisis, that many artists are questioning the materiality of art objects and moving into the performative, we still have to find a means to do something with the past.

What I find very interesting is that a lot of institutions are moving into zero-money collecting. Zero-money collecting is exactly that: It is looking for many different kinds of materials which can tell stories; which can tell the story of a movement; which can tell the story of an artist; which can tell the story of a critic. It's very important not to concentrate on the contemporary art object alone, but to make sure that you surround the object/s with many different kinds of materials. Here in India, things are getting even more interesting. Remember that Indian modernism showed this breakage, this cleavage, which is that one group -- listening very carefully to what the West was saying -- stated that we have to concentrate on the bazaar, on painting and sculpture. The other group -- people like Tagore or Dashrath Patel -- was saying we shouldn't split things up.

Today, there is an even bigger task for Indian museums in terms of the archive, because there are all kinds of objects which I would (in the sense of Tagore and Dashrath Patel) like to connect with Indian modern contemporary art production and move back into the museum. It's an amazing challenge, because when I think about the exhibition of Dashrath Patel in Kolkata, there are so many interesting materials there which relay to Nasreen Mohamedi; they were part of this movement despite counteracting MF Hussain and Raza. ""It's all about art, and only about art,"" it was said of these materials. Therefore, there are many materials and objects which could be moved into the museum, not just documentation.

There is another aspect which I find very interesting, which becomes evident in this Biennale: that in India, there is still an innate sense that things don't have to be split up -- that we can inject literature, cinema, design, but that we can also inject the popular arts. Do you call it folk art, do you call it craft? I don't think we have the right name for it yet. Because there are some artists who are so-called ""outsider artists"" who fit in the concept of Anita Dube so well. And they would fit in in Kiran Nadar's museum too. Actually, Kiran Nadar is now showing an outsider artist; I don't recall his name. He is very famous for creating murals and he died very young -- actually, he committed suicide in Japan, because he couldn't take the tension between the so-called high art and what he was forced into and where he comes from.

In terms of the archive, there is a lot at stake for the future of the museum, even more so for the future of a museum in India, because of all these tensions and the different paths one can walk on. It's very important to walk on these paths.

If you want to create a museum in India, if you do a Biennale, an archive is very important, but don't be nostalgic, don't be obsessed and don't fetishise the archive. A lot of artists in the West also create work about archives. I think there is too much nostalgia around the concept. It's very unproductive to concentrate only on the past and the recent past. It's incredibly important to look forward.

On the subject of criticality and moving beyond nostalgia and engaging with a societal approach, whether it's a museum or the archive, how important do you think constructive pedagogy is in these spaces?

Incredibly important. And I like the word 'constructive' pedagogy, because you have many different kinds of pedagogical methods to adopt. I understand constructive pedagogy as something you develop together with an audience, with a community, with participants. The time when one would say, 'I am going to tell you what's good and what's bad,' is over. So is the time when one authority would declare, 'This is it.' This was good for the period when art was all about shock, awe and separation. Today, we live the art of 'with'. Artists don't want to play the role of geniality anymore, and I think curators should also stop playing the role of geniuses. I am afraid to say that I see many young people in India who want to become curators now instead of becoming artists, because they still believe in the authoritarian voice of the curator. So for me, the time of the geniality of the artist and the curator is over. We have to develop ideas and discourses with the audience, and this is where constructive pedagogy comes in.

It's not about passive participation or participation which I would say is a kind of fake democracy. There is another way around it, and it's very much about decision-making processes: Who is making decisions, and how do we make decisions?

I can tell you one story, about the Tate Modern when they invited Olafur Eliasson. Eliasson created this incredible orange sun in the Turbine Hall. The curators, management and the artists were confused and in a disarray after a few days because so many people had flocked to the space -- many more than were expected. They started to do things themselves -- they hung out, started to have picnics, take siestas, and the worst of all, the visitors started to show their own art. Of course that's not allowed in museums. Ridiculous.

What we have to learn is that there are many ways to take decisions and that we have to learn the consequences of the art of 'with' -- that is where constructive pedagogy comes into being.

You mentioned a co-productive element and that's exactly what this edition of the Biennale looks at. How well do you think this parallels themes of representation and invisibility or marginalisation and silence?

First of all, this Biennale is directed by an artist, and Anita Dube is an artist that I am absolutely fascinated by, because I often didn't understand her, I didn't know where her references came from. This Biennale gave me an amazing field of references to understand the work of the artist better. In this case, it is Anita Dube. References which I had never expected that she was alluding to. So that's incredibly interesting.

Anita Dube's work allows for a kind of engagement because of the themes chosen and because you know that she has chosen her peers, many of whom are women, but not women alone. Her work allows for a process of identification, not so much for a process of distancing. She tries to communicate. She tries to -- and that's the most important aspect -- in order to make a contribution.

When I was teaching (I still give lectures to artists), artists would come up to me and say, 'We would like to follow your course, to go to this art school, that art school.' I would always say to them, what do you want? Some would reply, 'We want to be able to express ourselves.' I doubt if that's necessary. I think an artist today has to, in the first place, make a contribution. And that's what this Biennale is doing. Anita Dube has invited so many artists who believed or who believe in and who made and continue to make contributions. So in a way, they make necessary art. Because there is so much art which is totally unnecessary today, even in India.

But, according to new research from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, by giving gifts to kith and kin happiness after an event does not vanish.

In the paper, ""People Are Slow to Adapt to the Warm Glow of Giving,"" forthcoming in Psychological Science, Chicago Booth Associate Professor Ed O'Brien and Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management's PhD candidate Samantha Kassirer found that participants' happiness did not decline, or declined much slower, if they repeatedly bestowed gifts on others versus repeatedly receiving those same gifts themselves.

""If you want to sustain happiness over time, past research tells us that we need to take a break from what we're currently consuming and experience something new. Our research reveals that the kind of thing may matter more than assumed: Repeated giving, even in identical ways to identical others, may continue to feel relatively fresh and relatively pleasurable the more that we do it,"" O'Brien explains.

The researchers conducted two studies. In one experiment, university student participants received $5 every day for 5 days; they were required to spend the money on the exact same thing each time. The researchers randomly assigned participants to spend the money either on themselves or on someone else, such as by leaving money in a tip jar at the same café or making an online donation to the same charity every day. The participants reflected on their spending experience and overall happiness at the end of each day.

The data, from a total of 96 participants, showed a clear pattern: Participants started off with similar levels of self-reported happiness and those who spent money on themselves reported a steady decline in happiness over the 5-day period. But happiness did not seem to fade for those who gave their money to someone else. The joy from giving for the fifth time in a row was just as strong as it was at the start.

O'Brien and Kassirer then conducted a second experiment online, which allowed them to keep the tasks consistent across participants. In this experiment, 502 participants played 10 rounds of a word puzzle game. They won five cents per round, which they either kept or donated to a charity of their choice. After each round, participants disclosed the degree to which winning made them feel happy, elated, and joyful.

Again, the self-reported happiness of those who gave their winnings away declined far more slowly than did the happiness reported by those who kept their winnings.

Further analyses ruled out some potential alternative explanations, such as the possibility that participants who gave to others had to think longer and harder about what to give, which could promote higher happiness.

""We considered many such possibilities, and measured over a dozen of them,"" says O'Brien. ""None of them could explain our results; there were very few incidental differences between 'get' and 'give' conditions, and the key difference in happiness remained unchanged when controlling for these other variables in the analyses.""

Adaptation to happiness-inducing experiences can be functional to the extent that it motivates us to pursue and acquire new resources. Why doesn't this also happen with the happiness we feel when we give?

The researchers note that when people focus on an outcome, such as getting paid, they can easily compare outcomes, which diminishes their sensitivity to each experience. When people focus on an action, such as donating to a charity, they may focus less on comparison and instead experience each act of giving as a unique happiness-inducing event.

We may also be slower to adapt to happiness generated by giving because giving to others helps us maintain our prosocial reputation, reinforcing our sense of social connection and belonging.

These findings raise some interesting questions for future research - for example, would these findings hold if people were giving or receiving larger amounts of money? Or to giving to friends versus strangers?

The researchers have also considered looking beyond giving or receiving monetary rewards, since prosocial behavior includes a wide range of experiences.

""Right now we're testing repeated conversation and social experiences, which also may get better rather than worse over time,"" O'Brien explains.

The Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, will evaluate the merger of primary schools in Jharkhand. The state education department has roped in the institute for a detailed study of 4,600 merged schools to find out if the reorganisation has brought about any improvement or not, department officials said.

State education secretary AP Singh said, ""IIM Ranchi would see if the reorganisation has brought any benefits for students as well as the education system. It would also evaluate if the initiative brought about any improvement in the education of those students who were shifted to other schools in the merger process,"" he said. ""We have sought a financial proposal from the institute for the study.""

The reorganisation exercise of schools had also caught the interest of IIM Bangalore, which expressed its willingness to carry out a study on the process and its benefits, said the secretary.

Merging schools with low enrolment is an exercise that has been undertake by Rajasthan and Jharkhand in the country with the support of the Union government and NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog, the policy think tank of the Government of India. Jharkhand started the merging procedure in 2016-17.

Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) director Uma Shankar Singh said that there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under the education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or fewer students. These schools had an average of one or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four-five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools?"" he said.

The council said that a four-step process -- field inspection; cross-district verification; block and district consultation; and final notification -- was undertaken to merge the schools.

Singh said that 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools had been shifted and 96% of the students had expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty in shifting 150 schools due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue has been resolved, and students from 120 schools have been shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students, giving them better teacher availability, and cut the requirement of 4,500 teaching positions. The merger process saved the government Rs 400 crore by reducing teaching positions and infrastructure requirements, said JEPC officials. The officials added that the funds thus saved would be spent on strengthening the education infrastructure of the merged schools."

CEO Darius Adamczyk isn't the type to play the hype man,so when he says he's ""extraordinarily excited"" about something, it's meaningful. Those were the words he used earlier this year to describe Honeywell's visionfor using technology to improve air travel and stake out a leading position in theburgeoning field of connected aircraft. It's Kristin Slyker's job to make that happen.

Slyker, 44, leadsthe company'sefforts to sell antennas that enable satellite communications, high-speed in-flight WiFi service and software that can improve fuel efficiency, predict maintenance needs and help pilots plan flights. It's a job she says she never would have envisioned for herself when she joined the companymore than 16 years ago in an information-technology role. Having grown up in the Phoenix area, where Honeywell Aerospace's headquarters are located, she graduated from Arizona State University's W.P. Carey School of Businesswith a degree in computer information systems.But with a father who served in the Air National Guard, airplanes were an important part - and occasional playground - of Slyker's childhood.

""This job brings it full circle,"" Slyker, vice president of connected-aircraft customers and partnerships, said in a Dec. 4 interview on board Honeywell's Boeing Co. 757 test plane as we circled the Grand Canyon. The plane, stripped of most passenger accoutrements save for a dozen or so seats, now serves as a flying laboratory for Honeywell's latest innovations. These include its GoDirect software services and connected radar that crowdsources information from other planes, satellites and ground systemsto give pilots a more complete and accurate picture of the weather.

One reason Slyker may not have envisioned her job is that it didn't officially exist until early 2017, when Honeywell Aerospace CEO Tim Mahoney established connected aircraft as its own business and tapped her to lead it. Connectivity is in Honeywell's DNA: the company has been enabling cockpit satellite communications since the 1980s, and has a long history with radar and flight-planning services. The turning point for converting its connected-aircraft aspirations into a full-fledged business was when it gained theability to pair those traditional offerings with big-data mining and real-time information, Slyker says. The market also had to be ready for next-generation technologies.

Buzzwords like ""connected"" and ""digital"" tend to translate as ""overplayed"" and ""expensive"" to industrial investors bruised by General Electric Co.'s poorly executed foray into software. Honeywell has pitched its connected-aircraft business as a means to make its aerospace unit, the company's largest, less vulnerable to economic slumps. Demand for connectivity upgrades and software services isn't dictated by flight hours or gross domestic product to the same extent as new planepurchases and traditional repair work, Ben Driggs, president of services and connectivity at Honeywell Aerospace, said in an interview.The big question, as it was for GE, is whether this can be a new source of revenuefor Honeywellor if these investments are simply necessary to maintain its hold on high-margin maintenance work, says Scott Davis, CEO of Melius Research.

It's easy to understand the business model for Honeywell's JetWave equipment that enables reliable WiFi even over oceans. The company also sells access to that connection via adistribution agreement with satellite communications operator Inmarsat Plc.In an increasingly connected world, the ability to be plugged in and entertained at all times holds appeal for passengers -and for the airlines that can charge them for that service.The less tangible part of Honeywell's connected-aircraft push is the idea of using data harvested from plane parts to improve operations.United Technologies Corp.'s $30 billion takeover of avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc. is a bet that scale will help it get ahead in connected aircraft, but Honeywell is prioritizing quality over quantity.What works in Honeywell's favor,Davissays, is its bottom-up mindset.

The company starts with a known problem - like the delays passengers can face while an airline tracks down a fueling truck from the other end of the airport - and then tries to find a way to solve it via software and data analytics. In this case, it's Honeywell's GoDirect Ground software, which uses data scraped from fueling and baggage-sorting trucks to give operators better awareness of how their fleet is being used, allowing them to allocate vehicles more efficiently and improve turnaround times.(2) It sounds simplistic, but it's easy to spend a lot of money in software and wind up with offerings people aren't willing to pay for. ""I'm not going to build my infrastructure in the hope that I'm going to find a problem to solve,"" Slyker said.""I'm building my infrastructure to solve the problems I know exist.""

She has unique insight into what those problems are. Before coming to Honeywell, Slyker worked in programming andprogram management at Accenture with a focus on the oil and gas industry. She drew on that background at Honeywell as she transitioned from IT, working first with the team that decided what next-generation business jet technologies the company should invest in before eventually handlingplanning and controls for the commercial-aviation business's$1 billion annual research and development budget. She also spent about four years as vice president of commercial-customer operations for Honeywell's integrated supply-chain team, which is a fancy way of saying she had to manage cranky phone calls if deliveries didn't show up or quality issues arose. This isn't a job I envy, but it trained her to make customers' needs the starting point for decision-making.

That mentality is paying off. Swissport International, the world's largest ground-service provider, inked a deal this month to deploy GoDirect Ground across its operations.No financial terms were disclosed, but the 13% reduction in maintenance costs Swissport reported after applying Honeywell's service across five ground-handling stations earlier this year was enough to entice it to sign up for a bigger project.

The benefit of Honeywell's multi-faceted approach to connected aircraft is that it doesn't necessarily need to earn billions of dollars in revenue from predictive-maintenance software to be successful in this industry. In addition to satellite antennas, Honeywell also sells a little gray box it calls the Aircraft Data Gateway, which gives airlines a way to securely and wirelessly transfer information on and off a plane. It's what makes this whole idea of connected-aircraft and real-time information work, so you can see the appeal even for airlines thatmay prefer to build data-analytics capabilities in house. Honeywell's predictive-maintenance offerings should also allow the company to save costs on its own repair work: if you know something will break ahead of time, it tends to be a more minor (and less expensive) fix.

All of this math is made easier by the fact that Honeywell hasn't been throwing money around willy-nilly on software. Its connected-aircraft operations blossomed out of three acquisitionsand,true to Honeywell form, they were niche and reasonably priced. The company bought wireless-connectivity company EMS Technologies for $491 million in 2011 and then paid an undisclosed amount to acquire fuel efficiency software-maker Aviaso and in-flight airtime provider Satcom1 in 2015. Contrast that with GE's recent announcement that it will sell a majority stake in its ServiceMax field-technician software business to Silver Lake for seemingly a lot less than the $915 million it paid for it in 2017.

Connectivity is a squishy word that many companies abuse, but Slyker and Honeywell have a concrete approach to it that should pay off one way or another.

Two years back when theatre director Nimi Ravindran, 43, got a grant to teach theatre to students at a public school, she was confident her fluency in the local language, Kannada, would be enough to communicate with the students. Instead she found that all but one of 20 fifth graders at a Kannada-medium public school in Bengaluru's Marathahalli area spoke Bengali.

""Most of them said they were from West Bengal. I wondered what these children were doing so far from home,"" Ravindran said. As she started conducting workshops in Hindi, that the children were somewhat familiar with, their stories started flowing.

""They spoke about the trees near their homes, the spirits that lived in them and the clean air. They missed their home,"" Ravindran recalled.

The Sundarban delta--nearly one million hectare in area--is formed at the point where the rivers Ganga, Brahmaputra and Meghna merge into the Bay of Bengal. The delta is extremely fertile as the three rivers carry an estimated one billion tonnes of sediments.

Nearly 40% of Sundarban--the world's largest mangrove forest, three times as large as Goa--is in India, the rest is in neighbouring Bangladesh.

Sundarban (literally 'beautiful forest') features in the list of UNESCO's 209 natural heritage sites in the world for supporting ""an exceptional level of biodiversity in its terrestrial, marine and aquatic habitats"".

Over the last 40 years, Sundarban has lost 220 sq km--nearly the size of Kolkata--to the sea, according to Sugata Hazra, director of the School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University.

As rising sea levels engulf entire islands, residents are migrating en masse, from the Bangladesh as well as the Indian side of Sundarban.

Not all are environmental migrants, but with no documentation of this kind of migration, the numbers are hard to estimate.

But ripples of this migration are being felt over 2,000 km to the southwest. As many as 40% of students in some Kannada-medium government schools in Bengaluru speak Bengali, according to the Samridhdhi Trust that runs bridge schools to help these children cope.

IndiaSpend tracked some of these migrants from Sundarbans to the Kalihata slum in east Bengaluru's Marathahalli area. Studies show that several districts of West Bengal, not just in Sundarban but across the state, are extremely vulnerable to the impact of climate change.

By 2060, nearly 1.4 billion people across the world will be at risk of becoming environmental migrants, some internal and others flocking across borders. The annual rate of sea level rise is expected to triple by the year 2100, making agriculture as well as everyday life in low-lying places, like Sundarban, unsustainable.

This is the third story in our series on how climate change is disrupting people's lives (you can read the first story here and the second here). The series combines ground reporting from India's climate change hotspots with the latest scientific research, and highlights how people are adapting to the changing climate.

The Sundarban delta, home to the world's largest mangrove forest, is at risk from rising sea levels because of global warming.

One in 10 individuals living in a low-lying coastal area on this planet is in India. Along with China, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam, India has the highest population that will be exposed to the impact of flooding and extreme weather events that the rising sea will bring, according to a 2015 study.

Human activities have already caused global warming by 1 degree Celsius, according to the September 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world body for assessing science related to climate change. Governments of 195 countries are on this panel.

""Over 90% of the heat trapped in the climate system is actually in the oceans. As the oceans warm, just like liquid in a thermometer, it expands and (the) sea level rises,"" said John Church, research scientist and one of the lead authors for the chapter on sea level rise in the IPCC's fifth assessment report.

Melting of non-polar ice, like that in the Himalayas, the thermal expansion of oceans as they warm, and the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are pushing up global sea levels.

""With unmitigated emissions the sea level rise could be as much as one metre by 2100,"" Church said. If the entire ice sheet over Greenland were to melt, that alone would cause global sea levels to rise by seven metres. If all the ice sheets in Antarctica melt, it could push the levels up by another 55 m.

A video by the European Space Agency (ESA) explaining what contributes to sea-level rise.

Sea levels will continue to rise not just through the century but well past 2100. For people living on small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas, this means, at best, that more salt water from the sea will enter their fields making the soil unsuitable for agriculture, there will be increased flooding, frequent cyclones and infrastructure damage. At worst, it means the piece of land they call home would be under water.

Scanty research on the India side of Sundarban

The changing climate in the Bangladesh side of Sundarban is well documented but not much is known about the Indian side, according to Selvin Pitchaikani, an oceanographer at the Institute of Environmental Studies and Wetland Management (IESWM) in Kolkata.

Pitchaikani, who published his data on the changing weather patterns in Sundarban in 2017, found that the land is increasingly growing saline and that cyclonic storms have become frequent. Rainfall patterns have already changed, making conventional cultivation difficult for farmers, his research found.

But ""to come to any conclusion, we need data for a minimum of 20-25 years. We need more weather stations in the region as well as funding"", he said emphasising the need for more research.

With migration, children grow up without a parent, fewer people to care for the elderly

It's a four-hour car ride from Kolkata to the Sundarban delta region. Once here, a car becomes useless. To reach the island of Mousuni, it's another hour-long journey of switching between electricity-powered rickshaws while on small stretches of land, and small boats to cross the streams.

Electricity reached Mousuni--one of the larger islands in the delta with a population of over 25,000--a year ago, trailing climate change by decades.

Mousuni is an island in the Sundarban delta with a population of over 25,000 residents. Frequent floods and the rising sea level have forced many to migrate from Mousuni.

Sheikh Sufi, 27, grew up in Mousuni. His home is on the coast overlooking the Bay of Bengal. ""We used to grow rice and chillies but a decade back there was severe flooding. After that the crops haven't grown,"" Sufi said, holding his three-year-old son Abdul Rehman over his shoulder. Once their land became infertile due to salt water, they learnt to fish. Now, six months a year, Sufi travels over 2,000 km to Kerala to work as a construction worker earning about Rs 300 a day.

Like Sufi, nearly 96% of these environmental migrants are headed to other areas within India, according to a study of 1,315 households in the region. The study was conducted by Deltas, Vulnerability & Climate Change: Migration and Adaptation (DECCMA), a consortium of researchers from universities in UK, Ghana, Bangladesh and India.

Of these migrants, 83% are men and 17% women. Most are young; between the ages 21 and 30. The men interviewed for the study said they were moving for employment opportunities as agriculture was unsustainable. The women were moving to either join their husbands post marriage or to live with other family members.

Left behind are the elderly, children and most women.

""There are two types of migrations--proactive, who plan their retreat from the coast in advance and reactive, who move only when there is no other alternative left. In Sundarban we are still witnessing reactive migration,"" said Indrila Guha, principal at Basanti Devi College, Kolkata and a researcher in environmental economics.

Children growing up without a parent, fewer people to care for the elderly, and poor women who could become easy targets for traffickers, are some of the potential fallouts of this situation, according to Guha.

For the ones who move with their families in tow, life continues to remain tough. The children in Bengaluru's bridge schools struggle to adjust to life in the city, the language barrier making it even more challenging for them to adjust. Parents frequently move in search of jobs and education is one of the first casualties.

Residents adapt to rising seas

As the onslaught of the sea continued, Sufi's home was reduced to rubble. During high tide, the sea waves wash away chunks of his house. On a low tide day, like the one when IndiaSpend visited, his home provides a view of the sea that tourists scout the globe for.

Sufi, his wife and young son live with a neighbour. ""We have no money to build another home. Where can we go?"" he said, with eyes downcast.

Sheikh Sufi, 27, outside his destroyed home in Mousuni. Sufi works as a construction worker over 2,000 km away in Kerala for six months in a year.

""We have no policies directed at rehabilitation and resettlement of people who have lost their land due to sea level rise and coastal erosion,"" said Hazra, of Jadavpur University.

Rainfall is usually heavy, and severe cyclonic storms frequent. This area receives 1,501-2,500 mm of rainfall, compared to the Indian average of 801-1,500 mm.

Those who haven't migrated try to adapt. Shabir Sheikh, 27 and Khushbanoo Bibi, 25, married for 12 years, are constructing a new home for themselves and their three children, on higher ground.

""During floods, the stove gets wet and so we are making sure in the new home it will be higher so flood waters don't reach it,"" Khushbanoo said. Most women here cook in the open, on mud stoves and firewood, which makes it impossible to cook during the floods.

Shabir Sheikh and his wife Khushbanoo Bibi's new home is being built at a higher level to keep flood waters at bay.

The government is helping by building embankments along the coast to stem the flood waters, and flood shelters to accommodate those affected by floods. There are no long-term policies to help relocate and rehabilitate residents.

Double burden of rehabilitation and poor health in Sundarban

Globally, of the regions in the low lying coastal areas at the risk of flooding, most are underdeveloped or developing.

Nearly a third of the children under the age of five in South-24 Parganas, the district where Mousuni is, are stunted--short for their age. Half of the households still lack modern sanitation facilities and as many six in every 10 women are anaemic. Yet, the district is now having to prioritise infrastructure to deal with climate change.

Depending on the material used to build the embankment, a one-km long section could cost as much as Rs 1 crore. As seas rise, locals plead for the government to build more walls even as they are aware that these are just short term measures against climate change.

Threat to biodiversity

More than 200 species of plants, 400 species of fishes and 300 species of birds, numerous phytoplankton, fungi, bacteria, zooplankton, reptiles, amphibians and more call Sundarban their home. Even within Sundarban, species differ depending on the salinity of the soil. Sundarban is also home to many threatened and endangered animals like the Royal Bengal tiger, estuarine crocodile and the Indian python.

The changing temperature of water and increased salinity and acidity in the soil has already impacted the region's biodiversity, according to studies by the Marine Science Department of Calcutta University and the Department of Biological Science of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Kolkata.

While the rising sea level impacts biodiversity, experts also blame human activity. ""If, for instance, there were no obstructions on the major rivers and flows were not diverted, eroded material would have reached the delta,"" said Anurag Danda, senior advisor for Climate Change Adaptation at the World Wildlife Fund.

""Between the Tehri dam (Uttarakhand) and Farraka barrage (Murshidabad, West Bengal), there are at least 1,000 interventions along the Ganges that either divert water or hold water resulting in much reduced sediment delivery,"" he explained.

Problems for nature and man will continue to grow as sea levels continue to rise, scientists say. ""The question would be not whether it would happen but how quickly it would happen,"" Church, co-author of the latest IPCC report, said.

What is the way out for those living along the coastline? Planned retreat to safer places, aided by the government, is the main option, Hazra said. ""It will be economically beneficial as a whole rather than keeping people there and rebuilding embankments."""

He returned to China.

Minnesota prosecutors said Friday that Chinese billionaire Richard Liu will not face charges after a woman accused him of rape while he was attending a University business program in August.

Liu, the founder of the Beijing-based e-commerce site JD.com, was arrested Aug. 31 on suspicion of felony rape and released within hours. He returned to China.

Prosecutors said that ""profound evidentiary problems"" would have made it ""highly unlikely"" that any charge could have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

In a statement, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that as prosecutors reviewed surveillance video, text messages, police body camera video and witness statements, ""it became clear that we could not meet our burden of proof and, therefore, we could not bring charges.""

Liu was in Minneapolis for a weeklong residency as part of the University of Minnesota's doctor of business administration China program. The four-year program in the university's management school is geared toward high-level executives in China and is a partnership with Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management.

Liu's attorneys have said he is innocent. JD.com has said Liu was falsely accused.

Liu, known in Chinese as Liu Qiangdong, is a prominent member of the Chinese tech elite, with a fortune of $7.5 billion. He is part of a generation of entrepreneurs who have created China's internet, e-commerce, mobile phone and other technology industries since the late 1990s. The son of peasants, Liu built a Beijing electronics shop into JD.com, China's biggest online direct retailer, selling everything from clothes to toys to fresh vegetables.

He has continued to lead the company since his arrest.

On the night of the alleged attack, Liu and other executives went to Origami, a Japanese restaurant in Minneapolis. The alleged victim, a Chinese citizen who is studying at the University of Minnesota on a student visa, went to the dinner as a volunteer and, her attorney Wil Florin said, felt coerced to drink as the powerful men toasted her.

Text messages reviewed by The Associated Press and portions of the woman's interviews with police show the woman claims Liu dragged her into a vehicle and made advances, despite her protests. The woman texted a friend: ""I begged him don't. But he didn't listen."" She said he raped her at her apartment.

The alleged victim has not been publicly identified. She is still enrolled at the university, Florin said.

Liu had recently tried to distance himself from sexual assault allegations against a guest at a 2015 party at his penthouse in Australia. Liu was not charged or accused of wrongdoing, but Australian media reported he tried unsuccessfully to get a court to prevent the release of his name in that case. The guest was convicted and sentenced to prison in October."

While the GST Council is expected to cut tax rates on some commodities, most notably cement, during Saturday's meeting, tax analysts do not expect a large number of rate cuts to take place. They do, however, expect greater clarity to do with the GST annual return form, around which there has been a lot of confusion.

However, there are not likely to be a large number of rate cuts as industry expected following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement on Tuesday saying that 99% of the items would be brought into the 18% or below rate slabs.

The government has now called for a public hearing on January 2 on its proposal to make Veda Nilayam a memorial for the late AIADMK leader.

In his report, A Enoch, assistant professor of department of social work at the Madras School of Social Works -- the agency appointed for the SIA -- concurred with the government's decision to convert the late chief minister's residence into a memorial.

""The project is within the ambit of the government order because only the former CM's residence can be converted into her memorial. Our assessment has found that there will be no social impact due to it,"" the report displayed publicly at the Chennai district collectorate said.

The SIA has further said social impact management was not required as nobody resides at the place currently. ""No property would be affected due to acquisition of 'Veda Nilayam' as it is the only property that will be taken over for the purpose. A total of 10 grounds is needed for the project,"" the report added.

The report was submitted to the government after a SIA was conducted on December 8, where residents of Poes Garden opposed the move.

The Indian Music Industry (IMI) certified platinum-selling singer/songwriter, who was in Hyderabad for an award function recently, says she looks forward to visiting the region because it strengthens the bond she shares with her fans here. ""South India and in particular, Hyderabad holds a special place in my heart because I have a huge fan base here. Every visit helps me connect better with my fans and vice versa,"" says the daughter of industrialist, Kumar Mangalam Birla. In a chat with Hyderabad Times, Ananya opens up about her music, business ventures, family bonding and more. Excerpts:

'I will be releasing my new single and an EP in early 2019'

Ananya is waiting for 2019 with bated breath as she will be releasing her latest single in January. Speaking about the song, she says it will be about the 'real people' in her life. ""This year, I have learned a lot about who my true friends are. I have also tried to acknowledge things that people did to help me rise. So, the upcoming song is all about these 'real people' in my life,"" says the English electro-pop artist.

Previously, Ananya has released a string of hits such as Meant To Be, Livin' the Life and Hold On among others, and the upcoming release will be her fifth single. ""The single is not the only thing that's keeping me excited about 2019 as I also have an EP scheduled for release in March. It will have five songs and will feature Jamaican-American rapper/producer Sean Kingston along with two Nigerian rappers and some Indian talents as well. In fact, I will be flying straight to Los Angles from Hyderabad to meet Sean,"" says the 24-year-old Circles hitmaker.

'I grew up in a household where music had a constant presence'

The sixth generation entrepreneur of the Birla clan, Ananya says music has always been a huge part of her family. ""My father sings very well and I grew up seeing my mother play the santoor. I too learnt the instrument before shifting to the guitar and piano,"" she says, adding that she was a regular in singing competitions during her school days. ""I was part of my school band and also did a lot of gigs while pursuing graduation in Economics and Management from Oxford University before dropping out. I wrote my first song called Spectator when I was 11,"" says the singer who opened for pop-rock giants Coldplay when the latter performed at the Global Citizen Concert in Mumbai in 2016.

Many may not know but the pretty lady has also written a song about her mother, while every song she writes is special to her, Ananya admits that some are so personal that she doesn't feel like sharing it with the world. ""Unstoppable is a song that I wrote about my mom. I even recorded it, but haven't released it yet. Sometimes we don't need the whole world to know certain emotions that are extremely close to our hearts and maybe that's why I do not want to release it.""

'I am currently focusing completely on music'

Other than music, it's start-ups and philanthropy that are keeping Ananya busy. Born in one of the leading business families of the country, entrepreneurship comes naturally to Ananya and when she is not strumming the guitar or scribbling the lyrics of a new song, Ananya heads a microfinance venture and a foundation for mental health. ""I started my professional journey as an entrepreneur first and then got into music. I turned an entrepreneur when I was 17 and floated a microfinance venture, which is still very much a part of my life,"" she says, adding that she thrives on both business and music.

Karuppannan said here on Friday.

""An attempt is being to create an impression that all plastic products are being banned. This is not true. Only 20% of them are covered under the ban, which is to come into effect in the State from January 1,"" Mr. Karuppannan said.

He was speaking at a regional-level awareness meet on 'Plastic Pollution Free Tamil Nadu' here.

Just about 14 products, including plastic bags, cups, non-women carry bags and plates, are covered under the ban. ""We are also taking steps to promote alternatives to the banned products. When such eco-friendly alternatives come into widespread use, it will also benefit the farming community,"" he observed.

The State government has announced the ban on use-and-throw plastics only after extensive consultations and thought.

""We have been pressing for such a ban for two years now. The Chief Minister initially wanted to give about a year's time before implementing the ban, but subsequently agreed for a six-month deadline,"" he said.

The State has been divided into six zones, and IAS officers have been appointed to review the sensitisation measures being taken up among the people. Usually, there will be some resistance to such new regulations. But the decision has evoked good response from various sections of society. Besides, government departments have already started implementation.

Stating that the move was necessary to protect land, especially agricultural land, from pollution, he said the State government had taken stringent measures to protect land, air and water.

Solid waste management also was posing a challenge to the authorities, as dumping of waste too polluted land. ""Our next focus will be on tackling this problem. We are examining the feasibility of generating power from solid waste and it would be adopted across the State,"" he said and called upon government officers and stakeholders to extend their full cooperation for successful implementation of the use and throw plastics.

Minister for Tourism, 'Vellamandi' N. Natarajan, and Minister for Backward Classes and Minorities Welfare, S. Valarmathi, emphasised the need for effective implementation of the ban and favoured the use of traditional and organic alternatives.

Collectors S.Suresh Kumar (Nagapattinam), V.Santha (Perambalur), A.Annadurai (Thanjavur) M.Vijayalakshmi (Ariyalur) and L.Nirmal Raj (Tiruvarur) and S. Amuthavalli, City Engineer, Tiruchi Corporation, explained the steps being taken for implementing the ban.

While eight people were injured due to injuries sustained in the stampede-like situation during a concert at Mithibai College on Thursday, it is being alleged that some who had tried to barge into the venue had fake passes. While parents of the injured students insist that the passes were genuine, college authorities say they will have to be come up with ways to ensure fake passes are easily identifiable.

David Bhangera who is one of the students admitted to Cooper hospital after the stampede like situation, is just 16 years old and was not supposed to be anywhere near the event, which is exclusively for college students. David, who is a class X student from an Andheri school, is critical after suffering a rib-fracture and is undergoing treatment at the SICU in the Vile Parle hospital. Nikhil Pawar, Kunal Chavan and Hitesh Kamble are three others who are still undergoing treatment at the Cooper hospital, but are stable.

'Wards had passes'

All of them were admitted to Cooper Hospital after the unfortunate incident. Popular rapper Divine was performing at Mithibai College at the Colosseum festival organised by the Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) section. Families of the injured youngsters have alleged that their wards had passes. But it seems none of them were aware if their children had legitimate passes.

David is scheduled to appear for his SSC examination beginning from March 1. But now his family is worried if he will recover in time. ""His friends who are collegians apparently had tickets to the event. But they were stopped at the gate and told that the passes were fake. Following the chaos, David bent down to pick up his sandal that had slipped off and then started to run, and that is when people stamped on him,"" said Premala Bhangera, David's mother.

'Not students' fault'

Shivani Pawar, mother of Nikhil, a class XI student of GPM College in Andheri said, ""My son had the pass with him even when he was brought to hospital. He also had a wrist band of the same festival. Why were so many passes given out if there was not enough space? More so, why were students from other colleges invited to the event if the place was enough to only accommodate their own students?"" Kunal Chavan's mother, Pooja said, ""The organisers said the passes our kids had were not appropriate. How is it the students' fault? The organisers should have ensured that fake passes were not circulated.""

'Will take precautions'

Dr Rajpal Hande, principal of the Mithibai College, when asked about the parents' allegation of fake passes, said, ""We have to learn a lesson from this and take extra precautions when it comes to passes, such as having a hologram on them, so it will be very easy to differentiate between right and wrong passes.

""Such young children were not expected to be there as the festival is for degree college students. This specific performer who was born and brought up in J B Nagar has a huge fan-following in his locality. He had posted on his social media accounts that he would be performing at Mithibai College, which is why we saw the general public from that area come. The incident was certainly unfortunate, but we were caught unaware with so many people trying to get in, and there was a bit of chaos."""

The youngster, whose kidnapping plan was busted by cops on Thursday, wanted to pay a few lakhs to a man who had promised him a job with a high salary on an international cruise ship.

It is learnt Gaurav, whose father Pradeep is a teacher at a school at Wanadongri, had roped in his two friends Raju Harde and Sagar Bagga for executing the plan promising to divide the money among the three. Bagga is already in police net facing charges of kidnapping for ransom and extortion. The MIDC cops are also interrogating Gaurav.

Police said Gaurav had wanted to make his career in aviation and tourism industries. He has done some course too. Gaurav further wanted to pursue cruise management as career. He had spent considerable time in Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad to pursue his dream of going on a cruise ship as it's crew, said police.

Gaurav left home on Thursday on his scooter. Around 1 pm a call was made to his father Pradeep's cellphone by Bagga and Harde asking him to cough up Rs 20 lakh or be ready to receive parcel of his son's body parts. The call was made from Gaurav's cellphone. Bagga, nabbed from his home at Bhamti, already has a crime against him at RP Nagar police station. Harde belongs to a farmer's family. Police are yet to come across Harde's criminal records.

Gaurav's father Pradeep rushed to MIDC police station on receiving the first call. The mobile phone was then found switched off. Cops had first traced the tower location of the call to Gondkhairi. The caller had asked Pradeep to come in a 'car keeping the door open' and 'also not to approach cops'.

The so-called kidnappers had asked Pradeep to come with cash near Chhatrapati square. They then asked him to meet them at Santra market and then at railway police station. Pradeep had cops accompanying him in another vehicle. Police said Gaurav sensed something was wrong and reached a security guard's cabin at the railway station. Faking illness, he asked the guard to call up his father on cellphone to inform him. Talking to his father on the guard's cellphone, Gaurav said he was having a hazy vision and feeling giddy.

Pradeep and MIDC police under senior PI Bharat Kshirsagar reached the place and rushed Gaurav to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) for medical examination but nothing was diagnosed. Gaurav was brought to police station for questioning. He initially claimed to have been taken towards Hingna in a car.

PI Kshirsagar said Gaurav spilled the beans during sustained questioning and admitted he was sitting at Tekdi Ganesh temple near railway station while Bagga and Harde had been calling up his father for ransom. ""Bagga claimed Gaurav too was present with him and Harde when the calls were made and they were changing locations to evade arrest,"" said Kshirsagar.

Harde is yet to be arrested and Gaurav's cellphone, used for demanding ransom, is yet to be recovered."

Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman said there were ""profound evidentiary problems which would have made it highly unlikely that any criminal charge could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.""

In a statement, Freeman said that after an investigation by Minneapolis police and a review by four senior sexual assault prosecutors, it was clear his office could not meet its burden of proof, and therefore could not bring charges.

""Because we do not want to re-victimize the young woman, we will not be going into detail,"" Freeman said.

Liu, a 45-year-old billionaire who maintains tight control of JD.com, was released without charge about 17 hours after he was arrested on Aug. 31 and quickly returned to China, where he has continued to run the company. His representatives have maintained his innocence after the woman from China studying at the University of Minnesota accused him of rape.

JD.com shares extended gains on Friday and were up 5.8 percent after news spread of the decision not to prosecute.

The case had attracted extreme interest in China.

Liu, also known as Liu Qiangdong, grew JD.com from a humble electronics stall to an e-commerce giant with 2017 net revenue of $55.7 billion, partnering with Alphabet Inc's , Google, Walmart Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK>.

The decision not to bring charges was a big relief for Liu, who could have faced as many as 30 years in prison under Minnesota law if convicted of first-degree criminal sexual misconduct.

On Friday, Freeman said the three months it took his office to review Lui's case was not unusual for a sexual assault investigation, especially one in which no one was in custody.

""It had nothing to do with Liu's status as a wealthy, foreign businessman,"" Freeman said in his statement.

Reuters previously reported details of what happened while Liu was in Minneapolis, including a description of the alleged rape and events around it given by the now-22-year-old student.

Usually based in Beijing, Liu made the U.S. trip for a weeklong residency programme at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management, which runs a doctor of business administration programme with China's elite Tsinghua University.

The University of Minnesota said it had no comment on Friday's announcement by authorities.

The decision to not prosecute followed criticism of Minneapolis authorities, including Freeman's office, for what some see as a failure to pursue sexual assault cases adequately.

A recent investigation by the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper found that only one in four sexual assault cases in Minnesota is ever referred to a county attorney, and that prosecutors reject half the cases police send them. In August, Freeman called the series ""a good wake-up call"" and pledged to strengthen sexual assault investigations.

Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman said there were ""profound evidentiary problems which would have made it highly unlikely that any criminal charge could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.""

In a statement, Freeman said that after an investigation by Minneapolis police and a review by four senior sexual assault prosecutors, it was clear his office could not meet its burden of proof, and therefore could not bring charges.

""Because we do not want to re-victimize the young woman, we will not be going into detail,"" Freeman said.

Liu, a 45-year-old billionaire who maintains tight control of JD.com, was released without charge about 17 hours after he was arrested on Aug. 31 and quickly returned to China, where he has continued to run the company. His representatives have maintained his innocence after the woman from China studying at the University of Minnesota accused him of rape.

The decision not to bring charges was a big relief for Liu, who could have faced as many as 30 years in prison under Minnesota law if convicted of first-degree criminal sexual misconduct.

On Friday, Freeman said the three months it took his office to review Lui's case was not unusual for a sexual assault investigation, especially one in which no one was in custody.

""It had nothing to do with Liu's status as a wealthy, foreign businessman,"" Freeman said in his statement.

Reuters previously reported details of what happened while Liu was in Minneapolis, including a description of the alleged rape and events around it given by the now-22-year-old student.

Usually based in Beijing, Liu made the U.S. trip for a weeklong residency programme at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management, which runs a doctor of business administration programme with China's elite Tsinghua University.

The University of Minnesota said it had no comment on Friday's announcement by authorities.

The decision to not prosecute followed criticism of Minneapolis authorities, including Freeman's office, for what some see as a failure to pursue sexual assault cases adequately.

A recent investigation by the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper found that only one in four sexual assault cases in Minnesota is ever referred to a county attorney, and that prosecutors reject half the cases police send them. In August, Freeman called the series ""a good wake-up call"" and pledged to strengthen sexual assault investigations.

Mr. Ansari, who had run away to Pakistan in 2012 to allegedly meet a female friend that he met on Facebook and was later arrested, reached his house on Thursday after spending six years behind bars in Pakistan. His building in Versova, despite efforts of his family to keep their celebrations low key, wore a look of jubilation and euphoria on Friday. While neighbours and relatives kept pouring in to meet him, Mr. Ansari spent most of the day gazing out of the window.

""When I left Mumbai, Samsung Galaxy S2 was a fad and roads were open and wide. The city is changing,"" he said in an exclusive interaction with The Hindu on Friday evening.

Now 33 years old, Mr. Ansari expressed regret at his decision six years ago and said he wants to bury all the unpleasant memories. ""I really regret having left everything behind and running there. I regretted that even when I was in Pakistan. I should have given it another thought. While on social media, we often forget that we do not know much about the person on the other end. Right from the beginning, one should be cautious of who they are interacting with,"" he said.

About his dark days in Pakistan, Mr. Ansari said happy memories from his childhood became his strength.

""I do not know why or in what context they occurred, but there was not a week when I did not have dreams of my school and friends from there. In isolation, miles away from the city, these dreams kept me going in every sense of the word,"" he said.

However, Mr. Ansari said he has no hatred whatsoever. ""We cannot ignore the fact that humanity is alive there also. Those who helped me, showered their kindness, fought for me while I was behind bars, were all Pakistanis. We all talk about treatment given there by the agencies, but they were doing their job. They stopped when they realised the truth,"" Mr. Ansari said.

He said, ""Instead of scratching old wounds and harbouring hatred, it is better to slowly let them go. I am back home, but there are many who need to be repatriated too. My brothers and sisters are there. I know what they are going through and the pain of their families.""

Back in Mumbai, Mr. Ansari now has one goal: to find a job and resume from where he had left his career six years ago. While settling in life continues to be his priority, nothing, he said, is more important than finding a job. ""My family has done a lot for me. I now want them to sit back and relax and let me do my best for them.""

An avid learner, Mr. Ansari was working as a teacher with a hotel management institute in Mumbai, and wishes to go back to the profession. ""The crucial period of my career building has gone by in jail, but I will not lose hope. It was hope that kept me going in Pakistan; I will ensure that that hope never ever perishes,"" he said."

The Indian School of Business (ISB) is gearing up to launch a specially designed programme for women independent directors to coach them in both business and non-business related matters.

""We want to contribute to diversity in business management and workplace by encouraging women leaders. A core group of experts will work on designing a special programme for women directors so that they can be independent and empowered,'' Rajendra Srivastava, Dean, ISB told BusinessLine.

Asked how women directors are different from their male counterparts in boardrooms, Srivastava said that there are certain gender-related issues and constraints for women directors such as higher stress in voicing opposition.

In addition to financial analytics and business concepts, ISB will teach them how to cope with stress and how to ignore the glass ceiling, according to Srivastava.

While he still holds cards close to its chest about the specifics of the programme, there are many issues that women face.

As per the recent estimates of the Women on Corporate Boards (WCB) Mentorship programme and the Institutional Investor Advisory Services, the average tenure on company boards for women is 4.6 years against 9 years for men among the Nifty 500 companies.

The findings of a November study, Corporate governance and risk transfer: A survey on perceptions of women leaders in the National Capital Region, by the BIMTECH and Raheja QBE General Insurance Company Ltd are also worth noting.

The survey of 650 corporate leaders finds that most of the women leaders faced 'Trust Deficit' from colleagues. Gender stereotypes, stress related to pregnancy and other biological functions also figured prominently.

Srivastava said that ""The proposed course is also a part of initiatives to step up focus on women in various ways. We will also increase intake of women candidates progressively in our programmes.''

As of now, ISB has 35 per cent women candidates in its post-graduate programme."

Photograph: Manchester United/Twitter

Manchester United's caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said, on Thursday, that he wanted to 'get the players enjoying their football' after he returned to Old Trafford following the sacking of Jose Mourinho.

United have turned to their former Norway international striker Solskjaer on a deal until the end of the season to inject some life into what has been a fraught campaign.

The club parted company with Mourinho, on Tuesday, with the club in sixth spot in the Premier League having made their worst start to a season for 28 years, culminating in a limp 3-1 loss to bitter rivals Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday.

Mourinho's final few months in charge were dominated by media reports of his falling out with the club's 90 million pounds ($114 million) France midfielder Paul Pogba while his side laboured on the pitch playing dull defensive football.

Solskjaer, who as a player was part of United's era of dominance under Alex Ferguson and scored the goal that secured an unprecedented treble almost 20 years ago, wants to return a feel-good factor to their under-performing squad.

""I am just going to be myself... get the players enjoying their football and looking forward to seeing the supporters again,"" Solskjaer, 45, told MUTV on Thursday in his first interview as caretaker boss.

""We are in a results business and we want to win games and that is my job. We just want to see them play the football they can.""

Solskjaer, who has left his role as manager of Norwegian club Molde, said the busy upcoming schedule of matches would give all of his squad a chance to impress him.

Their game on Saturday at Cardiff City, where Solskjaer was briefly manager in 2014, begins a run of five in 15 days.

""The amount of games coming up is no problem because we've got an amazing squad, we've got 23-24 players,"" Solskjaer said.

""They are all quality and they'll all get a chance now with the amount of games coming up. They've got a chance to show they are Man United players.""

Solskjaer's place in United's folklore means he is likely to receive a rapturous welcome when they play their next home match against Huddersfield Town on Dec. 26.

The Norwegian, who was the hero on one of the club's most famous nights when got the winner in stoppage time as United completed a 2-1 comeback triumph over Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final, said he would relish his time in charge.

""As a player I gave everything I have and now walking out and leading this team and being part of this team. Playing for pride, history, it will be very special.""

Chelsea's Sarri says Premier League will miss Mourinho

Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri said the Premier League will miss sacked Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho and hopes that the Portuguese can return to management in England again.

United dismissed Mourinho on Tuesday after suffering their worst start to a league season for 28 years and replaced him with former striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer until the end of the current campaign.

Asked ahead of Saturday's home league clash with Leicester City if the former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Inter Milan boss would be missed, Sarri said: ""I think so. Mourinho won everything, won everywhere so I like him very much as a coach and as a man.""

Mourinho said a day after his sacking that United had a future without him, just as he did without them, and Sarri backed the 55-year-old to make a swift return to the dugout.

""I think he's right when he said that United have a future without Mourinho, but he has a great future without them. I'd like to see him on the bench as soon as possible. Maybe in England... not here.""

Sarri said Solskjaer could expect a tough job as he attempts to steady the ship at United and get the team firing on all cylinders again.

""I remember him as a player. He was a good player. But I don't know him as a coach. Of course, the job will be difficult,"" Sarri added.

Former Napoli boss Sarri has enjoyed an encouraging start to his first season as Chelsea manager despite enduring a few bumps along the way.

Chelsea sit fourth in the table with 37 points from 17 games but Sarri ruled them out as title contenders along with leaders Liverpool and second-placed Manchester City.

""I've never seen Chelsea like a contender for the title. I always said that at the moment there are two teams a step ahead of us.""

World Cup winners France organised yet unexciting, says Xavi

Former Spain and Barcelona midfielder Xavi has said France's World Cup triumph this year left him feeling ""unenthusiastic"" due to their style of play.

Didier Deschamps' side, containing the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann and Paul Pogba, beat Croatia 4-2 in an action-packed final in Moscow after beating Argentina 4-3 in the tournament's stand-out game in the last 16.

They also saw off Uruguay and Belgium on their way to the final.

Yet their performances left Xavi, one of the heroes of Spain's 2010 World Cup win and a four-times Champions League winner with Barca, unimpressed.

""All France say to me is that they are the champions,"" Xavi said in an interview with Spanish newspaper Marca published on Friday.

""They are an organised team, not very exciting, but they have a lot of qualities. They work hard, they counterattack like rockets, you have Griezmann and Mbappe running back to defend. That's fine, but it doesn't make me feel enthusiastic.""

Xavi, who is seeing out his career in Qatar with Al Sadd and has said repeatedly he intends to become a coach when he retires from playing, also criticised the short-term attitudes of coaches at World Cups.

""In a World Cup coaches are more practical because they are scared of being knocked out. You make one error, and 'ciao',"" he added.

""I'm of a different school of thought, believing you should always try to have the ball and take risks but 70-80 percent of teams in a World Cup don't take risks and they wait for a chance to score. It's a shame. The result is what justifies the means and convinces fans, but it doesn't convince me."""

Ambati Rayudu's sudden retirement from first-class cricket before the start of the Ranji season would leave him short of match practice ahead of twin ODI series against Australia and New Zealand but the Hyderabad cricketer is unfazed.

Rayudu plays only one format for India and his decision to quit Ranji Trophy and play ODIs and Indian Premier League raised a few eyebrows but the Hyderabad right-hander called it his method of managing the workload.

""I mean...the only thought process was to preserve my body as far as possible. I am 33. I have had surgery to my knee in the past. I really wanted to make efficient use of my body in terms of the amount of cricket I play,"" Rayudu said on the sidelines of launch of the Junior Super Kings inter-school T20 championship 2018.

When asked that his decision would lead to reduced match practice now that he will get into the Australia series having not played a single match for two months, Rayudu couldn't come up with a convincing reply.

""No, I mean definitely match practice is important. Anyway red ball cricket and white ball cricket there is a huge amount of difference. You can compensate by practising and playing other games,"" he said.

However he didn't elaborate the 'other game' part as Mushtaq Ali Trophy (T20) will happen only after he finishes ODI legs of Australia and New Zealand.

While skipper Virat Kohli has made it clear that the team management is looking at Rayudu as a No 4 option going into the World Cup, the player himself doesn't have any choices or preferences.

""I am basically not looking at any number as such. I am preparing for the series coming up in Australia. I am not really thinking too far beyond. As far as my training is concerned, I just look at my game and look at where I can improve and go about it,"" Rayudu said.

Asked how challenging it was preparing for the ODI series in Australia, the Hyderabad cricketer said preparations were going on well for the tour.

""International cricket in itself is a challenge... so, all I can say is that I am preparing for the upcoming series in Australia the way I should. All I can say is I am preparing well..,"" he added.

Rayudu, who returned to the national team after a good run for title winners Chennai Super Kings in the IPL last year during which he scored over 600 runs, said he Mahendra Singh Dhoni trusted him and he wanted to repay the faith in him and was happy to make most of the opportunities.

""Definitely... Dhoni bhai trusted me and I always wanted to repay the faith he had in me. I worked on my game and I am happy that I could make most of the opportunities I got,"" he added.

Asked if playing aggressively helped turn things around during his stint for CSK, he said as he got backing from the people the job became easier.

""I mean playing aggressively and playing aggressively with confidence is an entirely different thing. Whenever you have the belief, you can go out there and express yourself. Once people back you, the job becomes easier.

Meanwhile, medium-pacer Mohit Sharma, who was picked by CSK in the December 18 auction for Rs 5 crore said he was delighted to be back at the franchise and added ""it is always good to return home.""

""Always feels good to be back. Like you go to office and return home every day, it is good to return to CSK. The bond and the culture that CSK has developed, you don't get it so easily anywhere else. It's a family atmosphere.

""It's not just in the players, you see it in the staff, and in the fans, those who support Chennai. I played elsewhere for 3 years, but this was always said about me - ""Mohit Sharma, CSK player"". I love that, the feeling is really good,"" he added.

Sharma, who played for Kings XI Punjab last year in the IPL, said his aim was to do well for CSK adding he was not thinking about returning to the national side.

""My aim is to do well for CSK. To be honest I am not thinking that much about return to national side. I will keep trying to do my best for CSK,"" he added.

Asked if he was expecting CSK to bid for him again, that too for such a big price, he said, ""If I say I was not missing CSK, I would be lying big time! Yes, I have missed CSK a lot. I have missed being part of CSK - even when I played elsewhere for 3 years, I used to think it would have been better for me to have been playing at CSK. The environment creates a lot of difference.

""No doubt, the MS Dhoni factor is always there. How well he understands you, how he handles you, that matters a lot,"" he added."

It's necessary to practise what you preach. And, it's just as important to preach what you practise, especially where sustainable living is concerned. For, there is an element of resistance in almost all of us to it. We would rather take the line of least resistance, settling for the convenient, than act keeping in mind, the interests of future generations.

Four city residents seem to have grasped this truth, instinctively, and they have been zealously promoting the eco-friendly practices that have done wonders for their immediate neighbourhoods. The four -- Sumitra Srikanth, Ganga Sridhar, K.L. Bala and C.R. Ashok -- have chosen school students as the target group. After all, it is these children who will lead out planet into the future.

The four have been making a difference, individually in their neck of the woods, and their paths have crossed due to their engagement with many sustainability groups, which include Solid Waste Management - People's Forum and Kapaleecharam.

In this new volunteering work, the four would like to be identified as EcoKonnectors. At present, they are guiding students of five schools -- P.S. Senior Secondary School, Chettinad Harishree Vidyalayam, Vidya Mandir, Chennai Corporation Public School and Vana Vani Matriculation Higher Secondary School (which is situated on the campus of IIT-Madras). They want to engage with more schools across Chennai.

""Ours is team work. We chart out a plan, approach schools and create awareness. Having nature and eco clubs in schools is a great way to get started on sustainability practices. We play the role of a mentors, and as such, we provide them with guidance and also chart out an action plan for them to work on,"" says Ganga Sridhar.

At P.S. Senior Secondary School, with the support of the teachers, Bala has helped the students set up an eco-club. Divided into multiple groups, the students enforce eco-friendly practices and monitor them. For their art projects, they fashion models out of discarded and recycled material such as newspapers, plastic pipes, straws and mats.

Recently, At his alma mater, Vana Vani Matriculation Higher Secondary School, C.R. Ashok helped the students conduct a 'green carnival.'

""We tried to avoid plastic as much as possible. We asked the vendors to bring in biodegradable plates and glasses instead of disposables. We held poster competitions for children on environmental themes,"" he says.

At Chettinad Harishree Vidyalayam too, students actively segregate and compost the waste generated on the campus. Recently, the students visited Thiruveedhi Amman Koil Street in Mandaveli and met the members of TAKSRA to learn more about waste management, says Bala .Sumitra Srikanth, who works with Vidya Mandir, says, ""When the school set up the terrace garden, I provided them with grow bags and seeds and offered my expertise through power-point presentation and videos. The teachers and students have taken an active interest in maintaining the garden and I am very happy to see the progress they have made,"" says Sumitra.

The 'EcoKonnectors' are urging more schools to come forward to take up green initiatives on their campuses and are willing to adopt schools to help them become more eco-conscious."

With a presence in almost every car market across the globe, Daimler and BMW have led the European charge in the global car industry not only in terms of technology but also in terms of volumes.

Daimler group, Mercedes' parent company, and BMW have been in talks for joining hands in terms of resources to develop future tech for transportation. While the joint effort had already got a green signal from the competition authorities in the EU some time ago, now America has also issued a nod clearing the path for the two German conglomerates to come together.

The global automotive industry is undergoing a tectonic shift after a century of building combustion engines to an electricity driven future. It is not only the powertrain that is reinventing itself, but along with it, the buying patterns, customer choices and the basic definition of transportation is being questioned in order to fit into the future that looms ahead of us.

In the meantime, while the traditional carmakers continued playing to their strengths, disruptors like Tesla built the alternate narrative and have now have gained the higher ground in terms of technology, learning and applications. Autonomous driving tech has been catapulted into the limelight by advances in artificial intelligence and the old-school manufacturers have been left behind, having to play the catch up game with small-scale startups not only from the Silicon Valley, but also from China. While China's imminent collapse, as predicted by the western economists, isn't even on the horizon, the capability of Chinese investors and hence, their technology has become a major threat to the global biggies of the automotive industry.

The joint venture would work towards developing and standardising non-specific components like batteries, motors, control systems et al. While that would certainly help in cost sharing, it might also lead to a faster development cycle. This would, ultimately, allow the Germans to catch up to the leaders in the multiple fields and help re-establish their supremacy on the back of the decades of production and quality management experiences that the existing thought leaders lack."

Government schools have to resort to buying water from tankers when the borewells fail or there is a problem with electricity to pump the water up. Cooking mid-day meals, water for washing the dishes, for the small garden which they sometimes have and above all water for using the toilets becomes a challenge in the absence of a reliable source.

One way of addressing the problem and providing supplemental water for schools is to build a rainwater harvesting system which collects rooftop rainwater in underground sump tanks. Thanks to funding from WIPRO Cares and some good work by Manjunath, a self-trained plumber, 10 schools now have rooftop rainwater harvesting systems. The school heads and teachers met recently to discuss how the system was working, the challenges encountered in maintaining them and what lessons were learnt from the experience. The Block Education Officer turned up, which was a pleasant surprise to the teachers assembled. She exhorted them to continue the good work, maintain the systems and to strike partnerships with companies for CSR funds and NGOs for implementation of water and sanitation especially since the region was dry and water tables were falling.

Apart from the water supplement that it brings, rainwater harvesting teaches many lessons for the children. For example, with the help of a small rain gauge they learn how much it rains in their school area. Even a rainfall of 500 mm over a 200 square metre roof area means 100,000 litres of rainwater to collect and harvest, a figure that usually surprises them.

With small experimental testing kits and guidance, they check the quality of rainwater for its pH, its bacterial content and its chemical content. They learn how rainwater filters work and how sump tanks need to be maintained for cleanliness. The usage of water for drinking and for cooking, for the toilet and for washing dishes is calculated and they learn the demand put on water. They learn to notice where the used water goes and whether it is treated or left untreated.

Children also become aware about aquifers, groundwater, its quality and its challenge in terms of fluoride, nitrates and other contaminants that are becoming common. They learn to test and identify good groundwater sources in their villages and towns.

It requires sustained hand holding and an interested and committed group to make this possible. Funds from companies and other donors is of great value. Working with teachers and the school management council is a skill that takes time and patience to acquire.

Above all, it takes a local committed plumber like Manjunath to be in constant touch with schools, repair pipes, clean filters and generally counsel and assist the school in taking care of its water and sanitation systems.

In the great endeavour of a clean India and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 6- Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, it is necessary for a society and a nation to invest in schools and the schoolchildren to help them become water literate and be wise stewards of water in the future.

In this lies water wisdom and in this we must not fail."

The company was burning cash as it struggled to differentiate its software from that of Uber Eats, GrubHub Inc., and other competitors, and it had recently sold shares that valued the company at less than its previous funding round. Then something strange happened: Excluding overhead expenses such as salaries and rent, DoorDash started turning a profit. Granted, that's a generous definition of the word ""profit,"" but it was enough for Saudi-backed SoftBank Group Corp., which swooped in to lead a fresh round of investment totaling $535 million.

DoorDash used the money to expand from 600 cities to 3,000, and another round of venture funding tripled its value, to $4 billion. Researcher Second Measure says DoorDash is now the ­fastest-growing business in its field. The delivery company says it tripled annual sales in 2018 and recorded net revenue of $107 million in November. ""We've been working on the same strategy for five years,"" says Chief Executive Officer Tony Xu. ""Now some of these things are bearing fruit.""

While most rivals spend their time trying to appeal to the people ordering the food, Xu has consistently focused on the businesses making it. ""He was asking the question 'How can we help this restaurant increase its sales?' "" says Sequoia Capital partner Alfred Lin, an early investor. With Chief Operating Officer Christopher Payne, previously an executive at Amazon.com, Microsoft, and EBay, Xu has developed software that restaurants can use at their own cash registers and embed on their websites. The company has signed on national chains including Wendy's, Chipotle, and Cheesecake Factory. ""DoorDash became our lead horse because of their focus on quality,"" says Kurt Kane, Wendy's chief concept and marketing officer. ""The food almost always arrived hot.""

Xu grew up in Champaign, Ill., after emigrating from China at age 5. His family often relied on food stamps. Dad worked as a graduate aeronautical engineering researcher at the University of Illinois, while Mom waited tables and eventually took part ownership in a nearby restaurant. ""To me, my mom was the epitome of the American dream,"" Xu says. ""She came to the U.S. with a ­little more than $250 to her name and worked hard to create a small business."" He started his own while at Stanford Business School in 2013, with two friends on the undergrad side, taking fellow students' orders over the phone for ­restaurants that didn't deliver and making the deliveries themselves.

Steady demand made DoorDash's early revenue impressive enough for the startup incubator Y Combinator to connect Xu with venture capitalists including Lin, but in 2016, Xu had trouble persuading venture firms to keep investing at a higher price. Still, executives stayed on, joined by Payne in 2016, and by the end of 2017, Xu's strategy was starting to pay off. A greater selection of restaurants helped attract more users, driving down costs. Profits in key markets became a realistic goal, then the norm. DoorDash says it's profitable -- again, not accounting for overhead expenses such as salaries and rent.

The $535 million funding round came in March, with capital from Sequoia and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, along with SoftBank. The cash has allowed DoorDash to push into smaller markets, from Chico, Calif., to Pensacola, Fla. Over the summer, shortly after Xu hired Chief Financial Officer Prabir Adarkar away from Uber Technologies Inc., venture firms Coatue Management and DST Global plowed in an additional $250 million. Adarkar, who helped Uber work on its initial public offering filing, declined to comment on competition with Uber Eats or say when DoorDash will go public, but he says the company is already preparing for an IPO. This year, the company says, its full-time staff has increased 82 percent, to more than 1,000 employees.

DoorDash still has a long way to go to beat out Uber Eats and GrubHub. The latter, which owns brands including Seamless, Eat24, and LevelUp, has America's largest ordering audience, making 530 million deliveries in the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. In the same amount of time, DoorDash says, it's made more than 100 million. For now, Xu says he'll stay focused on what restaurants want, including providing satellite kitchen space for those needing more capacity. The goal remains to help small businesses survive, he says: ""We built this company for people like my mom."""

In the latest case, District Child Protection Officer Kanhu Charan Rout has lodged a complaint against Maa Ambika SC/ST Residential School, Sidhal for running a school by producing forged documents, harassing and humiliating students.

The school was opened in 1992 and the management of the residential school had obtained NOC by submitting a fake land document and other infrastructure. After obtaining NOC from the District Education Officer, Jagatsinghpur, the Board of Secondary Education gave permission to conduct examinations. Meanwhile, the villagers brought allegations of lack of facilities and harassment of students by engaging them in the agriculture field or domestic work.

They alleged that school authorities have pressed the children, including girls, in domestic work and cultivation of paddy crops in the land. The students were also tortured when they refused to do these activities. The parents also alleged that though the strength of the residential school is about 170 from Classes I to X, the stipend of Rs 1,200 was being availed against 300 students.

Acting on the complaint, Collector Yamini Sarangi sought details on the school's infrastructure like toilets, kitchen, drinking water facilities, boundary wall, safety measures and other documents in August.

The school was also asked to comply with the shortcomings within 15 days but the management failed to do so following which the administration obtained permission from the Government and closed the school.

Despite the closure of the school, the management was running it illegally. Inspector-in-charge of Jagatsinghpur police station Rajani Kant Mishra said after receiving allegations, police registered a case against the president, secretary and headmaster of the school as their names are mentioned in the FIR under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act and an investigation is on."

Acting on a tip-off, police arrested the two accused near the power station in Sector 115. The arrested duo has been identified as Amit Bhati, owner of the school, and Mohammad Ahmad, driver of the earthmover that was being used at the construction site.

Two students had lost their lives while three others got injured on Monday when a boundary wall of New KM Public School collapsed and five children came under it.

A residential construction work was in progress on the plot attached with the school premises. The sand from the construction site was kept along the boundary wall of the school which allegedly led to the collapse. The wall of the school was around 10 feet high and many rock slabs were also kept on its top, police said.

Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has sent a recommendation to slap a penalty of Rs 20,000 on the owner of the plot whose dumped sand led to the incident. ""We have sent our recommendation to the city magistrate as the sand was kept without covering it. Once we get the approval from the city magistrate, a notice will be sent to the owner of the plot,"" said Anil Singh, regional officer, UPPCB.

Pollution control board officials also visited the site to identify the total area where the construction work was going on and the uncovered sand. The total area is around 3,000 square feet on which construction material was lying uncovered, the officials said.

On Monday, senior police officials had said that they were expecting education department to file a separate FIR in the matter. However, the education department has merely filed a brief complaint that the school was running illegally and a proper investigation should take place in the whole incident.

Police had arrested school principal Sanjeev Jha on Monday night itself. ""We have arrested three accused, including the two main accused who were arrested on Thursday. The remaining three accused will also be arrested soon. The education department has given us an application,"" said Shwetabh Pandey, circle officer 3.

Police have registered an FIR against six persons, including the management of the school and the neighbour whose dumped sand allegedly led to the incident. Besides Bhati, Jha and Ahmad, other accused include Deshraj, owner of the adjoining plot, his son Sumit Bhati and Rajendra Solanki, manager of the school.

The FIR has been registered under sections 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of Indian Penal Code (IPC), and section 75 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015."

Christmas is the spirit of giving without a thought of getting. It is happiness because we see joy in people. It is forgetting self and finding time for others. It is discarding the meaningless and stressing the true values"".

By taking these beautiful thoughts, values, and Christmas celebration mood in mind; once again students of Campion School, Arera Colony bhopal witnessed and celebrates a wonderful Christmas Day along with The Principal's Day in Loyola Auditorium on 20th Dec 2018 with full zeal and fervour.

The programmes began with the Lighting of the Lamp done by Principal Fr. Dr. Athnas Lakra S.J., Vice Principal Fr. Amritlal Toppo S.J., Superior Fr. Christdhari Kujur S.J., School Bursar Fr. Ashok S.J., Primary Headmistress Sr. Lily D'souza A.C., and Senior Teacher & Lecturer Mr. Mahendra Kothari along with other dignitaries.

Thereafter, a beautiful birthday song ""Wish you a Very Happy Birthday"" for Principal father sung by the students. After this, to spread a social message ""More Plantation"" in the society, ""Saplings"" on behalf of Flower Bouquets and Birthday Greeting cards (made from waste materials to represents Eco friendly); given to the principal Fr. Dr. Athnas Lakra S.J on his birthday by the Secondary School Captain Prabal Gupta & Asst. School Captain Aryan wadhwani along with primary section Monitors of the school.

Message of Jesus Christ is showed by the different Carol Songs, Christmas Tableau, Celebration Dances, Plays and Western Dances etc. on this Christmas Carnival programme.

Secondary Student's choir groups gathered and sang carols, ""Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle all the way...., 'We three kings of orion star', 'My favourite time of year', Snow is falling all around me, 'God rest your merry gentleman' and primary students sang 'O Pyari raat O Nyari Raat', 'Joy to the World the Lord has come' and 'Feliz navidad' carol songs.

As the students sang the popular carol, ""Jingle Bells"", students dressed as Santa Claus arrived on the stage. Students sang Christmas carols, played various games and taken gifts by 'Santa Claus'.

The Resounding bells, voices of singing carols, with Rock band performances are a treat to the ears and eyes particularly as this is the ""Christmas Day Celebration Dance and western dance"".

Primary Section students presented a wonderful Tableau depicting the birth of Lord Jesus in a unique and interesting way. Amidst dance and music the students depicted the prophecy of Archangel, the birth of Jesus and the arrival of wise men from the East to bless the little Jesus.

Birth of Jesus was shown in the form of a short play along with the melodious Christmas carols presented by children with rhyme and rhythm depicting the arrival of Santa Claus.

The participants played Tablas, synthesizer, guitar, and violin along with vocalists. The birth of Jesus Christ was shown through the Beautiful Crib Decoration by the students of the school. Christmas tree was also decorated beautifully.

Thereafter, Principal Fr. Dr. Athnas Lakra S.J., and Headmistress Sr. Lily D'Souza in there speech said ""The festival of Christmas reminds the glorious advent of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, on this earth about two millennia ago. Born in Bethlehem, He rose from humble beginnings to become a World Teacher. His message of Love and Compassion inspire millions of followers all over the world today.

The Christmas season is marked with festivities and rejoicing at the wonderful gift that God bestowed on mankind in the form of His beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. The greatest gift we can give to God is to live by at least one of his teachings"".

He also thanked to All the Fathers, Brothers, Sisters, Management, Staff, Well wishers and students of Campion School for his birthday wishes and Christmas day Celebration. Vice Principal Fr. Amirtlal Toppo S.J., said ""Jesus is God's perfect, indescribable gift. The amazing thing is that not only are we able to receive this gift, but we are able to share it with others on Christmas and every other day of the year"".

After this the Award ceremony for different categories; (best excellence student in academic, academic, 100% attendance etc.) was taken place. In the End Vote of thanks given by Asst. School Captain Master Aryan Wadhwani The whole programme was presented by more than 4000 students from K.G.I to class XIIth and entertained the guests.

The audience was mesmerized by the performances of these young and energetic children. From Primary side comparing was done by Mrs. Reena Majumdar and from secondary side Master of ceremony done by Mrs. Sonali Shrivastava.

In keeping with the Christmas spirit, the whole school wore a festive look and was tastefully decorated. The entire programme was highly appreciated by the Principal & vice Principal Father."

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

He said IIM Bangalore has also expressed willingness for a study of the reorganization process and its benefit."

Thereafter I'll write a TOI blog post on this topic.

Who are these economists?

Thirteen senior economists, including former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and Sajjid Chinoy of JP Morgan. Others are: Abhijit Banerjee, Pranjul Bhandari, Maitreesh Ghatak, Amartya Lahiri, Neelkanth Mishra, Prachi Mishra, Karthik Muralidharan, Rohini Pande, Eswar Prasad and E. Somanathan.

Unfortunately, I've not heard of any of these economists apart from Raghuram Rajan and read none of them before. I read only the world's best economists (with Hayek and Friedman being my benchmark), and no Indian economist comes in that category. And given what these economists have produced in this report, I will not be reading their work anyway.

In this report, they're OK on labour reforms, ordinary on most issues and pretty hopeless on agriculture, education and healthcare. Most importantly, they have totally missed governance reforms although they repeatedly point out the massive failure of government in every field. A major blind spot these economists need to fix.

The Imperative for Strong, Equitable, and Sustainable Growth

India is one of the fastest growing large countries in the world, having grown at an average of almost 7 percent for the last 25 years. There have been many notable reforms over this period - most recently, the co-operative fiscal federalism that has brought the Goods and Services Tax into being, the enactment of the Indian Bankruptcy Code, and the dramatic dis-inflation of recent years, partly as a result of a move to an inflation targeting regime.

While commendable, we should not be satisfied with this. India is still one of the poorest countries in the G-20, and poor countries ought to grow faster because catch-up growth is easier. As important, the benefits of growth in India have been distributed extremely unequally, with top incomes rising much faster than the rest. [Sanjeev: The real issue remains extreme poverty] We have seen new environmental challenges, in the form of sharp increases in both local pollution levels and in CO2 emissions [Sanjeev: CO2 emissions are GOOD, not bad] that, if unchecked, threaten to stall or reverse progress. India is also not creating enough jobs: even though data on employment in India are both low quality and controversial, the recent news that 28 million applied for 90,000 low level railway jobs suggests we are not satisfying the demand for jobs.1 Unfortunately, we are not well-positioned to follow the export-led growth path that allowed many Asian countries to climb out of poverty. Despite abundant cheap labor, we are not part of many global supply chains. Even as global firms seek to diversify away from China so as to reduce political risk, India is rarely seen as an obvious alternative. [That's because socialism has messed up everything in India]

Given India's continental size, it need not follow the export-led path. It will, however, have to ensure that growth generates jobs and incomes across the skill spectrum, in the process

There are tremendous possibilities for reforms that will take us towards faster and more equitable growth, as this report will lay out. However, we have to allocate scarce resources carefully to make sure that there is enough investment in sectors such as infrastructure to create jobs. India's aggregate fiscal deficit (state plus center) is still close to 6.5 percent of GDP, higher than almost any in the G-20, and not significantly lower than levels that existed five years ago. However, our investment rate has fallen sharply in recent years. Despite that, our external financing requirement (as measured by the current account deficit) increased appreciably earlier this year, increasing vulnerability. Moreover, to the extent that India grows while being more reliant on domestic demand than were other Asian emerging markets, it needs a much greater focus on macroeconomic stability than they did. For all these reasons, it needs to prioritize government spending better, focusing on filling clear investment gaps and protecting the vulnerable. It also needs to increase revenues by making the tax system more progressive both in taxes levied as well as through more effective collection from rich non-payers, by bringing more people into the tax net, and by charging users for government services where appropriate.

A key factor in spurring growth will be reforms that alleviate ""supply side"" constraints on growth and job creation. We have to enable both the industrial sector as well as the service sector to operate at larger scale. This involves embracing highly overdue labor reforms including allowing for a rich menu of contracts with workers that allow for more possibilities than just permanent workers and short term contractual labor in firms [Agree]. Such additional contracting possibilities could give workers more job security, give firms the incentive to train and invest in their skilling, even while giving firms more reason to scale up. Similarly, cleaner title to land, as well as a land acquisition process that protects the seller while simplifying acquisition, will reduce the cost of developing land, a critical need if we are to create jobs [Agree, but these economists should ask why Indian governance system can't perform this most basic function]. A more predictable and better regulatory environment - which prunes redundant or unnecessary regulation, carefully sets regulations in new areas necessitated by our development, and enforces regulations effectively and impartially - will create a much better environment for business. We must also improve the capabilities as well as strengthen the independence of our regulatory institutions. [Agree, but why is India's governance in such a mess even today?]

Scale is also key for productivity growth which, in turn, is essential for India to expand its share of world exports. The ongoing reorientation of the United States away from dependence on China provides India with a great opportunity to position itself as a viable alternative for cheap sourcing of goods and parts. But this would require macro and industrial policy reforms of the kind just outlined that remove existing impediments to India becoming a valued partner in global supply chains. Rolling back the recent increases in import tariffs along with a renewed commitment to resisting protective policies would be a good way of signaling this goal. [Agree]

In outlining an economic agenda, we have to recognize government capacity is limited - the number of government employees is often low relative to the tasks they are assigned [Sanjeev: TOTALLY DISAGREE here. The issue is SHEER AND TOTAL INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION]. This is often compounded by low staff motivation and relatedly high absenteeism, as well as inadequate training. Government takes on too much, while delivering too little. Yet for growth to be equitable, a must in our democracy, effective and well-targeted government engagement is essential. [Why are these economists not talking about governance reforms?]

One partial solution is more decentralization, with more powers and funding delegated to the states, and perhaps more importantly, within the states to municipalities and panchayats. It will allow for a much more dynamic decision-making process, resulting in government policies that are more sensitive to local conditions, as well as more local democratic control of officialdom. [This is fine in principle but totally fails to account for the fact that the SAME bureaucracy and political incentives will lead to the SAME outcome.]

The strategic use of technology has the potential to help here as long as we are careful not to make a fetish of technology, are mindful of the human dimension of transactions, and deploy technology with enough safeguards. Technology can make it easier to monitor flows of funds and uses of funding locally, allowing for more devolution of funding, something that has been proposed by previous Finance Commissions. More generally, effective use of technology can also help substitute for government manpower, increase the points of access to government services, help monitor service provision, and reduce leakage in the system.

The debate on whether the public sector should occupy areas that can be done by the private sector will no doubt continue, and there is an obvious case for exiting areas where the public sector contributes little while draining the exchequer and distorting competition. [Sanjeev: Why is government involved in ANY business at all? And this is not a specific recommendation: a motherhood statement] The government should also reconsider its interventions in areas where it adds noise and uncertainty - for instance, the constant fiddling with agricultural import tariffs, the unpredictable closures or opening of export and import windows, and the inability to procure agricultural commodities or release them effectively, does significantly more damage than good to agriculture. While actions are taken in the name of the farmer or the consumer, it is the middleman who often benefits. [Sanjeev: there's nothing wrong with the middleman benefiting in a competitive and open market. But the market is not open. This recommendation fails to recognise the huge blockages on agriculture sector trade.]

Moreover, even when the consumer benefits from high farm production and low agricultural prices, which also help contain inflation, the cost to the farmers can be significant. The case of pulses is revealing. In 2016-17 for example, India witnessed its highest ever domestic production - close to 23 million metric tonnes -- likely reflecting a combination of a normal monsoon after successive droughts and the farmer response to higher market prices and MSPs. This was sufficient to fully satisfy domestic demand. Despite that, India imported a hefty 6.6 million tonnes of pulses (almost a third of total domestic production) at zero import duty - leading to a massive domestic supply glut, and a sharp and sustained fall in pulse prices over the next two years which continues to this day, with prices currently 30% lower than their 2016 peaks.

In addition to getting the government out of areas it should not be in, there is an equally urgent task of strengthening the government in areas it does poorly or is virtually absent in - for instance, regulating and certifying educational or medical service providers, apprehending and successfully prosecuting economic offenders [What about non-economic??!!], or regulating haphazard development and environmental despoliation without blocking growth. [When even murderers like Modi can remain on the loose, then what hope of justice? This was the opportunity to talk about governance reforms.]

For growth to be equitable and sustained, we have to reform our education, skilling, healthcare, and welfare systems significantly. Our record on primary education is dismal, with only about half of the children in class five able to do math or reading at the second-grade level. Parents have responded by increasingly migrating to private schooling, but private schools are only slightly better than government schools, and in their current form will not solve the problem of low education quality. [This is a TERRIBLE comment to make - to downplay private enterprise, the only thing that is working in India for the POOR] It does not get better at higher grades -- our PISA scores were so low that we refused to participate again in that international benchmarking exercise. The poor quality of human capital may already be constraining growth (industry is increasingly concerned about the large and growing skill deficit), limits its inclusiveness and prompt a premature move to replace workers with machines.

Healthcare is another area of major concern. In particular, the public system has largely been abandoned by the patients seeking regular primary care. They prefer paying for private treatment even though many practitioners are unqualified and prescribe the wrong treatment in more than 70% of the cases. This is partly a consequence of the failure of the public sector -- public sector practitioners are often absent, and when present they put very little effort into treatment. It is unclear how the recent Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, which is the main current effort to deal with healthcare issues, will address this issue. [Sanjeev: with the BLATANT failure of government staring in the face, where is the talk about governance reforms?]

This is especially a problem because dealing with the large growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the many, only partly-solved, child and maternal health issues, relies heavily on getting frontline providers to lead the charge. Similar concerns apply in the education sector. A failure to ensure high-quality education and health care provision means that a substantial proportion of our future labor force will grow up underequipped with skills needed in the labor market and suffering from the long term consequences of stunting and wasting. Much of the middle-aged population will be dealing with debilitating diseases that could have been prevented or controlled. This obviously limits the sustainability and the inclusiveness of growth.

The environment is, of course, a critical challenge to the continuation of our growth and to the extent to which growth translates into improved quality of life. Many of our cities are increasingly experiencing levels of pollution that border on the toxic. If we cannot manage the environment at our present level of development, greater growth will make matters far worse. [Sanjeev: once again, this points to severe government failure - but no mention of the need for governance reforms] The consequences of environmentally myopic policies are reflected, for example, in the rapidly falling water table in many parts of the country, which threatens the sustainability of our agriculture. Relatedly, climate change is already having very significant effects on productivity and the quality of lives in India and we need to be at the forefront of global efforts to combat it. [Sanjeev: this claim is, of course, CRAP]

That our current policies do not add up to an inclusive and sustainable growth agenda is reflected in growing agitation across our society. Agrarian unrest, and the constant demand for loan waivers, is now compounded by demands for some form of government support from sections of society that are nowhere near the poorest. This reflects Indians' growing anxiety about their future and that of their children in an increasingly winner-take-all society, where they often end up on the losing side. Our welfare schemes like the MGNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana are mostly directed towards the very poor (the one exception being the public distribution system), so they do not serve the purpose of protecting those outside that group. Without stronger, sustainable, and inclusive growth we simply do not have the resources to expand our welfare schemes significantly, [Sanjeev: BUT WHY SHOULD WELFARE BE EXPANDED?] but if we do generate that growth, not only will there be less demand for welfare but there will be more resources to service any demand.

The bottom line is that while we have performed creditably in the last 25 years across different administrations, we cannot be complacent about our economic challenges. They are mounting. We are a group of economists, each with different specializations and interests, who have come together to offer proposals for the way ahead. Some of us are based in India, some outside, but we are all closely engaged in, and concerned about, India's development. We do not belong to any party, nor are we from the government. We hope this non-partisan analysis of our situation, while not intended to be comprehensive, will help spur debate as India moves to elections. The rest of this note summarizes our proposals, and offers our consensus view on some of the key issues we face. We then append individual notes by members of the group, which offers more details of individual views and proposals. Each note reflects the view of the author(s) in their personal capacity, and does not necessarily represent the institution they are affiliated with.

Macroeconomic stability: a prerequisite to sustainable growth and job creation

India's economic history is replete with the same lesson: preserving and protecting macroeconomic stability is an essential prerequisite to strong and sustained growth. Every time macro stability has been traded off to boost growth, the economy has been pushed towards a crisis, the consequences of which have undermined the very growth that was the initial policy focus.

Ensuring macroeconomic stability has at least three elements to it: maintaining low and stable inflation, ensuring the consolidated fiscal deficit leaves enough space for private investment, and ensuring that the current account deficit is sustainable and can be financed largely through stable capital inflows, to help insulate the economy from sudden swings in global sentiment. High and variable inflation constitutes a regressive tax, with the poor bearing the biggest brunt, since their incomes are typically least indexed to inflation. It also dissuades foreign investors from investing in rupee assets. Similarly, large and unsustainable fiscal/external imbalances impart significant macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty, push up borrowing costs and risk premia in the economy and threaten financial stability. All this impedes private and public investment.

Fiscal consolidation to creating space for more investment

The economy has made significant progress in combating inflation in recent years. Over the last 4 years inflation has averaged just over 4% versus almost 10% in the previous five years, and household inflation expectations are getting progressively anchored. The same, however, cannot be said of the fiscal side.

While the center's fiscal deficit has been steadily brought down, the combined deficit of the states - even after adjusting for UDAY - has continued to widen in recent years and, thereby, largely undone the center's consolidation. Consequently, the consolidated fiscal deficit in 2017-18, stood above 6.5%, not very different from its levels five years ago. Our primary suggestions to make progress on this difficult issue:

De-risking the external sector

India's heavy dependence on oil imports often results in ""boom-bust"" cycles on the balance of payments when crude prices change. For example, the CAD narrowed to 0.7% of GDP in 2016-17 as crude prices fell and was then tracking close to 3% of GDP in 2018 when crude prices bounced back up. This resulted in a large balance of payments surplus in the first instance and a large deficit in the second. These sharp swings complicate monetary policy, as well as exchange rate and liquidity management, and create undue external and fiscal volatility (since oil prices also alter the fiscal math). We should:

Fixing the Stressed Sectors

Careful but quick policy reforms are needed for the sectors/areas that are stressed. These include agriculture, infrastructure (including power), exports and banking. There are common themes in any revival. Typically, we need to redeploy government effort in each of these sectors, focusing it on areas where it is truly needed to play an enabling role, while freeing the sector of excessive bureaucracy and intervention, which results in inadequate access to markets, distorted prices, and poor incentives. While the recent focus on improving India's ranking on the World Bank's Doing Business measures is commendable, we should guard against the temptation to focus on the specifics of the World Bank measures, while neglecting the broader impediments to producing in India. [Agreed] We now consider each of these sectors in more detail.

Agriculture & the rural economy

We need deep rooted transformation of agriculture, treating it not as a sector that has to be propped up through repeated sops, but as an engine of India's job creation and growth. For that, it is imperative that we thoroughly reform agricultural and land policies. In particular, a key source of agrarian distress in recent years has been that the terms-of-trade confronting farmers has turned progressively more adverse, partly as a result of policies to combat food inflation. While low inflation is desirable in itself, the impact on farmers also needs to be taken into account. A policy priority should be to reduce distortions in farm product prices as well as input prices. Another important enabler is technology, both in educating and informing farmers, as well as in opening access to markets. Some specific proposals include

Infrastructure

Accelerating the pace of the infrastructure build-out will help in a number of ways; it will create jobs in construction and new economic activity around the resulting roads, ports, airports, railways, and housing; it will promote inclusion as it connects interior rural areas to markets; it will make our exports (and import-competing manufacturing) more competitive as it reduces input costs such as land (as cheaper areas are connected) and power, as well as improves logistics and reduces transportation costs; it will open up India to both domestic and foreign tourism, which can be a tremendous source of semi- skilled jobs. This will require

Power

Despite having some of the largest reserves of coal, as well as having substantial unutilized power generation capacity, India is both short of coal as well as short of power. These are policy self-goals, arising from both the dominant presence of government in coal mining and power distribution as well as populist impulses in pricing. Nevertheless, our low base allows us to choose a path that is both more energy efficient as well as less polluting as we reform the system for the twenty first century. For this we need:

Exports

India's non-oil, non-gold current account has deteriorated by almost 3% of GDP in the last three years, suggesting an urgent need to improve the underlying competitiveness of the tradable sector. Boosting exports should be the lynchpin of that strategy. [Sanjeev: Any economist who says this is simply not a good economist. Refer to Kautilya, and the best economists who agree that IMPORTS are the key. Let consumption be the focus of economists, and exports are a minor subset of this production process.] The existing constraints in the export sector appear to be reflective of more general problems in manufacturing: low scale of production, low productivity, bureaucratic impediments, high cost of inputs like land and power. We have suggested ways to address these earlier. In addition,

Financial Sector

Given the non-performing asset (NPA) build up in the banking system, it is imperative we make the banking system more robust and well capitalized [Sanjeev: HOW? By taxpayer subsidy??], expand its capacity to extend credit, and improve incentives to lend to the most productive sectors. While the recent travails of the NBFCs are a matter of concern, some of their problems stem from an overly rapid expansion of their balance sheets as they grew to substitute for banks. Stability in the banking system will help spread stability to other parts of the financial system as, of course, will the reverse.

The main challenges for the banking sector are to improve governance, transparency, and incentives in the banking system. Key measures should include

The non-bank financial sector needs a strong banking system as well as deep equity and bond markets, supported by liquid secondary markets and a robust regulatory and legal infrastructure. Key priorities include:

Making growth inclusive and sustainable

A good job is often the most important form of inclusion. In addition, we need to help individuals obtain the human capabilities that will enable them to secure and hold that job, as well as protect those who cannot get jobs. Let us now turn to proposals on inclusion.

Education

The single greatest limitation of the Indian education system is its inability to deliver universal functional literacy and numeracy in primary school. Several studies show that students who fail to achieve basic skills by the end of class 3 learn very little in subsequent years even if they are enrolled in school. Our top education policy priority is therefore:

The Right to Education (RTE) Bill's input-based approach to education quality was unlikely to succeed given the extensive evidence that most school inputs are neither necessary nor sufficient for improving learning outcomes. RTE has led to an unnecessary and disruptive closure of several low-cost private schools that parents were choosing of their own accord. In many cases, even government schools are in violation of these input-based norms. We therefore recommend:

While improvement in schooling is a key building block to education, we cannot neglect either vocational training/skilling or college education. Both will be critical to providing our youth with the wherewithal for the jobs of the future. High quality research universities will be essential, both to train the teachers for our colleges as well as to fuel the innovation needed for the next stage of our growth. [Sanjeev: GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THESE]

Dealing with the skills shortage

There is wide recognition that the current models of publicly subsidized skilling are not performing very well even though skills are extremely scarce. What seems to work better is the skilling provided by private firms that are training their own labor force. However, under current laws, firms can employ workers for up to one year after which they either have to fire them or make them permanent. Since there are significant costs and inflexibilities in making workers permanent, many firms keep workers on short contracts and terminate them before they can become permanent. This state of affairs serves neither the firm, which has to hire new workers frequently and has no incentive to train them, nor the worker, who has no security of employment, and who is not trained. At the same time, since the government is often the only employer that offers secure jobs, young people spend their twenties applying for these jobs rather than working. However, these jobs are extremely expensive thanks partly to the munificence of the Pay Commissions and therefore there are too few of them. As a result, a cynic could argue that the government and the private sector lack manpower, while young people sit at home filling applications and preparing for tests. We propose that:

Women's labor force participation

There are clearly both supply-side issues-families not allowing women to work, women feeling disempowered -- and demand-side issues -- lack of women-friendly jobs in the private sector as well as discrimination. Some useful first steps here:

Healthcare

There is much to be done to reform the healthcare system in India. Increasingly, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer play a much bigger role, so healthcare needs to be reoriented to address these.

Environment

Even while business complains about the difficulty of getting environmental approvals, the quality of our environment leaves much to be desired and with climate change looming we should be thinking in terms of reaching peak emissions within the next decade or so and then sharply reducing them. For all of this we need to get more professional about the environment and climate change, as well as more transparent about the regulatory process.

Social Protection

India has more than 400 separate social protection schemes. A vast majority of them are funded at very low levels and do very little. However, they absorb some amount of bureaucratic capacity. And despite the wide variety of schemes available on paper, as the many protests make clear, people do not feel protected. In particular while MGNREGA provides some support for the rural landless, most other relatively poor people have only the PDS to fall back on. This is one reason that it is so difficult to remove any government scheme, however inefficient. There is a clear need to create a reliable pipeline for providing compensation for losers, as we move towards a more rational system of social protection. The Direct Benefits Transfer is a good starting point and building on it by being credible in compensating losers will be key. Specifically we suggest"

But where to find them? Deal, no deal or even another referendum?

While #Brexit has dominated much of public debate and Government time, #Metoo and #gigeconomy have also featured prominently in public debate though they are assigned to the Government's growing list of ""future legislative reform needed if we just had time"" pile - shame JK Rowling couldn't make Hermione's time turner a reality.

The Government has repeatedly stated that it intends to maintain current UK employment laws so that existing workers' rights are unchanged following exit day, this could of course change, as political fortunes change ('Fantastic [Brexit] Beasts: the [G]rimes of Grindel[gov]'). The reality is that it is unlikely the Government will change its mind and repeal all EU-derived employment law or make large-scale changes to employment law in the aftermath of Brexit. There may be scope to tweak some provisions within the current legislation, but political considerations make it relatively unlikely that core employee rights would be reduced significantly following Brexit.

John Whiting, now CBE, is the writer's personal favourite taxman for this simple and honest statement, which continues to be true. Like last year, determining worker status in modern workplaces has once again been a hot topic in 2018.

Back in February we finally saw the delayed Government Response to the recommendations of the Taylor review of modern working practices; and the answer to the tricky employment status issue is...more consultation and thinking!

The Government has rejected Matthew Taylor's recommendation for introducing a 'worker status by default' presumption and is instead revisiting the possibility of a new statutory test to determine employment status. As acknowledged in the latest consultation which closed on 1 June, codification of the test for employment status would involve trade-offs. On the one hand, a simple and clear formula will give more certainty. On the other hand, the current case law based framework provides the nuance and flexibility often needed when applying the test to different circumstances which are inevitable in the labour market.

Ultimately, employment status is a complicated subject because employment relationships are just that - complicated. A status test set down in legislation rather than case law doesn't change that fact. Trying to encapsulate the nuanced factors developed over years of case law into legislation will be no easy feat. But have the courts been any more helpful this year?

Since the 2016 landmark tribunal decision (and 2017 Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) judgment) that Uber drivers are workers (despite Uber's best efforts at drafting bamboozling contractual clauses) there has been a seemingly endless supply of successful new claims predominantly concerning couriers [Insert your choice of courier company name and you will most likely find a case].

In June, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Pimlico Plumbers Limited & Anr v Smith on whether a plumber who was self-employed for tax purposes was nonetheless a worker for employment law purposes. In relation to the personal service requirement for establishing 'worker' status, the Supreme Court confirmed that a limited or occasional power of delegation could still be consistent with personal performance. The 'dominant purpose' of the contract remained one of personal service.

The Supreme Court's judgment significantly decreases the importance of the right of substitution as a determining factor. A substitution clause in and of itself does not magically prevent worker status. On the other hand, integration in the business appears to be a factor of increasing importance in the current wave of worker status cases.

The Supreme Court has tweaked the judicial test by succinctly articulating the 'dominant purpose' factor. But this is more judicial test evolution rather than revolution. Unfortunately, for hopes of world peace, arguments over the required elements of worker status are far from over. Whether and to what extent 'mutuality of obligation' between assignments is relevant to a person's status during assignments is still up for grabs. 'Mutuality of obligation' is a crucial factor to establish 'employee' status, but is it required and if so, to what extent, for establishing 'worker' status? As the Supreme Court said there is no easy answer to this question and it will have to await appraisal on another occasion.

The further appeal in the Uber case was heard by the Court of Appeal on 30 and 31 October. Will the judgment, when handed down, provide an answer? No doubt whichever way the judgment goes, the losing party will further appeal.

Unfortunately, we are not much closer to tackling world peace!

Last year in Jones v Birds Eye, the employment tribunal reminded us that following the 2013 EAT decision in Moran v Ideal Cleaning, the number of agency workers potentially falling within the provisions of the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 was significantly lower than originally anticipated. Following Moran, not all agency workers are protected; it is only those supplied to work temporarily. Those placed indefinitely (meaning open-ended in duration) are not placed 'temporarily' and are therefore outside the scope of the Agency Workers Regulations (AWR).

In both Moran and Jones the agency workers were found not to be temporary and so not covered by the AWR. Conversely this year in Brooknight Guarding Ltd v Matei we have an example of an agency worker placed temporarily. The EAT agreed with the tribunal, that while a relief security guard mainly worked at one site, it was as a 'cover security guard'. Each 'as required' assignment was on a temporary rather than on a permanent or indefinite basis.

In Kocur v Angard Staffing Solutions Ltd, an employer breached the AWR in providing an agency worker with fewer enhanced contractual days' holiday and shorter paid rest breaks than comparable permanent employees, despite the agency worker receiving a higher hourly wage. The EAT rejected the defence that the agency worker's higher rate of pay offset his inferior holiday entitlement and rest breaks - the AWR require a term-by-term comparison not a package approach.

For a part-time worker to establish less favourable treatment under the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (PTW) they need to identify an actual full-time worker comparator who is: employed by the same employer under the same type of contract and engaged in the same or broadly similar work having regard to level of qualification, skills and experience.

In Roddis v Sheffield Hallam University, the EAT considered what constitutes the 'same type of contract' for PTW purposes in the context of a claim by an employee working under a zero hours contract. The University argued that a lecturer's zero-hours contract was not the 'same type of contract' so he could not compare himself with a full-time lecturer on a permanent contract of employment.

A good academic try? Well no. The EAT had no trouble in rejecting this argument. It cannot be that a zero-hours contract of itself constitutes a different type of contract for the purposes of the PTW, since the consequence would be that an employee on a zero-hours contract would never be able to compare themselves to a full-time worker. As the EAT points out, if a contract of employment containing a zero-hours clause was a distinct type of contract under the PTW, the PTW would be self-defeating.

Back in June 2013, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 was revamped. Significant new provisions were introduced. The changes included introducing co-workers' liability for victimisation with corresponding employer statutory vicarious liability.

In November, the Court of Appeal in Timis and Sage v Osipov confirmed that an individual's personal liability for detriment which they cause to a whistleblower colleague can extend to liability for that colleague's dismissal. Where a distinct prior detrimental act done by a co-worker results in the whistleblower's dismissal, the whistleblower can still recover compensation for losses flowing from the dismissal - a so-called 'dismissal consequent on detriment' claim. In this case, it leaves two wrongdoer directors on the hook for just over £2 million of losses, the employer company being insolvent.

For there to be a qualifying disclosure under the whistleblowing legislation, there must be a disclosure of information, not a matter of opinion or an allegation. In practice, information and allegations are often intertwined. In June, the Court of Appeal clarified that the question is whether the disclosure has ""sufficient factual content and specificity"" (Kilraine v London Borough of Wandsworth).

This year we have also learnt on the whistleblowing front:

Common law vicarious liability is a principle of strict, no-fault liability for wrongs committed by another person. In an employment relationship, an employer may be liable for the wrongs committed by an employee where there is a sufficient connection between those wrongs and the employee's employment. This is a very long-standing legal principle with the foundation of the 'modern' principle going back to 1912 (Lloyd and Grace, Smith and Co). But have 21st century developments expanded its scope?

Following a number of appellate level 21st century judgments, when considering whether an incident has sufficient connection with the employer, it is not merely a question of whether the employee was 'at work' in a strict sense. Instead it is whether the employee was otherwise 'clothed in the employer's authority' or ''acting within the field of activities assigned to them'.

For example, an employer was liable for a Managing Director's violent assault of a colleague at an impromptu post-Christmas work party after-party as the MD 'chose to wear his metaphorical managing director's hat' at the time of the incident. Another employer was vicariously liable for a data breach by a rogue employee as access to the data was within the field of activities assigned to him. The fact that the rogue employee's actions were designed to harm the employer was irrelevant.

July saw the Court of Appeal hand down one of the most significant judgments of the year - a combined judgment in Royal Mencap Society v Tomlinson-Blake and Shannon v Rampersad t/a Clifton House Residential Home. In a single judgment, the Court of Appeal has effectively overturned the precedent value of numerous EAT judgments concerning the treatment of 'sleep-in' shifts for national minimum wage (NMW) purposes.

Where a worker is required to work a number of 'sleep-in' night shifts at the employer's premises (to be available in case of an occasional emergency but otherwise expected to sleep all or most of the shift), does the full night shift constitute 'working' for the purposes of the NMW? The Court of Appeal has now answered this question ruling: ""the only time that counts for NMW purposes [during sleep-in-shifts] is the time when the worker is required to be awake for the purpose of working"".

Quite simply the only time that counts for NMW purposes is the time when the worker is required to be awake and actually carrying out work. Time spent sleeping/relaxing does not count. Factors previously found to point towards NMW being payable for the entire sleep-in shift are now irrelevant. The sleep-in exception in the NMW Regulations applies to cases where ""the essence of the arrangement is that the worker is expected to sleep"".

Turning to on-call time for Working Time Directive purposes, until this year Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case-law has tended to focus on the worker's location during stand-by periods and whether it is at a place determined by the employer. Early this year, in Ville de Nivelles v Matzak, the CJEU considered whether on-call time is 'working time' for fire-fighters on-call at home but with a duty to respond within eight minutes. The CJEU has held that such time is 'working time'.

Perhaps a bit counterintuitively, this judgment still reaffirms the importance of proximity to the workplace. In this case, the obligation for the firefighters to remain physically present at the place determined by the employer (their homes) and the 'geographical and temporal constraints' resulting from the requirement to reach their place of work within eight minutes, limited the opportunities which the firefighters had to devote themselves to their personal and social interests. The situation of the firefighters in this case could therefore be distinguished from that of a worker who, during his stand-by duty, must simply be at his employer's disposal inasmuch as it must be possible to contact him. While being on employer premises during on-call time is not required, the proximity of the worker to the workplace at a place determined by the employer (even if it is the worker's home) is still a key factor.

In what is now a perennial favourite, holiday leave accrual, carry-over and pay calculations have once again featured heavily over the year.

Working out holiday entitlement for term time only workers, casual and zero hour workers can often prove to be an administrative headache. The Working Time Regulations (WTR) require holiday pay to be calculated on the basis of the average hours worked in the preceding 12 weeks immediately before payment is made. However, many employers have instead worked out holiday pay by using a 12.07% of annualised hours shortcut as set out in ACAS guidance (5.6 weeks is equivalent to 12.07% of hours worked over a year for a full time worker).

While the 12.07% method is accurate in many cases, it isn't always. In March, the EAT in Brazel v The Harpur Trust confirmed that calculating holiday pay for variable hour, term-time workers based on 12.07% of annualised hours is incorrect. The express provisions contained in the WTR cannot be overridden for ease of calculation. As shown in Mrs Brazel's case, the shortcut did not work accurately for part-time term time workers. Employers using a 12.07% of annualised hours calculation as a shortcut need to review their holiday pay calculation practices or face potential claims.

In Gomes v Higher Level Care Ltd, the Court of Appeal was asked whether compensation for failing to provide rest breaks can include an injury to feelings award. If yes, this would significantly increase the value of rest break breach claims.

The Court of Appeal has confirmed that compensation for claims for failing to provide rest breaks does not extend to injury to feelings, being akin to a breach of contract claim.

While compensation for failure to provide rest breaks and annual leave does not extend to awards for injury to feelings, not all WTR claims are excluded. In contrast, compensation for injury to feelings may be awarded in working time detriment claims since they are more akin to a statutory tort (South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service v Mansell & ors).

We have also had yet another EAT judgment on overtime and holiday pay calculations. The EAT in Flowers and others v East of England Ambulance Trust, once again confirmed that for a WTR claim ""normal pay"" is that which is ""normally received"". Focusing on whether overtime is or isn't ""voluntary"" is irrelevant. The key is regular receipt. But also check the contractual provisions. If there is a contractual right to have overtime included, there may not be a need to establish a regular pattern. In Flowers, regardless of the WTR claim, the claimants were entitled under a contractual clause to have any overtime pay received in the preceding three months included in their annual leave calculation whether or not the overtime worked was part of a regular and settled pattern.

In two German references, Kreuziger v Land Berlin and Max-Planck v Shimizu, the CJEU held that a worker who does not apply for paid annual leave during employment does not automatically lose the right to an allowance in lieu of untaken leave on termination. The worker must have been given an opportunity to take that leave. While employers are not required to force workers to actually exercise their right to take paid annual leave, a bit of nagging may be needed. It is for the employer to show that it encouraged the worker to do so, while informing them, accurately and in good time, of the risk of losing that leave at the end of the applicable reference period.

The CJEU has confirmed that the Working Time Directive (WTD) does not require holiday leave accrual during the taking of parental leave (Tribunalul Botoşani v Dicu). Parental leave (in the UK 18 weeks' unpaid leave to care for a child) is distinguishable from sickness absence and maternity leave. If national law suspends the employment contract during parental leave, then annual leave entitlement does not accrue during the taking of that parental leave. Parental leave is not equivalent to a period of actual work for determining the duration of paid annual leave.

In the UK, legislative provisions which apply to maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental leave expressly state that during the leave period the employee is entitled to the benefit of all the terms and conditions of employment except remuneration - so holiday leave accrual continues during these leave periods. However, there is no corresponding legislative provision in relation to EU law derived parental leave.

If an employer unilaterally imposes a contractual change, it is possible for employees' agreement to be implied if they continue to work without protesting after the change has been imposed. But this is risky. Careful analysis of all communication from employees (both verbal and written) is necessary to ensure nothing has been communicated that suggests or evidences objection to the changes. Where the change imposed does not have immediate effect, silence would not be considered to be agreement simply as a result of the passage of time.

In April, the Court of Appeal in Abrahall and ors v Nottingham City Council reminded employers just what risky business it is to assume agreement. In this case, the Court held that a group of employees who continued to work following their employer's imposition of a pay freeze did not agree to a variation of contract. Although the employees did not bring tribunal claims until two years later and did not individually communicate protest, they had protested through their trade unions at the time. The employees continuing to work could not be taken as unequivocal acceptance of a change that was wholly to their disadvantage. A decision by the union not to take industrial action over the imposed change did not equate to accepting the variation.

Also in April, we received Supreme Court clarification on when contractual notice of termination served by post takes effect (Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust v Haywood). In the absence of any specific contractual provision, contractual notice takes effect only when the employee personally takes delivery of the letter containing the notice (so not date recorded delivery signed for by a family member). In this case, the date of termination was crucial because it determined whether the notice period expired on or before the employee's 50th birthday, which affected her pension entitlement by some £200,000.

This judgment now aligns the contractual law position with the statutory position in respect of the effective date of termination (EDT) under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

Lesson: when dismissing an employee, it is usually best to inform the employee in person (written confirmation being simply that, confirmation, and not the mode of first communication of the actual decision). This will remove any ambiguity about the date of dismissal.

From this year's crop of unfair dismissal judgments we have learned:

A head teacher's failure to disclose to school governors a close personal relationship she had with a registered sex offender was misconduct justifying dismissal (Reilly v Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council - Supreme Court). This judgment is of particular note as Lord Wilson questions how useful is the long-standing Burchell v BHS reasonableness test, but without reaching a conclusion. The Supreme Court has, in effect, invited argument in a future case.

Misconduct does need to necessarily amount to gross misconduct for a fair dismissal. There is no magic in labelling something as gross misconduct rather than as serious misconduct for unfair dismissal purposes. As ever, each case will be fact specific to determine whether the employer acted reasonably in treating that reason for dismissal as sufficient to justify dismissal (Quintiles Commercial UK Ltd v Barongo - EAT).

The deemed extension of the effective date of termination by statutory minimum notice does not apply where the employer is entitled to immediately dismiss (summary dismissal) by reason of the employee's conduct (Lancaster and Duke Ltd v Wileman - EAT)

An employee's letter giving 'notice' was not an unambiguous resignation. The context for the letter was that the employee was expecting to take up a different role in another department (although that role was subsequently withdrawn) and the tribunal was entitled to read it as giving notice of intention to leave a particular role rather than to terminate employment (East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust v Levy - EAT).

Where an employee is contractually entitled to receipt of Permanent Health Insurance (PHI) payments, absent any over-riding express terms, the courts will imply a term preventing an employee being dismissed where this would deprive them of the benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled under the PHI scheme. While an employee may use the implied term in a breach of contract wrongful dismissal claim, tribunals must not allow that breach to automatically dictate its conclusions on unfair dismissal. Having said that, breach of the implied term will still be a very important relevant factor when assessing fairness (Awan v ICTS UK Ltd - EAT).

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee for taking part in the activities of an independent trade union. Union officials who are also employees will lose this protection where they are found to have acted wholly unreasonably or maliciously in carrying out their functions. But where is the line drawn?

The Court of Appeal confirmed a trade union official was automatically unfairly dismissed despite misuse of confidential information. In the Court's view, it is not uncommon for a union representative to be given, without soliciting it, information that he or she realises has been obtained without the owner's consent. Although it might be said that the only correct course in such circumstances would be to decline the information or destroy it, the court was 'not here concerned with an ethics seminar'. Instead the key question was whether the very limited way in which Mr Morris made use of the obviously illegally obtained information (forwarding it to HR and insisting on a meeting to discuss the contents) was a 'sufficient departure from good industrial relations practice to take his conduct outside the scope of 'trade union activities' .

The Court held the line had not been crossed. At most, some sort of warning for storing and not deleting the information might have been appropriate. The official's conduct was not outside the scope of 'trade union activities' and he was therefore entitled to the statutory automatic unfair dismissal protection (Morris v Metrolink RATP Dev Ltd).

On the tax front, since 6 April the way that termination payments are taxed has changed. All payments in lieu of notice are now treated as earnings subject to tax and class 1 NICs. Effectively, employers are required to subject to tax an amount equivalent to the employee's basic pay (as defined in the new rules) if notice is not worked. However, planned changes making termination payments above £30,000 subject to class 1A NICs (employer liability only) have been postponed even further to April 2020, which is good news for employers.

While case law on transfers of undertakings has been relatively quiet this year we have had some interesting cases and some rare examples:

A renewed warning that if a parent company takes over the day-to-day running of the business of a subsidiary, this may result in a TUPE transfer of the subsidiary's employees to the parent. Significant care should be taken when a parent company decides to show more of an interest in the business of its subsidiary (whether following a share acquisition or otherwise). If the parent starts making decisions and issuing directions in a manner which suggests that it has assumed control of the subsidiary, it could inadvertently become the employer. In Guvera Ltd v Butler a parent company learned that lesson at some considerable cost, with awards for failing to inform and consult on the intra-group transfer amounting to £3.5 million having been made to the numerous claimants in this case.

European case-law in line with existing UK case-law that a temporary cessation of activities prior a transfer does not necessarily prevent the existence of a transfer of undertaking (Colino Sigüenza - CJEU).

A reminder that in assessing whether there has been a service provision change (SPC) to multiple new providers, the effect of fragmentation must be considered when identifying the relevant activity. In some cases, the way a service is carried out post-transfer will be a relevant consideration in determining whether the activities are fundamentally the same as those carried out by the outgoing contractor. It is important to assess the issue of fragmentation early on in the analysis, because in some cases the fragmentation will be so acute that it will no longer be possible to say that there has been a service provision change (London Care Ltd v Henry and others - EAT).

EAT guidance on the meaning of 'undertaking', 'economic entity' and 'administrative function', which is rarely seen in domestic cases. A useful round-up of case law (both domestic and European) in relation to services or entities performing functions within the public sector (Nicholls and others v London Borough of Croydon).

A rare example of a permitted change to terms and conditions following a TUPE transfer. A transferor was not prevented from withdrawing a travel time allowance. The genuine reason for its withdrawal was that it was outdated and unjustified, not for a reason related to the transfer (Tabberer v Mears Ltd - EAT).

It was hard to miss that on 25 May, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) together with the new Data Protection Act 2018 came into force introducing a raft of important changes to the data protection regime. Key changes include:

In July we received Court of Appeal guidance on the balancing test needed when dealing with a ""mixed data"" Subject Access Request and when a third party objects to their data being disclosed (B v General Medical Council):

Although the decision concerns the DPA 1998, it will continue to have relevance under the DPA 2018 and GDPR regime.

This year employers are reminded that checking references given by applicants is an important part of any recruitment process. Especially where experience equates to safety, doing so is critical.

In Francis-McGann v West Atlantic UK Ltd, a pilot applied for a captain position with a freight airline. He falsely claimed to have previously worked as a captain and gave as a referee Mr Desilijic Tiure - in hope that the reference would never be checked. The pilot was appointed as a captain before his references were checked and provided with training based on him already being an experienced captain.

The person who initially decided to hire Mr Francis-McGann was clearly not an obsessive Star Wars fan. When his references were checked, it became obvious that Mr Desilijic Tiure was fictitious, being Jabba Desilijic Tiure, better known as Jabba the Hutt of Star Wars fame! However that was merely the first Episode.

After being summarily dismissed, Mr Francis-McGann brought a tribunal claim for three months' unpaid notice pay! The tribunal had no qualms in dismissing his claim and allowing the employer's cross claim for recovery of training costs in accordance with a contractual clause in the sum of £4,725. The force was clearly not with Mr Francis-McGann.

In July, the EAT gave a warning to prospective employers considering withdrawing a job offer following the receipt of an unsatisfactory reference criticising an applicant's levels of absence in their previous job without first considering whether there was an underlying disability.

In South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust v Lee a prospective employer was liable for discrimination arising from disability when it withdrew a job offer after receiving and relying upon two unsatisfactory references. One of the references was unduly negative and inaccurate because it heavily relied on disability-related absences. The tribunal found the discriminatory reference had more than a minor influence on the new hirer's decision-maker. As such, it did not matter that the non-discriminatory reference may in and of itself have been sufficient cause to withdraw the job offer (although this may be relevant when awarding compensation). Lesson - consider references critically to assess whether any adverse comments in references may relate to disability necessitating follow-up enquiry.

Do employers need to match enhanced maternity pay for fathers taking Shared Parental Leave (ShPL)?

Early in April, the EAT in Ali v Capita Customer Management confirmed that it is not direct sex discrimination for employers to offer 14 weeks' enhanced maternity pay but only statutory ShPL pay.

While this case is in line with Government guidance and the traditional view, it is notable that Mr Ali's case concerned an enhanced maternity pay period of only 14 weeks which happens to be the minimum maternity leave period required under the EU Pregnant Workers Directive. As such, a question mark remains where enhanced contractual maternity pay period exceeds 14 weeks.

While we received at least a limited answer on the question of direct sex discrimination (subject to a pending appeal), the question of indirect sex discrimination is still very much up for grabs. Three weeks after the EAT handed down the Ali judgment, the EAT handed down its related judgment in Hextall v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police.

In Hextall, the same question was considered through the prism of an indirect discrimination claim. In this case the EAT held the original tribunal incorrectly analysed the question of comparators and also failed to correctly identify the particular disadvantage. The case was therefore sent back to the tribunal. The question of indirect discrimination continues to be unresolved and we wait a further tribunal decision (determined on the correct legal basis). Like Ali, Hextall too is subject to a pending appeal.

While large private sector equal pay claims against several large supermarkets are making their way through the tribunal system and the usual endless preliminary issues, this year we have learned:

'Discrimination arising from a disability' is still a relatively new concept first introduced by section 15 of the Equality Act 2010. Over recent years we are gathering a body of case-law on the intricacies of this concept which involves the employer treating the employee ""unfavourably because of something arising in consequence"" of the employee's disability. Section 15 entails two distinct causative issues: The first involves examining the employer's state of mind: did the unfavourable treatment occur because of the employer's attitude to the relevant 'something'? The second is objective: is there a causal link between the disability and the 'something'?

This year we have learned:

In Donelien v Liberata UK, the Court of Appeal reassures employers that they can rely on the advice of occupational health advisers in determining whether an employee is disabled, so long as appropriate questions are raised and further clarification is sought where necessary.

An employer does not necessarily need to take every step possible to establish whether an employee is disabled in order to avoid having constructive knowledge of disability. The test is what an employer could reasonably be expected to know. In this case, the employer had not relied solely on an occupational health report stating that the employee was not disabled. It had also taken into account 'return to work' meetings and letters from the employee's GP. An employer's efforts need not be perfect and, in the circumstances, the employer had taken reasonable steps to ascertain the nature of the employee's illness and could not reasonably have been expected to do more particularly when dealing with an uncooperative employee.

To establish an indirect discrimination claim, the employee will need to show that the employer applied a ""provision, criterion or practice"" (PCP) that puts, or would put, those of the employee's protected group at a particular disadvantage compared to other groups. In Carreras v United First Partners Research, the Court of Appeal held that an expectation that an employee would work late does not have to be presented as an instruction to cause a disadvantage. If the disabled employee can establish the existence of a long-hours culture, this may be enough to amount to a 'practice' under the Equality Act 2010.

In Colt Technology Services Ltd v Brown, the EAT decided an important point regarding the effect of PHI on discrimination compensation, where the employee has had the opportunity to choose different levels of PHI cover through a workplace flexible benefits scheme.

The EAT considered the 'insurance exception' to the general rule that claimants should only be compensated for actual loss. The policy behind the exception is that an employer should not be able to benefit from an employee's prudence in taking out insurance, and so insurance pay outs are not set off against the employee's financial losses in those circumstances. In the context of a flexible benefits package - where an employee can choose the level of their insurance benefits in exchange for foregoing extra salary - this principle must be apportioned. The portion paid for by the employer without the employee foregoing extra salary will be offset (in this case 50%) and the portion for which the employee had foregone extra salary will not (in this case an additional 25%).

In relation to a claim for unlawful victimisation under the Equality Act 2010, ""giving false evidence or information, or making a false allegation, is not a protected act if the evidence or information is given, or the allegation is made in bad faith."" But does an ulterior motive for making a victimisation claim show bad faith?

In Saad v Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust, the EAT confirmed that honesty not motivation is key. The primary question for victimisation purposes is whether the employee has acted honestly in giving the evidence or information, or in making the allegation, that is relied on as a protected act. The existence of a predominant ulterior motive, while potentially relevant, is not the focus of the enquiry. In this case, just because the allegation was raised as a means to deflect criticism during a performance process did not automatically mean it was done in bad faith.

In Unite the Union v Nailard, the Court of Appeal reminds employers that harassment can be committed by inaction was well as action. Failure to act in relation to third party harassment which is brought to the employer's attention, may itself amount to harassment. If the reason for the failure to act was influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the relevant protected characteristic, then that failure to act may itself amount to harassment. Employers should ensure that they train staff on dealing with harassment issues, make it clear that harassment from suppliers, clients and customers is not tolerated and keep clear records of issues arising.

In Bakkali v Greater Manchester Buses, the EAT point out that in harassment claims, context is a crucial element. Conduct ""related to"" a protected characteristic (in the test for harassment) is wider in scope than conduct ""because of"" a protected characteristic (in the test for direct discrimination). It requires a broader enquiry, involving ""a more intense focus"" on the context of the offending words or behaviour.

The Holy Grail: financially sustainable access to justice.

Following last year's abolition of tribunal fees by the Supreme Court, the number of claims has been steadily increasing. While the number of individual tribunal claims overall has not yet returned to the pre- 2013 introduction of the fees regime level, we have reached an important statistical milestone. September's quarterly statistics revealed that single-claim receipts are, for the first time, at a higher level than when fees were first introduced.

While the number of claims is set to rise over the near future, the Ministry of Justice in November announced that a new fee regime ""balancing tribunal funding and access to justice"" was ""in development"".

Four years after the introduction of mandatory ACAS early conciliation (EC) we finally have appellate level confirmation on how to apply the 'stop the clock' provisions. In April, the EAT confirmed the widely accepted view that the time limit to present a claim should always be extended by the number of days it takes to complete the EC procedure (Luton Borough Council v Haque).

While there are several rankings published every year by individual organisations, MHRD accepts NIRF (National Institute of Ranking Framework) ranking. According to 2018-2019 rankings, IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Bangalore, IIM Calcutta, IIM Lucknow and IIT Bombay are the top 5 B-Schools in India.

With CAT 2018 Result inching closer, aspirants are scrutinising their options for colleges. Everyone has already started looking at the plethora of ranking of MBA colleges in India. However, there is a world beyond rankings. The second critical factor to consider is placements. Most candidates look into past placement records of colleges before they take admission. In this regard also, NIRF has made things easy by providing actual placement statistics, which the institutes have officially submitted to them.

As per them, the top 5 B-Schools in India on basis of the average package offered are IIM A, B, C, SPJIMR, XLRI. Their median placements in the 2016-17 batch were respectively 2148548, 2000000, 2000000, 2000000, 1900000. Please note that here we are talking about median placements and not highest packages.

Arranging top 50 B-Schools in India on basis of their median placements, the highest is 2148548 and lowest is 300000. But, as you can see, placements do not solely determine ranking. Because SPJIMR has fourth best placements yet has an overall rank of 19. Likewise, XLRI has fifth best placement yet ranks at number 5. Another example is IIFT, with 1507000 median placement, is 12th best in terms of placements and yet is at 23rd rank.

So what other things matter?

Advertising

Candidates should also consider aspects such as diversity, scholarships, infrastructure, research projects undertaken by the institute, consultancy projects undertaken by the institute and qualifications of faculty members. Checking accreditation, the affiliation of the college is also important. CAT 2018 exam apart, there are many MBA entrance exams like MAH MBA CET that are yet to happen, that open gateway for admission to several good colleges.

Also, take into consideration that rankings are prone to loopholes. The fact that colleges such as FMS Delhi, JBIMS, NMIMS, XIMB are not in NIRF ranking, for any reason, begets for candidates to go for a second opinion.

Third, but a really important factor to choose the perfect MBA college, is fees. Top colleges for MBA / PGDM that have low fees are FMS Delhi, JBIMS Mumbai, NITIE Mumbai, TISS Mumbai, IIT Delhi, IIT Roorkee, DMS Pune / PUMBA, BHU, Delhi School of Economics, JMI University. At FMS, the annual tuition fee is approximately Rs 10,480 per year which is one of the lowest pan-India.

Candidates are aware that pursuing a management program usually requires a lot of investment (fee is usually around 25 lakhs), and moreover, those 2 years will shape their future. Hence, good planning is critical while selecting colleges.

Aspirants can also get a better picture of what the college is like by connecting with alumni or present students of a B-Schools. However, it is not uncommon to come across extreme reviews, hence utilize student feedbacks and reviews by exercising best judgement. Wishing you the very best for your CAT Result 2018, and MBA Admission 2019.

Claims for indirect expropriation may arise through environmental regulatory regimes. Where legislative schemes operate to interfere with existing property rights, such interference may constitute de facto, or indirect, expropriation. One example of a legislative regime that has been the subject of indirect expropriation claims is the federal Species at Risk Act (the ""SARA""). Under the SARA, the Governor in Council is empowered to make emergency orders to provide for the protection of certain wildlife species. The emergency protection order may extend not only to Crown land, but also private property. The SARA provides for a limited compensation scheme. The Minister may provide for reasonable compensation for losses suffered ""as a result of any extraordinary impact of the application of"" the emergency protection order. The Governor in Council may make regulations with respect to the procedures to be followed and the methods to be used to determine the compensation.

The sage grouse order exemplifies how a SARA emergency protection order may give rise to an expropriation claim. The sage grouse order was the first emergency protection order to be issued under section 80 of the SARA. It was issued to protect the greater sage grouse population in Alberta and Saskatchewan, and came into force on February 18, 2014. The sage grouse is an endangered species under the SARA and Alberta's Wildlife Act. Under the Wildlife Act it is an offence to ""willfully molest, disturb, ore destroy a house, nest or den"" of sage grouse. The sage grouse order restricted activities on 1,672 km2 of provincial and federal Crown lands in southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan.

In The City of Medicine Hat et al v Canada (AG) et al, LGX Oil and Gas and the City of Medicine Hat, which had interests in the Manyberries oil production site that was affected by the sage grouse order, brought a judicial review and constitutional challenge of the sage grouse order at the Federal Court of Canada. The applicants successfully resisted a summary dismissal motion brought by the Crown and subsequently commenced an action at the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench for $123.6 million in compensation (including accelerated reclamation costs) for de facto expropriation of existing oil and gas mineral rights, leases and rights-of-way. This case is ongoing. At this point, the Governor in Council has not made regulations with respect to compensation. The Crown pleads that the emergency protection order is regulatory and, in the alternative, that compensation under the SARA is discretionary. In the further alternative, the Governor in Council had chosen not to make regulations, and the emergency order did not have an ""extraordinary impact"" on the plaintiffs.

Another case was Groupe Maison Candiac Inc v Canada (AG). This case concerns the second emergency protection order made under the SARA, which protects the western chorus frog. The western chorus frog is listed on the SARA's list of endangered species as a threatened species in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The emergency protection order prohibits excavation, deforestation and construction within a two km2 area in the municipalities of La Prairie, Candiac and St-Philippe, Quebec to protect the frog and its habitat. This order was the first time a SARA emergency protection order restricted development on private land.

As a result of the western frog order, Groupe Maison Candiac Inc. (""Groupe Maison"") was forced to reduce its residential development by 171 units after construction was already underway and Groupe Maison had obtained the requisite municipal and provincial approvals. Groupe Maison brought a judicial review of the emergency protection order by way of a constitutional challenge and an expropriation claim. The Federal Court dismissed the application, finding that: (1) section 4(c)(ii) of the SARA is within the federal government's jurisdiction over criminal law; and protected by the doctrine of ancillary powers, including jurisdiction over peace, order and good governance; (2) the western chorus frog order did not amount to expropriation that required compensation; and (3) the Parliament had already provided a mechanism for compensation under the SARA that applies in ""extraordinary circumstances.""

In 2017, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change received three petitions to recommend to the Governor in Council for an emergency order to protect the southern mountain woodland caribou population. The Minister conducted an Imminent Threat Assessment and, on May 4, 2018, determined that the southern mountain caribou faced imminent threats requiring intervention for recovery. An emergency protection order may be forthcoming for Alberta and British Columbia. The SARA public registry and the Canada Gazette will provide updates on this matter.

Alberta's Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (the ""EPEA"") is another environmental protection legislation that affects expropriation claims. As one of its purposes, the EPEA adopts the ""polluter pays"" principle to address contamination. The EPEA includes three regulatory mechanisms with respect to contamination: (1) Part 5 Division 1 concerns the release of substances generally; (2) Part 5 Division 2 concerns contaminated sites designation; and (3) Part 6 deals with conservation and reclamation. Further, the EPEA expressly acknowledges an affected person's recourse to court through private civil claims. Some of the key concepts related to the three regulatory mechanisms are considered below.

Part 5 Division 1 of the EPEA deals with the release of substances into the environment. Under section 112, the person responsible for the substance has the duty to take remedial measures with respect to any release of same. Environmental protection orders may also be issued to the person responsible for the substance where the release is causing, has caused or may cause an adverse effect.

The statutory definition of ""person responsible"" includes: (1) owner and previous owner of substance; (2) every person who has or has had charge, management or control of the substance; (3) successor, assignee, executor, administrator, receiver, receiver‑manager or trustee of (1) to (2); and (4) principal or agent of (1) to (3). The ""person responsible' excludes, unless they release new or additional substances: (1) a municipality in respect of land shown on its tax arrears list, or land acquired by it by dedication or gift of an environmental reserve, municipal reserve, school reserve, road, utility lot or right of way; (2) a person who investigates or tests the land for the purpose of determining the environmental condition of that parcel; and (3) the Minister responsible for the Unclaimed Personal Property and Vested Property Act, with respect to a parcel of land to which that Act applies. Thus, it appears that the notion of ""person responsible"" is based on one's relationship to the substance/release only, and not based on the cause of the release.

Part 5 Division 2 of the EPEA provides for the designation of contaminated sites. Under section 129 of the EPEA, the Director may designate a site as a contaminated site and issue an environmental protection order to a person responsible for the contaminated site. The Director must consider several factors before issuing an environmental protection order for a contaminated site, including: (1) due diligence of the owner or previous owner; (2) whether the presence of the substance at the site was caused solely by the act or omission of another person, other than an employee, agent or person with whom the owner or previous owner has or had a contractual relationship; and (3) the price the owner paid for the site and the relationship between that price and the fair market value of the site had the substance not been present.

The ""person responsible for the contaminated site"" means: (1) a person responsible for the substance that is in, on or under the contaminated site; (2) any other person who the Director considers caused or contributed to the release of the substance into the environment; (3) the owner of the contaminated site; (4) any previous owner of the contaminated site who was the owner at any time when the substance was in, on or under the contaminated site; (5) a successor, assignee, executor, administrator, receiver, receiver‑manager or trustee of a person referred to in any of subclauses (2) to (4); and (6) a person who acts as the principal or agent of a person referred to in any of subclauses (2) to (5). As was the case with Division 1, the definition of ""person responsible for the contaminated site"" again excludes municipalities and investigators. In this case, the test is based on the relationship to the substance/release and the property.

In practice, Division 2 is rarely used. Designation will only occur as a last resort when there are no other appropriate tools. There have only been five instances of designation of a contaminated site since 1993 and no environmental protection order appears to have been issued under Division 2. Division 2 offers options otherwise unavailable, including the allocation of responsibility to present and past site owners who may have contractually assumed liability for the pollution, remedial actions plans and agreements with the Director, and the apportionment of costs of remedial work among responsible parties. The Minister may also pay compensation to any person who suffers loss or damage as a direct result of the application of Part 5 Division 2.

Environmental contamination may affect the valuation of expropriated property. Under the Expropriation Act, compensation for expropriation is based on the market value of the expropriated land, which is in turn ""the amount realized if sold in the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer"", and provable damages. The determination of market value accounts for everything that is present in the site, except for the legislated exclusions found in section 45 of the Expropriation Act.

Contamination introduces issues in valuing expropriated property, given the uncertainty in liability exposure, scope, duration, risk and stigma. Below are some case law on the interaction between the expropriation of contaminated lands and the ""polluter pays"" principle.

In Toronto (City) v Bernardo, the respondent Bernardo was the registered owner of a property and permitted the corporate respondent's scrap metal business on property rent-free by oral licence to occupy. The City of Toronto served and published notice to expropriate property. The City conducted environmental testing on property which showed contamination, and was advised that clean-up costs for property could be in range of $250,000 to $750,000. The appraised value of the property was $242,500 before taking into consideration site remediation or clean-up costs. Given the estimated cost of remediation which exceeded value of land, the City's offer of compensation to the respondents was $1. The respondents did not request compensation hearing but refused to surrender possession. The City brought motion for order to take possession. The Ontario Supreme Court granted the City's motion as the respondents had the opportunity to contest the City's offer of compensation in proceedings before the Ontario Municipal Board and chose not to take any action to assert claims for compensation.

In Thompson v Alberta (Minister of Environment), the claimant had purchased land for the sum of $1 million. At the time of purchase, the land was not part of any property acquired by the Crown for a proposed transportation corridor. The Crown reviewed roadway plan within months of claimant's purchase and determined that land was a necessary part of the corridor. The Crown expropriated land for $1,025,000. The claimant brought action for increased compensation. The action was allowed in part. The claimant was granted $1,120,000. The Crown's valuation discounted the value of the property because of the unknown cost of filling or remediating a wetland (which is 50% of the property) for future residential development, which posed an economic challenge for a prospective purchaser. The Court found that the cost of remediation calculated by the Crown was based on premature assumption that land was to be developed in isolation with no possible cost sharing by adjacent developers. The Court, however, recognized that a discount must be applied for market value because of this possibility of remediation.

In Ville de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu c Cour du Québec, the subject property included a grocery store, snack-bar and a retail marina fuel distribution outlet for vessels navigating on Chambly canal, and a gas station for road vehicles. The issue before the Court was whether the costs of decontamination should be deducted from the compensation awarded for expropriation, based on the duty to remediate. It was argued that evidence demonstrated that there was a spill onto the neighbouring property, therefore the question as to cessation of activities no longer applied, and the mandatory provisions of the EQA regarding decontamination was triggered. The Tribunal Administratif du Québec (the ""TAQ"") ruled that the total remediation cost of $450,000 be paid by the owner of the property, 9092-9340 Québec Inc. (""9092"") and should be deducted from its expropriation indemnity award. The value of the expropriated property, after deduction of the decontamination costs, was established as being $31,000.

The Court of Quebec allowed the appeal, holding that the finding of the TAQ was unreasonable and profoundly unfair. Were it not for the expropriation, 9092 could have ceased its activity at its own time, negotiated with a willing purchaser and, based upon the projects of the purchaser, negotiated the decontamination works remaining according to the circumstances. The City deprived 9092 of its right to complete the decontamination work at the time that it deemed the most suitable to its interests and subject to conditions that would have been more favourable. By forcing 9092 to assume the costs of decontamination estimated by the City engineer, the TAQ deprived the owner of the quasi-totality of the value of the expropriated property. The City brought a judicial review application which was subsequently dismissed. The Court found that the systemic analysis undertaken by the Court of Quebec highlights the significant defects and the fragility of the TAQ ruling to assign full liability to 9092 for the estimated costs of decontamination of the property.

Case law suggests that the law is not blind to the causation of the contamination when evaluating the market value of an expropriated property that has been contaminated. Liability for the remediation of contaminated land in Alberta clearly rests with ""person responsible for the substance"" and, in the rare case of designated contaminated sites, ""person responsible for the contaminated site."" Liability for contamination does not run with the land in Alberta.

This leads to the question of what is the intent of the law in respect of a faultless landowner for the environmental depreciation of land in the expropriation context. The principles of statutory interpretation apply to deem the legislature as knowing all the law and the necessary statutory language to give effect to its intention. The EPEA and the Expropriation Act are meant to be interpreted harmoniously as a scheme in cases of expropriation involving contamination. The Expropriation Act is a remedial statute. Accordingly, it must be given a broad and liberal interpretation consistent with its purpose.

Currently, the right of a faultless landowner to recover from a ""person responsible"" remediation costs in civil claims (whether under the common law or the EPEA) is a chose in action. This chose in action does not appear to be considered in the calculation of market value in expropriation. In the new era of third-party litigation funding, a chose in action for remediation costs is a valuable element that may offset some or all of the discounts associated with contaminated land, even in an open market.

But, it isn't all about violence; the game offers a chance for romance & more.

New Delhi: The Island of Sanhok in the blue Pacific waters is serene. With lush green vegetation and ancient ruins, it could be your perfect holiday destination. The only problem is that people here are looking to kill, and Indians are obsessed with it.

Welcome to the world of Player Unknown's Battlegrounds or PUBG, a multiplayer video game. The objective of the game is to be the last man or team standing.

Since its launch in 2017 by South Korean company BlueHole, PUBG has become a rave among millennials worldwide. The company eventually set up a subsidiary -- PUBG Corp -- to solely focus on the game. This March, it launched a free mobile version of the game in partnership with Tenecent.

In India, PUBG has emerged the best loved video game, according to a Google research report. A Quartz study found that nearly 62% of its 1,047 respondents were playing the game. Most of the respondents were males (92.1%) in the age group of 16 to 24 years.

This demographic has given rise to young adults with gaming addictions, so much so that schools in Bengaluru recently began issuing warnings to parents about it.

As a game, PUBG is destructive and confrontational. That is precisely what keeps Indian youth glued to it.

""According to Freud, humans need food, sex and violence to survive. This game takes care of the violence part really well,"" says Anirban Roy, a Mumbai-based analyst who began playing PUBG as a college student.

Psychologist Prateeskha Khatri explains that the violence gives people a feeling of superiority and victory, which keeps drawing them back.

""There is a lot of hitting and shooting that goes on throughout the game. The sense of victory after killing an opponent overpowers the players. Hence, they do not mind the violent nature of the game at all,"" she says.

As a student, Roy used to spend up to six hours daily playing. Now, the 24-year-old plays the game for about an hour before he goes to bed.

""You can kill people mercilessly and also communicate with the victims. It gives the players a sense of superiority. When you are angry with the opponent, the in-built voice chat automatically kicks in to connect the two players. So you can even instill fear and intimidation,"" says Roy.

While playing, the body releases dopamine, a mood-lifting chemical that induces an adrenaline rush in gamers. This feeding of dopamine is how the game becomes addictive, explains clinical psychologist Roshni Bhagnani.

""Dopamine is also released during gambling, drug and alcohol abuse. (Such) Violent games give players a medium to let out their otherwise suppressed emotions,"" she says.

PUBG is also gripping because of the game's narrative. The storytelling is left to the players and it's up to them to make or break it. As players move up the levels, the individual stories of their game avatars also build.

Since PUBG can be played from a smartphone, and doesn't require a console or a computer, it's easy access also enables the addiction.

""You get a full-fledged game with all features of a multiplayer for free on a hand-held device. This is why PUBG is so popular,"" says Joy Goldar, a Delhi-based game developer.

Much like any addiction, PUBG is disruptive in reality too. Players often cut themselves off from the rest of the world, forego sleep and other basic needs to keep pace with the game.

Debayan Purkayastha, a 24-year-old brand management employee from Bengaluru, sleeps about four hours a day to be able to play and hold down a regular job. ""I play till 4 am and wake up at 8 to go to office,"" he says.

How does he do it? An abundance of black coffee through the week, and sleeping through the weekend.

""I have stopped socialising with people, devoting whatever free time I have to PUBG. It is better than human interaction and I have no regrets,"" he adds.

Psychologist Bhagnani says addicts prefer spending time in the virtual world because it helps them avoid their real emotions.

""It is easier, and there is greater thrill in unlocking targets and meeting goals. Social interaction and peer engagement may start to seem less gratifying in comparison,"" she explains.

For a 24-year-old psychology student from Delhi, the game has become a space to vent anger. A sexual harassment survivor, the tactical violence of PUBG is her way of coping.

""It is a good channel for taking out my frustration. The noise and killing without guilt gives me a sense of peace,"" she says.

In some extreme cases, this can lead to deadly consequences. As was the case of a 19-year-old who killed his parents and sister in Delhi and tried to make it look like a robbery. The teen had rented a flat to be able to play video games all day. Psychologists linked his psychopathic tendency to the violent nature of the games he played.

It's not all bad news, though. In the right measure, PUBG has its redeeming qualities. Amidst the gore, some have found self-confidence, and others even love!

Akshay Lokhande has enjoyed finding his voice in the game, quite literally.

""I have been told that my voice is quite different. It is heavy and nice. So whenever I play with a random squad, they are quite intrigued by my voice. It makes me feel good about myself,"" says the 28-year-old animator from Mumbai.

By default, the voice chat feature is turned on, which allows players to interact with their teammates.

For Malancha Biswas, a self-described introvert and second-year sociology student, PUBG is where she met the ""love of her life"".

""I come from a girls' college, so it is nearly impossible for me to meet and interact with guys of my age. Dating apps like Tinder and Hinge suck. Mostly, you end up meeting creeps. So I spend most of my free time playing PUBG,"" says Biswas. It was in this time she met her boyfriend Rishi.

""We used the voice-call to connect. He had a sexy voice. I plucked up my courage and asked for his number,"" she says.

Roy remembers his girlfriend getting upset about the amount of time he spent gaming.

""My girlfriend would be suspicious of me because she heard stories of people meeting on PUBG and going on dates. It's the new Tinder!""

Prateek Goyal and his friends have turned PUBG into their hang out spot. Since the group is spread out across time zones, the game makes keeping in touch more fun.

""It's probably the easiest way to catch up with friends. Everyone from my school group is on a different continent right now. So we play PUBG and talk while playing. That way we are doing something together, and it is a lot like school,"" says the 26-year-old game developer from Delhi.

Anumita Joshi, a school counselor based in Pune, says what PUBG does for Goyal and others like him is provide a sense of collective reinforcement.

""Imagine spending an hour in the game with your old friends. The fact that you are talking to each other in spite of being miles apart is satisfying. The game-play might be violent but a minor kill as a group instills a sense of collective achievement,"" she says.

As PUBG players parachute over islands and drop right in to the thick of the action, they are creating survival strategies not just for the virtual, but also their real worlds.

Every level cleared in the game is an achievement that boosts gamers in their regular lives. Add to that the possibility of romance and friendship, it does seem that PUBG can feel more real than not.

A special CBI court in Mumbai is likely to pronounce the verdict in the sensational Sohrabuddin Sheikh-Tulsiram Prajapati alleged fake encounter case of 2005 in which 22 persons, most of them policemen, are on trial.

The case has attracted much attention as BJP chief Amit Shah, who was Minister of State for Home in Gujarat at the time of the incidents, was one of the accused before being discharged in 2014. During the trial, as many as 92 prosecution witnesses turned hostile.

Most of the accused are junior-level police officials from Gujarat and Rajasthan. The court earlier discharged, for want of evidence, 16 of the 38 persons charge-sheeted by the CBI. These included Amit Shah, the then Rajasthan Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria, former Gujarat Police chief PC Pande and former senior Gujarat police officer D G Vanzara.

2. IPS Officer Rajnish Rai Suspended as CIAT Chittoor Principal

Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rajnish Rai has been suspended by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs for allegedly 'abdicating' his office as the IG and Principal of CRPF training school at Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh.

Rai, who had arrested DG Vanzara and two other IPS officers in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh alleged fake encounter case in 2007, was serving as inspector general and principal of the Counter Insurgency and Anti-Terrorism (CIAT) School of the Central Reserve Police Force.

Rai had been placed under suspension for 'unauthorised handing over the charge of IG and Principal, CIAT School, CRPF, Chittoor and abdication of office on November 30.'

Rai had earlier this year sought voluntary retirement with effect from November 30 after completing 50 years of age under the provisions of the All India Services (Death-Cum-Retirement Benefit) Rules, 1958, but the Centre rejected his request in October.

4. Non-Registration of FIR: HC Issues Notice to Gujarat Govt

The Gujarat High Court issued notices to the state government and Director General of Police (DGP) over a petition filed by a woman, after she sought the court's direction to police to file a FIR against a woman police constable for duping her.

According to the petitioner, Nirmalakumari Rao, she had paid Rs 3 lakh to Anandiben Barot who is a constable at Dehgam police station, as the latter had promised the former success in Lok Rakshak Dal Exam last year.

Digital Banking Market size is driven by the technological advancements in the banking sector. The advent of the interactive services with fewer clicks and customized product offerings have led to a rise in the mobile banking, contributing to the market growth. For instance, mobile applications and websites that save customer data and offer real-time personalized services in response to changing customer habits. Furthermore, the omnichannel product experience that allows customers to initiate the transaction on a device and complete on another is one of the factors that drive the market. This has led to a responsive web design with a source code that adjusts based on the limitations of the screen or device.

The partnership and collaboration between the banks and fintech companies are the primary factors supporting the market. Most banks have launched their own online services to cater to the demand for the digital banking solutions. They are collaborating with the fintech companies and online service providers to enhance their customer base. For instance, in 2016, Clydesdale Bank & Yorkshire Bank collaborated to launch ""B"", a bank operating online only which provides a current account with debit and credit card facilities and contactless payment through mobile wallets such as Apple Pay and Android Pay. Other banks, such as Commercial Bank of Dubai, HSBC, and BNP Paribas, have also launched their online banking services to capitalize the growth in the fintech industry.

The payment verticals in the digital banking market are banking cards, Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Uniform Payment Interface (UPI), mobile wallets, Point Of Sale (POS), mobile banking, internet banking, and micro ATMs. The banking cards and internet banking applications are estimated to experience a high growth due to their widespread acceptance among business enterprises and merchants. The multichannel payment options offered by these payment methods have also contributed to their growth. Mobile wallets are the fastest growing payment verticals due to their convenience and widespread acceptance.

The North American region is leading the digital banking market due to its early adoption of technology and the high density of smartphone users. For instance, the population aged between 20-30 was the first to have access to broadband connections in their houses or own a smartphone in middle school, resulting in a better understanding of the digital media. Europe has emerged as the second largest revenue generator in the global digital banking market. High literacy rate and knowledge of mobile and internet banking services are the major contributors to the growth in the region.

Some of the industry verticals in which digital banking has been adopted are retail, corporate, and investments. The cost reduction, improved customer focus, and analytics for better understanding the customer needs are driving the market growth. However, the increasing cybercrimes and lack of awareness are the factors hindering the growth in the market. Furthermore, internet connectivity issues are also one of the major constraints associated with the growth of the market.

The market dynamic forces have been determined after conducting a detailed study of the Global Recycled Metal Market.

Europe recycled metal market share is projected witness gains of more than 4% during the forecast timeframe. This is primarily due to stringent laws and legislations imposed by environmental regulatory bodies in Europe, which has triggered metal recycling to reduce the carbon footprint and help save the environment from hazardous waste generated. For instance, Directive 2008/98/EC imposed by European Commission defines basic concepts related to waste management.

Sample copy of this report @

www.gminsights.com/request-sample/detail/2792

According to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc. Recycled Metal Market size is forecast to exceed USD 125 billion by 2024

Industry Growth drivers are

* Rapidly growing construction industry in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East

* Strong product demand from electrical & electronics industry in North America

* Stringent & supporting legislations for metal recycling in Europe

It signifies terms and conditions related to waste, recycling and recovery. Moreover, Directive 2012/19/EU prevent the generation of electrical & electronic waste and to promote reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery to reduce the quantity of waste to be eliminated, whilst also improving the environmental performance. These trends are likely to make significant impact on the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Recycled non ferrous metal market size was valued more than USD 90 billion in 2017. Non ferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, lead, precious metals and other metals such as nickel, zinc, tin, palladium, etc. These metals find wide-ranging applications across construction, electrical & electronics, transport, consumer goods, industrial machinery, nuclear, military and several other end-user industry. For instance, lead is widely used electronics in batteries, ammunition, cable sheathing, etc.

Lead batteries are used in transport industry and constituted approximately 35% of the total industry share in terms of volume in 2017. These trends will help boost the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

In terms of volume, recycled metal market share for building & construction constituted close to 45% of the total business share in 2017. It is mainly due to comprehensive recycled metal applications in the building & construction industry. For example, ferrous metals (iron and steel) are broadly used in the construction of large steel frameworks in the building, bridges, drainage components and various other architectural frameworks.

Furthermore, non ferrous metals including aluminum, copper and lead are also utilized in the building & construction sector. Lead sheets are used for roofing, cladding of vertical walls, soundproofing in partitions and ceilings in office, school and hotel buildings. These trends will help make considerable contribution to reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

North America electrical & electronics industry is on the rise which is due to consistently changing consumer's preferences and continuous technology upgradation. For instance, the electrical & electronics industry was valued more than USD 900 billion in 2016 and accounted for a total of 21% of the global electrical & electronics industry. These trends will drive reprocessed metal demand owing to its wide spread applications in metal plating electronics via electrodeposition. It provides improved corrosion resistance, enhanced electrical conductivity and improved solderability which helps in protecting against wear.

Furthermore, precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, rhodium, etc. are also widely applicable in the electronics industry owing to its unique physical and chemical properties which provides reliability to the electronics sector. It will help attain significant gains to the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

Ineffective metal reprocessing is a key constraint which is probable to impede the global reprocessed metal market size by 2024. For instance, only 40% of the total copper produced is attained from recycling and 33% of the total aluminum produced is attained from recycling process. Nevertheless, rising emphasis on metal processing and reusability to reduce carbon footprint and impact of hazardous waste will generate plentiful opportunities for the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Key reprocessed metal market players are Sims Metal Management, Steel Dynamics, European Metal Recycling, Nucor Corporation, ELG HanielGmbh, Schnitzer Steel and Novelis. The market players are expanding their capacity to process metal to attain profitability in the market. For example, Novelis announced to build flat-rolled aluminum plant in January 2018 in Kentucky U.S. for USD 300 million.

And this is exactly the situation that we are facing today in our Khasi-Pnar society. And who could possibly feel the direct threat and impact of this situation are the innocent citizens who are not politically or materialistically ambitious in life. From various incidences that have happened in the state recently and during the past few years, we see the breakdown of the rule of law and flouting of the law despite many prohibitions that are in place which I need not elaborate. Even though we always stake claims on customary laws that govern our society, they are mostly in oral form lacking the appropriate authority and power of modern jurisprudence. And the fact that the Khasis never had their own scripts is just another analogy to indicate the nature of hesitation of the people to come under any contract law or agreement but to rely solely on the conscience and conduct of the person, which is not suitable for the administration of justice in a modern state.

On the issue of leadership crisis, this is not a new development but is as old as the community itself. The primary reasons are perhaps that the Khasis have migrated to these hills not as a whole bunch of community or tribe but as individual clans in different times and seasons. And if this is the case then obviously there were frequent conflicts and misunderstandings on governance, land for settlement, etc. Hence, in some instances, these problems have percolated to every subsequent generation and its nature is also being inherited by many individuals and groups till date. But the prominent among these was on who should be the in leading roles because all clans are equal in status. Therefore, the most ideal situation is to have a third person to preside over them such as the 'Chieftain' or the 'Syiem'. Thus in most cases the Syiem is always from outside their circle or an outsider.

As a community we have not been able to raise good leaders for the society because we are so divided politically and culturally into various groups of different thoughts and ideologies which is a result of that crisis. And the reason why I am saying this is because I do not see any capable Chief Minister from among the Khasi-Pnar community as of now and in the near future. The root of the problem lies in the fact that people at large have never understood the basic principles and values of leadership. And those who think and see themselves as leaders are relying exclusively on external factors such as finance, qualification and strategies which can be easily acquired but yet are not intrinsic human characters that will define true leadership. Self-styled leaders may be plenty but genuine and systematic leadership comes from the system within. We have therefore failed as a community and the state as a whole in this aspect.

Apart from this traditional nature, another major modern factor that has contributed immensely to this ongoing leadership crisis is the exemption of this topic from the entire educational curriculum. Right from the very inception of our educational system, this issue was perceived as academically irrelevant and unnecessary. The reason I am saying this is because nowhere in the past, during our school and college days have we ever come across the term leadership. And the primary goal of education was and is to get a government job at any cost in any capacity be it technical, clerical, secretarial and teaching as a security for life. Leadership is such a term which is strange and unfamiliar to the learning community during the past generations and in the present as well. Therefore, there is a lack of leadership skills in every department and sector of governance to ignite the mechanism of growth and development. Leadership et al is only learned in other courses of higher studies and prominently in the Management Institutes. Thank God for such institutions that are now available in our state but how many students from the native state are getting the privilege to enroll in these institutions. The CBSE on the other hand has gone much ahead by introducing leadership right from the primary level. This is outstanding because the opportunity to experience and taste the idea, concepts and challenges of leadership should begin from a very early age. Here again we can question the wisdom of our education policy and the competency therein in the mission and vision to shape the lives of our children and the future generation.

Look at the political parties that are functioning in our state and their leaders. Do we have any hope on any of them? They are there only for the sake of power and position during elections and when they lose the elections they just vanish into thin air. I just happened to watch a programme in a local TV channel attended by our Deputy Chief Minister as Chief Guest on the anniversary celebration of one local church where he unfortunately said, 'Katba nang bun ki balang, katta nang bun ki jingsniew' (the more churches, the more the crimes). What a silly statement from the Deputy CM! Does he mean to say that churches are propagating crimes? As a responsible person he should have put things the other way round. Just because he is in a position of power he has no authority to define things lavishly. It is here that leadership is also like an image that reflects the entire quality of an individual because a simple statement may ruin and damage the whole community thereby hurting the sentiments of many sincere adherents.

We always blame lack of unity for the sorry state of affairs, but in fact unity is the synchronization of each and every effort where we are all components of that effort. The concept of leadership as perceived by many especially the rural population is the strength of financial muscles. What a pathetic situation when money decides who gets elected and who forms the government. So what can we expect from people who pay money for votes? Nothing much, except that they will do all they can to recover their investment in the next five year.

Therefore, there is an immediate need to inculcate the values and qualities of leadership right from the primary level of schooling in order to build the state and community for the future."

The story that emerges from Arvind Lal's book is undoubtedly fascinating. It begins with a terrible tragedy of Arvind's only brother, younger than him, who, in a state of drunkenness, shot dead his father, a pre-World War II commissioned Army doctor, who after opting for premature retirement in 1947, was successfully running a pathology laboratory. Arvind's mother and he dealt with the shattering shock and its aftermath, thanks to her courage and support of their family's spiritual mentor, a very young and devout saint known as Haidakhan Baba.

A student of Delhi's Modern School, Arvind's ambition of becoming a naval aviator was put paid to owing to weak eyesight and on the advice of his uncle, a naval officer, he chose medicine and joined the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC), Pune, where after MBBS, he was back for post-graduation and also assigned as a teacher and hostel warden, the only ever civilian to hold that post. While medical college hostels are known for their lack of dull moments, some anecdotes of incidents in the AFMC hostel related in the book only prove how adventurous and at times quite over-adventurous the students are.

Following the ordeal of his father's death and its aftermath, Arvind's mother and he got set to face the future. Arvind had to leave the enviable triple involvement at AFMC to take over, his father's legacy of a path lab.

Maj. Dr S.K. Lal began his career as an Army doctor in the Indian Medical Service, later re-named Royal Indian Army Medical Corps and belonged to a genre of Indian Army doctors who saved many a soldier's life in very challenging conditions of a bloody World War II, in which 250,000 Indian Armed Forces formed a highly war-winning component of the Allies. After partition, Maj. Lal, a pathologist by profession, came to partitioned India from Rawalpindi, which became part of Pakistan and having left the Army, set up a lab in Delhi as the Central Clinical Laboratory in 1949, with about 30 patients visiting it everyday.

After taking over his father's lab, Dr Arvind Lal changed its name to Dr Lal PathLabs and not much later, launched new testing methods and introduced more tests. Reacting to the first technological challenge, Arvind added an auto analyser after it was launched in 1982 and the first testing for hormones in India in a private lab was done by Dr. Lal Pathlabs in 1981. Before that no thyroid test could be done in a private lab. That thought led him to create collection centres in different parts of the city. From there on, a patient could visit a centre close to his house, give his blood sample, go back to his house eat his breakfast and again in two hours come back and collect his reports. And this is how Arvind introduced franchising -- probably for the first time in healthcare in the world.

Since 1980, Dr Lal PathLabs is following the same kind of franchise agreement. Today, more than 95 per cent of the collection centres are franchised. With this, Dr Arvind Lal solved one of the greatest problems in healthcare -- that of accessibility. Presently, Dr Lal PathLabs conducts about 700 home visits everyday, operating nearly 200 labs, including Asia's biggest lab at Rohini, New Delhi with 2,100 collection centres and pick-up samples from another 5,000 medical establishments all over India. The lab tests over 70,000 patients everyday and its record till 2017, has been of having tested over 15.5 million patients.

Arvind and his family maintained their close contact with Haidakhan Baba and no matter what agnostics or cynics is think or say, there is power in spiritual devotion, meditation and linked issues related to the Hindu religion or civilisation, which the Western world does not understand but has done enough damage to.

Dr Lal PathLabs (LPL) has become one of the most reputed laboratories in Asia, having to its credit a record of 28 labs accredited from the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL, Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India). It has achieved international recognition for the Indian healthcare industry in the form of accreditation from the College of American Pathologists (CAP -- USA).

Dr. Lal has revolutionised laboratory medicine by introducing the maximum number of new tests, instruments and ICT (Information, Communications, Technology) systems in India. His R&D unit has done India proud by developing the latest tests in molecular diagnostics, cytogenetics, genetics and many more. The aim of the R&D division is to provide highly specialised tests at low cost to the weaker sections of the society.

Arvind is a member of many expert and advisory bodies constituted by the central and the state governments. He is accredited to having the first PPP (Public Private Partnership) in the field of laboratory testing with the government of Tripura since 2004 and later with the government of Gujarat for testing over 30,000 newborn babies in 2011-2012. In 2017, NITI Aayog appointed him as the convenor of the Working Group on Diagnostics that submitted a model PPP to the Aayog that will form the template for future PPPs in diagnostics with the Central & state governments.

He is currently the chairman of the Health Services Committee, FICCI. Dr Lal is also an active member of NATHEALTH, Healthcare Federation of India, National Healthcare Committee of CII and has played a significant role in promoting the Indian healthcare sector abroad. He is also leading the Healthcare Sector Skill Council (HSSC) Curriculum Development Committee for paramedical training in the field of laboratory medicine.

Appointed as the honorary physician to the President of India in 2001, Dr Lal has also been serving as a pathologist to almost all the past and present Presidents and Prime Ministers of India. His laboratory is the nodal laboratory testing the largest number of government employees in India from CGHS, ECHS, the Ministry of Railways, Delhi government and many others. He has been invited as the keynote speaker at IIM-Ahmedabad and also by the Harvard Business School, USA.

They also arrested the driver of a backhoe loader as work by the heavy machine allegedly led to the mishap.

The owner and driver of a backhoe loader were among the six named in an FIR over the incident, the police said.

""Two of the accused were arrested on Thursday by officers from Sector 49 police station. One of them is the owner of the school, while the other is the driver of a backhoe loader. The principal has already been arrested. The police will nab the other three accused soon,"" said Noida City Superintendent of Police Sudha Singh.

Owner Amit Bhati has claimed that he had rented out the plot for ₹10,000 per month in March 2017, and that K.M. Public School was run by principal Sanjeev Jha and vice-principal Raghvender Solnaki. The principal was arrested earlier.

Two students died while three others were critically injured after the boundary wall of the unauthorised school in Sector 45 here collapsed on them around 9.30 a.m. on Monday. The students were writing an exam at the time the incident.

The police said the construction material used to build the boundary walls was of poor quality. The trigger for the collapse was construction in an adjacent plot. It is alleged that as the backhoe loader and excavator being used at the adjacent site reached the school's boundary wall it collapsed on the students.

The parents of the deceased students accused the school administration for the accident and demanded strict action against the management. They said the school had claimed it was affiliated to recognised boards. The parents had protested on a road in front of Sector 49 police station, leading to a jam.

The deceased have been identified as Vivek Kumar (7) and Bhupender Singh (10), while the injured students are Naitik (8), Amit (7), Ashish Kumar (8) and Akaash (9) -- all students of Class I.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had ordered a magisterial-level probe into the matter."

The set standard of working nine to five with weekend offs will soon cease to exist, says British billionaire Sir Richard Branson.

Richard Branson left high school and at just 15 and started his first business and never looked back. The Virgin Group which he founded is said to be controlling more than 400 companies. Working five days in a week with Saturday and Sunday off in addition with a few weeks of holiday annually is a norm but it will not be the case in future, wrote Virgin founder Richard Branson in a blog post.

He says that one of the biggest barriers to jobs in the coming years will be technology.

The billionaire recalled Google's Larry Page and his assessment that the number of jobs for people is going to go downwards as the technology makes new headways. Drones and cars sans drivers are just some of the examples.

If the government, he continues, works on getting the workers on gaining the technical skills required for the future marketplace, say, in exchange for public service and gives them tuition, it will create smarter work practices.

Adding that the new developments in job trends could mean shorter work weeks for the US workforce, he said it would lead to ""a better work-life balance for Americans.""

He admitted that new trends might be ""a difficult balancing act"" but that does not mean it cannot be done.

For all of these industries, there are common requirements that need data to enable management of the fleet, yet it is difficult to ensure accuracy. Managers need to know exactly where their vehicles are at all times. They also need to know the health of each vehicle within the fleet and the answers to questions like: Is it in working condition? Is it idle? Is it in need of maintenance? And if it's working, is it available? These fleet insights allow a company to optimize its distribution of vehicles.

Managers must figure out how to track their fleet and turn insights into action. And while adding GPS to vehicles can help locate a vehicle, it falls short of alerting the manager of a maintenance need.

SAP has developed an industry innovation kit that addresses fleet management. While developed for the automotive industry, the kit applies to all the industries mentioned above. SAP Leonardo for Automotive, fleet insights option, can improve on-time vehicle availability and improve customer experience. It can learn about the usage patterns within a fleet, and understand the specific processes flows to improve efficiency and effectiveness. A measurable benefit is the reduction of non-billable vehicle time.

How does the kit achieve all of this? With the help of machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT), the kit can monitor a fleet of vehicles. Machine learning is used to understand the fleet's operating patterns. Once learned, the kit can anticipate the health of specific vehicles within a fleet and predict when maintenance might be needed. For instance, it could suggest what specific part in a vehicle needs to be replaced and it could predict how much manpower is needed for the repair.

For example, if a car's brakes need to be replaced, the kit can send a notification through SAP Cloud Platform. This notifies the manager and tells them exactly what needs to be done with a notification like ""The brakes on car #37 need to be replaced in two months. Estimated time for repair is one hour and one mechanic is needed."" This helps streamline the repair process. If a manager has a two-month time line and the brakes take one month to arrive, then the manager could order the new brakes now and avoid losing up time waiting on spare parts to arrive.

According to Edina Sewell, automotive solution manager at SAP, this kit can also aid in understanding the supply and demand for vehicles: ""The kit can enable fleet managers to gather the necessary information about their fleet, in real time. From a supply and demand perspective, managers can see where their services are needed. They can also see how many vehicles are available to help.""

If a company has 100 vehicles at its disposal, but a poor understanding of upcoming service requests, the fleet insights option kit could help the company understand how many vehicles would be needed each day and where to deploy individual vehicles or schedule a vehicle for maintenance.

The kit is based on what SAP has learned through co-innovation customers. In one such example, a company had a fleet of company cars to manage. They were manually recording the usage of their vehicles, which combined professional and personal usage. This method was slow, inaccurate, and difficult. Digitizing their fleet management and applying advanced technologies to provide insights made their fleet management more accurate and simple.

SAP Leonardo for Automotive, fleet insights option, can improve vehicle availability, track vehicles and monitor their health, and give real-time tracking of the supply and demand for vehicle services."

It will augment the existing training mechanism with online module-based training coupled with certification. This will make training inputs available to government servant on site and on flexitime basis. The initiative aims at ""Competent Civil Services for Good Governance"". He also launched Hybrid Course on Administrative Laws developed by DoPT in collaboration with the premier law school, National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru.

On the occasion, RTI Portal on Judgments/Orders of Supreme Court, High Courts and CIC, was also launched that will provide a learning environment for all stakeholders under which a repository on the landmark cases on the RTI will be available at one place.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that Ministry of Personnel has undertaken various initiatives in the last four and a half years. He said that the launch of these initiatives on the eve of Good Governance Day shows Government's commitment to 'maximum governance, minimum government'. He also spoke about the initiatives taken by DARPG. He added that the number of grievances has increased due to prompt response of the Department. But awareness needs to be generated in society about grievance disposal mechanism, he added. He said that during the last four years, the participation of districts has increased in the Civil Services Day awards, which has transformed the whole process. Commenting on the RTI Portal on Judgments/Orders of Supreme Court, High Courts and CIC, he said that this is an extension of online RTI mechanism that is available to the users. Speaking on the improvements made by DoPT in the training programmes, the Minister said that the training programmes of India are now being acknowledged worldwide. He further said that 'Anubhav' initiative of the Ministry is a good base for research activities and now the department is in the process of preparing a manual based on these write-ups. The Minister also urged the state Governments to adopt these initiatives towards good governance and improved training techniques.

The DoPT Secretary Dr C. Chandramouli said that the launch of the initiatives today is yet another milestone which aims at capacity building of Government officers. He said that appropriate training is of vital importance for public service delivery. This online programme is a part of overall 'Digital India' flagship programme of the Government. The DoPT will encourage and keep adding more programmes to this platform, he added.

Secretary, DARPG & Pensions, Shri K.V. Eapen said that Department of Pensions has taken several initiatives for the benefit of pensioners such as organising First Pension Adalat, root cause analysis of the grievances and issuing Digital Life Certificates etc. He said that recently many changes have been incorporated in National Pension System (NPS) based on the recommendations of a committee of Government.

iGOT (Integrated Government Online Training Programme)

The National Training Policy-2012 mandates that all civil servants will be provided with training to equip them with the competencies for their current or future jobs. The current structure of training for Government servants including domestic and foreign training is mostly available to very small section of the government servants. However, consequent upon some recent initiatives undertaken by Department of Personnel and Training, Government of India aimed at providing training to cutting edge level functionaries in the Central/State Governments, significant changes have taken place. The outreach of the existing training setup is very limited in view of the large workforce employed in various States/UT Governments. The Integrated Government Online Training Programme (iGOT) launched by Minister will augment the existing training mechanism with online module-based training coupled with certification. This will make training inputs available to government servant on site and on flexitime basis. Furthermore, the training will be focussed and targeted to the requirement of the officials.

The e-Learning mode provides unparalleled opportunities for training to a large number of civil servants scattered all over the country. The latest technologies make available vast resources of learning material and online courses, providing the individuals enormous choices and flexibility in learning. The online training programme through Massive Online Open Courses mechanism would be a platform to bring together the numerous Government and other training institutions for providing a single point of access to the repository of training resources. This will provide a broad training eco-system creating synergies across various premier training institutes of the country and will cater to the training needs which can encompass all the officials in the entire hierarchy of Central and State Governments. This platform will ultimately build a large training eco-system. The training courses under this programme will be accessible through DoPT's web portal. Among the bouquet of Training Courses on offer through this initiative are those offered by MIT, USA too. DoPT has collaborated with JPAL, South Asia and MIT, USA to launch MITx Micro Master Programmes for the government servants.

Hybrid Course on Administrative Laws

The DoPT, realising the need for training inputs in Administrative Laws, has collaborated with the premier law school, National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru to develop and offer Long Term Diploma programme and Short Term Courses in these areas. The courses to be delivered by NLSIU have been launched by Minister today.

RTI Portal on Judgments/Orders of Supreme Court, High Courts and CIC

The Right to Information (RTI) Portal on Judgments/Orders of Supreme Court, High Courts and CIC has been developed by Institute of Secretariat Training and Management (ISTM), New Delhi. This Portal will provide a learning environment for all stakeholders under which a repository on the landmark cases on the RTI will be available at one place. The Portal also makes available the gist of the replies given by Central Public Information Officers (CPIOs), First Appellate Authorities as well as the Supreme Court. It will be helpful in learning the latest trends of implementation of RTI Act as the judgments/orders given by Central Information Commission, High Courts and Supreme Court are always a crucial source to track the developments on this subject.

Born at Mandya, brought up and educated at Bangalore, V. N. Prasad shifted to Mysore in 1984. A 'Highways & Bridges Designer and Project Management Consultant' by profession, he took to singing as a hobby from his school days. His mother, late Vasantha Venkatarangan, was an AIR singer and Prasad drew inspiration from her.

Since 1986, he has staged performances in almost all the auditoria of Mysore. His endeavour has always been to identify young singing talent in Mysore and promote them on big stages. Many youngsters in his group have risen to formidable heights today.

Prasad was the first to bring 'Karaoke' culture into Mysore. Speaking to Star of Mysore, he says, ""I used to drive up to Sadashivanagar, Bangalore, to record Karaokes on 'C - 60' cassettes and use them to practice and train youngsters."" His programmes across 'Round Tables' and 'Rotary' in and around Mysore have been popular over three decades.

A big fan of Kishore Kumar, he was stuck to programmes around Kishore's numbers. A discerning fan of Prasad and a playback singer Chandrika Gururaj and his Rotarian colleague late Dr. Patawardhan advised Prasad to come out of the shell of Kishore and sing others' numbers too. He has staged many programmes of Mohammed Rafi and Mukesh. Mohammed Rafi's daughter, Nasreen Ahamad and son-in-law Miraj Ahamed had come down from Mumbai to attend Prasad's programme at Mysore in April 2017.

Chandrika Gururaj, the noted Kannada playback singer, has performed alongside Prasad at Mysore with her live orchestra comprising greats like Shabbir (Key Board), Madhusudhan (Tabla), Srinivas (Guitar), Arun (Rhythm Pads). They are all currently playing for film industry in Karnataka. Prasad has earned popularity across Mysore and beyond for his approach to rendition -- stress on pronunciations, sur, taal and importantly emotions of the lyrics; acknowledged by connoisseurs across Mysore.

During the centenary year of University of Mysore, Prasad's troupe was offered the privilege to stage four performances; one in the Open Air Theatre and three more in the Senate Hall.

The ability to smell is critical for salmon. They depend on scent to avoid predators, sniff out prey and find their way home at the end of their lives when they return to the streams where they hatched to spawn and die.

New research from the University of Washington and NOAA Fisheries' Northwest Fisheries Science Center shows this powerful sense of smell might be in trouble as carbon emissions continue to be absorbed by our ocean. Ocean acidification is changing the water's chemistry and lowering its pH. Specifically, higher levels of carbon dioxide, or CO2, in the water can affect the ways in which coho salmon process and respond to smells.

""Salmon famously use their nose for so many important aspects of their life, from navigation and finding food to detecting predators and reproducing. So it was important for us to know if salmon would be impacted by future carbon dioxide conditions in the marine environment,"" said lead author Chase Williams, a postdoctoral researcher in Evan Gallagher's lab at the UW Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences in the School of Public Health.

The study, published Dec. 18 in the journal Global Change Biology, is the first to show that ocean acidification affects coho salmons' sense of smell. The study also takes a more comprehensive approach than earlier work with marine fish by looking at where in the sensory-neural system the ability to smell erodes for fish, and how that loss of smell changes their behavior.

""Our studies and research from other groups have shown that exposure to pollutants can also interfere with sense of smell for salmon,"" said Gallagher, senior co-author and a UW professor of toxicology. ""Now, salmon are potentially facing a one-two punch from exposure to pollutants and the added burden of rising CO2. These have implications for the long-term survival of our salmon.""

The research team wanted to test how juvenile coho salmon that normally depend on their sense of smell to alert them to predators and other dangers display a fear response with increasing carbon dioxide. Puget Sound's waters are expected to absorb more CO2 as atmospheric carbon dioxide increases, contributing to ocean acidification.

In the NOAA Fisheries research lab in Mukilteo, the research team set up tanks of saltwater with three different pH levels: today's current average Puget Sound pH, the predicted average 50 years from now, and the predicted average 100 years in the future. They exposed juvenile coho salmon to these three different pH levels for two weeks.

After two weeks, the team ran a series of behavioral and neural tests to see whether the fishes' sense of smell was affected. Fish were placed in a holding tank and exposed to the smell of salmon skin extract, which indicates a predator attack and usually prompts the fish to hide or swim away. Fish that were in water with current CO2 levels responded normally to the offending odor, but the fish from tanks with higher CO2 levels didn't seem to mind or detect the smell.

In the behavioral tests shown in this video, juvenile salmon in two separate tanks were exposed to an odor that would normally prompt a fear response. In the first clip, fish smell the odor coming from the left side of each tank, and avoid or swim away from the smell. In the second clip, fish have been exposed to higher levels of CO2, which has impaired their sense of smell. The fish don't react to the odor once it is introduced to both tanks, suggesting their ability to smell has been altered.

After the behavioral tests, neural activity in each fish's nose and brain -- specifically, in the olfactory bulb where information about smells is processed -- was measured to see where the sense of smell was altered. Neuron signaling in the nose was normal under all CO2 conditions, meaning the fish likely could still smell the odors. But when they analyzed neuron behavior in the olfactory bulb, they saw that processing was altered -- suggesting the fish couldn't translate the smell into an appropriate behavioral response.

Finally, the researchers analyzed tissue from the noses and olfactory bulbs of fish to see if gene expression also changed. Gene expression pathways were found to be altered for fish that were exposed to higher levels of CO2, particularly in their olfactory bulbs.

""At the nose level, we think the neurons are still detecting odors, but when the signals are processed in the brain, that's where the messages are potentially getting altered,"" Williams said.

In the wild, the fish likely would become more and more indifferent to scents that signify a predator, Williams said, either by taking longer to react to the smell or by not swimming away at all. While this study looked specifically at how altered sense of smell could affect fishes' response to danger, it's likely that other critical behaviors that depend on smell such as navigation, reproduction and hunting for food would also take a hit if fish aren't able to adequately process smells.

The researchers plan to look next at whether increased CO2 levels could affect other fish species in similar ways, or alter other senses in addition to smell. Given the cultural and ecological significance of salmon, the researchers hope these findings will prompt action.

""We're hoping this will alert people to some of the potential consequences of elevated carbon emissions,"" said senior co-author Andy Dittman, a research biologist at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center. ""Salmon are so iconic in this area. Ocean acidification and climate change are abstract things until you start talking about an animal that means a lot to people.""

Other co-authors are Paul McElhany, Shallin Busch and Michael Maher of the Northwest Fisheries Science Center; and Theo Bammler and James MacDonald of the UW Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences.

This study was funded by Washington Sea Grant and the Washington Ocean Acidification Center, with additional support from the UW Superfund Research Program, the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center."

By ""real,"" she does not mean more difficult. Rather, the activist and author is seeking recognition of the value of domestic work, and to raise its status and pay accordingly. ""It's the work that makes all other work possible,"" said Poo, executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA) and author of the best-selling book ""The Age of Dignity: Preparing for the Elder Boom in a Changing America.""

""Caregiving is the work that allows the rest of us to go out and do our work in the world, but it has been made invisible and taken for granted,"" she said. ""It's not called real work - it's unskilled, 'help' paying poverty wages.""

Poo has been active since the mid-1990s in the movement to organize caregivers, nannies and other domestic workers to fight for equal rights and better wages. Along with leading the New York City-based NDWA, she co-directs Caring Across Generations, which focuses mainly on policy at the state and local level. Poo's work was recognized by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which awarded her one of its ""genius grants"" in 2014.

NDWA has 63 local affiliates and chapters around the country, and organizes nearly 200,000 workers. In 2013, the organization played a key role in getting the U.S. Department of Labor to rewrite rules to include domestic workers in the federal government's minimum wage and hours protections. The organization also has helped win passage of legislation in eight states that extends basic protections such as overtime rules, paid sick days and the right to unionize to domestic workers.

In 2019, NDWA will be pushing legislation at the federal and state levels aimed at lifting up this crucial work.

U.S. lawmakers will introduce legislation in Congress next year that would close legal loopholes excluding domestic workers from some federal labor and civil rights laws, create new benefits and protections for them, and encourage innovations to address the unique challenges of domestic work. The legislation, called the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, is sponsored by U.S. Senator Kamala Harris and Representative Pramila Jayapal, both Democrats.

The legislative push has important implications not only for the well-being of caregivers, but for the labor market and economy as the country ages.

By the year 2030 there will be a severe national shortage of caregivers, according to recent research by human resources expert Paul Osterman. We will be short 151,000 paid direct-care workers, and 3.8 million unpaid family caregivers. Osterman, a professor of human resources and management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, projects that by 2040 the shortfall will rise to 355,000 paid workers and a shocking 11 million ""family and friends"" or unpaid family caregivers. (https://reut.rs/2Evm8yj)

CREATING QUALITY JOBS

Lifting up domestic work, including caregiving, can make this work more desirable, Poo thinks, and attract many new workers to the field.

Currently, most domestic workers still earn only $11 an hour or less, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, and most do not receive healthcare or retirement benefits. ""With the need for family care growing - both child care and elder care, but especially elder care - we will need a strong, professional workforce to meet the need,"" Poo said.

But she also argues that caregiving can provide quality jobs at a time when automation and artificial intelligence threaten to displace people in many occupations. ""We know for sure care jobs will not be automated in the near term, nor can they be outsourced,"" she said.

The normal economic laws of supply and demand should boost wages naturally - if the market for caregiving labor was a normal market. But it is not.

Two-thirds of long-term care in the United States is funded by the federal Medicaid program, with the remainder paid through private commercial insurance or out-of-pocket. Medicaid payment policies vary widely among the states, but cash-strapped Medicaid programs have limited ability to boost wages, and Medicaid determines reimbursement rates for the payrolls of health providers, limiting the impact of labor market demand. Outside of Medicaid, the insurance market for long-term care is dysfunctional, with only a very small fraction of older households having purchased commercial policies.

NDWA is part of a coalition working to advance an innovative approach to funding care through social insurance programs in the states. Proposals to create publicly funded long-term care benefits have been advanced in seven states: California, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, New York and Washington. In most cases, the programs would be financed through an additional tax on payroll or income.

It has been clear for some time that social insurance can provide part of the answer to the nation's long-term care funding dilemma. In 2016, three reports developed by a nonpartisan consortium of researchers, representing an ideological middle ground, called for streamlining private long-term care insurance to make it work better, but also covering the most extreme risk through publicly financed insurance (https://reut.rs/2T4wY2n). This approach makes eminent sense, and states could provide the catalyst to get the country moving.

As Poo points out, a win-win is available: meeting the surging demand for caregiving while creating quality jobs for millions of Americans. ""These jobs will be a large share of the jobs of the future,"" she said. ""Just like we turned manufacturing jobs from poverty wage, dangerous jobs into jobs with real economic mobility, we can and should do the same for care jobs.""

Now scientists have developed a non-invasive technique that involves mere flash of a laser light to assess healing.

The method exploits a particular property of some tissue proteins - ability to re-emit light upon absorption. Such proteins, known as tissue fluorophores, have chemical compounds that can re-emit light. Collagen is one such protein that is vital in wound healing. So when a laser light is flashed on tissues under examination, the amount of re-emitted light from the healing tissue directly corresponds to collagen concentration, which in turn, indicates the status of recovery process.

Researchers at the Manipal Academy of Higher Educationused commercially available 325 nm laser light to inspect healing by exploring tissue fluorophores, and a detector to collect re-emitted light. The re-emitted spectra were recorded using a fibre optic probe kept very close - about three mm - to the wound site. The spectra was then analysed in a spectrograph connected to a computer.

The collagen levels measured by this technique, known as autofluorescence, were validated by biochemical tests of patient tissues. The comparison showed that autofluorescence was consistent and suitable for assessment of burn wound healing. This study also shown tissue collagen can be used as an optical biomarker for assessing burn wound healing, researchers explained. Tissue samples were collected from burn patients admitted to the Department of Plastic Surgery and Burns,Kasturba Medical College.

In earlier studies, the technique was used in lab-induced wounds in animals. Now it has been tested in tissue samples from human burn patients suffering from different degree of burn wounds. Tissue formed following treatment was excised before grafting and utilized for autofluorescence measurement.

""Our technique is user-friendly and solely dependent on excitation and emission of tissue fluorophores without the addition of any external dye molecule. This helps maintain tissue architecture during the assessment of healing,"" Dr VijendraPrabhu of Department of Biotechnology at the Manipal Institute of Technology, a member of the research team, told India Science Wire.

For clinical management of wounds, periodic evaluation of injured tissue is necessary to know progress of healing. Sometimes wound assessment is done by trained clinicians but it is a subjective method. The other method is to conduct histopathology and biochemicalanalysis to measure amount of collagen deposited. Repetitive invasive tests can result in fresh wounds and possibility of infection and scarring.

Through autofluorescence technique, collagen information of the tissue can be gathered in just 10 to 15 seconds. ""It can provide complementary data conducive to making clinical decisions. After successful testing on clinical samples, we are ready for mass testing on burn wound patients. This system can also be utilized to test collagen disorders in patients,"" Dr Prabhu said.

The research team included researchers from Manipal Academy of Higher Education - Prof K.K.Mahato (Department of Biophysics, School of Life Sciences); Dr. Vijendra Prabhu (Manipal Institute of Technology); Anusha Acharya (School of Life Sciences); Prof B.S. Satish Rao (Department of Radiation Biology and Toxicology),Bharath Rathnakar (Department of Biophysics); Dr. Pramod Kumar (Department of Plastic Surgery and Burns) and Dr. Vasudeva Guddattu (Department of Statistics).The study was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and research findings have been published in Journal of Biophotonics.

On account of rising disposable incomes and changing lifestyles, parents are, nowadays, paying more attention to their children's early education so as to cultivate creativity amongst them. As these toys combine learning and fun, they are well received by parents and children alike, in turn, augmenting the demand for educational toys. Apart from this, investments from international toy brands, like Mattel, Hasbro and Lego, are contributing to the growth of the China toys market. These investments are a result of rising popularity and mounting domestic demand for toys in the region. Moreover, China has recently witnessed a boom in the e-commerce sector because of the evolution of smartphones and other digital media platforms. Online platforms have enabled International brands in directly selling their products to the Chinese population without being physically present in the country.

Well, these are national level management entrance examinations conducted for admission to management courses in India's prestigious management institutes. If you want to pursue a Master in Business Administration (MBA) program, you must be in a dilemma regarding which exam to appear in. Well, you can give any of the management entrance tests as per your choice. Keep reading the article to know which management exam is better i.e. which out of XAT or MAT you should appear in.

It is very important for MBA aspirants to work really very hard to grab a seat in a reputed MBA college. Most of the institutes offer admission based on candidate's score in CAT or MAT. So, it is wise enough to appear for these two. However, there are some colleges such as XLRI who conduct their own entrance test for admission to MBA courses. Let's understand about XAT and MAT.

Xavier Admission Test (XAT)

The Xavier Labour Relations Institute Jamshedpur School of Management (XLRI) conducts the Xavier Admission Test (XAT) for admission to the MBA program. Only a few B-Schools accept candidates based on their XAT score. Candidates who have passed the Bachelor's degree examination in relevant discipline from a recognized university with an aggregate of at least 50% marks (45% for candidates belonging to SC/ ST Category) are eligible to apply for XAT. This entrance exam is conducted only once a year.

Management Aptitude Test (MAT)

The Management Aptitude Test (MAT) is a national level entrance test which is conducted by the Centre for Management Services (CMS) of All India Management Association (AIMA). This examination is conducted in all the major cities across India and also in the leading cities of Abroad. Almost every institute accepts students based on candidate's score in MAT. The score obtained in MAT is required for admission to PGDM course or any other equivalent programs offered by the AIMA or other Management Institutes participating in it. MAT is conducted by the All India Management Aptitude Testing Service (AIMATS), New Delhi. This test is conducted four times in a year i.e. in February, May, September and December. To appear in this entrance test, candidates must hold a Bachelor's degree in relevant discipline from a recognized university.

Key Differences Between XAT and MAT

All the management institutes that participate in MAT are either AICTE approved or are associated with prestigious universities. Students who are in the final year of their Graduation are also eligible to appear in the MAT. There is no age limit to appear for this entrance examination. Work experience is also not required to apply for this examination.

XAT is a national level entrance exam conducted by the Xavier Labour Research Institute, Jamshedpur (XLRI). This examination is conducted for admission to various management programs offered by XLRI. The score obtained in XAT is used by more than 60 Management Institutes for admission in LIBA (Loyola Institute of Business Administration), Chennai, Xavier Institute of Management and Entrepreneurship (XIME), Bangalore, Xavier Institute of Management (XIM) and many more.

So, both of the examinations mentioned above are good and popular. You can give both of the examinations. However, you will get only one chance if you appear in XAT whereas you will get four chances to crack MAT. So, don't forget to apply for MAT as it has better chances to give you selection."

Government announces important measures to revamp and expand scheme of setting up EMRSs; 462 new EMRSs to be set up Launch of Van Dhan Yojana by Prime Minister to improve income and livelihood for about 5 crore tribal people Two National level and four state level museums to celebrate contribution of tribal freedom fighters being set up

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal Ministry for overall policy, planning and coordination of programmes for development of Scheduled Tribes. The Scheduled Tribes comprise about 8.6% of India's population (according to the 2011 census). In the year 2018, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs focused on education of tribal people, new initiatives to substantially step up economic empowerment of the tribal population as well as bring into spotlight the tribal culture by constructing museums to highlight the tribal freedom fighters. A very major thrust this year has been on revamping and overhauling the prominent scheme of setting up of Eklaya Model Residential Schools to expand the reach of good quality education among the tribal persons.

Ministry of Tribal Affairs has continued with its endeavours for socio-economic development of Scheduled Tribes (STs) through specially tailored schemes for education, infrastructure and livelihood to fill in critical gaps. Allocation of Business Rules (ABR) of Government now mandates this Ministry to monitor 'Tribal Sub-Plan' (now recoined as 'Scheduled Tribe Component') funds of Central Ministries based on the framework and mechanism propounded by NITI Aayog. In order to consistently improve public service delivery, Ministry of Tribal Affairs constantly reviews various schematic initiatives, recent ones being rationalization of scholarship schemes besides on boarding of same on DBT platform and online portal for NGO Grants.

Budget allocation of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs has gone up from Rs. 5329.32 Crore in the year 2017-18 to Rs. 5957.18 Cr in 2018-19. Ministry has already utilized 74.69% of its allocated outlay on various developmental initiatives for STs. An amount of Rs. 2385.90 Cr (as on 09 December, 2018) has been released under two Special Areas Programme of the Ministry viz. Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution for Education, Health, Livelihood/Income Generation Activities etc. Similarly, allocation for Scheduled Tribes Component across all Ministries has witnessed an increase from Rs. 31,920.00 Cr in the year 2017-18 to Rs. 37,802.94 Cr in 2018-19.

With implementation of Public Financial Management System (PFMS), efficiency in funds allocation and monitoring its release has been improved besides enhancing transparency and accountability. All agencies receiving funds from the Ministry have been on boarded in the system. This facilitates real-time tracking of fund utilization by implementing agencies.

MONITORING OF FUNDS FOR TRIBAL DEVELOPMENT

Allocation of Business Rules (ABR) amended in January, 2017 has mandated the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) for monitoring of STC funds of Central Ministries. An online monitoring system has been put in place by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs with web address http://stcmis.gov.in for monitoring of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP)/Schedule Tribe Component (STC) funds. The framework captures data directly from Public Finance Management System (PFMS) and provides inputs to see through expenditure vis-a- vis allocations. Monitoring of physical performance and outcome of initiatives has also been introduced in the system. A customized proforma has also been developed in MIS to capture location of ongoing projects and beneficiary details. Further, Nodal Officer have been designated in line Ministries/Departments for coordination and monitoring. Required credentials are shared with nodal officers for uploading data regarding output and outcome. Review meetings are held regularly for effective monitoring.

There are 37 Central Ministries and Departments having STC funds catering to specific tribal development in various sectors through 299 different schemes, as reflected in the Statement 10B of the Expenditure Profile of the Budget, 2018-19. Allocation for welfare of Scheduled Tribes across all Ministries has witnessed an increase from Rs. 24,005.00 crore in financial year 2016-17 to Rs. 31,920.00 crore in financial year 2017-18 and Rs. 37,802.94 crore in 2018-19. With the efforts of Ministry of Tribal Affairs, the STC expenditure has gone up from 85% of total allocation at Revised Estimate stage in 2016-17 to 96% in 2017-18. During 2018-19, out of total allocation of Rs. 37,802.94 crore, an amount of Rs. 23,772.05 crore has already been released as on 09.12.2018, which is 62.88% of the total allocation.

As far as State TSP funds are concerned, vigorous efforts of MoTA has resulted in 98% increase in expenditure of State Tribal Sub-Plan funds by States during the years block of 2010-13 (wherein a total of Rs. 1,65,691.00 crore was expended) to 2014-17 (wherein a total of Rs. 3,27,574.00 crore were expended).""

As on 09.12.2018, 63% of the total allocated STC amount has been released by different Central Ministries / Departments against various development projects relating to education, health, agriculture, irrigation, roads, housing, electrification, employment generation, skill development etc.

SCHEME FOR EKLAVYA MODEL RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (EMRS)

Eklavya Model Residential School is an excellent approach for imparting quality education to ST children. Apart from school building including hostels and staff quarters, provision for a playground, students' computer lab, teacher resource room etc. are also included in the EMRSs. The scheme aims to bridge the gap in literacy level between the general population and tribal population.

A total of 284 EMRSs have been sanctioned as on date, out of which 219 have been reported functional, with about 65,231 students enrolled therein.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, in its meeting held on 17th December, 2018, has decided that by the year 2022, every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons, will have an Eklavya Model Residential School. Eklavya schools will be on par with Navodaya Vidyalayas and will have special facilities for preserving local art and culture besides providing training in sports and skill development. Accordingly, it is proposed to establish new EMRSs in the remaining 462 sub-districts by the year 2022 as per the phasing plan as given below:

It has also been decided to set up an Autonomous Society under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs similar to Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti to run the EMRSs.

The recurring cost has also been enhanced from the existing Rs. 61,500/- to Rs. 1,09,000/- per student per year from 2019-20.

The CCEA decision also spells out reservation of 20% seats under sports quota and 10% for non-ST students.

An outlay of Rs. 118.65 Crore has been made to various states under the scheme Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Grants under Article 275(1) for skill development of more than 31,000 male and female tribal beneficiaries in a wide gamut of trades such as (i) Planning and Management including office management (ii) Solar Technician / Electrician (iii) Beautician (iv) Handicraft (v) Skills required for day to day construction works (such as Plumbing, Mason, Electrician, Fitter, Welder, Carpenter (vi) Refrigeration and A/C repairing (vii) Mobile repairing (viii) Nutrition (x) Ayurvedic & tribal medicines (xi) IT (xii) Data Entry (xiii) Fabrication (xiv) Paramedics and Home Nurse Training (xv) Automobile Driving and Mechanics (xvi) Electric & Motor Winding (xvii) Security Guard (xviii) Housekeeping & Management (xix) Retail Management (xx) Hospitality (xxi) Eco-tourism (xxii) Adventure Tourism.

VAN DHAN YOJANA

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has launched a game-changing initiative for tribal people - The Van Dhan Yojana, with the launch of the first Van Dhan Vikas Kendra at Bijapur by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi on 14th April, 2018. It aims to provide skill upgradation and capacity building training and setting up of primary processing and value addition facility.

As per the plan, TRIFED will facilitate establishment of MFP-led multi-purpose Van Dhan Vikas Kendras, a cluster of 10 SHGs comprising of 30 tribal MFP gatherers each, in the tribal areas. This initiative is aimed at mainstreaming the tribal community by promoting primary level value addition to MFP at grassroots level. Through this initiative, the share of tribals in the value chain of Non-Timber Forest Produce is expected to rise from the present 20% to around 60%. About 3000 such Van Dhan Kendras are proposed to be set up in two years in the forested Tribal Districts of the country. To begin with, this initiative is proposed to be taken up on priority in the 39 Districts with more than 50% tribal population and to then gradually be expanded to other Tribal Districts in India.The initiative aims to promote MFPs-centric livelihood development of tribal gatherers and artisans. MFP or what may be more aptly referred to as Non Timber Forest Produces (NTFPs) are the primary source of income and livelihood for about 5 crore tribal people in the country.

AADI MAHOTSAV

Ministry of Tribal Affairs organized a National Tribal Festival named as 'Aadi Mahotsava' from 16November, 2018 to 30 November, 2018 with the help of TRIFED to celebrate, cherish and promote the spirit of tribal craft, culture, cuisine and commerce at Delhi Haat, INA. This festival was inaugurated by Sh Jual Oram, Hon'ble Minister of Tribal Affairs.

More than 1000 Artisans from 20 States, 80 Tribal Chefs and 14 Dance Troupes comprising more than 250 Artists participated in the Mahotsav. Highlights of the Mahotsav were - Live demos for traditional tribal food and drink; Lac bangles; demo for 4 different schools of painting i.e. Warli, Pithora, Gond and Saura; Fashion show for tribal textiles, fashion accessories etc. Tribal products displayed at Mahotsav included heritage collection of Sarees, Men's collection including cotton, woollen and silk Jackets, Kurtas from MP, Rajasthan and Jharkhand; Bell Metal from Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh; Paintings from Gujrat, Maharashtra, Odisha and MP; Woollens from HP, Uttaranchal and J&K; Honey, spices dry fruits etc. from different States; Tribal Jewellery from Himachal, Odisha, North-East, MP, Telangana; Pottery from Manipur, Rajasthan; Home Furnishing from Rajasthan, North East, MP, UP; Bags collection from Gujrat, Telangana, Jharkhand; and Grass Mat and Coir collection from West Bengal, Jharkhand and Kerala.

It has also been proposed that National Tribal Festivals shall be conducted in 17 States/ Union territories up to March, 2019 to provide a broad platform to highlight tribal culture across India.

NGO GRANTS

Implementation of Online application system ""NGO Grants Online Application & Tracking System"" (www.ngograntsmota.gov.in) activated for processing NGO proposals under the scheme of ""Grant-in-aid to Voluntary Organizations working for welfare of Scheduled Tribes"" has resulted in quicker information flow and smoother implementation of the scheme besides increasing the number of applications.

MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICE FOR MINOR FOREST PRODUCE

The scheme for 'Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and development of Value Chain for MFP"" (known as MSP for MFPin short) was launched in the year 2013-14 and it then covered only ten MFP items and was applicable to the Schedule V States only. Subsequently, in October 2016 the extent and coverage of the scheme was increased by adding more MFP items and also rendering the scheme applicable country wide. The MSP of ten items that were originally incorporated into the scheme were further revised in November 2017. The issues of further expanding the list of MFP items as also further revising the MSP of the existing MFP items are being considered by the Ministry."

All six members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had voted for keeping the key benchmark rate unchanged, said the Minutes of the MPC meeting released by the Reserve Bank Wednesday.

The RBI had kept the repo rate -- at which it lends to banks -- at 6.50 percent in the MPC review held between December 3-5.

""Although the inflation trajectory has been revised downwards, several uncertainties persist, especially about the medium-term outlook of food inflation and oil prices. Incoming data should help clear the haziness and enable better assessment of the inflation outlook, especially regarding the permanence of the current softness in inflation prints.

""Hence, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and retaining the stance of monetary policy as 'calibrated tightening',"" said the minutes of the meeting quoting Patel who had resigned as the RBI Governor on December 10.

Should upside risks, as outlined above, not materialise on a durable basis in the coming months, there is a possibility of space opening up for policy action in due course, Patel had argued.

RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya was of the view that even as the projection for retail inflation have been revised downwards significantly, several upside risks remain.

""In my view, it is better to understand data somewhat better over the next two months...While the recent downward surprises to inflation have significantly reduced the extent of policy tightening required in future, they have not eliminated the requirement altogether. On balance, given the relatively short period of time over which inflation has softened, it is important to wait and watch,"" Acharya said in the MPC meeting.

The RBI revised downwards the inflation forecast for the second half of the current fiscal at 2.7-3.2 percent and 3.8-4.2 percent in the first half of the next fiscal beginning April, due to favourable factors including assumption of a normal monsoon in 2019.

With risks tilted to the upside, the RBI remains cautious because of several uncertainties such as risk of a sudden reversal of the unusually low food prices, impact of MSP, oil price trajectory, volatile financial markets, elevated inflation expectations as well as risks of fiscal slippages a the centre and state government levels.

Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director of RBI, while voting for the status quo on the policy repo rate favoured maintaining the stance of calibrated tightening.

""With inflation projected to rise above 4 percent over the 12-month ahead horizon, it is apposite to persevere with the stance of calibrated tightening to head off inflation pressures from potentially corroding the foundations of the growth path that is evolving over the medium-term,"" Patra said during the three-day MPC policy review.

Former Indian Institute of Management professor Ravindra H Dholakia said the best that can be done under the present circumstances is to hold the rate but change the stance to neutral to take care of all possible uncertainties.

""We should not deny any possibility of either a rate cut or a rate hike in the near future depending on data coming in,"" he said.

The sole female member in the six-member panel Delhi School of Economics Director Pami Dua also expressed her views that even as inflation has softened, the upside risks remain.

It is therefore best to pause and wait for incoming data while maintaining a vigil on inflation, especially with respect to food and crude oil, Dua said.

""At the same time, given the uncertainty with respect to the inflation outlook, I also vote for maintaining the stance of calibrated tightening,"" she added to her observation.

Member Chetan Ghate, professor, Indian Statistical Institute viewed ""both the inflation and growth numbers having developed 'soft-spots', the appropriate risk-management approach at the current juncture would be to 'wait and watch'.

This will allow the MPC to see how various risks to both inflation and growth evolve, and better assess the ability of flexible inflation targeting to absorb the impact of shocks that the economy is currently experiencing, said the Minutes of MPC quoting Ghate.

Consumer price index (CPI) based retail inflation had eased to a 17-month low of 2.33 percent for November due to softer food prices, the government data showed earlier this month.

In October, it was at a year low of 3.38 percent.

The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from February 5 to 7, 2019."

It happened long ago That was my teenaged son telling me in very clear words I was bemused as my son was wearing only a T-shirt with pullover/jacket and apparently, no shivering.

However, my friend who had arrived from UK, and was witness to the occurrence, smiled at the youngster and nodded in his support ""But you do not seem to be feeling cold. Then how are you saying that winter has arrived?"" I questioned my son The duo smiled again, in unison ""Dad, these are phrases from Game of Thrones and are many years old.""

Saying this, he walked away, leaving me plundered. While my mind was still working on how to resume and carry on the dialogue with him, my friend diluted my resolve. He said, ""Man, it is time to brush up your vocabulary Not only did he give me a preliminary lesson in the Game of Thrones but he also reminded me of the stages of change that we had read in management school. I was apparently still resting comfortably in a precontemplation stage, not yet acknowledging that there was a behavior that needed to be changed In Game of Thrones the phrase 'Winter is coming' epitomizes readiness for change; it signifies that the snow and ice change the environment; it represents showdown between House of Stark and White Walkers; in nutshell, it an ability to be always prepared for the arrival of White Walkers - the evil.

The winter represents more than just cold; it is synonymous with nimbleness. Those three words taught me that I was missing to match the pace of change. While I grew up with the belief that change was the only constant but somewhere, I missed to admit that understanding of basic concepts would also undergo change; I just forgot to remain agile. As I write this, I note that ""Justice"" turns out to be Webster's word of the year 2018 and ""Toxic"" is Oxford's word of the year.

These simple words have been chosen because a large number of people explored the relevance of ""just what exactly we mean when we use the term justice"" or because the word 'toxic' has been ""used in an array of contexts, both in its literal and more metaphorical senses I realised that the art of unlearning and learning in life has been given a backseat.

If even simple words like winter, justice, toxic have contextually vivid and newer interpretations, my heap of knowledge is no longer contemporary - I need to gallop, grasp and grind; and do it recurrently With my heart swelling with pride over my son, I instantly spoke out to my friend, ""My son has taught me a powerful lesson Sensing my choked voice, he suggested that we focus on something else, say, the real showdown - a game of chess. Sipping through the kahwa, we enjoyed the game and relived good old days.

So engrossed were we in the game that we did not realise when my son entered the room, exhausted after an hour's play, and asked, ""how much time will you take? My friend said promptly, ""I'm reaching the endgame. Only three-four minutes more ""Uncle, Endgame will come in four months and NOT four minutes. They have just released a trailer of the sequel to Infinity Wars. We are all waiting We, the outdated friends, looked into each other's eyes - baffled. Winter, for us, had indeed arrived. It called for rapid moves lest we lose another battle in the war of life..."

Alleging that the inspections by the government teams are ""motivated"" and ""an attempt just to tarnish the image of civic bodies"", the education committees of both south and north corporations have directed their officials not to let the ""survey teams enter the school premises"".

The government has asked Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to assess each government, private, and municipal school on parameters like safety, teaching-learning facilities and community engagement. DCPCR is the statutory body to monitor implementation of rights of children and Right To Education Act, 2009 in the city.

The chairperson of the south corporation's education committee, Nandini Sharma, said the House had already rejected the inspection proposal. ""The survey teams had taken permission from us three months ago after showing us a set of questions. But now they have completely changed their track, which is unacceptable."" These inspections also disrupt entire work in schools, she added. ""No permission is sought from the principals and committee members barge into classrooms,"" she alleged.

Sharma's counterpart in the north corporation, Ritu Goel, said she had directed education officials to discontinue the visits with immediate effect. ""We had agreed to the exercise keeping child welfare in mind but the government is using it politically to malign the image of corporation schools."" Goel said she had received complaints from 20-25 teachers about the conduct of inspection teams.

The little kids are asked ""motivated"" questions, Goel alleged. ""Which brave child gets beaten by teachers? Which good student brings the tea for teachers? When a teacher is talking on mobile phones then you don't disturb them -- such types of questions are being asked,"" she said. ""The purpose is only to create a controversy.""

Showing the files about the ""agreed-upon"" questions, she added that the survey was meant to be about issues like safety of kids, guard rooms and visitors in the school. Corporation officials were also asked to provide details of students' family members but they are yet to send any information.

DCPCR member Anurag Kundu, however, claimed that the corporations couldn't legally stop the inspections. ""DCPCR is not under Delhi government and it is an independent statutory body. It is legally obligated to monitor implementation of RTE Act in all schools. The education committee has no authority to stop us,"" he said.

Kundu said the teams were asking the questions agreed upon in joint meetings in September. ""The questions cited by the education committees are not being asked. Only questions like how do you feel in classroom? Are you allowed to ask questions,"" he added.

He also pointed out that Quality Council of India, a central government agency, had been selected as the project management agency for the survey."

In that session, I looked at the changing legal and media landscape for Local Councils, and examined strategies for managing unwelcome media attention. In this bulletin, I look more closely at some of the external management options available to Local Councils.

We are increasingly contacted by councils who are at the centre of unwelcome media attention, often involving social media and sometimes involving serious allegations. Although sometimes the result of unfounded complaints by concerned residents, local media and ""shock jocks"", the seriousness of the allegations, and their potential effect on council, staff and councillors, make it necessary for all involved to know their rights and what processes to follow to contain and manage the situation.

In October 2018 the former mayor of Narrabri Shire Council, Conrad Bolton, was awarded more than $100,000 in damages after Facebook posts were made by a local resident accusing him of corruption and intimidation.

The disgruntled resident had set up a website called ""Narri Leaks"", which became known to other residents in the area. Mr Bolton's children were approached at school about the allegations on the website, and Mr Bolton and his wife noticed a significant drop in the number of invitations they received to functions and events. The Court was told that the Narri Leaks page had been ""devastating"" and ""soul-destroying"".

The proceedings were commenced in 2015, but only came to a conclusion three years later in 2018. Mr Bolton was awarded his legal costs and interest. The disgruntled resident was permanently restrained from publishing or broadcasting any further defamatory content.

Defamation occurs when a person's reputation is damaged as a result of a publication about them. It applies to online and social media statements, as well as statements made by traditional forms of communication. The law of defamation is governed by the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) and the common law.

To prove defamation, a person needs to establish that:

The defamed person also needs to bring the claim within one year of publication.

Generally, whoever is identified by the relevant statements has the right to bring a defamation claim. Defamation is a personal right of action owned by the person aggrieved. As a public body, a local council does not have a right of action in defamation. However, an employee or councillor who is adequately identified by a defamatory publication, by name or otherwise, may have the right to bring a claim.

Because defamation is a personal right, councils need to ensure that funding court proceedings for defamation won't lead to allegations of misuse of funds. For this reason, councils often have a rule in their codes of conduct prohibiting the funding of legal services for advice on defamation claims or associated litigation.

To pursue a defamation claim, you must provide proof of publication of the defamatory statement. This means you need to show that the person you are accusing participated in the chain of communication of the offending material to third parties. The person making the defamatory statement must have either intended to convey the material, or been reckless as to whether their conduct would lead to that outcome.

That may not always be easy. For example, if a defamatory publication is disseminated online by an anonymous source, it can be difficult (not to say expensive) to identify the author. While you may be able to prove that a Facebook page has defamatory statements on it, you might not be able to prove that a particular person posted them.

""Publication"" of a defamatory statement takes place where the offending material is downloaded onto a device and accessed, regardless of where the offending material was uploaded. For that reason, it is common for actions in defamation in New South Wales courts (for example) to be pursued against people outside that jurisdiction - even overseas.

Although forensic data analysts can find out much about the timing and location of online publications, their work can lead to dead ends if a person has been careful to cover their tracks.

All these factors add up, and pursuing someone for defamation can be protracted, difficult and expensive, particularly when they do not admit publication.

Councils must be ready to manage serious allegations - even if they at first seem bizarre or unfounded. Councils must also follow policies and procedures, including those in the 2018 Procedures for the Administration of the Model Code of Conduct published by the NSW Government. Finally, councils should be aware of their obligations under legislation, including the GIPA Act and the Public Interest Disclosures Act 1984. Outside of these obligations, councils can also take steps to contain fallout from unwelcome public attention.

In today's hostile media environment and the 24-hour news cycle, it is imperative that councils curate a media response to any unwelcome media attention. The time has passed when the best approach is to simply ignore a story or ""wait for the storm to pass"".

When serious allegations are made (whether they are founded or not), councils should inform the public of prompt action they are taking and keep any investigation transparent. Where appropriate, councils should also consider releasing a public statement of support for employees. It is becoming more common for councils to hire public relations ""crisis managers"", who can help them get in contact with media outlets and curate public messages, including positive stories to change prevailing sentiment.

If allegations against council are serious, internal or external investigations may be needed. Often, councils select a senior person to conduct them, or engage specialist investigation companies or lawyers.

A decision should be made early whether any subsequent report is for internal use only or for external publication. This will frame the approach to the investigation, including privilege and confidentiality over relevant documents, and the content of the report itself.

During the investigation, councils should be conscious of:

Councils are obliged under work health and safety legislation to safeguard the physical and psychological wellbeing of their officers and staff. Anyone named or readily identifiable in media stories will understandably feel anxious and stressed. Investigations, which often involve interviews by external persons, can be confronting and burdensome. Councils should consider procedures to make the process as transparent as possible and to remove uncertainty. This should include access to an employee assistance program, nominating managers or personnel to routinely check on affected employees, and keeping employees well informed of any review and investigation process."

A delegation of Sikh residents met the Governor on Tuesday and submitted a six-page memorandum apprising him of several issues confronting the community, according to a press release issued by the Harijan Panchayat Committee (HPC).

The HPC said the delegation told the Governor that the school belonged to the committee and that they had patta for the land.

They also pointed out that the school has received grants under various schemes.

HPC secretary and City Gurdwara Management Committee president Sardar Gurjit Singh, who led the delegation to the Governor, said the Government of Punjab has granted funds for the school.

The delegation's meeting with the Governor comes in the wake of Chief Minister Conrad Sangma categorically saying funds to be given by the Punjab government couldn't be used in the disputed area. Deputy Chief Minister, Prestone Tynsong, and Urban Affairs Minister, Hamletson Dohling, had also taken exception to the Punjab Government announcing Rs 60 lakh as compensation for the city's Sikh community.

Tynsong asserted that the Punjab government announced compensation without verifying facts and on the basis of hearsay while Dohling said that it would mislead the entire country by giving the impression that there was massive destruction in the incident at Sweeper's Colony.

The HPC said that the Deputy Chief Minister and Urban Affairs Minister were unnecessarily raising the issue to cause confusion and malign the Sikhs.

Alleging that a truck, a showroom and a shop were burnt during the riot in Shillong in June, Singh said the Punjab government had granted compensation to the respective owners.

He rued that so far no compensation of any kind has been given by the Meghalaya government and clarified that no compensation has been announced for any injured person by the Punjab government.

In 2016, the then Punjab Chief Minister, Parkash Singh Badal, visited Shillong giving Rs 10 lakhs to the Guru Nanak School and Rs 5 lakhs for the general development of Thandnongiaw village, Ri-Bhoi district, but nobody then had protested.

Disband High Level Committee

Demanding that the HLC be disbanded, the HPC said it has been issuing illegal orders for survey of properties of the poor Sikhs to the Shillong Municipal Board with the intention to dislocate them.

The HPC said that the so-called High Level Committee is bad in law and its proceedings in so far as relocation of Sikhs are concerned have been stayed by the High Court, the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).

""It has been acting in a biased and malafide manner,"" he said.

Singh said the NCM has ordered a stay on the state government's move to relocate the Sikh residents.

The delegation urged the Governor to ""remove the climate of fear being built against them.

It told the Governor that the Sikhs have been ""victims of veiled threats by student bodies, tribal NGOs, underground organisation namely the HNLC and other political leadership of the state. There have been intermittent overt and covert attempts to create a climate of fear in the minds of the Sikhs.""

The delegation also requested the Governor to enable the poor and suffering 218 Sikh families to get pattas and to change the official name of Punjabi Colony, which is referred to as ""Sweepers Colony"" citing the NHRC's instruction to the state government in this regard."

The late Stephen Hawking famously didn't believe in God. Neither does the renowned Richard Dawkins. But is that typical for U.K. scientists?

In a new study, researchers from Rice University, Baruch College and West Virginia University find that U.K. scientists are indeed significantly less religious than the U.K. general population.

In addition, U.K. scientists at elite universities are more likely to never attend religious services than those at less prestigious schools. The study also indicates biologists are more likely to never attend religious services than physicists.

""The Religiosity of Academic Scientists in the United Kingdom: Assessing the Role of Discipline and Department Status"" utilizes data collected in a survey of biologists and physicists employed at elite and nonelite departments, as past research has suggested the distinction could be relevant in understanding differences in religiosity. The researchers were interested in how U.K. scientists, particularly those who work at elite schools, compared to the general population with regard to religious beliefs.

The researchers found that while only 18 percent of people in the U.K. said they do not believe in God, 45 percent of U.K. scientists responded the same way. In addition, the researchers discovered that scientists in elite departments (a categorization based on the number of publications per department, published department rankings and insider knowledge) are about twice as likely to never attend religious services than scientists in nonelite departments.

Elaine Howard Ecklund, the Herbert S. Autrey Chair in Social Sciences, professor of sociology, director of Rice's Religion and Public Life Program and the study's lead author, observes that that elite scientists may represent the leading edge of the secularizing effects of science.

""Individuals who are at the most elite institutions may disproportionately feel the cultural pressure to secularize,"" Ecklund said. ""So, if those methods and mindset are inherently in conflict with religion, then these successful scientists would experience the greatest erosion of religious faith.""

Ecklund noted that such findings could also be a product of social forces rather than intellectual ones.

""This distinction could have an impact on how the public views scientists, in a national context where some minority groups are bringing challenges to teaching evolutionary theory, for example,"" she said.

""Elite scientists might express less religiosity because they assume that, as elite scientists, they are supposed to be or need to be less religious to fit a professional ideal,"" she added. ""Because they might already be on the fringes of that professional ideal in the first place, nonelite scientists may feel less social and cultural pressure to further conform to it.""

Study co-author Christopher P. Scheitle of West Virginia University's Department of Sociology and Anthropology said this might also help explain why U.K. biologists are more than 2½ times more likely to never attend religious services than British physicists.

""It is possible that U.K. biologists might be concerned that being seen as a more active participant in religion would violate some professional norm,"" said Jared Peifer, an assistant professor in the Department of Management at Baruch College's Zicklin School of Business.

Ecklund added: ""This norm might result from the history of public conflict surrounding issues like evolution and human embryonic stem cell research, which are most clearly connected to the biological sciences.""

The researchers hope their work will help foster a better understanding of the social dynamics between religion and science beyond the traditional focus on the U.S."

A majority of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members cited upside risks to inflation and emerging downside risks to growth for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged, as per the minutes of the committee meeting released by the Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday.

They also flagged the possibility of fiscal slippage influencing the inflation outlook, heightening market volatility, and crowding out of private investment.

While the decision to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent was unanimous in the 5th Bi-monthly Monetary Policy review on December 5, only Ravindra H Dholakia (former professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad) voted to change the stance to neutral from calibrated tightening.

Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute, observed that the elevated level of inflation, excluding food and fuel (6.1 per cent) at a three-month high, continues to be problematic.

""Most sub-groups of inflation, excluding food and fuel, other than clothing and footwear, have registered upticks. The reversal in inflation, excluding food and fuel, needs to be carefully watched,"" said Ghate.

With both inflation and growth numbers having developed ""soft-spots"", Ghate felt that the appropriate risk-management approach at the current juncture would be to ""wait and watch"". Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics, said: ""Looking forward, downside risks to the inflation outlook include continuing moderation in food inflation and a sharp fall in crude oil prices.

""At the same time, the slowdown in global growth may also lead to softening of crude oil prices. On the flip side, there is also the possibility of a rebound in crude oil prices due to supply factors.""

Additionally, fiscal slippages by the government may have adverse implications for market volatility and impact the outlook for inflation.

""Upside risks associated with an increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) still persist. Risks due to an increase in state-level House Rent Allowances (HRAs) and input prices also prevail. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the inflation outlook and movements in both food inflation and crude oil prices have to be watched closely,"" elaborated Dua.

According to Dholakia, with RBI's own inflation forecast coming down by around 120 basis points and quarterly growth forecasts marginally revised downward, opening up the output gap going forward, there is hardly any justification in retaining calibrated tightening stance.

Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director, RBI, was of the view that the Indian economy is experiencing the onset of positive supply shocks as reflected in the sizeable easing of prices of food and petroleum products which could reverse. Accordingly, they should be looked through, while remaining alert to spillovers to the rest of inflation, which is already elevated and rising.

""With average inflation gradually converging to target, these growth impulses can be maintained by ensuring that the expansion remains sustainable,"" said Patra.

Viral V Acharya, Deputy Governor, RBI, pointed out that factors such as unexpectedly large collapse in food inflation and oil price crash have resulted in an extraordinary downward revision in RBI's 12-month ahead inflation outlook. However, the past two months have also been extraordinarily volatile, making it difficult to make a complete sense of recent data."

""If you thought they (the Congress) only had a problem with EC and EVMs, now wait. They have humiliated the Army, CAG and every institution important to our democracy,"" he said during an interaction with polling booth level BJP workers of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry through a video conference from New Delhi.

He was apparently referring to the Congress questioning the veracity of the surgical strikes targeting terrorist launch pads in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir and for contesting the Comptroller and Auditor General's finding of Rs 1.86 lakh crore loss to the exchequer in the coal scam.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi had on Sunday lashed out at the Modi government, saying he will not allow ""destruction"" of institutions like the Supreme Court and the Reserve Bank of India.

The BJP government believes ""only one idea should run India"", Gandhi had told a public rally organised by his party's southern ally the DMK in Chennai.

Referring to the Supreme Court's judgement on the contentious Rafale fighter jet deal, the prime minister said the Congress was opposing it just because it did not like the verdict.

""They (the Congress) questioned an SC verdict just because they did not like the decision. Earlier, just because they could not threaten the court into doing what they wanted, just beacuse the court was being fair, they tried to even impeach the Chief Justice of India,"" he said.

The Congress had earlier this year moved a notice in Parliament for impeaching the then Chief Justice Dipak Misra, seeking his removal on five grounds of ""misbehaviour"". It was, however, rejected by Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on April 23.

Responding to a question of a party worker on taking on the Congress over its ""false"" propaganda, Modi said the perfect answer to ""undemocratic behaviour"" lay in strengthening democracy.

""Like the sunlight, which is the best disinfectant, information and awareness are important for democracy. Hence, people need to be apprised of the behaviour, attitude and dangerous games of the Opposition, including the Congress.

""They will do their best to spread lies but it is in our hands to spread truth. They will do their best to mislead people but it is in our hands to expose them,"" he said.

He asked the BJP cadre to tell people that before every election the Congress party started making noise about EVMs to create an atmosphere of doubt. But when results were in their favour, they accepted it.

Likening the Congress and opposition parties to a student blaming the school, teacher and examiner if his results were not favourable, Modi said, ""The same thing is happening in the case of our opposition, too. This has to be explained to the people.""

Hailing people as the greatest force protecting democracy, the prime minister said the last time Congress tried to threaten it, people threw them out of power. He was apparently hinting at imposition of Emergency by Indira Gandhi in 1975.

""Reach out to people and tell them the Congress' DNA is still the same. Just because Emergency saw a big fightback from the people now they have become more cunning in their tactics. But yet again India will not excuse the Congress for playing with democracy.""

""From housing to health care, from sanitation to skills, there are schemes for every section of society,"" he said, and asked booth level workers to reach out to people about those measures.

He said, if people were confused or misinformed, BJP workers could seek help of the Narendra Modi app to arm themselves with data and information.

Emphasising the need for strengthening the party at the polling booth level, Modi said,""Mera booth sabse majboot (strong). After all, the party that wins at the booth level wins the elections....meet (people) them regularly, share their joy, their sorrow and serve them.""

He also interacted with beneficiaries of the Centre's Mudra loan scheme and lauded a woman, expressing happiness that she had now become a job giver.

Modi asked BJP workers to inform people about how the education sector had undergone a transformation under his government.

In the last four years, he said, the focus was broadened from only the outlays to include outcomes.

""Similarly, the earlier approach was only about teaching. Going a step ahead, the government looked at learning. We are improving quality of education and increasing quantity of opportunities,"" he said.

Modi said the government came up with the National Institutional Ranking Framework for rating institutions based on objective and verifiable criteria. It was made available seperately for streams such as engineering, management, pharmacy, architecture, humanities and law.

He also talked about the steps taken for setting up branches of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in different states, including Tamil Nadu.

Modi said over 13,000 skill development centres were imparting livelihood training to lakhs of youth in 375 different skills.

The RBI had kept the repo rate -- at which it lends to banks -- at 6.50 per cent in the MPC review held between December 3-5.

""Although the inflation trajectory has been revised downwards, several uncertainties persist, especially about the medium-term outlook of food inflation and oil prices. Incoming data should help clear the haziness and enable better assessment of the inflation outlook, especially regarding the permanence of the current softness in inflation prints.

""Hence, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and retaining the stance of monetary policy as 'calibrated tightening',"" said the minutes of the meeting quoting Patel who had resigned as the RBI Governor on December 10.

Should upside risks, as outlined above, not materialise on a durable basis in the coming months, there is a possibility of space opening up for policy action in due course, Patel had argued.

RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya was of the view that even as the projection for retail inflation have been revised downwards significantly, several upside risks remain.

""In my view, it is better to understand data somewhat better over the next two months...while the recent downward surprises to inflation have significantly reduced the extent of policy tightening required in future, they have not eliminated the requirement altogether. On balance, given the relatively short period of time over which inflation has softened, it is important to wait and watch,"" Acharya said in the MPC meeting.

The RBI revised downwards the inflation forecast for the second half of the current fiscal at 2.7-3.2 per cent and 3.8-4.2 per cent in the first half of the next fiscal beginning April, due to favourable factors including assumption of a normal monsoon in 2019.

With risks tilted to the upside, the RBI remains cautious because of several uncertainties such as risk of a sudden reversal of the unusually low food prices, impact of MSP, oil price trajectory, volatile financial markets, elevated inflation expectations as well as risks of fiscal slippages a the centre and state government levels.

Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director of RBI, while voting for the status quo on the policy repo rate favoured maintaining the stance of calibrated tightening.

""With inflation projected to rise above 4 per cent over the 12-month ahead horizon, it is apposite to persevere with the stance of calibrated tightening to head off inflation pressures from potentially corroding the foundations of the growth path that is evolving over the medium-term,"" Patra said during the three-day MPC policy review.

Former Indian Institute of Management professor Ravindra H Dholakia said the best that can be done under the present circumstances is to hold the rate but change the stance to neutral to take care of all possible uncertainties.

""We should not deny any possibility of either a rate cut or a rate hike in the near future depending on data coming in,"" he said.

The sole female member in the six-member panel Delhi School of Economics Director Pami Dua also expressed her views that even as inflation has softened, the upside risks remain.

It is therefore best to pause and wait for incoming data while maintaining a vigil on inflation, especially with respect to food and crude oil, Dua said.

""At the same time, given the uncertainty with respect to the inflation outlook, I also vote for maintaining the stance of calibrated tightening,"" she added to her observation.

Member Chetan Ghate, professor, Indian Statistical Institute viewed ""both the inflation and growth numbers having developed 'soft-spots', the appropriate risk-management approach at the current juncture would be to 'wait and watch'.

This will allow the MPC to see how various risks to both inflation and growth evolve, and better assess the ability of flexible inflation targeting to absorb the impact of shocks that the economy is currently experiencing, said the Minutes of MPC quoting Ghate.

Consumer price index (CPI) based retail inflation had eased to a 17-month low of 2.33 per cent for November due to softer food prices, the government data showed earlier this month.

In October, it was at a year low of 3.38 per cent.

The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from February 5 to 7, 2019.

""I will urge the society to come forward to help them and I have full hope that the people will remember our martyrs. Let us boost the morale of our armed forces and help them and remember them too"", he said.

The department had also organised a patriotic song competition in which six teams participated.These teams were selected out of 1,200 schools.

Ahead of the programme, school children had visited homes of families of those killed in the line of duty and war heroes and penned their experiences in the form of essays.

The best essays were selected and winners were awarded by Governor Malik.

On the occasion the Inner Wheel Club and Rotary Club Elite of Jammu, adopted families of those killed in the line of duty.

""Although the inflation trajectory has been revised downwards, several uncertainties persist, especially about the medium-term outlook of food inflation and oil prices. Incoming data should help clear the haziness and enable better assessment of the inflation outlook, especially regarding the permanence of the current softness in inflation prints.

""Hence, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and retaining the stance of monetary policy as 'calibrated tightening',"" said the minutes of the meeting quoting Patel who had resigned as the RBI Governor on December 10.

Should upside risks, as outlined above, not materialise on a durable basis in the coming months, there is a possibility of space opening up for policy action in due course, Patel had argued.

RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya was of the view that even as the projection for retail inflation have been revised downwards significantly, several upside risks remain.

""In my view, it is better to understand data somewhat better over the next two months...while the recent downward surprises to inflation have significantly reduced the extent of policy tightening required in future, they have not eliminated the requirement altogether.

On balance, given the relatively short period of time over which inflation has softened, it is important to wait and watch,"" Acharya said in the MPC meeting.

The RBI revised downwards the inflation forecast for the second half of the current fiscal at 2.7-3.2 percent and 3.8-4.2 percent in the first half of the next fiscal beginning April, due to favourable factors including assumption of a normal monsoon in 2019.

With risks tilted to the upside, the RBI remains cautious because of several uncertainties such as risk of a sudden reversal of the unusually low food prices, impact of MSP, oil price trajectory, volatile financial markets, elevated inflation expectations as well as risks of fiscal slippages a the centre and state government levels.

Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director of RBI, while voting for the status quo on the policy repo rate favoured maintaining the stance of calibrated tightening.

""With inflation projected to rise above 4 percent over the 12-month ahead horizon, it is apposite to persevere with the stance of calibrated tightening to head off inflation pressures from potentially corroding the foundations of the growth path that is evolving over the medium-term,"" Patra said during the three-day MPC policy review.

Former Indian Institute of Management professor Ravindra H Dholakia said the best that can be done under the present circumstances is to hold the rate but change the stance to neutral to take care of all possible uncertainties.

""We should not deny any possibility of either a rate cut or a rate hike in the near future depending on data coming in,"" he said.

The sole female member in the six-member panel Delhi School of Economics Director Pami Dua also expressed her views that even as inflation has softened, the upside risks remain.

It is therefore best to pause and wait for incoming data while maintaining a vigil on inflation, especially with respect to food and crude oil, Dua said.

""At the same time, given the uncertainty with respect to the inflation outlook, I also vote for maintaining the stance of calibrated tightening,"" she added to her observation.

Member Chetan Ghate, professor, Indian Statistical Institute viewed ""both the inflation and growth numbers having developed 'soft-spots', the appropriate risk-management approach at the current juncture would be to 'wait and watch'.

This will allow the MPC to see how various risks to both inflation and growth evolve, and better assess the ability of flexible inflation targeting to absorb the impact of shocks that the economy is currently experiencing, said the Minutes of MPC quoting Ghate.

Consumer price index (CPI) based retail inflation had eased to a 17-month low of 2.33 percent for November due to softer food prices, the government data showed earlier this month.In October, it was at a year low of 3.38 percent."

It will encourage discussion and debate, and invite feedback for further refining our policy approach. We believe that economic transformation cannot happen without public participation. Development must become a Jan Andolan.""

NITI Aayog followed an extremely participative approach in preparing the strategy. Each area vertical in NITI Aayog had in-depth consultations with all three groups of stakeholders, viz., business persons, academics including scientists, and government officials.

The overarching focus of the Strategy document is to further improve the policy environment in which private investors and other stakeholders can contribute their fullest towards achieving the goals set out for New India 2022 and propel India towards a US$ 5 trillion economy by 2030.

Government Initiatives to Spread Awareness Regarding Menstrual Health to Boost Adoption

Lack of awareness regarding menstrual health in developing as well as underdeveloped parts across the globe have led national governments to initiate awareness program with the aim to assist girls and women to live healthy and productive lives where menstrual hygiene is a prerequisite. Specifically, with the focus on educating teenage girls, several government projects and initiatives have been launched. As the intensity of these programs grows, women in rural areas have started adopting hygienic products.

Further, governments in the developing countries like India have made menstrual hygiene an integral part of the nation's hygiene management guidelines. The program manages involvement of state governments, district administrations, engineers and technical experts in line departments; and school head teachers and teachers to ensure considerable penetration of the program among all adolescent girls and women. Increased education levels among females with the support of government initiatives is likely to boost adoption of menstrual sponge market during the estimated period.

Unawareness, Associated Health Risks, and Stringent FDA Regulations to Hamper the Market Progress

Unreachable health care services in the underdeveloped parts of Africa explains the lack of awareness regarding health and hygiene among the common population. As a result, the women population in the region is oblivious to hygiene maintenance, especially during the menstrual cycle. Further, lack of awareness about the use of menstrual sponges and debate associated with its usage is hampering the adoption of menstrual sponge.

Past examinations of sea sponges conducted under FDA revealed the presence of bacteria - Staphylococcus aureus which is responsible to cause toxic shock syndrome. Since then sea sponges that are labelled as menstrual sponges for use as menstrual tampons are required to get a premarket approval under the FDA Section 515. This has led to several manufacturers recalling their products. Further, owing to the risk of development of toxic shock syndrome, medical professionals do not prescribe the frequent use of menstrual sponges. Limited popularity, associated health risks and stringent FDA regulations are factors expected to impound the growth of the menstrual sponge market.

Addressing media persons here today, the Union Minister for Tribal Affairs Shri Jual Oram said that consequent upon Budget announcement for 2018-19, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, in its meeting held on 17th December, 2018, has decided that by the year 2022, every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons, will have an Eklavya Model Residential School. Eklavya schools will be on par with Navodaya Vidyalayas and will have special facilities for preserving local art and culture besides providing training in sports and skill development. Across the country, as per census 2011 figures, there are 564 sub-districts i.e. blocks/taluka/tehsil having more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons. Out of these sub-districts, at present 102 sub-districts have EMRSs.

He informed the media persons that it is proposed to establish new EMRSs in the remaining 462 sub-districts by the year 2022 as per the phasing plan as given below:

The Minister said that the proposed scale up of the initiative through enhanced recurring and non-recurring cost is a path breaking initiative. This will immensely help in reducing gaps in literacy between ST population vis-à-vis overall population. The focus is on academic excellence through this upscaled initiative and will lead to holistic development of tribal children.

Ministry of Tribal Affairs (M/oTA) was set up in 1999, with the objective of providing more focused approach on the integrated socio-economic development of the Scheduled Tribes (STs), the most underprivileged of the Indian Society, in a coordinated and planned manner. M/oTA is the nodal Ministry for overall policy, planning and coordination of programmes for development of STs. One of the important educational intervention by Ministry of Tribal Affairs is establishing Eklavya Model Residential Schools with the objective of enhancing access to quality education and to maximize retention of ST students within various stages of school education and promoting higher learning among them. EMRS is an excellent approach for imparting quality education to ST children. Apart from school building including hostels and staff quarters, provision for a playground, students' computer lab, teacher resource room etc. are also included in the EMRSs. A total of 284 EMRSs have been sanctioned as on date, out of which 219 have been reported functional, with about 65,231 students enrolled therein. The existing non-recurring cost is Rs.12.00 Crores (16.00 Crores for North East, hilly, deserts and islands). The recurring cost is Rs.61500/- from 2018-19.

The important features of the decision are:-

1. Setting up of Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) in 462 blocks having more than 50% ST population with minimum 20,000 ST population by the year 2022 including 12 Eklavya Model Day Boarding School (EMDBS). It may be also being mentioned that EMDBS will be established wherever density of ST population is higher in identified Sub-Districts/Blocks (90% or more). This will be a boost for providing additional scope for ST Students seeking to avail school education without residential facility.

2. Financial provisions for 145 EMRSs and 5 EMDBSs during 2018-19 and 2019-20.

3. Setting up of an Autonomous Society under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs similar to Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti to run the EMRSs. (The Society to function through an Executive Committee (EC) under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Tribal Affairs. The EC shall be responsible for the management of all affairs including allocation of funds for setting up and functioning of EMRSs. The composition of the Steering Committee will be decided with the approval of the Minister, Tribal Affairs.

4. Enhancing the construction cost of EMRS (with 480 students capacity) to Rs. 20.00 Crore.

5. Cost of construction of EMRSs for North East, hilly areas, difficult areas and areas affected by Left Wing Extremism at 20% more than the normal cost.

6. Enhancing the recurring cost from the existing Rs. 61,500/- to Rs. 1,09,000/- per student per year from 2019-20 and recurring cost for EMDBS to Rs. 85,000/- per student per year from 2019-20.

7. Upgradation of already sanctioned EMRSs on need basis with unit cost subject to a maximum of Rs. 5 crores per school.

8. Setting up Centre of Excellence for sports at select locations with all related infrastructure (buildings, equipment's etc.). This Centre of Excellence will have specialized state-of-the-art facilities for two identified sports (including one group sport and one individual sport) which will be common for a State.

9. Enhancing the grants for maintenance, which are admissible every five years, from Rs 10 lakhs to Rs.20 Lakhs.

10. Utilization of up to 10% seats by non-ST students. Priority shall be given to children of EMRSs staff, children who have lost their parents to Left wing extremism and insurgencies, children of widows etc.

11. Reservation of 20% seats under sports quota for deserving ST students who have excelled in the field of sports.

As per the inquiry, the school head, education department officials and the doctors who examined the girl did not report the matter to the police. Copies of the letters are with TOI.

In November, TOI had reported that the commission has refrained itself from recommending action against the persons in question for delay in reporting the case as suggested in the Juvenile Justice Act and had left it to the concerned authorities to decide the punishment. Notably, this is the first time that the child rights commission has shown leniency in a serious case and not recommended FIR against every person from doctors to school heads and education department officials who did not report the matter to the police as per the Act suggests.

As per the information, this was done because the school authorities were found to be unaware about the law that applied in such a case.

In 2015, CCPCR had acted the other way and recommended FIR against the school management of a private Chandigarh school for delaying to report the molestation case of a pre-primary student. The conductor of the school bus had molested a kindergarten student in the bus. Recently, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed a lower court to proceed against a the school principal who had failed to act even after knowing about the molestation.

The JJ Act states under Section 19 (1) that any person who has the apprehension that an offence is likely to be committed or has the knowledge that an offence has been committed, should bring the incident to the notice of the special juvenile police unit or the local police. The failure to report such an offence is punishable with imprisonment or fine or both.

Failing to report the commission of an offence under Section 19 (1) or failing to record such offence under section 19 (2) is punishable under Section 21

(2) which states that any person, being in-charge of any company or an institution (by whatever name called) who fails to report the commission of an offence in respect of a subordinate under his control, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year and with fine.

CCPCR chairperson Harjinder Kaur could not be reached for comment."

He had just about recovered from an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury and his shaky feet raised self-doubts on his ability to make the cut. However, coach Stephen Constantine showed tremendous faith in him. Poojary slowly regained his confidence and played a crucial role in the team's run-up to the final.

It's been the case with Poojary since he first took to the beautiful game. Each time he decided to walk away from football, the universe conspired in a way to ensure that he was drawn right back to it. It's what has made him believe in something that he calls magic today, besides, of course, his own abilities.

For, without that little bit of enchantment, the dream of playing professional football would have remained just that, let alone turning out for the senior national side in the Indian blues.

A stroke of luck

Football entered Poojary's world quite by chance. At St. Augustines High School in Nerul in Navi Mumbai, he had readied himself to go for cricket selections but erroneously landed up at the football trials instead. One look at his ability to run with the ball at his feet earned him plaudits at that early stage.

""We had a good system in place with experienced coaches to guide us. The likes of Rahul Bheke, who went on to play professional football, were from my school. Once I got started, I never really stopped playing,"" Poojary says.

When it came to school football, competition was scarce in Navi Mumbai -- a far cry from the hundreds of teams that turn out in the league conducted by the Mumbai School Sports Association. So while his school were champions for a good eight years that he was there, the real challenge lay in locating a club to further his prospects. That opportunity came in the form of a team comprising boys from the Ryan International Group of schools, where Poojary was part of the squad the earned promotion to the first division of the Mumbai District Football Association league.

Education first

Back home, the conditions on him playing football were set even before he was out of school. Three years before Poojary was born, his father, Chandrashekhar, had moved to Mumbai from Mangalore in search of work and was employed as a waiter at a hotel in Chembur. Excelling at education was key to bettering his prospects in the future and in turn, easing the financial burden on the family.

""I come from a middle class household, so money matters for us. Aur life main security tab milegi, jab padhai karega. Mereko doctor, engineer banana that, lekin main to flop ho gaya (And you'll earn security in life if you studied. They wanted to make me an engineer or a doctor, but I simply flopped),"" Poojary says, smiling.

After performing reasonably well in his 10th grade, Poojary took to the science stream. Around the same time, someone told him about trials at Mumbai FC for their under-15 side. He made the cut and proved his worth at the Manchester United Premier Cup in 2011 that featured most junior I-League teams.

By the end of the tournament, Poojary had captained the side to the final where they lost to Salgaocar, though his performance still earned him the best player award. Coach Naushad Moosa was left impressed with the promise he had shown, and the following year, promoted him to the Mumbai FC under-19 side and asked him to train with the big boys.

Despite struggling with injuries and low on confidence, Poojary received the backing of India coach Stephen Constantine. Image courtesy: Nikhil Poojary

For three years, Poojary was part of a daily grind that started at 4.30 am, involved changing three trains and spending around 2 and a half hours travelling in each direction, to get to the training ground in Borivali from his home in Nerul.

""And this was if I managed to get onto the train, which used to be really crowded at times,"" he recalls.

The taxing routine, however, left little time for studies, and in turn, Poojary flunked his 12th-grade examination. His father made a quick call to coach Moosa and told him that his son would play no further part at Mumbai FC. It was to be a premature end to his football career, yet life handed him a lifeline when he least expected it.

A team called Mumbai Tigers FC, which was formed around the same time in Vashi -- a short distance from his home -- reached out to him with an offer of Rs 10,000. It was unheard of for an under-19 player at the time.

""It was a relief for me and motivation for my parents to allow me to continue playing. At a time when I was about to quit, a new club came my way. You can call it God's gift,"" Poojary says.

Under the watchful eye of coach Bimal Ghosh, who is known to have groomed a number of young players, Poojary was once again, handed the opportunity to train with the big boys -- the likes of Steven Dias, NP Pradeep, Surkumar Singh and Paresh Shivalkar, who had already made a mark at the national stage. Having lost a year at college, there was enough time now to train and Poojary slowly found his feet among the seniors. But even as he settled into the new set up, the club suddenly shut shop, leaving him with question marks on his decision to continue playing all over again.

The hunt begins

From Mumbai Tigers, Poojary moved to Air India, who had pulled out of the I-League but actively played other tournaments. The money was also good and his parents finally relented on their insistence that he chase an education. When the time to renew his contract came a year later, Poojary decided to hold his horses on the advice of an agent, who told him that he would soon sign for a bigger, better club. That offer never arrived and after Mumbai FC too declined to sign him, Poojary found himself relatively stranded midway through 2015, with no income at his disposal for over six months.

""That was a time that I thought I would give up on a career in professional football, join a call centre and see where my life would take me,"" Poojary says.

Even as he was finalising his decision to quit playing, an offer to try out at Mohammedan Sporting came his way in November 2015. There was no question of asking his parents on their opinion, for he knew their decision, so with a one-way ticket, he decided to take on a 36-hour, unreserved train ride to Kolkata and try his luck.

""It was around Durga Puja and I didn't get a seat, so I slept next to the toilet at the start of the journey. I soon met some East Bengal supporters on the train, and when I told them I was Bheke's friend (who was at East Bengal at that time) and was going for trials, they gave me some place to sit,"" he says.

With the finances hard to manage at home, Poojary arrived in Kolkata relatively penniless and walked to Mohammedan's training facility. He was soon directed to the dressing room, which was to be his home for the next week. Before leaving, he was handed a can of mosquito repellent by the club officials and shown a sofa that was to be his bed.

""And I did need it at night amid all the muck,"" Poojary quips.

In the week that followed, Poojary was at the trials and during his time off the field, he would go watch the first team play in the Calcutta Football League alongside the supporters.

""An entire truckload of fans -- I had never seen anything like it before, because who asks a footballer anything in Mumbai? I would join them to the ground and back, eat biryani with them and get to see what Kolkata football was all about. It was nothing like I had experienced before and when I spoke to my mother, I remember telling her that I wasn't going to find a team better than this one,"" he says.

Further dejection

But by the end of it, further rejection followed as he was denied a contract and he called his agent to give him an earful, distraught at his prospects after all the struggle. He then pleaded his father to book him a ticket, unable to hold back his tears, simply wanting to return home and hang up his boots.

""That evening, my agent called me again and said that East Bengal was offering me trials. I laughed at the prospect of such a big club calling upon me, when I had been rejected by Mohammedan. But he insisted so I went,"" he says.

Before Poojary was handed the opportunity to step on the ground, former player and now a part of the East Bengal management, Alvito D'Cunha, did a background check on him by calling his coaches. What followed were three of the most horrible days at trials, after which, he was duly informed that a practice game against Army XI would be his last stint before he was being sent back home. That in turn, switched the balance in Poojary's favour for the first time in his senior career.

Striking gold

In the Calcutta Football League that year, Army XI had handed East Bengal a shock defeat. As a result, the scheduled fixture was expected to draw a lot of eyeballs and was even broadcasted on local television. East Bengal had their revenge with a 2-0 win, but more importunately, the fans had a new hero in their midst in Poojary, who had scored both goals.

""You know how it is to score a goal in India -- it then doesn't matter whether you had a decent game or not. That evening, I was handed a three-year contract. And I didn't bother looking at the amount because playing for East Bengal was massive,"" Poojary says.

What Poojary didn't know then was that scouts from the national team had also made their way there and in a few days, he received his first call-up for the India under-23 side. However, a hamstring injury ruled him out for the rest of the year.

By the time the next season arrived, Poojary was a wreck. The pressure of playing for East Bengal had told time and again, and at the back of his head, self-doubts had crept in on whether he would be able to handle another intense season in Kolkata.

""The fans would watch every single game and would critically analyse your performance, whether in person or on social media. I thought of terminating my contract and staying back in Mumbai. But I had always looked up to Rahul Bheke, who was at East Bengal at the time, and when he called and insisted that I come, I decided to go,"" he says.

India debut beckons

That stint is what Poojary calls his breakthrough season. Under coach Trevor Morgan, he made rapid progress and after 14 appearances in the I-League, he received another call-up for the India under-23 side. And this time, he didn't disappoint.

After putting on a good show in practice games in Singapore and Qatar, Poojary found himself in the India squad for the Tri-Nations Cup in Mumbai in August 2017. It was his first senior call-up and one of the few occasions when his parents could come to watch him play, making his debut even more special.

""There couldn't have been anything bigger for me than my folks making it there. Though I came on as a substitute in the first game, I started the second. There were tears streaming down my face when the national anthem played. Even today, I find all this very hard to believe,"" he says.

Injury issues

After the tournament, Poojary received a call from FC Pune City who asked him if he was interested in signing for them. He decided to go back to Kolkata to talk to East Bengal about his future. But during the first few training sessions, he hit rock bottom after all the highs, picking up an ACL injury that ruled him out through all of last year.

""After my surgery, I went to multiple doctors but my rehab had some major ups and downs. One day I felt fit and then the next, I would have my confidence knocked out at training. I wasn't sure if I would play at a good level again,"" he recalls.

Though injured, Pune City stood by their man and signed him, taking over his recovery process. When it came to the national team, Poojary had been sounded out before his operation that he would be considered for the SAFF Championship in Bangladesh and his rehabilitation had been planned in a way, that he would be ready in time for the tournament in September this year.

Fighting back

During the first day at camp, he had the lowest score on the fitness test. The niggling pain was a constant source of torment and Poojary had serious doubts on playing.

""They pushed me so hard that I thought it would aggravate my injury. When I look back now, clearly I had no idea that they had a plan,"" he says.

""Coach Stephen Constantine showed tremendous faith in me. The rest of the support staff would conduct endless sessions, specifically for me, and I remember that the massage therapy would go on until midnight. It's their hard work and their confidence in me that gave me that little bit of belief in my own abilities,"" he adds.

After the 45-day camp which also featured games in Australia, Poojary made the cut to the squad for the SAFF Championship. The time on field had gradually helped him gain back his confidence and Constantine handed him his first chance as a second-half substitute against Sri Lanka. In the next tie against the Maldives, Poojary started the game and notched up his first international goal.

""That goal was a massive boost for me; more so, because I realised I had recovered, both physically and mentally. The goal was for the coaching staff who had worked so hard on me,"" he says.

Poojary considers himself to be a very different person after undergoing all that he had during the injury. He's back at his best now, with seven appearances for Pune City, as well as game time during the national side's friendly against China.

Having made the cut for the 34-member, preliminary squad for the AFC Asian Cup, he will be looking to prove his worth at the Indian camp. And though Pune City have had a turbulent season thus far, he certainly believes in a little bit of magic these days.

It will take place at Egmont Palace in Brussels on 15-16 January 2019, aiming to develop technology-driven solutions for some of today's most pressing humanitarian challenges.

This two-day event will bring together international and Belgian humanitarian organisations, donors, large companies, start-ups, scientists, academics and engineers to generate new ideas, build prototypes and launch new projects that could help save and change millions of lives around the world.

WFP has identified six key challenges faced by the humanitarian sector, such as improving humanitarian access in hard-to-reach areas, optimising data management, adapting to climate change, connecting smallholder farmers to markets, leveraging local food production for school meals, and using technology to predict population movements. Participants will form teams that will address these challenges either by developing prototypes using new technologies or through harnessing the existent resources from multiple stakeholders.

The Humanitarian Hackathon aims to leverage cutting-edge technologies and solutions, which can help create a world without hunger by 2030. After decades of decline, global hunger is on the rise again, making the Hackathon's challenges extremely timely and relevant. As many as 821 million people - one in nine - go to bed on an empty stomach each night. Finding new ways to deliver aid more efficiently and effectively is crucial to alleviate their suffering and turn #ZeroHunger into reality.

For more information, visit our website www.humanitarianhackathon.org. The application deadline for participants is 27 December 2018.

The Humanitarian Hackathon is an initiative of the Belgian Ministry for Development Cooperation, Digital Agenda and Telecommunications, a major donor of international humanitarian aid. The event is organized by the World Food Programme (WFP), the leading agency fighting hunger worldwide, and by Hack Belgium Labs, the creator of Belgium's biggest multi-stakeholder hackathon.

Dustin Pooler, MD, who is currently a Fellow in Abdominal Imaging and Intervention at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.

Obesity is a major public health problem in Western countries like the US. Approximately two-thirds of adults in the USA are either overweight or obese. Obesity is associated with fat accumulation in the liver in conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The disease can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver cirrhosis, which significantly increases the risk of liver cancer.

Weight reducing surgical procedures such as bariatric surgery and sleeve gastrectomy are very effective in reducing body fat. However, whether overall body fat reduction also causes a decrease in liver fat is yet to be established. The only available procedure is a biopsy, followed by fat detection. However, liver biopsy is a highly invasive procedure and is not at all suitable for routine diagnosis and monitoring of progression of fatty liver diseases.

The new study used a noninvasive technique called chemical shift encoded magnetic resonance imaging (CSE-MRI) to quantitatively estimate the liver fat content before and after weight loss bariatric surgery. The procedure assesses the fat content of the liver by measuring a fat fraction called proton density fat fraction (PDFF).

Pooler indicated that CSE-MRI allows the representation of the liver fat content as a percentage, which is much easier for the patients to comprehend. The percentage value also permits the direct comparison of the fat content of liver from surgical as well as biopsy samples, without any confusion or ambiguity.

Chemical shift encoded magnetic resonance imaging (CSE-MRI) is an adaptation of the MRI technique, which is a noninvasive imaging method using a powerful magnetic field, radio waves and a computer to produce detailed images of the internal structures of the body. The images produced by MRI are clearer and much more detailed than other imaging techniques.

CSE-MRI takes advantage of the difference between the properties of water and fat in an organ. The differences in the local magnetic field produced by variation in the fat density due to presence of water molecules, helps to quantitatively assess fat composition of the body (in the present study, fat content of liver) and estimate the degree of saturation of the fat (saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated), thereby producing very accurate, clear-cut images of the liver.

When PDFF is measured by CSE-MRI, it helps to detect the presence of fatty liver. Thus, PDFF can act as an accurate biomarker of fatty liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

The study involved CSE-MRI to assess the condition of 50 obese patients both before and after undergoing bariatric surgery for weight reduction. The patients were put on a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) for 14 days before the surgery, which has been found to enhance the safety and efficacy of this type of surgery.

Before the surgery, CSE-MRI was carried out twice, first before initiation of the VLCD and second, one-day pre-op. After the surgery, CSE-MRI was carried out thrice - at 1 month post-op, 3 months post-op, and 6 months post-op. The research team also determined liver fat by PDFF and compared it with the body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference, which are important physical markers of obesity.

The following findings concerning the study participants should be noted:

Most Important Finding: The initial PDFF was the only parameter that strongly predicted both loss of liver fat and the time to normalization.

""The results showed a rapid early phase of improvements in liver fat, followed by a phase of continued improvements at a slower pace,"" Pooler said. ""The changes began with the initiation of the low-calorie diet and occurred in advance of the overall improvements in BMI among the patients.""

The following implications were noted, with reference to the role of CSE-MRI in the management of obese patients suffering from fatty livers:

""There is this assumption that when you lose weight, you also reduce liver fat, but the relationship was very hard to measure prior to having a good tool like MRI,"" Pooler said. ""This study shows that the MRI technique is very clinically feasible for monitoring liver fat over time.""

The research team believes that the CSE-MRI technique could have many applications, other than just monitoring the effects of bariatric surgery. The procedure could potentially monitor all types of patients who have undergone a variety of weight reduction treatments. The researchers aim to extend their study to these groups of patients in the future.

Six persons, including principal Sanjiv Jha of New KM Public school, were earlier booked in the case. The others are absconding.

Another FIR has been filed by the education department on Monday against the same accused for running the unauthorised school.

""In August 2017, we had shut a similar unauthorised school at the same site. However, soon after they changed the name of the school and reopened it. We are hopeful that the accused will be arrested soon,"" said basic education officer, Balmukund Prasad.

The administration has also approved a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each for the families of the deceased students and the families are hopeful it will be transferred to them soon.

The incident occurred around 9.30 am on Monday in Salarpur village, while an exam was going on inside the school.

According to principal Jha's statement, the victims were standing outside to either use the washroom or to drink water. Since he was busy inside the school as examinations were going on, he didn't know the exact sequence of the event, said police officials.

Five children were trapped under the rubble of the boundary wall when it collapsed. All five had been rushed to nearby hospitals after they were extricated from the debris by the locals, the police and a team from NDRF.

Two of the students identified as Vivek Yadav (7) and Bhupendra Singh (11) died while three others were critically injured. One of the injured students was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday while the other two continue to recuperate.

According to police, construction work was in progress on the adjoining plot. The sand from the construction site was kept along the boundary wall of the school, which was about 10-feet high, and the weight of it allegedly weakened it thereby, leading to its collapse.

Police had registered an FIR against six persons, including the management of the school and the neighbour on whose plot the construction was taking place. The persons who have been booked are Amit and Sumit Bhati (owners), Deshraj Bhati (neighbouring plot owner), Sanjiv Jha (principal), Raghvendra Solanki (school manager) and the operator of the earthmover ( yet to be identified).

The FIR has been registered under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 338 (causing grievous hurt) and Section 75 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

Sector 49 police arrested Jha from home in sector 107. Jha was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.

A photograph of Marx overlooks stacks of plastic chairs, crammed bookshelves and an old desktop computer in an office on the ground floor of a building in central Mumbai. On the evening of January 12, a group of electricity workers affiliated with the Mumbai Electric Employees Union met here. They worked for Reliance Energy, which supplied electricity to homes in the city's suburbs. Despite working for the company for around two decades, laying cables and excavating new lines, they were not permanent employees - they were hired by contractors, who supplied labour to the company.

The previous few weeks had been tumultuous. The company was in the middle of a major transition: its ownership was changing hands, with the Adani Group in the process of taking over.

During this period, a worker died on December 19. He was returning home from work when he fainted and hit his head, resulting in a brain haemorrhage. All the workers in the area - permanent and contract - went on a one-day strike to force the company to pay full-duty compensation to his family.

It seemed like a victory - except, on January 1, the contract workers found they had been marked absent for the day of the strike, while the permanent workers had not. When the union raised this, four workers were suspended on January 9.

Three days later, the union met in their Dadar office to discuss this suspension. Hours later, close to midnight, four of its members found men in plain clothes at their doorstep.

""At around 11.45 pm, around 15 to 20 people came to our door,"" said Rajitha, wife of Satyanarayana Karrela, 40, one of the union members. ""We did not know who they were as they were in civil dress. When we asked they just told us they had work with us.""

The men made the couple sit with their backs to each other and asked them to stay silent as they went about ransacking the house. At the end of the search, they said that they had to take Karrela with them. Panicking that he was about to be kidnapped, Rajitha seized her husband's arm and refused to let go. At this point, she said, the men announced they were the police. They said Karrela would be released in the morning. When she still refused to let go, they wrote an address and phone number on a piece of paper and told her to come there the next morning.

Similar stories played out at the houses of other union members that night - Babushankar Vanguri, 30, Shankar Gunde, 40, and Ravi Marampelli, 40. Large groups of police in plain clothes appeared close to midnight, searched their houses and took them away.

This was no ordinary police detail - it was the Anti-Terrorism Squad of the Maharashtra Police. As the families of the union members found out later, the arrests had been made under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which punishes those proved guilty of working with banned organisations. In this case, the ATS claims the workers had been funding the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), which has been fighting a protracted guerilla war in central and eastern India for decades with the aim of overthrowing the government.

How exactly had low-paid workers in Mumbai, who barely earned enough to support their families in India's most expensive city, saved money to send to an underground organisation?

The police claims they did so by raising money from contractors.

At the heart of the police claims, as outlined in its 5,000-page chargesheet submitted in May, are two bank cheques of Rs 1.5 lakh each. Issued in May 2017, the cheques was signed by three office bearers of a contractors association that supplied labour to Reliance Energy. The police claim the workers encashed the cheques and passed on the money to a Maoist operative, who further transferred the money to underground Maoists in Telangana.

But other union members have a simpler explanation for the cheques: they say they were written in support of the union's annual May Day function.

""The workers organised May Day functions every year and get donations from the contractors association for this,"" said N Vasudevan of the New Trade Union Initiative that backs the contract workers' union.

On the same day that they arrested the four union members, the police also arrested Narsaiah Jumpala, one of the three signatories of the cheques and a member of the contractors association. Anjaiah Anthati, president of the association, said there was no coercion at the contractor association meeting at which they decided to sign the cheques. The association, he claimed, makes donations to all workers unions every few years and that too in ""white"" money, by cheque, not cash.

""We can conduct our business only if we have good relations with them,"" said Anthati. ""If we tell them, 'No, go, we won't give you anything', then at some point, the union people will cause trouble for us. That is why we tell them we will take care of them. For this, we have to give them chai paani (money).""

But the police has cited witness statements from at least unnamed 12 contractors in support of its claims. These feature as part of the chargesheet, among the 100-odd statements which have been cited after redacting witness names.

Strikingly, all 12 statements contain identical paragraphs about how the workers introduced a man named ""Mahesh"", who they claimed worked for ""the Party"". ""As I am a resident of Andhra Pradesh, I know that in our native place, Naxalites are recognised as being of the 'party,'"" reads every single statement as translated into Marathi, purportedly made independently in Hindi by each contractor. ""Since then, we became afraid of the topic of Mahesh and whenever Ravi Marampelli, Satyanarayana Karrela and Shankar Gunde asked us for money, we always gave them money out of fear.""

Said Atul Chandra Kulkarni, additional director general of police in charge of the Anti-Terrorism Squad, ""If they have made identical statements to us, that is why we have recorded it that way.""

On January 12, along with four workers and the contractor, the police also arrested a man named Ajay Dasari, who they allege is the Maoist operative who workers introduced as ""Mahesh"". The seventh arrest, also made the same day, was of Ramesh Gondiala, 37, a pro-Telangana poet and activist who worked as a milk delivery man near Kalyan, on the outskirts of Mumbai. In February, another worker, Saidulu Singapanga, 36, was taken into custody, taking the total number of arrests in the case to eight.

This isn't the only Maoist case brought by the Maharashtra police against urban residents. Over June and August, Pune police arrested ten lawyers and activists, accusing them of working with the banned CPI (Maoist) and labelling them ""Urban Naxals"". These arrests too were made under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. Often described as draconian with vague definitions, it allows the police to hold the accused in prison for long periods by prohibiting the courts to grant bail as long as the accusation made by the police appears ""prima facie true"".

""As far as Maharashtra is concerned, there are very few UAPA cases,"" said Nihalsingh Rathod, a Nagpur lawyer with the Indian Association of People's Lawyers. ""Most cases are invoked against Islamic terrorism. The rest are concentrated in Gadchiroli district [in eastern Maharashtra, where there is a Maoist presence].""

Of the few in western Maharashtra, one is the union workers' case. Another is the 2011 case against alleged Maoist Angela Sontakke and the Kabir Kala Manch, a cultural organisation based in Pune, members of which have since been released on bail. In 2015, the Anti-Terrorism Squad arrested Konnath Muralidharan, a Maoist leader from Kerala while he was being treated at a hospital near Pune.

Given the prominence of the ten activists arrested between June and August, and a legal challenge to their arrests in the Supreme Court, discussions on the misuse of this 1960 law were briefly revived, before receding again.

According to Indiaspend, as many as 2,700 cases were filed under UAPA in three years between 2014 and 2016. Of the 33 trials under the law completed in 2016, it reported, 67% ended in acquittals. Evidence in several of these cases tends to be vague.

""I think a lot of leeway is given to the prosecuting agency at the pre-charge stage because it's their word against what the accused have to say,"" said senior advocate Rebecca John, who has argued several cases under the act. ""I don't think enough judicial scrutiny takes place at this stage. And very few of these cases end in conviction. For the prosecution, the period of incarceration is itself the punishment.""

A common thread that connects all of the men arrested on January 12 is the place where they came from: Telangana. Or more specifically, the two districts of Nalgonda and Karimnagar. Also common is their caste background: the workers are all Dalits.

The Mumbai Electric Employees Union was established in 2005, after a worker died while on duty. As contract workers, they were entitled to a compensation of only Rs 25,000 but as union members claim, they successfully forced the company to increase it Rs 6.5 lakh. Since then, the union grew in strength, attracting a large membership of around 1,000 of the company's 4,000 contract workers, many of whom are Telugu-speaking migrants. The Shiv Sena-affiliated Mumbai Electric Workers' Union, which is the only union which is recognised by the company and the Labour Commissioner, claims to represent all contract workers, apart from the 3,500-odd permanent workers, many of whom are Marathi-speaking.

All the arrested workers were office-bearers of the Mumbai Electric Employees Union and played a crucial role in every negotiation with the company and contractors. They all lived in and around Ghatkopar in central Mumbai with their wives and young children and had each been with the electricity company for around at least 15-20 years.

Work conditions were severe at first, say members of the union who worked with their arrested counterparts. Each day, they would go to the company's electricity office and contractors would tell them how many of them would get work for that day. Often, workers would return home empty-handed. With the formation of their union, however, working conditions changed. One of their first struggles was to ensure that all contract workers would get work daily. The arrested workers were active in ensuring this.

In their spare time, they organised reading groups and kept their fellow workers updated with political pamphlets and books related to Marxist, Ambedkarite and pro-Telangana ideology, said Vasudevan. Despite their long stint in the metropolis, the union members had strong connections to their homelands and were active in supporting the movement for a new Telangana state. When Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the new Telangana Rashtra Samiti government promised three acres of land each to landless Dalit farmers. The workers, said Vasudevan, made several trips back home in the hope of getting land.

A Telangana-based researcher specialising in human rights and law, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that many migrants did indeed come back in droves in the first year of the new government, thinking they had to be physically present to avail of the scheme. However, the scheme has not materialised. The workers had grown disenchanted with the new government, said Vasudevan.

According to their co-workers, all the arrested shared an interest in Ambedkarite and Marxist ideas. At all their homes, the police found books, magazines and pamphlets related to this ideology. At Singapanga's home, the police found copies of Veekshanam, a magazine edited by N Venugopal, a Telugu poet, literary critic and journalist.

""We have even published their letters in Veekshanam,"" said Venugopal, who knew six of the eight accused. ""That way they are socially active. But the charge the police is making now is preposterous and unbelievable.""

The police chargesheet contains a screenshot of an email sent by one of the arrested workers, Vanguri, to another arrested worker, Singapanga, inviting him to an event at Ramabai Nagar to protest the arrest of Manda Krishna Madiga, a Telugu Dalit rights activist living in Telangana. Krishna, who was subsequently released, has spoken against the Maoist party for betraying the cause of workers.

But an official of the Anti-Terrorism Squad, who did not want to be identified, claimed the workers' union itself was as an overground organisation of the Maoists. Such organisations are part of the Golden Corridor Committee plan, he said, through which Maoists seek to infiltrate industrial areas in western India.

By all accounts, the workers, however, showed greater interest in Ambedkarite ideas. On December 31, they travelled to Pune in a group of 40 to take part in the anti-caste commemoration at Bhima Koregaon near Pune, where Dalit soldiers with the East India Company had trounced the casteist Peshwa-led army of the Maratha empire in 1818. ""I had gone there for the first time because it was the 200th anniversary of the battle,"" said Saidulu Gondrigalla, one of the suspended workers who was part of the group. ""We saw the [memorial] pillar in the morning, while the garlands were still being put up, then returned to Pune for the Elgaar Parishad,"" a conference being held to mark the anniversay.

While they returned to Mumbai on January 1, back in Bhima Koregaon, Dalits came under attack that day, sparking a strike and caste clashes, which spread across western Maharashtra. By the second week of January, police had conducted sweeping arrests of Dalits they believed to have participated in the violence.

When news of the workers' arrests first came, their colleagues thought this might be related to this action. However, given that the arrested workers were all union members, they also wondered whether this had anything to do with their last protest against the management in December.

The chargesheet is silent on both.

Spokespersons of both Reliance Infrastructure and Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited declined to comment on the case or the suspension of the employees.

""We are not pursuing any such past matters,"" said a spokesperson for Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited in response to a detailed questionnaire. ""It's a brand new company and a brand new way to do things. We took over on August 29 and this is a matter of last year December and January.""

A representative of Reliance Infrastructure, the holding company for Reliance Energy, also declined to comment. ""As discussed, as this business is now with Adani Electricity, you may write to Adani Electricity,"" a Reliance Infrastructure spokesperson wrote in reply to Scroll.in's questions.

Other than the workers, those arrested in the case include Jumpala, the contractor, Dasari, the alleged Maoist operative, and Gondiala, a poet and activist whose connection to the workers is tenuous.

As general secretary of the contractors association, Narsaiah Jumpala was one of the authorised signatories for cheques issued by the organisation. He had a reputation within the association for being sympathetic to the cause of workers, according to both his wife, other workers in the union, and even the head of the contractors' association.

When the worker who later died was admitted to a hospital in December, the contractor who was his employer called Jumpala for advice, according to his wife. Jumpala told the contractor to go to the hospital. ""[The contractor] said he was afraid to go there alone as the workers would be agitated,"" she told Scroll.in. ""He then asked my husband to accompany him in the morning, as my husband has good relations with workers of other contractors as well.""

Anthati, president of the contractors' association told Scroll.in that Jumpala did indeed have good relations with the workers. ""Vo worker ke piche hi rehta tha,"" he said. ""Jumpala was always with the workers, particularly that union...He used to favour them.""

The donation to the union came out of Jumpala's initiative, but the decision was taken collectively by 12 committee members, said Anthati. ""This fellow [Jumpala] only arranged the meeting for the workers,"" Anthati said. ""He asked me three times and I did not give him a time. The fourth time he asked me, I said all right and the entire committee sat and decided to give them money.""

There is not much information available about Ajay Dasari, the man the police claims the money was diverted to. The police chargesheet says he lived in Kalyan and even lists an address. But the address, a squat building adjacent to a larger bungalow, is occupied by families of Bihari and Jharkhand migrant workers, living there on rent. The wife of one of the workers confirmed the Anti-Terrorism Squad had visited this address on a Saturday in January, asking for Dasari.

The woman, who did not want to be identified, said Dasari was her husband's friend. They had met about five years ago while working at a cola factory in Kalyan and Dasari used to visit their home once or twice a month.

""Even now none of us can believe that he could be a terrorist like they said,"" the wife said. ""He always kept his eyes down, he spoke softly, did not look at any women, and never fought with anybody.""

Dasari told them that he lived with relatives in Thane, but that his wife and children were in his village in Telangana. They did not know much else about him.

The Telangana-based researcher found the police claims about a Maoist operative meeting openly with workers suspect.

""It is highly unlikely that if this person was a Maoist, he would go around telling people he was one,"" he said. ""In general, Maoists use cities as safe zones, where they don't take up any activity.""

An Anti-Terrorism Squad official familiar with the case who asked not to be identified agreed that ""Maoists keep their open activities away from secret ones to prevent detection."" However, he claimed that if Dasari was ""allowed access to both sides"", it indicated that he was in fact a ""high level functionary"".

It is not clear how Ramesh Gondiala, a poet and milkman, came to be linked to this case. A pro-Telangana activist from Nalgonda district, his connection with the workers is tenuous - according to Gondrigalla and Vasudevan, he met them in November 2013 at a meeting to support the formation of the state.

Venugopal, who wrote the preface to a book of poetry that Gondiala published, said his poetry covered issues of gender, Dalit rights, labour and the Telangana state.

Gondiala worked to deliver milk to houses in his neighbourhood and also worked as a driver. His wife told Scroll.in that he also regularly helped construction workers to arrange compensation or treatment for them if they suffered injuries or died while on duty.

The ATS also questioned another writer and translator, Prabhakar Macha, in the case. A teacher who was quite popular in Telugu writing circles, Venugopal said Macha was a significant link between Marathi and Telugu literature. He had written a 200-page book on the contribution of Telugu migrants to the building of Mumbai city.

In the first week of January, Macha's wife died. On January 23, a week after he was questioned by the ATS, he killed himself.

In the First Information Report filed hours after the arrests, the ATS claims its operative received a confidential tip-off from an informer, who told them that members of the Maoist party were raising money, recruiting new members and spreading Maoist propaganda to destabilise the nation. The informer said the members were going to congregate at Kalyan station at around 4.30 pm. The FIR charges seven men - excluding Singapanga at this stage - under sections 20, 38 and 39 of the the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which pertain to membership of and recruitment to banned organisations, but not to fundraising for them. The charges of fundraising appear only in the chargesheet.

In the chargesheet, the police claims to have CCTV footage from an apartment building in Tilak Nagar, which purportedly shows Dasari meeting the arrested workers between 12 pm to 3 pm.

The ATS claims in the FIR that it arrested Dasari at Kalyan station at 5.30 pm. Through his interrogation, within a matter of hours, it was able to get the residential addresses of seven accomplices. At midnight, in simultaneous raids, six men were arrested.

Saidulu Singapanga is not among the seven individuals named in this FIR. Like several other union members at the time, Singapanga too did not appear for work for some weeks after the other union members were arrested, fearing that it was the union itself being targeted. When he reported for work on February 5, he was arrested immediately.

But questions have been raised over the police claims.

Jumpala's wife pointed out only her husband was arrested, even though cheques from the contractors association require three signatures. The union's founding minutes, a copy of which is in the chargesheet, designates three individuals - the president, general secretary and treasurer - as elected officers for bank transactions.

""When I confronted [another contractor in the association] about this, he became very aggressive and started shouting at me,"" Jumpala's wife told Scroll.in. ""He said he had nothing to do with the cheques, and that my husband had signed a cheques in his personal capacity and handed them over for illegal activities.""

Anthati, president of the contractors' association, said that all three signatories had indeed signed two cheques, each amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh, but did not hand them over to the union representatives at the meeting because they did not have a receipt book with them.

""I told them we would give them the cheques only after they gave us the receipt,"" Anthati said. However, he added, a few days later, Jumpala took the cheques from the office assistant, saying that he was going to Chembur, would give them to the union people and bring back a receipt. This never happened. Instead, the cheques were made out to two individual members of the union and the receipt never made it to the association office, he claimed. Scroll.in could not independently confirm this.

It is not clear from the chargesheet how the money from the cheques was passed on to the Maoists, nor is it clear whether or how the accused recruited new members for the Maoist cause.

Most of all, what is mysterious are the 12 near-identical statements purportedly made by contractors to the police.

Anthati said that as he operated in Kandivali zone in another part of the city, he did not know what the others had said to the police and whether they knew that their statements in Hindi had been identically translated into Marathi. Contractors in the east zone deflected numerous attempts by Scroll.in over almost two months to speak with them.

Advocate Rebecca John said that identical statements were a common feature of the UAPA cases she was familiar with. ""It is common to have nebulous evidence, nothing very concrete,"" John said. ""The police looks into their personal lives, including their computers, so that even if you download an article, you can become a member by association. The police also gets surrendered Maoists to make statements in which there is a fair degree of police control. In a fair world none of these cases would see the light of day.""

However, Atul Chandra Kulkarni, additional director general of police in charge of the Anti-Terrorism Squad staunchly defended the investigation. ""UAPA cases are especially serious because I know that people don't get bail or they will get a longer prison term if convicted,"" he said. ""That is why I don't cook up evidence nor do I let my officers do so. But of course, I have the prerogative to take X [fact or person] and not Y in my case if it supports that. Facts will be chosen to marshal evidence.""

He pointed out that his team was simultaneously working on a case involving Hindutva extremists who had been arrested with large caches of weapons and bombs.

Ten months after the arrests, the families of the union members are struggling. Reduced to single-income households, one family left for their village in Telangana, unable to pay the rent for their room. The others are being supported by women who have taken up domestic work to make ends meet. There is uncertainty over whether they would be able to pay their children's school fees.

There are other consequences too. The families of the workers were reluctant to meet Scroll.in in their homes to avoid drawing more attention to themselves. They said the ATS officials still visit them regularly, making their neighbours wary of them. One of their landlords even asked them to leave, to avoid the police attention.

Since the arrests, the scrappy union, which took on the company to fight for provident funds, safety equipment, identity cards and even a kind of job security with assured daily work to all its members, has become somewhat dormant.

""Because of this atmosphere, the workers are scared that if they remain with our union, they too will be arrested,"" Vasudevan said.

There are other losses which the workers rue, including the hard-earned one of dignity.

""When we go to make demands of the contractor now, they tell us to go away or we will also be arrested,"" said Laxman Bomma, one of the workers suspended on January 9. ""They normally give us our new uniforms in January, but we have not got that this year. We now have to go to Vile Parle to collect our salaries, when earlier they would give it at the offices where we report for work.""

Said Gondrigalla, ""Earlier, they would treat us with some respect and dignity. That is no longer there."""

The toddler's parents, who lodged a police complaint Friday and on the basis of which a case was registered Tuesday, allege that their son's face was red and swollen when they got him home Friday evening. The allegations have been refuted by the day care.

According to the complaint, the parents noticed their son's face was red and swollen when they reached home after picking him up at 4.30pm. They then returned to the day care seeking an explanation, police said.

""We returned to the day care around 6.30pm and asked the staff to show us CCTV footage. In the footage, we saw a teacher slapping my son. He was forced to sleep on the floor in the corridor leading to the toilet,"" stated the father in his complaint.

The boy's father said he demanded CCTV footage of the past month, but the centre refused to provide it. He has also alleged that teacher had falsely noted in the child's daily diary that he had consumed lunch, when he was not even offered food and that the CCTV footage shows it. ""He just had an apple and milk,"" the father stated.

The parents told the police that they left their child in the day care around 12.20pm.

On the basis of the complaint, the police have registered a case against the day care centre's management under IPC Section 323 and section 75 of Juvenile Justice Act at Sector 50 police station on Tuesday. The Child Welfare Committee (CWC) has taken cognizance of the incident.

""We have questioned the staff and director of the day care. We did not find any sign of assault on the boy's body. We have recorded the parents statement as well,"" additional SHO Naresh Yadav said, adding that a copy of CCTV footage was shared with police.

The day care centre's director has refuted the allegations and said that it was a minor issue.

""The boy was not regular, which is against the rules. On the day of the alleged incident, he reached school after lunch, which is served till 12.20pm. He slept and after waking up, we was offered milk and apple. A teacher patted him on the back when he was approaching another boy who was asleep.

The conference with the theme 'Operations and Supply Chain Management at Cross Roads: challenges of Big Data, Industry 4.0, Sustainability and Global Uncertainty' has attracted more than 200 paper submissions and about 190 of them would be presented in during the event, a press release issued by IIM-K said.

Prof. Vishal Gaur of the Johnson School of Business, Cornell University, USA will inaugurate the conference. IIM-K director, Prof. Debashis Chatterjee will preside over the function.

Among the prominent personalities scheduled to attend the event are Prof. Gopinath Chattopadhyay, Federation University, Australia; Prof. Alok V Verma, Old Dominion University, USA; Prof. Arnab Bisi, Carey Business School, John Hopkins University, USA; Prof Saji Gopinath, Director IIITMK Thiruvananthapuram, among others.

The organisers of the conference said that though traditionally, the domain of Operations and Supply Chain Management (OSC) addresses the challenges of productivity, quality and cost reduction apart from 'uncertainties and variability', in recent times, the practitioners and researchers are focusing more on developing 'green products' utilising 'green processes', and developing strategies for 'reverse supply chain'.

Later, it was realized that being ""environmental friendly"" is not sufficient, rather the OSC should cater to ""triple bottom line"" of an organisation - by demonstrating economic, environmental and societal development.

In the last five years, with the phenomenal growth in the field of robotics, information and communication technologies, OSC began to utilise 'smart automation', 'near-field communication' and 'internet of things (IoT)' leading to another phase of revolution called Industry 4.0."

When the Indian startup ecosystem - then mostly limited to Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR - was witnessing a funding frenzy in 2015, Hyderabad was still recovering from the turmoil in the wake of Telangana's birth. Known for its IT legacy, over the years, macro-economic factors had hampered growth and 2015 was almost the year for a fresh start.

Three years on, the city has acquired a serious reputation as a growing startup hub. It's not just about the funding that Hyderabad-based startups have raised. The number of entrepreneurs choosing to start up in the city is growing, as are the number of partnerships among startups, academic institutions, corporates, and the government.

One strong indicator of growth is funding raised. According to YourStory Research, Indian startups raised $8.3 billion in funding in 2015. Startups from Hyderabad raised $43 million that year - just 0.52 percent of the total. Cut to 2018: Indian startups have raised $11.23 billion so far. Of this, Hyderabad-based startups accounted for $400.95 million - that's 3.5 percent of the total.

The sheer number of startups too shows strong growth. In 2015, the Nizam's city was home to around 1,500 startups. Today, that number has grown to 4,000, according to the Telangana State Innovation Cell (TSIC).

""Hyderabad has always had a strong entrepreneurial DNA. The IT legacy is testament to that. But in these three years, there has been growing awareness and push towards new-age technology startups. Each year, at the Centre of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE), the kind of startups that come in are different. The entrepreneurs are maturing and growing,"" says Ramesh Loganathan, a professor at IIIT and a mentor and guide at CIE.

There is also a growing number of students looking to start up, he adds. According to the CIE, there are 18 student-driven startups at IIIT today, up from just eight in 2015. In all, CIE is currently incubating 78 startups versus 54 in 2015.

The push to increase startup activity in the city comes from government quarters as well - while different states have announced startup-friendly policies, for Telangana, the idea was more of a 'need to have' than 'nice to have'.

Jayesh Ranjan, IT Secretary, Telangana Government, says,

""Being one of the youngest and newest states in the country, our first agenda was to build an ecosystem of technology and innovation. Post bifurcation, Hyderabad needed to catch up, and that needed to be done fast. We felt the quickest way to do that was by encouraging startups. So, we began with a basic framework and policy, and ensured it was translated on ground.""

The state government's policy framework focused on physical infrastructure and programme management capabilities, which facilitated the setting up of T-Hub in a public-private-partnership involving active participation from three academic institutes - IIIT-H, Indian School of Business (ISB), and NALSAR.

In the first phase, 2016 saw T-Hub become operational. It is spread over 70,000 sq ft and currently houses over 200 startups. The policy document by the government states that in the second phase, the facility will be spread over 3 lakh sq ft and will house over 3,000 startups.

T-Hub offers a co-working space that gives startups a chance to forge partnerships with companies, investors, and mentors, among others. Gayam Motors, a electric vehicle (EV) startup, which was incubated out of CIE and T-Hub, was selected to be a part of the Summit Mercedes-Benz EQ Global Fellowship.

""One-third of Telangana is government land so it can be easily given to set up labs and central government institutes. What we need to push is an output and get in a stronger density of companies,"" says Phanindra Sama, Chief Innovation Officer, TSIC and Co-founder of redBus.

The CIE is now planning to set up an accelerator that will focus on health/medical technology startups.

""We realised there were growing number of healthtech and healthcare startups in the city. These needed special attention and focus; hence, we thought of developing an accelerator inside CIE itself. Many startups in the space could be a part of the incubator,"" says Ramesh.

In October this year, the government also announced the first phase of T-Works to focus on manufacturing and product startups. Sujai Karampuri, CEO, T-Works, says, ""The idea has been to create a platform and a framework where converting an idea into a product becomes easy for hobbyists, engineers, makers, engineers, entrepreneurs, etc.""

T-Works wants to lower the barriers-to-entry for prototypes and create an environment where failure to develop a product is not frowned upon.

Sujai says that as a nation we have embraced software-related solutions and businesses, but, the ""same is not the case when it comes to developing a product in the domain of mechanical, electromechanical and electronics"".

IT Secretary Ranjan says that with the legacy of IT and corporate tie-ups, stronger collaborations would be the way forward. ""There are currently 40 incubators in the city, but they need to collaborate to grow faster. Collaboration always helps and makes the city grow faster. It is like the fuel that pushes strategy into action. We have all the different aspects of the ecosystem.""

The five must-haves for a startup are idea, implementation, market, a team, and funds. To create a sustainable funding model for startups in the city, the government also set up the T-Fund last year. With an initial corpus of Rs 100 crore, it invited startups to apply so that it can fund them. The T-Fund is also planning to start a Rs 600-crore seed fund that will take contributions from private investors.

Government efforts are clearly in place, but what of the private sector and its faith in the Hyderabad startup ecosystem?

In 2018, in all, 32 startups raised $400.95 million. In 2015, this number was $43 million across 33 deals. The mix across stages also was healthy, with 2018 seeing 15 pre-Series A deals, two PE rounds, four Series A rounds, and one each in Series B, C and E. This is a big change from 2017, when no Hyderabad-based companies raised Series B, C, D or E rounds. And in 2015, while there were 22 Pre-series A rounds, there were few others in the growth stage.

Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar's interest in startups by investing in city-based USPL and Smartron gave the city a big boost. Investors agree.

""Startups in Hyderabad are as good as startups in Bengaluru, Delhi, or Mumbai. We don't invest in startups on the basis of the city or the region they are based out of,"" says Vaibhav Agarwal, Partner, LightSpeed Ventures.

While there is increased interest in the ecosystem, there are few funds or investors with offices in Hyderabad. The one that stands out is Endiya Partners. The Hyderabad-based early-stage venture capital firm was started by Sateesh Andra, Dr Ramesh Byrapaneni, and Abhishek Srivastava. The two-year-old fund has approximately Rs 200 crore to invest, and focuses on SaaS, security, mobility, semiconductors, fintech, digital healthcare, and medical devices.

Of the eight companies in Endiya Partners' portfolio, two - Ekincare and Darwinbox - are based out of Hyderabad.

""We believe Hyderabad has a strong base of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. There is a strong product and growth focus in startups here. Also, when it comes to investments, we are sure we will soon add more Hyderabad startups to our portfolio,"" says Sateesh.

A seed investor based in the city says, ""The founders are getting a little more mature, and the startups here are understanding the focus on product.""

What would put Hyderabad on the startup map in a bigger way, say mentors and founders, is having a big startup from the city. Anu Acharya, Founder of Mapmygenome, says startups from the city are more driven towards enterprise tech, software, and healthcare. The last is, in fact, one of the top sectors garnering investment. This year, healthcare has accounted for $130 million of the total funding raised by Hyderabad-based startups.

Also, ThinCI, which is registered in the US, but runs its operations from the city, raised Series C of $65 million this year, reinforcing its image as a favourite for SaaS startups.

""I am guessing this (focus on healthcare and SaaS) is driven more by the legacy of healthcare and IT in the city,"" says Rohit Chennammeni, Co-founder, Darwinbox, an HR-tech startup.

Endiya's Ramesh Byrapaneni, a cardiologist-turned-investor, says that while the existing healthcare ecosystem has enabled the growth and development of several healthtech startups, a complete ecosystem would help.

""We already have large pharmaceutical companies and hospital chains here. What is needed is an ecosystem of interaction. Currently, I feel many startups lack an understanding of ground realities. If they begin working with the hospital chains and pharma companies, they can build solutions for real-world problems. I see that happening now,"" he says.

Healthtech startups based in Hyderabad include StanPlus, Nephroplus, Call Health and Ekincare.

Mahesh Lingareddy, Chairman of consumer tech firm Smartron, says, ""When we talk of startups, there has been a push or focus towards B2C or more consumer internet companies. Now, we believe there is a need for real product innovation. Hence, I founded Smartron out of Hyderabad. When I came back (from the US), I knew I wanted to do something more than IT services, which was strong in Hyderabad. I wanted to put product innovation from India on the world map.""

To this, Sujai adds that over the last 10 years, Indians have been slowly gravitating towards building businesses around hardware, both mechanical and electronics. ""We have companies that make wearables, electric bikes, IoT gadgets, and medical devices right here in Hyderabad. With Industrial Revolution 4.0, creating products has become democratised. Indian startups are bound to take advantage of this trend and T-Works will become a great enabler,"" he says.

""There is a redBus mafia, a Flipkart mafia, a FreeCharge mafia - we need something like that here,"" says Phanindra. ""Each of the larger companies should give birth to 30 more companies; that will create a vibrant ecosystem. We need one big ingredient - a strong mix of a mentorship network of people who have built large companies and old traditional businesses. At TSIC, we are working to bring in that round of collaboration,"" he adds.

While ThinCI might have created waves for Hyderabad, it is still missing a big name like Flipkart or Paytm.

Ramesh says the number of applications from students to be a part of CIE has gone up as against those from people with experience. ""There is an increased number of students willing to experiment and try out. Three years back, we had to build more awareness and tell students that they could look at entrepreneurship as an option. Today, students themselves approach us. However, there can still be more number of students coming in,"" he adds.

Over the last three years, Hyderabad has been going all guns blazing - from policies and infrastructure, to funding, mentorship and even education. What remains to be seen is how it succeeds and how the Hyderabad startup ecosystem evolves in the days to come."

Not surprisingly, private coaching institutions have started offering special classes to crack the Symbiosis entrance tests.

Though the admissions would be based on ranking in the all India entrance exam, the institute had promised to reserve 25% seats for students with Nagpur domicile. They would also be given 15% concession in fee.

TOI was the first to report about the premier institution's entry into Orange City, with NMC allocating 75-acre land at Wathoda in East Nagpur on December 29, 2016.

Symbiosis will start admitting students to four programmes from July 2019, when the first phase of its campus is completed. Symbiosis Pro Chancellor Vidya Yeravdekar confirmed this in a SMS reply.

Three of its institutes -- Symbiosis Institute of Business Management (SIBM), Symbiosis School of Law (SSL), and Symbiosis Institute of Planning, Architecture and Design -- would offer MBA, BBA, BBA-LLB, BALLB, and BArch degree courses. The institute has recently started recruitment of faculty members and non-teaching staff too. SIBM will have intake of 120 students while SSL will have 240 seats.

Students appearing in the entrance exams for the institute's flagship MBA and other courses next month would be able to opt for Nagpur as the study centre. Private coaching centres have been quick to exploit the opportunity, and started offering preparatory courses for students from the city and region.

Nihit Mor, who runs one such centre, said the response to Symbiosis's centre is huge. ""We are getting queries from a lot of parents, who were earlier reluctant to send their kids, especially girls, out of the city,"" he said.

Mor added that Symbiosis schools are among the best in the country and would offer world class education in Nagpur itself. ""Symbiosis BBA is among the top 3, and law among top 10 in the country. These are good options for Nagpur students, and they no longer need to leave the city for studies,"" he said, adding that the application process may start in January.

Experts feel aspirants must get their domicile ready since it will be the proof to claim the benefits offered by the private institute. However, they also added, parents and students need to understand that the Nagpur campus so far doesn't have 'deemed university' status, like other Symbiosis institutes."

ONE OF the things that Shanti, 35, the wife of the watchman and assistant cook at the Kichugutti Maramma Temple in Suluvadi village in Karnataka's backward Chamarajnagar district cannot understand is why her husband is being considered a suspect in the December 14 poisoning death of 15 people at a temple event.

""Would he have fed our own daughter if he was aware that there was poison in the tomato rice served as prasad in the temple and would he have eaten it himself?'' she asks at her home in the temple's backyard where she lives with her extended family.

Shanti lost her 12-year-old physically challenged daughter Anitha after she consumed the pesticide-laced food served at the foundation stone laying ceremony at the Kichgutti Maramma Temple on December 14. Her husband Puttaswamy -- the assistant cook and watchman at the temple -- is battling for life in a hospital in Mysuru for the past three days. His name is among seven listed in an FIR by the local police while registering a case of culpable homicide.

""My daughter was one of the first to die that day. My two younger daughters, Arathi and Lavanya, went to school but Anitha went to the temple where her father was working to eat the prasadam. My husband fed her and ate some himself. She collapsed at the temple itself and he brought her home saying she was unwell but he was unwell himself,"" Shanti said.

Advertising

Along with Putaswamy, head cook Eranna and his main assistant Lokesh, who were in the kitchen that morning, figure among the list of suspects possibly involved in spiking the temple prasadam with poison on December 14. They too are in hospital.

Invesigations have found that a highly toxic pesticide -- monochrotophos -- was deliberately mixed with the food, an official involved with the probe indicated on Tuesday. Another police officer in the region, however, said the police were still waiting to question the cooks before arriving at any conclusion.

""One of the problems that we are facing is the fact that the three persons who were involved in the cooking that morning are still in hospital. We have not been able to question them as yet,"" a local police officer said.

One of the angles of investigation being pursued by the police has been to look at all those involved with preparation of the food and the temple festivities and to look closely at anybody who may have avoided eating the food knowing that it was poisonous and those who stayed away from the event despite being closely associated with the temple.

Among those who have been questioned since the poisoning incident are the temple manager Chinnapi -- a cement merchant, and a vice president who reportedly was among the first to arrive at the temple premises on the morning of the incident when the cooking began. A Lingayat seer who heads the temple trust but did not attend the foundation laying ceremony for a ""gopuram"" at the temple last Friday has also been questioned.

The Kichugutti Maramma temple is located on the fringes of forests on the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border around 200 km from Bangalore in what was two decades ago an area dominated by forest brigand Veerappan and his gang. The once obscure temple has become popular in recent years with devotees developing great faith in the diety.

On Tuesdays and Fridays, when special poojas are held, hundreds of people from surrounding villages -- including Tamil Nadu which is barely six km from Suluvadi village -- visit the temple, says Ponappa, a truck driver who lives next to the temple.

Along with the inflow of devotees, the temple's bank accounts too have grown. One of the lines of police investigation revolves around a dispute between the trustees of the temple and a seer who heads the trust with the seer being reportedly upset over being sidelined by other trustees like temple manager Chinnapi.

""The president of the trust wanted to spend Rs 80 lakh for the construction of the gopuram but the other trustees said the temple's bank accounts had only around Rs 40 lakh of funds. The president was upset after the trust went ahead with the gopuram construction plans,"" says Santosh, temple manager Chinnapi's son.

""My father and others in the temple management did not eat the meal served that day because they were busy with the pujas,"" he said.

Following the food poisoning incident, the Kichugutta Maramma Temple has been shut down by local authorities and wore a deserted look on Tuesday. ""This is not how the temple would look on a Tuesday. There will be hundreds of people,"" Nandish, a local said.

There is great anger among locals over the poisoning incident. ""Whoever is behind this must go to the gallows,"" says Kempamma, an elderly shop keeper outside the Holy Cross Hospital, located 43 km from Suluvadi where the first batch of 64 people who showed symptoms of poisoning were taken last week. Over a 100 people were affected by the poisoning."

Over the last 30 years, India has done a remarkable job ensuring its citizens have access to education. Beginning with State-level policies such as the Andhra Pradesh Primary Education Programme and Shiksha Karmi in Rajasthan in 1984 and 1987, respectively, and culminating in the Centre's Right to Education Act in 2009, the legislative and programmatic attention to education has been tremendous. And with that, there has been a genuine expansion in access and provision at the primary level.

In the chart, historical data from the District Information System on Education (DISE) on the year a school was built have been used to show how the number of government schools across the country has increased relative to three major Central Government education policies, the National Policy on Education in 1986, the District Primary Education Programme in 1994, and the aforementioned Right to Education Act.

Given that it has now been approximately 16 years since the passage of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the first central level effort, what has this flurry of activity brought? Encouragingly, there have been real wins over time. India has nearly universalised access to education and is now educating more people, including girls, for longer than it ever has before. The programmes have built schools, gotten children into schools, and had them stay in school for longer.

Additionally, it seems like this is also increasing employment and wages. A paper by Gaurav Khanna at the University of California, San Diego, finds that an additional year of schooling has high returns in the labour market, and that large-scale policies to expand education, such as the District Primary Education Programme, redistribute income from high-skilled to low-skilled workers. These are real achievements to celebrate. But this is about where the cheer ends.

On the learning front, the picture is far less rosy. Year after year of results from the Annual State of Education Report (ASER), released by the NGO ASER, has shown that student learning at the primary level is low and not getting better. In 2017, ASER shifted its focus from children at the primary level to ask what is happening with older children in the ages 14-18. Here, the news was no better. Math and reading ability for students in this age group were poor and well below what the government's own standards suggested they should be.

While the government's own National Achievement Survey is more encouraging, it is not by much. India's performance in the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (more commonly known as PISA) tests was so controversial that India did not re-enter PISA again (although India has decided to re-enter for 2021). This story of low learning levels is well known to many.

What should we make of these two contradictory findings? On the one hand, access to education has increased, and this is showing real returns on the labour market, and redistribution skills towards low-skilled workers. On the other hand, learning is low for young and older children; it is not improving, and is poor even in comparison to other countries. A new concern is beginning to emerge with the growing demographic bulge of large numbers of young adults exiting the school system and entering the workforce. The promises of the education system are failing on more than just quality, and this could have dire consequences for those promised the world.

A new genre of non-fiction has emerged over the last couple of years tracing the gap between the aspirations and realities for India's youth. Journalists Somini Sengupta and Snigdha Poonam have both written books profiling this new young aspirational class, and many of their dashed aspirations. In both, we find a number of young Indians struggling to find their place in the world. Promised much by their educational attainment, they find their hopes dashed when they emerge into the adult world, with jobs that either fall short of expectations, or a lack of formal employment altogether.

My own work suggests a similar concern -- those that have gone to school for longer are less likely to be trusting of a wide number of public institutions in India.

Using the Indian Human Development Survey, I find that those children that gained access to education as a result of the DPEP then live in households that are less trusting of public institutions. More concerning, those ""DPEP children"" are adults today with their political preferences and economic aspirations.

Why is this happening? The data suggest that while these individuals are earning more money, they are also doing this in different parts of the labour market: the unorganised and short-term contractual labour. Again, the gap between aspirations and reality has led to resentment.

Latin America has seen the rise of a cohort of youth called ""Los NiNis,meaning ""They neither study or work.""

So what can India and other countries, do? There are two solutions: fix schools or fix the school-to-work transition. While fixing schools is clearly important and there is much to be done here, placing undue faith in schools as the sole panacea for this cohort will likely not solve the larger problem of a large number of youth who enter a labour market not as rewarding as promised and cause further distrust in the education system. Schools cannot be blamed for both their own failings and the failings of the outside world.

That leaves us with fixing the school-to-work transition. And here, most solutions lie with the state. Public sector employment -- the much desired sarkari naukri -- has not grown apace with the growth in India's population. According to Devesh Kapur, public sector employment has actually decreased over the last decade.

So an expansion of the public sector is clearly in order. While this will not absorb all of those looking for employment, it will help absorb some as well as address some of India's public management issues.

Next, some combination of general training, labour market matching, and support for employers in hiring young adults is required. Here, the results for middle- and low-income countries are encouraging.

It is clear that the question of how to integrate youth into a larger society is a universal one that spans more regions than just India. The solution, however, likely does not lie with education.

While there are many shortcomings of the education system in India and elsewhere, the question for society is about how to best integrate the young when they have left compulsory schooling but have yet to find work.

It is here that further progression through the education system will run headlong into frustrated expectations as a result of poor integration into labour markets and larger society. To paraphrase WEB DuBois, the problem of the 21st century is the problem of youth employment."

The MoU was signed between the civic body, United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages at BMC Conference Hall this afternoon.

Under this unique collaborative venture a 6,000 sq. ft area Swachhata Kendra will be established near the temporary transit station (TTS) for the transport of solid waste, near Sainik School, Bhubaneswar.

The initial partnership will be initiated in 10 wards of BMC i.e. 12, 13, 16, 25, 27, 30, 34, 40, 41 and 53. The collaboration in the project aims to streamline plastic recycling in the city.

Swachhta Kendras or ""integrated material recovery centres"" will be opened for recycling all types of plastic i.e. PET, HPDE, LDPE, PVC, PP, PS and other types.

The Swachhta Kendra will ensure collection of nearly 5 MTs/ day of all types of plastics collection, segregation from different sources and to create a capacity of 10 ton per day minimum processing of all types of plastic waste.

The Swachhta Kendra project near TTS targets at the end of a 4-year period in the project better management, including collection, segregation and recycling of at least 6,800 Matric tons in the city of Bhubaneswar.

This is an important step in the management of delirium in older adults because the ability to quantify severity of the condition beyond merely rating delirium as present or not will help clinicians develop and monitor more effective treatments.

The quality of the tools available to measure delirium severity has been recognized as highly important for tracking prognosis, monitoring response to treatment, and estimating the burden of care both during and after hospitalization.

A research team including 21 scientists from Harvard Medical School, the Marcus Institute for Aging Research (Marcus Institute) at Hebrew SeniorLife, and 10 other academic organizations in the U.S. and China, searched databases including 9,409 articles that addressed measurement of delirium severity. They reviewed the full text of 228 and identified 42 different instruments to explore further.

Applying pre-specified criteria related to frequency of use, methodologic quality, construct or predictive validity, and broad domain coverage, 6 final high-quality instruments were identified. They included, the Confusion Assessment Method, Confusional State Examination, Delirium-O-Meter, Delirium Observation Scale, Delirium Rating Scale, and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale. These measures will enable accurate measurement of delirium severity to improve clinical care for this common and devastating condition. The researchers hope this work will stimulate increased usage, and head-to-head comparison of these instruments.

According to senior author of the study, Sharon K. Inouye, M.D., M.P.H., Director, Aging Brain Center, Marcus Institute and Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, ""The time is right to advance measurement of delirium severity: Measurement is important, impactful, and efforts to stratify risk, target treatment, and monitor for outcomes are already possible and feasible with existing approaches.""

First author, Richard N. Jones, ScD, of Brown University adds, ""Measurements of delirium severity should play an important role in the advancement of clinical care and research for persons with delirium.""

An estimated 12 million older Americans experience delirium each year, at a cost of over $164 billion (2011) in annual health care expenditures. Delirium is distressing to patients and families, prolongs hospital stays, delays rehabilitation, and increases risks for dementia and death. Despite its importance for patient safety and public health, delirium is often unrecognized by clinicians, and effective treatments remain elusive. Moreover, presentation of delirium is heterogeneous and multifaceted, and measurement of delirium and its severity pose unique challenges.

With the help of latest mobile technology, these excited children were trained to study their textbooks, helping them overcome their physical challenge in a way they did not think was possible before this. Each of them got a phone which had preloaded accessible textbooks, and they were taught to study these textbooks using latest mobile applications.

This innovation in CSR was made possible in one of its kind initiatives by mjunction services limited, India's largest B2B e-commerce company, in collaboration with the Chhattisgarh government. mjunction first procured the smartphones and then uploaded all Chhattisgarh government school textbooks for the intended age group into these smartphones. The third and last phase happened recently in Raipur when these 50 students were not only given these smartphones but also trained extensively on how to study their textbooks from these phones.

The programme gains greater importance in view of the limited availability of textbooks in Braille, where students had to share the books.

The reactions from the excited students were spontaneous and heartfelt, and sometimes exceeded expectations from the programme. Dinu Patel of class 8, said, ""What I could read on Braille in three days, I can now do in one day. I can also carry my books anywhere I go now as they are all on my mobile phone.""

Aarzoo Banu of class 9 said, ""My hands used to ache earlier while taking down class notes on Braille. Now with the recording facility on the phone, I can record my class notes and listen to them later with the 'talk back' facility.""

Yadeshwar Kumar Sahoo of class 9 said, ""This is especially useful when English spellings get complicated and it becomes difficult on Braille. I want to thank everyone associated with this as it really makes life easy for me.""

The students were handed certificates and felicitated at the end of the training programme at an event attended by top mjunction officials associated with the programme, Mr Gaurav Dwivedi, Secretary of School Education, Chhattisgarh Government and Mr Vinit Nandanwar, IAS, Mission Director, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. Dr Homiyar Mobedji, Disability Expert, Program Management Benetech India, conducted the training process.

Welcoming the initiative, Mr Vinaya Varma, CEO of mjunction said, ""We are glad to collaborate with the Chhattisgarh government on this. This programme is a part of mjunction's social responsibility activities, and will be run as a pilot project. In the next phase, this will be extended to more students of Chhattisgarh government schools.""

Mr Dwivedi said, ""I am happy to partner with mjunction on this. The children were extremely enthusiastic about using new devices and trying new technology solutions to overcome their disability."" Mr Nandanwar said, ""The initiative was a success and I hope to work with mjunction once again in the near future for the benefit of an even greater number of students.""

Mr Nandanwar said ""The initiative of mjunction and Sarva Sikhsha team was really fruitful and we hope to work together in future and benefit more students.""

mjunction has been working in the field of digital literacy for the underprivileged for the last 11 years and has taken the pledge of 'Transforming 30K' lives in the next two years. With this project, it forays into the field of providing education via mobile literacy, and is just the beginning of more such initiatives which will touch lives positively, Mr Varma added."

This way the company can be proactive to ensure that it stays compliant to new laws as well ensuring that the processes are effective and don't result in increased administrative burden at the VAC level.

Even before GDPR, the company has always had strong information security practices in place, with robust frameworks for handling data and an existing compliance-driven culture, as per the strict requirements laid down by client governments. ""To comply with GDPR, we have implemented a 13-point privacy framework that enables us to operationalise the requirements of the GDPR, and measure compliance with it,"" he adds. Cook further explains by giving an example, ""We put in place various processes for receiving consent from applicants for storage of their personal data, online and offline. Extensive training of our staff has also been part of our preparations. Many companies are looking at GDPR compliance as a means to strengthen their data and privacy norms, and naturally so, since this new era of data regulations heralds a data revolution.""

In the last few years, the conversations around data protection and data privacy have underscored a better understanding of the core philosophy of management of personal data. It is important to remember that organisations simply 'borrow' an individual's personal data for the purposes of performing a task. No more than that specific task.

""The best-case scenario for allowing flexible transfer of data, while also ensuring the security of personal data, is based on the standard of 'adequacy of transfer'. This means one country or organisation must determine that another country or organisation has sufficient data protection safeguards to ensure that the rights and freedoms of individuals travel with their data. Once the country or organisation is satisfied that the destination country has adequate safeguards in place, data can be transferred easily. Clearly, this must be underpinned by the capability of national data protection agencies to be able to perform checks of compliance and to be able to take corrective or punitive action if required,"" mentions Cook.

Mitigating security challenges

As the world's largest visa service provider that handles sensitive information of millions of applicants in more than 140 countries, for 61 client governments, it has always been incumbent on VFS to put rigorous data security checks in place. ""As such, in terms of technical and organisation measures for data security, we were already at an advanced level even before the GDPR - having attained ISO 27001 certification for Information Security Management Systems, our IT teams were well aligned with operating with strict controls. We also utilise sophisticated cyber security and threat detection tools as the nature of our business demands this,"" he reveals.

An important aspect of data privacy controls is ensuring employees across the global operations are adequately sensitised to the context and necessity of the protocols. So the company had to initiate a global internal awareness campaign to explain the basics of data privacy concepts to employees and this greatly facilitated the adoption of the data protection processes and procedures that followed. Large organisations who are attempting this for the first time may find this a challenging task, but it is an essential one, believes Cook.

Strategic approach

Data breaches are an expected risk to any organisation that is processing personal data. Therefore, it is vital to have in place both technical and organisational measures that detect, mitigate and recover from data breach, such that the risk to the personal data involved is minimised. ""At VFS Global, we use some very sophisticated detection tools that alert the security team of a potential incident. However, technology can only go so far and we recognise the value of the human element when it comes to data breach prevention. We encourage our employees to be very vigilant about risks which might manifest themselves at any time,"" he states.

Impact of AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the latest trend in data processing and as such has the potential to greatly change the way in which visa processing is performed. ""That said, we have to look at just how AI based process will take decisions. One of the fundamental tenets of AI is that the algorithm 'learns' from each decision made. A classic example of this is VFS Global's first digital employee ViVA, the first-ever chatbot in the visa services space. ViVA offers applicants round-the-clock support for visa queries, akin to any highly trained customer support executive. In effect, AI has to go to school to learn how to make decisions that are fair as well ethically and morally correct. This is where the privacy professional has to ensure that privacy by design is built in from the very start."" he explains.

Two students of the New KM Public School were killed in the incident on Monday, while three more were severely injured.

Police have lodged an FIR in the matter against six persons. They were waiting for the education department and parents of the deceased children to lodge separate FIRs in the matter.

""Two more FIRS are expected in the matter -- from the education department and the parents of the deceased children. The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) will also take action against one of the accused who had kept sand and construction material on the plot adjacent to the school, without covering it,"" Shwetabh Pandey, circle officer 3, said.

Police are also going to ask the education department to explain why school was allowed to function without requisite clearances. ""The school was closed around six months ago by the education department for want of approval. But, it again started functioning under a different name. We have asked the education department to submit their report on the issue,"" BN Singh, district magistrate, said.

Police have launched a manhunt to nab the accused, including the owners, management and staff of the school. Police detained Sanjeev Jha, principal of the school, on Monday around 9.30pm from his residence.

The UP pollution control board officials also visited the site to identify the total area on which construction work was going on and the other violations at the site.

""Our officials have visited the site. We will be sending our recommendation to the city magistrate to impose fine on the person who was undertaking the construction work without following the norms prescribed by the National Green Tribunal,"" Anil Singh, regional officer, UPPCB, said.

The UPPCB will impose a fine of Rs 20,000 on Deshraj, one of the main accused in the case.

He was carrying out construction in the plot next to the school and had kept sand and other building material near the wall, which collapsed under the weight of the material on Monday morning.

Police,too, said that prima facie investigation has revealed that the wall had collapsed under the weight of the construction material. The total area of the under-construction site was around 3000 sqft and the construction material was lying uncovered.

Recently, the district administration had started taking strict action against those found flouting National Green Tribunal norms.

The district magistrate had complained to the chief judicial magistrate against two government agencies for causing pollution in the district.

The district magistrate, using his power as per Section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act,

1986, had initiated the prosecution of Western Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL-W) and NBCC (India) Limited, as well as their contractors, under sections 15, 16 and 17 of the Act."

He was in constant contact with his parents everyday for the next few days, until 10 November. He told them that he would return back to Mumbai in two days. But right after this, Ansari went missing, which we now know, is because he had been picked up by Pakistani authorities.

When he received the eviction notice from CMRL a week ago, his fears became a reality. He joined 60 other residents who visited the CMRL officials last week to express their strong opposition about the displacement.

Corridors three and four under phase 2 of the Chennai Metro Rail project has received stiff opposition from residents and commercial establishments alike in thickly populated areas of T Nagar, Alwarpet, Mylapore, Kodambakkam and Nungambakkam.

Soon after they received notices from the Revenue Department to vacate their homes to facilitate Metro rail construction, residents sprung into action and forwarded written petitions to CMRL and state government, expressing their dissent.

""Around 30 shops and multiple houses on Chamiers Road, KB Dasan Road, TTK Road, and in Seethammal Colony are affected. For the sake of development, people cannot lose their houses,"" said a resident from Eldams Road, who took part in the meeting organised by residents last week in Ethiraj Kalyana Mandapam.

Traders and shopkeepers along Kutchery Road, Luz Circle and RK Mutt Road are struggling to find alternate spaces to continue their businesses. But, sources from CMRL made it clear that there will be no changes in the initial plan.

""A change in alignment is too early to decide now as the DPR is only in its initial stages. But, our team will hear all grievances put forth by aggrieved residents,"" said a CMRL official. A meeting is also scheduled on Decemeber 21 to hold negotiation talks with such residents added the official.

Similarly, 200-odd residents from T Nagar and Kodambakkam question the necessity of having a Metro station within 30 metres of Kodambakkam suburban station.

""They issued notices to all residents and shops located across 11 streets in T Nagar. But, under the owner's name, they have mentioned Ramakrishna Mission which owned this land some 60 years ago. This shows the absolute lack of coordination between CMRL, Chennai Corporation and Revenue Department,"" said Pasupathy S, member of Vivekananda Residents Welfare Association and Civic Exnora, from T Nagar.

Also, three months ago, CMRL had informed the management of Good Shepherd School in Nungambakkam that 3,300 sq m of the school's premises will be taken over for Sterling Road Station's car park and entry points. Following this, an online petition on Change.org was created against CMRL's move which was signed by 13,000 anxious alumni, students and teachers.

After the matter was taken to the Madras HC, the acquisition process was stalled. But on October 12, the land acquisition officer in charge of this issue informed the school that CMRL will not be changing its plan and will be acquiring the earmarked land. The school will be losing the ground and the primary block which houses 1,000-odd students from classes 1 to 5."

Shveta Salve, the fiery actress who made her debut in the hit 1999 TV show Hip, Hip, Hurray has come a long way since playing a sweet schoolgirl. Today, she is upbeat about her soon-to-be three-year-old starting pre-school instead! The highlight of her day, she tells us, is taking her daughter Arya every morning to school in Goa, as they cross beaches and farms, spotting cows, goats and chickens together.

Salve, married to entrepreneur Hermit Sethi, who has been shuttling between Mumbai and Goa ever since she had her baby, believes it has been the best choice ever. She says, ""My parents live in Goa, so while pregnant, it was natural for me to spend long periods here. And once the baby came along, I realised that giving my child a healthier, cleaner environment was just as important. Today, I live and work both in Goa and Mumbai and while my daughter is still young I am trying to give her the best of both worlds.""

Never one to slow down, Shveta despite being a hands-on mom also recently opened her dream restaurant called The Burger Factory in Goa. But after a hectic day looking after the operations and management of her eatery, she finds time to be a beach bum with her baby and spend some time soaking up nature.

Advertising On shutting the trolls

And while one would expect people to admire Shveta for successfully managing being a model, mom and an entrepreneur, while also finding time to let her hair down; the world of social media brings out the ugly side too. Recently, Shveta was trolled when she posted pictures of herself, holding a glass of wine and smoking on what she called her off-day. Never the one to shy from calling a spade a spade, Shveta powerfully got back to her trolls and posted a thought-provoking reply on how quickly some people can label women as bad moms. On why she thought it was important to shut the trolls, Shveta says, ""I understand that as someone in public eye, we are often subjected to scrutiny. But I thought it was important to address this issue not only because it was getting deeply personal as random people were deciding that I was a bad mom but also because it was reflective of how the society expects moms to be."" She questions, ""Isn't a mom a normal human being who likes to drink or smoke? Why should one try to portray an alternate image?"" But does she think that her honest social media posts open her to a barrage of conjecture? She answers, ""Whatever I put on social media is the real me. There is no pretence and I don't think anything should change once you are a mom. As a woman, why should I be questioned on what I do as a mother?""

She adds, ""While I do not recommend that all women must answer back all of the time but sometimes it becomes important to speak and let the world know that we are best aware of our responsibilities and no one has the right to question us. Just as the me-too movement, moms should also speak up when they feel it is necessary to do so.""

On the constant scrutiny

Any new mom would find it flattering to get compliments on her fit body. But ask Salve and she admits that while she gets a lot of attention for her toned body, it perturbs her to think that women are forever scrutinised and questioned. She says, ""If a woman does not shed her post-baby fat, she is body-shamed. If she looks fit and sexy people are again curious about how she does it. My problem is, why can't women be left to do their own thing? Why should they be expected to explain everything?""

She adds, ""The stream of questions just seems to be changing with every phase. When I was pregnant, I led a very active lifestyle. I scuba-dived, I snorkelled and I proudly posed in my baby bump. Back then, I was asked why I was not taking it slow. Why was I showing off my bump?""

Also Read: Not afraid to be ambitious, says supermom Tara Sharma Saluja

Salve adds, ""I was doing what my body told me to do and no one should assume or expect me to lead my life a certain way.""

The root of the problem, Salve believes, is the fact that people think it is okay to question women. She says, ""As a woman, you are constantly asked to explain everything from your career choices to your ambition to your dressing and when you become a mom, the questions just multiply. From why you chose a C-section to why you are not large enough during pregnancy, the mindless scrutiny never stops.""

Salve admits that as a new mom she is learning many things and while patience and letting go are important lessons she has learnt along the way, she also feels that ""sometimes it is just as important to speak to drop the curtain!"""

Under the proposed policy, the agency is looking into the possibilities of attaining self-sufficiency in water requirements for its stations and yard through rainwater harvesting. The preliminary steps have been already launched and the Water Institute of the SCMS Cochin School of Business will conduct a feasibility study on rain harvesting.

At present, the KMRL's water bill comes to Rs 15 lakh every month. For stations, it requires water mainly for cleaning. The plan is to develop an integrated and systematic effort to utilise the rainwater wisely.

This, according to KMRL officers, will have both financial as well as social impact.

In the financial side, KMRL will be able to save the huge water bill while on the social side, the agency is looking to save the quantity of water it uses every day. If KMRL is able to find water through rain harvesting to meet its day-to-day needs, the water in the public supply system can be saved and distributed in areas which face acute water shortage, especially during the summer.

""KMRL, as part of its green initiatives, is always looking for policies that will help in saving energy, land and water. The water management policy is a part of our efforts to meet the water requirements through natural means including rain harvesting so as to reduce dependency on public water distribution system,"" said KMRL managing director A P M Mohammed Hanish.

The idea is to explore the possibilities of rain harvesting at KMRL's Muttom yard, the viaducts along the Metro stretch and at stations. Various techniques like rooftop rainwater harvesting, catchments and ponds will be considered. The apt technique will be adopted on the basis of the feasibility study.

The Water Institute is carrying out the feasibility study free of cost. The study will look into KMRL's existing water usage pattern. It will also carry out a water audit as part of the study. The Institute will also provide technical assistance to KMRL in implementing various elements under the policy.

For the implementation of the project, KMRL will look into various modes including PPP (Public Private partnership) as wells as the CSR funds of various companies."

The students of KM Public School were writing their Hindi paper in the open in the absence of enough classrooms to house 150 students in total.

Police said the construction material used to build the wall was of poor quality. But residents of nearby villages said the wall gave in because an earthmover was digging an adjacent construction site and had made the soil at the base of the wall loose. The accident occurred around 9.30am.

Vivek Kumar (7) and Bhupender Singh (10), both students of Class I, were declared dead on arrival at hospitals. Those battling serious injuries have been identified as Naitik (8), Amit (7), Ashish Kumar (8) and Akash (9). The students were writing their test within metres of the wall as the sun was shining bright on the area on a chilly Monday morning.

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has directed the district administration to conduct a speedy investigation and bring the culprits to book. The adjacent plot that was being dug is owned by Deshraj Bhati and his son Sumit. Despite a notice to shut it down, the school was being run by Deshraj's nephew Amit Bhati.

An FIR has been lodged on a complaint by the district administration against Amit Bhati, principal Sanjeev Jha, school organiser Raghvender Solanki, and owners of the adjacent plot Sumit and Deshraj Bhati. The FIR has been lodged under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC and under provisions of the Juvenil Justice (care and protection of children) Act, 2000.

The school has 150 students in total from nursery to Class VIII. As it has only five rooms, including that of the principal, the students are often made to sit in the open. Police said the wall collapsed around 9.30am. The excavator had entered the plot and had been removing mounds of earth. When its wheels reached near the wall, it collapsed on the students who were sitting on the other side.

A police team reached the school within 10 minutes and started rescue operations. ""The National Disaster Response Force was called in for help. The injured students were rushed to Yatharth Hospital in Sector 110 and Prayag Hospital in Sector 41,"" circle officer Shwetabh Pandey said.

But it was the local residents who rushed in to bring the students out of the debris before the police and NDRF teams arrived. ""When the wall collapsed, the school staff fled the spot in fear. The villagers rushed in to help and brought the students out from under the rubble. Many of them were bleeding profusely. We called the police control room after that,"" said Raghav Singh, a villager.

""Three students were rushed to our hospital, of whom one was already dead. One of the two injured students will have to undergo an elbow surgery and the other is being treated for various injuries,"" said Shoaib, a doctor at the emergency ward of Prayag hospital.

Basic education officer Balmukund Prasad said that in August 2017, the education department had served a notice on the school, threatening to issue a fine of Rs 1 lakh if it did not close down. The name of the school was Khajana Devi then. ""After being issued the notice, they reopened the school with another name, KM Public School, without our knowledge. The education department will also lodge an FIR against the school owner and the management,"" Prasad said.

""Just today, I used one in first hour, third hour, and fifth hour,"" she told Business Insider.

The usage of Google products isn't unique to Lodewyk's public school in Bay City, Michigan. There are 80 million educators and students globally using G Suite for Education, which allows users to access Gmail, Google Cloud, Google Docs, and other productivity tools. In 2017, Chromebooks and other Google devices made up 58% of all devices purchased for US classrooms, according to Futuresource data.

Lodewyk is a fan. ""My peers and I benefit from both of these tools,"" she said.

Read more: Teachers love Google's education products but are suspicious. Why is a megacorporation giving them a perfect tool for free?

But Lodewyk is all about Apple when it comes to the devices she actually buys. Lodewyck said she has an iPhone 8 and plans to get a MacBook when she goes to college.

That's like most Generation Zs - the generation born after 1997 that's on track to

Google has become wildly popular in K-12 classrooms like Lodewyck's, even though Google doesn't make much money distributing that technology in the education sphere. Indeed, Jonathan Rochelle, a product management director for G Suite for Education, even told Business Insider that Google's push into education is partially ""philanthropic.""

Analysts say Google's interest in schooling stems from a desire to get children and teenagers accustomed to the Google ecosystem.

""It's pretty clear what motive Google has,"" Gartner Research vice president Kelly Calhoun Williams, who focuses on K-12 education and was in public education for 25 years, told Business Insider. ""This is not a product they're selling; this is not a commercial product. It's getting lots of people very used to working in a Google environment.""

So, if teens aren't falling in love with Chromebooks, why does Google keep pushing into the education market?

Even as Google dominates the classroom, teens are typically more likely to buy an iPhone and a MacBook than a Pixel and a Chromebook.

Investment bank and asset management firm Piper Jaffray found that, in their semi-annual survey of around 6,000 American teenagers, 86% plan to buy an iPhone for their next cell phone. And Worth Ave. Group found that 40% of college students shopping for a new computer will buy a MacBook. HP, which 15% chose, was the second-best brand.

""Apple built a product with a user interface and experience that embodies what Gen Z stands for - simplicity, connectability with other devices and programs, ease of access, and, most importantly, speed,"" Goel said.

This is despite Apple's decreased presence in the K-12 education technology market. Apple produced more than half of all education devices in the US in 2012, according to Futuresource. Just five years later, that market share has dropped to 19%.

Of course, not all teens are gaga for Apple. The prices are too high to be the universal choice for Gen Zs.

Madeline Topete, a 17-year-old who lives in Southern California, owns a Chromebook that she bought for $250 two years ago. She said it's held up well.

Still, Topete yearns for a MacBook. ""The truth is, all of us prefer Apple technology because of its advanced features and more user-friendly layout, but not everyone can afford one,"" she said. ""Those I know with a Mac got one from Mommy and Daddy, so to speak.""

Students who use Chromebooks might not love the hardware, but they're getting acclimated to the Chrome browser, Google Search, and YouTube. All of those products can be used on non-Google devices.

""There is some anchoring effect,"" Avi Greengart, the research director for consumer devices at GlobalData, told Business Insider. ""If you're familiar and comfortable with one environment, you're more likely to stick to that atonement more than if you've never encountered it.""

So, while MacBook-littered college campuses suggest the opposite, Greengart said Google has actually won in the education battle.

That's because many Gen Zs use Google Search, YouTube, Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps, and so on with their non-Google devices. And Greengart said getting a new generation of users acclimated to sharing its data with Google is a win for the company's advertising-dominated bottom line.

Goel agreed that Google's cloud technology has kept its productivity tools popular for Gen Zs. ""When I was in school, we would have a group Google Doc,"" Goel said. ""We would all take notes in the same file together at the same time, which helped create a class review for midterms and finals.""

""I would argue that that shows Google's strategy for education has worked quite well even if you're not using (Google hardware) anymore,"" Greengart said. ""There are long-term benefits for Google there."""

The police said the construction material used in building the boundary walls of the school was of poor quality.

The trigger for the collapse was ongoing construction in an adjacent plot, the police said.

The Kirloskar family dispute has seen the three Kirloskar brothers trading charges and taking their fight to the NCLT, Sebi and courts. The grandsons of SL Kirloskar and fourth-generation Kirloskars -- Sanjay Kirloskar, Atul Kirloskar and Rahul Kirloskar -- are in the midst of these battles. Sebi is investigating insider-trading charges by Atul and Rahul.

The 130-year Kirloskar Group is headed for yet another split as the Pune-based Kirloskar brothers are in the midst of a bitter fight with Atul and Rahul on one side and Sanjay on the other. Attempts made to end the battle through mediation by former finance secretary Vijay Kelkar failed. Appeals to preserve the Kirloskar legacy and resolve the disputes privately failed.

Atul and Rahul have filed a case at the NCLT against Sanjay and sought his removal from KBL claiming mismanagement and oppression. KBL has indicated that Sebi is investigating whether Atul and Rahul were involved in insider trading while being part of the KBL leadership team. Meanwhile KBL's independent probe into charges of insider trading against Atul and Rahul by justice (Retd) BN Srikrishna has been made public, which says that Atul and Rahul could be held guilty of insider trading.

Another bone of contention is the fight over the 'Kirloskar' trademark. Fight for the Kirloskar home in upscale Pune has reached the police station and there is also vast land holdings of the Kirloskar family in the outskirts of Pune. There are charges of failure in honouring the family agreement of not getting into each other's business. The battle has also reached their management school, Kirloskar Institute of Advance Management Studies.

The Kirloskar Group had first split in 2000 when Bengaluru-based Vijay Kirloskar moved out of the group with Kirloskar Electrical while the Pune-based Kirloskar brothers moved out with Kirloskar Oil Engine Engines, Kirloskar Brothers, Kirloskar Pneumaics and related subsidiaries.

The Kirloskar Group business was restructured and split between the brothers again in 2008-09 after a family settlement. Sanjay Kirloskar is running Kirloskar Brothers (KBL) while Atul Kirloskar and Rahul Kirloskar managed Kirloskar Oil Engines (KOEL), Kirloskar Pneumatic Company (KPCL), respectively. Companies were created to house investments and become holding companies to deal with the complex cross holdings in the Group.

KBL is the most successful of the Kirloskar companies paying dividend for 81 years and is among the leaders in the pumps business with an annual turnover of '3,000 crore. KOEL acquired a majority stake in La-Gajjar Machineries, marking their entry into the pumps business, which led to the escalation of the battle as there are differences in the interpretation of the non-compete clause in the Deed for Family Settlement. KOEL has just got permission from the RBI to start an NBFC and an insider-trading charge would hurt their credibility.

Sanjay Kirloskar has refrained from commenting as these matters were sub-juidce while there was no response from office of Atul and Rahul Kirloskar."

The Kendriya Vidyalaya (KV) school near Pune Airport was on Monday transformed into a beehive of activity as 1,700 adolescents gathered in the school premises to attempt a Guinness World Record on generating awareness on menstrual health and hygiene.

Organisers of the event claimed that this was the largest ever group of adolescent girls and boys ""under one roof"" for such a awareness session. on menstrual health and hygiene.

The programme was the joint initiative of the Bengaluru-based Motherhood Hospital, a leading healthcare chain specialising in women and children's health and the Pune-based Spherule Foundation, an NGO that works on women's empowerment and health-related issues.

""We were recently approached by the Records Committee of the Guinness Book of World Records who encouraged us to conduct this event on a larger scale as we had been specializing in the field of women and children's health. Hence, we tied up with the Spherule Foundation to conceptualize this event of educating adolescent girls and boys on the importance of menstrual health and hygiene,"" said Dr. Rajeshwari Pawar, consultant, gynaecologist and obstetrician, Motherhood Hospitals.

In her 40-minute address, Dr. Pawar addressed the students in a lively 40-minute speech in which she spoke of the importance of menstrual hygiene and busted stereotypes and myths associated with the subject.

She said the unique initiative was aimed at dispelling the many doubts faced by young girls regarding menstruation.

""The point of this gathering is to spark awareness among girls and boys on a subject often swept under the carpet,"" said Dr. Pawar.

She observed that a 2016 survey conducted by UNICEF in the Indian hinterland showed that 80% of the subjects stored their menstrual cloth in an unsanitary place for further use while 50% failed to dry their menstrual rags outside and in full sunlight which is an essential condition required to kill bacteria.

""Our joint initiative is trying to help our society understand the importance of menstruation and how to overcome the stigma around it,"" remarked Dr. Pawar.

""The global silence and shame around menstruation is alarming. In India alone, 23 million girls drop out of schools annually. This translates into one in every five girls owing to lack of menstrual hygiene management facilities, like availability of sanitary napkins and a logical awareness of menstruation,"" said Dr. Geeta Bora, Founder, Spherule Foundation.

Speaking on the initiative, Vijayarathna V, CEO, Motherhood Hospitals, said: ""There is a huge societal gap and lack of knowledge on menstrual hygiene. In India barely 18% of 355 million menstruating women use sanitary napkins with the rest unable to afford them, often resorting to using unhygienic substances such as newspapers, sand, leaves, mud or unsterilised clothes leading to vaginal and urinary tract infections, infertility and other reproductive health complications."""

The Harvard Business Review's latest ranking of top 100 CEOs includes only 32 MBAs. Since its inception, the proportion of MBAs in this exclusive club has hovered around 30. No wonder, questions are being increasingly raised about the relevance of conventional management education, especially mainstream MBA programmes. Against this background, business schools will do well to pay attention to the work of this year's Nobel laureate Paul Romer, who, incidentally, is a professor at a leading business school. His work in economics highlights the role of ideas and innovation in economic growth. Innovation need not be only technological, but it also spans domains of international trade, public policy and business management. Research and development are keys to innovation.

Of late, leading management institutes in India have increased their focus on research. However, research publications that help institutes to rise in academic rankings do not necessarily make them relevant to practice. Noted management scholar Nirmalya Kumar made a stinging observation about doctoral programmes arguing that, with a few exceptions, most marketing academics did not focus on the issues important to practitioners.

While research is aimed at understanding a phenomenon, development deals with creation. But businesses are seldom contended with mere understanding of phenomenon. They aspire to find solutions to problems. This is often the root cause of the perceived gap between theory and practice of management. If this gulf is to be bridged, business schools will have to shift focus from mere 'research' to 'research and development'. In science and technology domain, the term 'development' is commonly used in conjunction with research. However, the same is rare in business management, at least in academia.

Research does contribute towards solution building, but it is not the only input for the same. Development often calls for imagination and creativity. For instance, study of profile & behaviour of the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP) consumers constitutes research. But development of marketing strategy comprising low unit packs in the form of one-rupee shampoo sachets for BOP segment or pay-per-use pricing policy for usage of tractors by small landowner farmers has been a result of ingenuity of entrepreneurs and managers. Management guru CK Prahalad, who brought light on BOP markets, spoke about limitations of 'best practices' and the need to concentrate on 'next practices'. While a researcher can study best practices as they exist, next practices come under the realm of development.

If universities and business schools wish to focus on research and development, they need to raise some fundamental questions related to their research approaches and doctoral programmes. A fundamental difference between natural and social sciences often gets overlooked. In natural sciences, the 'reality' that is being investigated and the research findings that are supposed to facilitate understanding of the 'reality' can be independent of each other. Noted management scholar Sumantra Ghoshal illustrated this very lucidly with an example. He argued that even if a researcher wrongly interprets that the Sun revolves around the Earth and not the other way round, the reality does not change. The existence of objective reality makes it relatively easy for natural scientists to critically assess the evidence. However, in social sciences, the reality can be socially constructed.

Let us take the case of a company trying to expand market for electric cars. Using tools and techniques borrowed from natural sciences, a management researcher can build evidence about how and at what rate the market for petrol and diesel engine driven cars grew. Manufacturers of electric cars can certainly draw a few lessons from this. But these very same methods may not be useful to garner evidence on how electric car market 'can' be grown because the phenomenon of market expansion is yet to unfold. On the other hand, when an engineer tries to develop the first electric car, he/she can develop it in a lab, test it and provide evidence so that the same can be used prospectively. In most managerial situations, 'reality' cannot be constructed in advance of the practice. Since it is difficult to create managerial situations in labs, research techniques that rely on pattern recognition statistically can normally be used only retrospectively.

Moreover, innovation, by definition, amounts to breaking free from the pattern. A formula that led to the success of one organisation at one point of time can be intentionally disrupted by managers in competing organisations. Gary Hamel and CK Prahalad, in their best seller 'Competing for the Future', cite examples from photocopying and earthmoving equipment industry, wherein smaller players like Canon and Komatsu intentionally adopted practices that were very different from their respective leading competitors -- Xerox and Caterpillar. While researchers try to understand rules of the game, innovation results from changing those very rules.

If business schools want to retain relevance, they will have to make systematic efforts at according academic legitimacy to 'developmental' work of scholars. IIT Delhi has taken a step in this direction. It has decided to help doctoral scholars in converting their theses into ventures. Business schools need to remind themselves that the likes of Peter Drucker, Henry Mintzberg, Michael Porter, CK Prahalad, Sumantra Ghoshal or W Chan Kim attained status of revered gurus not because their researches involved esoteric tools and techniques, but because their work extended beyond research and led to the development of innovative solutions to managerial problems."

From being the only girl in her Computer Science class to becoming a strong feminist and perfectionist, the high achiever lets us in on her forays into the world of AI, and how this is just the beginning for her.

On her recent achievement, Aakriti says, ""I couldn't have achieved anything without the support of the people around me. Over the years, I have realised that it isn't about passing around business cards, but taking the time to recognise the people behind them. I do believe that small things matter. And of course, it is impossible to achieve anything if you don't give it your all and work persistently towards it.""

Aakriti studied at the Kellogg School of Management North-western University and also holds a Computer Science degree from the Ohio State University. The enterprising girl started her career at Deloitte and DE Shaw & Co, where Jeff Bezos served as the VP of Technology before starting Amazon.

She draws inspiration from her father, Srikanth Vasantharaj who has himself held key positions of general manager, VP and director at Sodexo.

She was born and raised in Bengaluru. and moved to the US to pursue her masters. She is currently staying in St Francisco.

About her work life, she says, ""I think that doing impactful work for high growth rocket ships are often an answer, and I have had the opportunity to drive key initiatives at Red Hat and IBM Watson, Deloitte and DE Shaw & Co in my career. I drove key initiatives in the capacity of Head of AI Product at IBM Watson in 2016 and was hired by Red Hat for their AI initiative as the CMO for AI in 2017. Recently, IBM acquired Red Hat for $34 billion which is the largest software acquisition ever in the history. Prior to that, I won the IBM Watson competition and was a national finalist back when Watson first won against the grand champion on the Jeopardy game in addition to launching products at IBM Watson as one of their first and youngest product team members.""

For women rising to prominence in tech, much of the past 20 years has been spent trying to emulate the Bill Gates, Zuckerbergs and Steve Jobs of the world. As a woman in artificial intelligence (AI) and marketing, who has been involved in AI initiatives for major Fortune 500 companies such as Red Hat and IBM Watson, Aakriti is a strong feminist and is often seen promoting women to enter into the world of AI and technology.

""I was a rebel growing up. As an only child from India, I saw other women in my country suffer and be denied their basic human rights. Even here in the US, women sometimes underestimate themselves, but I was raised with the notion that nothing is impossible. Under the guidance of my parents, I grew up to be a feminist, with the belief that women can do whatever men can do. I learned that if you really want something, you have to go get it. Today, more and more tech workplaces are starting to recognise the skills we offer and the importance of traditionally feminine traits.""

She is also a Zumba instructor, a fitness addict and an Indian classical dancer who wished to be a pop star when she was in eighth grade.

On her plans for the future, she says, ""I am launching something called Venture Amalgamator where I connect venture capitalists to entrepreneurs to help start-ups grow their business.""

About her secret to seeing success at such a young age, she says, ""Believe in yourself and own your success. Understand the goals of the person you are getting to know and try to help them.

The success of any task or activity depends upon the quality of preplanning and whether accomplish or not the objective must be attempted to solidify. To start with a strong monitoring mechanism is imminent in the School level and a rational commitment is needed from all the stakeholders. In my 20 years of continuous selfless attachment in Service Association work like ANSTA & NSEAOA what I personally observed is a logical working system is in the offing particularly management policies at all level and emphatically requires more inputs on academic interest. And to achieve its goal a tangible policy is impending to formulate through the blessing of political will to improvise its traditional tag. In this regard I would like to lay down the following humble suggestions as a measures for improvement of academic acceleration towards qualitative education in the department.

1. Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

12. The Government may plan for observance of Year of Academic Excellence for School Education Department."

The days of top-down, command-and-control leadership are coming to an end, giving way to a more transparent, empathetic management style. Instead of managers who breathe down their necks, the modern workforce demands a more supportive environment; one in which they are motivated by feeling connected to their work and supporting the success of their team and the business.

That means that in order to be successful, today's leaders must let go of the traditional one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, they must become better coaches; supporting, motivating, and playing to the individual strengths of their team members in the way that resonates best with each individual.

However, adjusting to this new management style can be a challenge for some who are steeped in the ""old ways"" of leadership. Becoming a better coach requires changing your perspective - on both yourself and your team.

To get some insight on how to make the shift, I e-mailed with Joanne Wells, a senior HR leader and expert in modern performance management, from Halogen Software. Joanne shared these tips on how you can become a better manager by improving your coaching skills.

Understand why coaching matters.

Employees want to be part of a culture where they can learn and grow as individuals and feel that their contributions have value beyond profitability. Which, when you think about it, isn't really all that revolutionary. In all aspects of life, don't we all want to be treated as individuals who matter instead of as cogs in a system whose only purpose is to serve someone else's needs? If you don't provide that kind of supportive environment, your team will stagnate like hamsters in a wheel -- working hard but not really going anywhere. Soon they'll be dissatisfied and head for the door.

Be willing to adapt.

Don't assume that your management approach is the best. Conduct self-assessments to better understand yourself as a leader - your communication style, your intrinsic motivators, and how you want to be recognized and rewarded. Then, recognize that not everyone will -- nor should they -- share your perspective. It's not their job to change how they want to be treated to fit your leadership style. It's your job to tailor your approach based on their needs. In order to change your team's behavior and improve their performance, it may be you who needs to change.

Get to know the whole person.

Set aside time to really get to know your team, both inside of work and outside. Learn about their passions and interests and how they balance work and personal life. Then, use that insight to inspire and motivate them. For example, if an employee is passionate about technology, figure out how to channel that interest in a way that they enjoy but that also helps the business.

Remember that your purpose is to help others.

Too many leaders think, ""How can I get my employees to do what reflects well on ME as a leader?"" If that's your purpose, people will see through it, and you'll lose their trust. Instead, your focus must genuinely be to improve the performance of your team. Your role is to help them grow in both their careers and in life, to feel valued as a person and not just for their productivity/output.

Always address ""what's next?""

In each interaction with your team, it's important to establish a follow-up action. If an issue or obstacle arises for an employee, talk-in that moment-about what the two of you can do to 1) resolve it and 2) prevent it from happening again. Working together to develop solutions and remove barriers not only demonstrates your commitment to helping your employees succeed, but also that you value their input and suggestions.

Give them room to experiment.

As a manager and coach, it's not your job to provide the answers to everything. Instead, provide a supportive environment where your employees can figure things out on their own and, if they do fail, can learn from the experience.

Being a successful manager is no longer about what you can get out of your employees. It's about how you can help them succeed as employees -- and as people -- which, in turn, will help the company thrive. Adopting an employee-centric coaching approach is essential to empowering your team to perform at their best and achieve their fullest potential.

At Ambit, we spend a lot of time reading articles that cover a wide gamut of topics, ranging from zeitgeist to futuristic, and encapsulate them in our weekly 'Ten Interesting Things' product. Some of the most fascinating topics covered this week are Management (Rocker's guide to management), MedTech (Using AI in diagnosing Cancer), Behaviour (National character stereotypes mirror language use), Technology (Robots controlled by paralysed people), Environment (Plasticphobia: Will going plastic-free harm the environment?) and Politics (When presidents were people) among others.

Here are the ten most interesting pieces that we read this week, ended December 14, 2018.

1) A rocker's guide to management [Source: 1843magazine.com]

Some interesting management lessons can be taken from the historic rock bands the world has seen. And this piece throws light on how some of the most famous bands in the world have managed to stick together over the years, while others broke apart. So, what's the most important thing? Finding the right combination of personalities pays off. As an investor, Garry Tan, co-founder of Posterous and Posthaven, says he probes the relationship between a start-up's founders as much as he does its business model. For him, the relationship needs to be deeper than the project.

Talking about Coldplay, they have been together for so many years. Why? Because they have a shared vision of success. All the band members get an equal cut even though Chris Martin is the lead. This democratic model depends on individual members believing that each has the group's interest at heart, not just their own. Coldplay knew they wanted to be the biggest band in the world; each member had the same clear-eyed ambition. Their equal income split works like equity shares: every partner has a direct interest in keeping the band together.

Marie-Louise von Franz, a psychoanalyst, wrote that ""whenever one is in a group...one has to draw a veil over a part of one's personality."" Gains from collaboration are traded off against self-expression. Occasionally, she said, it's the other way around: a group can become united in spirit and each individual expresses themselves more fully than they would be able to by themselves. A ""superpersonal harmony"" prevails. This rare condition, says von Franz, is what lies behind myths such as the Knights of King Arthur.

2) Powerful Predictors: Diagnosing Cancer in India using AI [Source: digital.hbs.edu]

In India, less than 10,000 pathologists have to service a population of 1.3 billion people. While the number of pathologists are too less, approximately 74,000 women die from cervical cancer every year, accounting for one-third of the burden of cervical cancer deaths globally. To take on this challenge, a company is using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect cervical cancer. The company here is Aindra Systems, founded by Adarsh Natarajan. Aindra is demonstrating how strategic use of automated technologies has the potential to democratize access to quality care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Aindra's end-to-end diagnostic platform takes biological samples which are stained by an autostainer, converted into a digital image, and then analyzed by AI algorithms to differentiate between cancerous cells and healthy cells. This three-part process is done onsite at a clinic, eliminating the need for the tedious process of manual staining and the transport of large batches of samples to distant laboratories. As a result, patients are told if they have cancerous lesions within 1-2 hours instead of 5-6 weeks.

Aindra's platform makes a strong case for the use of AI to address global health challenges, but AI-assisted technologies require vast amounts of labeled, high-quality data to train the AI algorithm, data that doesn't exist in many low-resource environments. In the case of healthcare, poor quality data could lead to fatal outcomes. AI-powered cervical cancer detection, in combination with widespread human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, has the potential to prevent deaths from cervical cancer globally -- an historic achievement. Companies like Aindra could play a key role in reducing the burden of disease in populations with poor access to high quality care and set the stage for future entrepreneurs from LMICs to develop AI-assisted technologies using human-centered design.

3) What's next for marketplace start-ups [Source: andrewchen.co]

In this essay, Andrew Chen, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, talks about the future of marketplaces. This essay covers: 1) why services are still offline; 2) the history of service marketplace paradigms which include the listings era, the unbundled Craigslist era, the ""Uber for X"" era, and the managed marketplace era; 3) the future of service marketplaces; and 4) the future opportunities.

Over the years, the buying habits have changed. From physical stores to online, people have started shopping online. These ecommerce shopping portals account for trillions of dollars in market capitalization. The next era will do the same to the $9.7 trillion US consumer service economy, through discontinuous innovations in AI and automation, new marketplace paradigms, and overcoming regulatory capture.

In the next 20 years, there'll be immense opportunities where technological, operational and regulatory hurdles persist. The services sector represents two-thirds of US consumer spending and employs 80% of the workforce. The companies that reinvent various service categories can improve both consumers' and professionals' lives-by creating more jobs and income, providing more flexible work arrangements, and improving consumer access and lowering cost.

4) In conversation with...Françoise Barré-Sinoussi [Source: mosaicscience]

In this conversation, Françoise Barré-Sinoussi reveals how she identified HIV as the cause of AIDS, and also talks about her receipt of the Nobel Prize, and the latest efforts to prevent, treat and manage HIV. When Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, along with her colleague Luc Montagnier, found the virus that causes the disease, it proved monumental, a boulder thrown into a lake whose ripples still fan out today. It proved critical too, transforming our understanding of AIDS as it bulldozed through country after country, bringing blindness and pneumonia and death like a grim huckster.

Effective treatment might have been developed in 1996, but three things prevented Barré-Sinoussi from giving up her fight against the disease: the lack of availability of antiretrovirals - of today's 35 million sufferers, only about a third receive treatment; the limitations of the treatment, which can cause a kaleidoscope of side effects; and the galloping rise in the number of infections. Barré-Sinoussi is ""concerned"" about young people, who are ""too relaxed"" about HIV because ""the education campaigns are not sufficient...there is not enough information"". A 2013 survey in Scotland found one in ten pupils think HIV can be transmitted through kissing.

Since 2008, when the first known case of an HIV patient being 'cured' was reported, dubbed the 'Berlin patient', a growing wave of stories have appeared citing research from around the world on what could lead to a cure. But scientists largely prefer the term 'functional cure' (Barré-Sinoussi favours 'remission' or 'sustained remission'), using it to describe a scenario in which a sufferer no longer needs antiretroviral therapy (ART) but his or her body is not wholly free from HIV. When asked whether functional cure will be available, she says, ""Maybe we will have a treatment that will be effective not for all but for some."" Also, on getting a complete cure, she says even she is doesn't know when that will happen.

5) National character stereotypes mirror language use: A study of Canadian and American tweets [Source: journals.plos.org]

Stereotypes about national character, i.e., individually held beliefs regarding psychological traits of world nations and cultures, are ubiquitous, stable and influential. The importance of these beliefs for the functioning of individuals, groups and societies is hard to overestimate. National character stereotypes, or beliefs about the personality characteristics of the members of a nation, present a paradox. Such stereotypes have been argued to not be grounded in the actual personality traits of members of nations, yet they are also prolific and reliable.

Stereotypes of Canadians and Americans exemplify the paradox; people in both nations strongly believe that the personality profiles of typical Canadians and Americans diverge, yet aggregated self-reports of personality profiles of Canadians and Americans show no reliable differences. The linguistic behaviour of nations mirrors national character stereotypes. A study conducted by using 40 million tweets from the microblogging platform Twitter quantified the words and emojis diagnostic of Canadians and Americans. Another study explored the positivity of national language use.

In other studies, the 120 most nationally diagnostic words and emojis of each nation are presented to naive participants. They are then asked to assess personality of a hypothetical person who uses either diagnostically Canadian or American words and emojis. Personality profiles derived from the diagnostic words of each nation bear close resemblance to national character stereotypes.

6) Why are Indian managers so damn good? [Source: qz.com]

The co-authors of Made-in-India Managers, R Gopalakrishnan and Ranjan Banerjee, discuss why some of the Indian-born global corporate leaders are successful. Leaders like Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Indra Nooyi (formerly PepsiCo), Sundar Pichai (Google), Shantanu Narayen (Adobe), and Nitin Nohria (Harvard Business School) have had a significant component of their early upbringing, living experiences, and education in India. According to the authors, they are ""made-in-India managers.""

After studying these leaders and others who were in leadership positions in global organisations across the world, the authors got an answer to their question; How did being 'made-in-India' help you get where you are today? The experience of growing up in India had shaped them positively in fundamental ways. There were basically four features that made them stand apart.

Competitive intensity: the authors conducted informal focus group to understand their perceptions of management education in India. One of the consistent themes that emerged through the interviews was their perception of Indian students as industrious and diligent. India's foremost business school, IIM Ahmedabad, admits one student for every 400 applications. Diversity and inclusion: This comes to save them when adjusting to a different or a variety of cultural environments. Such exposure begins early in life. It is not unusual in school to share lunch with people from different states -- a vast variety of cuisine is shared, understood, and appreciated.

Dealing with ambiguity: Indians learn to deal with a lot of things that are uncertain, and develop the ability to quickly assess situations and help themselves without waiting for the system to help them. Family values: The percentage of India-made leaders citing a family member as an influential role model is significantly higher than for their Western counterparts. The formative role of the family in shaping values through demonstration, stressing the value of education, and proving an ""always there"" support provides a strong value core that builds resilience. The strengths of the made-in-India manager emerge from the coming together of multiple, interlinked features with the ability to ""think in English.""

7) Cafe opens in Tokyo staffed by robots controlled by paralysed people [Source: soranews24.com]

Who said robots and humans can't live together? On 26 November, a ribbon cutting ceremony was held in the Nippon Foundation Building in Akasaka, Tokyo for a very special kind of cafe. Called Dawn ver.β, this café is staffed entirely with robot waiters. So what's new? Most of the places have robots. While this café's waiters' are robots, these robots are controlled by paralysed people.

Developed by Ory, a start-up that specializes in robotics for disabled people, the OriHime-D is a 120cm (4-foot) tall robot that can be operated remotely from a paralysed person's home. Even if the operator only has control of their eyes, they can command OriHime-D to move, look around, speak with people, and handle objects. Created in collaboration between Ory, NPO Nippon Foundation, and airline ANA, Dawn ver.β is designed to resemble the titular cafe from the 2008 anime Time of Eve, which is also contributing to the project.

During this time a staff of ten people, with conditions such as ALS or spinal cord injuries and working from home, are paid 1,000 yen (US$8.80) an hour (a standard wage for part-time work in Japan) to serve up coffee and interact with the clientele. But more importantly than money, these people are also given a newfound independence. In an age where people are afraid of robots taking all the jobs, it's nice to see an instance of robots giving people jobs for a change, especially in such a meaningful way.

8) Plasticphobia: Will going plastic-free harm the environment? [Source: BBC Radio ]

In this podcast, Tom Heaps, Rural Affairs Correspondent of BBC News, and a United Kingdom television and radio reporter and presenter, talks to several experts on plastic and its effects on our lives. The idea of plastic saving nature feels like environmental blasphemy today with its near universal polluting presence. We are all encouraged to live plastic-free, but does this put the interest of the planet first? Or are we at danger of damaging environmental side effects?

Most of the things that we use in our daily lives are made out of plastic. Be it spoon, bottles, earphones, mobiles, kitchen accessories, office accessories, etc. In UK alone, there are around 13bn plastic bottles used for water and soft drinks. Also, we are irresponsible in disposing these plastics. It's said that by 2020 all our plastic would be home compostable. Susan Lambert, curator of the Arts University, Bournemouth, feels that plastics are water-saving, land-sparing, etc. Tom Heaps also visited a plant where the company made plastics from plants. CEO of Biome Technologies, Paul Mines, says that they use plants to make bioplastics. And these bioplastics are used in making plastic materials like cups, bags, etc.

But one question that needs an answer is whether it is harmful for the environment? As these are made from plants, wouldn't it harm the nature? Mr. Mines says that these bioplastics are compostable within 3 months compared to years that it takes for a normal plastic bottle. While compostable plastic is one option, the other one is recycling. Steve Mahon from Armstrong Energy feels that we can turn all the plastics that are burnt or dumped into oil again. Armstrong Energy is making oils from plastics. So they are taking it back to its original form.

9) 'An education arms race': Inside the ultra-competitive world of private tutoring [Source: the Guardian] Every parent wants their offspring to be a master at whatever they plan to do in their careers. And to make that possible, they'll work day and night so that they can afford the best education for their kids. You can gauge this by the number of students being dropped at the Explore Learning tuition centre for extra maths and English coaching. The Bradford branch of Explore Learning is a tiny window into Britain's booming private tuition sector, now worth an estimated £2bn. Founded in 2001 by Bill Mills, a Cambridge maths graduate, the business now has 139 centres around the country (plus five in Texas run by a sister company). They are located mainly in shopping centres, so busy parents can get on with their weekly shop while their offspring perfect their times tables, punctuation and grammar.

The families who use the centre come from various walks of life. Some parents have their own businesses; others work at Bradford Royal Infirmary. There are families from Latvia, Poland and the Philippines. The parents talk about giving their children ""an edge"", the ""leg up"" they never had. Geoff Clayton, a retired garage worker, has been bringing his 10-year-old grandson, Brooklyn, to Explore Learning for about nine months. Brooklyn lives with his grandparents and likes football, Minecraft and maths. ""He's done really well,"" says Clayton. ""His reading has got a lot better, everything's got better."" The membership takes a significant chunk out of his pension, but he is happy to pay it to give Brooklyn ""a bit of a leg up"".

Initiatives aimed at making tuition more accessible already exist: some agencies pledge a proportion of their tuition to poorer pupils for free, while non-profit programmes such as the Tutor Trust connect tutors with disadvantaged schools. Explore Learning offers ""scholarships"" that give a 50% discount to parents on income support or jobseeker's allowance.

Some parents buy extra tuition to support children with special educational needs such as dyslexia, which mainstream schools are increasingly unable to meet. One mother from Nigeria said she sought extra support for her child as a practical response to racial discrimination: ""Any child from a minority has to be many times better than their white counterparts to be able to get into the top schools and universities."" But, not everyone is positive about the impact of tuition. ""It can cause students to not work in lessons,"" said one teacher. Another said: ""The need for tutoring frightens me. Schools should be able to offer students the support they need in class sizes that are manageable.""

10) When presidents were people [Source: the Atlantic ]

In this digital age, people are so exposed to fake news that they fail to differentiate between what's real and what's fake. This article, and Richard Ben Cramer's book 'What it Takes', shows how the era of politicians like George H. W. Bush and Donald Trump have seen dramatic change. Mr. Bush showed himself to people and was human-like, emoting genuine feelings. He didn't shield stuff that made him human from the people who covered him.

More so in those times a person's word mattered (since people were overall less about faking it). The spurts of doubt didn't matter, Mr. Cramer writes: Nixon had told Bush, to his face, that he was innocent, and for Bush, that was that. ""That was what he had to give, that was the measure of loyalty -- and the requirement of the code: personal commitment,"" Cramer writes. But, today's fast-paced life, era of reading headlines and low ""real"" interactions have made us judge, jury and executioner quick to write off things/people at a moment's notice.

In the Donald Trump era, where cries of ""fake news"" abound and the president views the media as the enemy, it's hard to imagine a resurgence of such access to politicians as people. A politician today is much more robotic, hence becoming less empathetic and way more rehearsed (can be read as fake) and everyone (not just politicians) is moving towards this. This is now becoming innate and something like-lie about your feeling and actions enough and that might just become the new normal or acceptable feeling (less human perhaps)."

The Pondicherry University (PU) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Université Paris-Est Créteil (UPEC), France, on research collaboration and exchange of faculty and students.

This follows a visit by an 8-member delegation from France led by Dr. Laurent Thevenet, Vice-President for International Affairs, and Joanna Belo, Director - International Affairs, UPEC.

According to Pondicherry University Vice-Chancellor Prof. Gurmeet Singh, international cooperation played an important role in building a globally competent academic and research system in the University.

The PU-UPEC cooperation will further enhance the long-standing relationship between Puducherry and France, he added. Pointing to the expanding global footprint of Pondicherry University through several MOUs signed over the past year, Prof. Anjaneya Swamy, Dean - School of Management, said this presented a great prospect for students and faculty members to be associated with world-class institutions and gain exposure to global benchmarks and best practices in academia.

Dr. Laurent Thevenet expressed delight at the speed with which this MoU could materialise from the first point of contact made only a few months ago. UPEC is one of the most comprehensive and inclusive universities in France, with an annual enrolment of about 30,000 students, including 3,000 international students, he said.

Prof. Chitra Sivasubramanian, Head - Department of Management Studies, pointed out that France is the third most preferred destination worldwide for international students.

Through this MoU, France has become more accessible to the students of Pondicherry University, she added.

Prof. Victor Anandkumar, Department of Management Studies and MoU coordinator, expressed confidence that this collaboration would be made operational through exchange of MBA students from the academic year 2019-20.

The MoU signing ceremony was also attended by Prof. Balakrishnan, Director of Studies, Educational Innovations and Rural Reconstruction; Prof. Rajeev Jain, Director of Culture & Cultural Relations, Education; Dr. Sasi Kanta Dash, Registrar; A.K.

Engineers at Rutgers and Oregon State University have found a cost-effective way to make thin, durable heating patches by using intense pulses of light to fuse tiny silver wires with polyester. Their heating performance is nearly 70 percent higher than similar patches created by other researchers, according to a Rutgers-led study in Scientific Reports.

They are inexpensive, can be powered by coin batteries and can generate heat where the human body needs it since they can be sewed on as patches.

""This is important in the built environment, where we waste lots of energy by heating buildings - instead of selectively heating the human body,"" said senior author Rajiv Malhotra, an assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. The department is in the School of Engineering.

It is estimated that 47 percent of global energy is used for indoor heating, and 42 percent of that energy is wasted to heat empty space and objects instead of people, the study notes. Solving the global energy crisis - a major contributor to global warming - would require a sharp reduction in energy for indoor heating.

Personal thermal management, which focuses on heating the human body as needed, is an emerging potential solution. Such patches may also someday help warm anyone who works or plays outdoors.

The Rutgers and Oregon State engineers created highly efficient, flexible, durable and inexpensive heating patches by using ""intense pulsed-light sintering"" to fuse silver nanowires - thousands of times thinner than a human hair - to polyester fibers, using pulses of high-energy light. The process takes 300 millionths of a second, according to the study funded by the National Science Foundation and Walmart U.S. Manufacturing Innovation Fund.

When compared with the current state of the art in thermal patches, the Rutgers and Oregon State creation generates more heat per patch area and is more durable after bending, washing and exposure to humidity and high temperature.

Next steps include seeing if this method can be used to create other smart fabrics, including patch-based sensors and circuits. The engineers also want to determine how many patches would be needed and where they should be placed on people to keep them comfortable while reducing indoor energy consumption.

Public image is equity. In politics, business, and entertainment. And when prominent people lose 'public image,' there is also the danger that they will lose a lot more. Mark Zuckerberg knows that. When David Fincher directed The Social Network in 2010, a film adapted by Aaron Sorkin from Ben Mezrich's 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal, he focussed on the allegedly murky moral universe of founder Mark Zuckerberg. And told the story of the lawsuits that erupted post the success of a little venture that had been ideated in a Harvard dorm, let's not forget, to play 'Hot or Not.'

Around the same time the film released, Zuckerberg donated $100 million towards creating an educational foundation in Newark, New Jersey. The goal was to help the city's struggling school system. The thing to notice here is just how he did it - he did it on the stage of the most popular talk show on the planet. The Oprah Winfrey Show. Was he ensuring that his gesture would overshadow the bad press he would get because of The Social Network? We couldn't tell, but the timing of the gesture was not an accident.

This was of course much before Facebook ran into even rougher weather.

At the end of each year, Mark Zuckerberg writes down his resolutions for the coming year on Facebook. They have ranged from the practical ('Wear a tie every day,' 'Learn Mandarin,' 'Read a book every other week') to the precious ('Meet new people,' 'Write a thank you note each day). Last year - 'to fix Facebook.'

Oops.

2018 has become Facebook's annus horribilis. A never-ending stream of news denting Facebook's image over and over again.

In April 2018, Zuckerberg appeared before the US Congress, post the revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm linked to the Trump campaign, had harvested the data of an estimated 87 million Facebook users to psychologically profile voters during the 2016 election.

Zuckerberg's Capitol Hill testimony was about the question of accountability for the mishandling of private data without users' knowledge, Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election, and selective censorship.

What was apparent was that despite its supposed intent to connect the world, Facebook had somehow succeeded in dividing its consumers across political lines. At least it was a throwback to the motto of its early days - Move Fast and Break Things. And did they ever.

The Senators at the hearing also indicated that they weren't sure if they could trust a company that has repeatedly violated its privacy promises. If Zuckerberg - much like another 'voice of a generation' Lena Dunham - is known for one thing, it's apology tours. This time, on the biggest stage of them all, Zuckerberg's implacable face, carefully controlled gestures and robotic monotone unleashed a flurry of memes.

On this edition of Digging Deeper, we continue our stories on the biggest news events of the year. The public image of the company that got us all image-conscious is up there with the biggest ones of the year. We will not just review the damage to the trust equity of Facebook and Zuckerberg but also focus on another protagonist in this tale, the woman who asked women across the world to 'lean in,' and the woman who was supposed to be the infallible voice of conscience in the company - COO Sheryl Sandberg. A Book of Faces falling from their pedestals is our story today. My name is Rakesh, and you are listening to Moneycontrol.

Facebook's year in review

2018 has been a relentlessly difficult one for Facebook and perhaps the most unforgiving in its 14-year history. In comparison, 2010 (when after Facebook violated users' privacy by making key types of information public without proper consent or warning) seems like a bad dream that Zuckerberg woke himself up from and then went about his day with a shrug.

If the taint of unwittingly spreading Russian propaganda during the 2016 US presidential election was not enough, newer and more serious accusations of data misuse, the proliferation of fake and misleading news that was reported to even have fanned the fires of genocide in Myanmar, have been plaguing the company. Zuckerberg seems woefully out of touch with how his platform can cause harm via hate speech and misinformation. As when he saw no harm in retaining posts concerning Holocaust denial on Facebook. (For reference, Holocuast denial is illegal in 16 European countries and Israel.)

Zuckerberg and Sandberg, the faces of the company have expectedly lost goodwill during the course of the year.

As Cnet put it, the scandals have had a far-reaching fallout, with founders at companies owned by Facebook heading towards the exit door. Those who have left include WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum; Instagram co-founder and CEO Kevin Systrom and Chief Technical Officer Mike Krieger; and Oculus co-founder Brendan Iribe.

Sandberg's conduct during this tumultuous year has not been exemplary either, and that has surprised legions who joined Team Sandberg post her genteel overtures to feminism with her theory of Leaning In. And the worldwide sympathy and admiration she evoked post a viral Facebook post about the sudden demise of her husband and the subsequent talkshow appearances she made to give messages of hope and healing to those struggling with unexpected loss. But more about her later.

Only last week, Facebook revealed that a bug could have exposed the private photos of up to 6.8 million users to outside developers.

But the annus horribilis began in March, when a joint investigation by The New York Times, The Guardian and The Observer revealed that the UK-based consultancy Cambridge Analytica, with now-proven ties to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, had misappropriated the data of 270,000 accounts of Facebook's over 2 billion users.

The way this happened is rather convoluted. And we dove very deep into it on an earlier episode.

A Cambridge professor, Aleksandr Kogan, created a personality quiz app called ""thisisyourdigitallife,"" and gained access to information on 270,000 accounts through Facebook's Login feature and then shared the data with Cambridge Analytica. It turned out later that the breach had in fact affected over 87 million users.

Here is where Zuckerberg and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg let down the users who have entrusted them with their privacy. They remained quiet during the initial days of the story breaking, although Facebook subsequently built a tool to let users know if their data had been accessed. Facebook did go on to admit that names, email addresses and phone numbers and in the case of 14 million users, even data with birth date, hometown and workplace, along with other information had been hacked.

Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform but only after much of the damage was done.

The credibility of the company is at an all-time low. Especially after Facebook executive Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth's leaked 2016 memo made it clear Facebook thrives on expansion at the expense of user safety. The inevitable question being asked today is, What kind of a value system prevails within a company that has undermined the trust of the users who have contributed to its success. This November, as is well-known, The New York Times published a revealing investigation into how Facebook ""delayed, denied, and deflected"" the scandals besmirching it. And one figure that decidedly fell from grace post the piece was Sheryl Sandberg.

Lack of accountability

The New York Times report details Sandberg's meltdown in September 2017 post the discovery by Facebook's engineers that there was suspicious Russia-linked activity on its site and a federal investigation was looming on the horizon.

Interestingly, Sandberg's anger had little to do with the misappropriation of data but with the fact that the social network's security chief, Alex Stamos, had informed company board members that Facebook had yet to contain the Russian infestation.

We quote, ""Mr Stamos' briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal. ""You threw us under the bus!"" she yelled at Mr Stamos, according to people who were present. The clash that day would set off a reckoning - for Mr Zuckerberg, for Ms Sandberg and for the business they had built together.""

The fact that 2.27 billion people and their personal data, photos, messages, shares and interaction had made Facebook, a Fortune 500 company and a global brand, seemed to miss her. As also the fact that her company was being used, as the piece says, ""to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe."" Her concern was more to do with a personal loss of face.

The biggest takeaway from this New York Times piece and the bit that irrevocably taints Sandberg as also Zuckerberg is that the two despite being aware of warning signs, concealed them from public view.

When the truth inevitably came out, the company's stock price stumbled and as we said before, its trust equity suffered a walloping as well.

What followed was a massive campaign to repair the damage. New York Times again, ""In the last year, Ms Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook's critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, persuading a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic. In Washington, allies of Facebook, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Ms Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook's reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.""

Facebook acknowledged that there was misinformation but did not attribute the misinformation and its propagation to Russia. Alex Hern, Guardian UK's tech editor said, ""It looked like it was a deliberate attempt to reduce the pushback from the Republican Party who, Facebook feared, would accuse them of batting for the Democratic Party if they said the truth, which was that there was a Republican misinformation campaign which was overwhelmingly in favour of Donald Trump.""

The New York Times report also brought out one more nugget - highlighting Facebook's link to an American political consultancy called Definers Public Affairs, which as Hern puts it, practices the ""dark arts of political campaigning, including an in-house smear factory."" A specific example of Definers' work - spread allegations that George Soros was funding Facebook's political opponents. In an environment where ""George Soros"" is used as an anti-Semitic dogwhistle, the subtext was simply, ""Jews are trying to crush Facebook."" This, let us remind you, was not a third party activity, this was what they had been hired to do - attack the opponents of Facebook.

A public statement was issued by Facebook but many felt it was a case of too little too late.

The statement said, ""This has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face. While these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.""

The trouble is not over yet. Regulatory and law enforcement forces in the US and Europe are still knocking at the company's door, and a national privacy law is being mooted that may hamper the future growth of Facebook.

Stamos and some other high-ranking executives have left the company and some onlookers believe that it is just a matter of time before Zuckerberg and Sandberg have to reconsider their positions at the company.

How Sheryl Sandberg's halo slipped

The making of an icon is an interesting process. And this year saw the fall of not just Sandberg but many others. Including Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi in whose fall, Facebook played an indirect role when it spurred the Rohingya genocide via inflammatory posts. Until recently, Aung San Suu Kyi was the celebrated heroine of the democratic uprising against the Military Junta. In 2017, she was even presented with a new rose hybrid named after her in Kunming, China. Even to those who did not know much about her politics, the image of Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi with a rose in her hair, stood for resilience and courage despite a 15-year long house arrest as a political prisoner. A time during which she was separated from her children and saw her husband only five times and lost him on his 53rd birthday.

In 1999, Time Magazine called Suu Kyi one of the ""Children of Gandhi"" and his spiritual heir to non-violence. Yet, post her ascension to the office of State Counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi has drawn world-wide criticism over her inertia and apathy towards the persecution of the Rohingya community in the Rakhine State and her refusal to concede that Myanmar's military had a hand in the genocide. Not just that, under her watch, journalists have suffered persecution as well.

Why this story needed to be told is that in a world starved of female representation in politics and boardrooms, the fall of powerful women like Aung San Suu Kyi and Sandberg is particularly hurtful and disappointing to women who look up to them and are inspired by their success.

Sandberg was a beacon of liberal ideals. She came into Facebook with impeccable credentials - a former Clinton administration official and ex vice president of global online sales and operations at Google. Her book Lean In, published in 2013, was a bestseller despite criticism that its approach towards making workplaces and success more accessible to women was based on the experiences of white and privileged feminism unconscious of intersectionality of race and identity. Also the book's notion that women could have it all was recently and famously dissed by former First Lady Michelle Obama who said, ""that s#!t doesn't work all the time.""

Still, in 2015, Sandberg became more than just a powerful corporate success story and turned into a figure of empathy for millions when she lost husband Dave Goldberg, the chief executive of SurveyMonkey. Her viral Facebook post about the loss saw an instant outpouring of sympathy from all over the world as people saw glimpses of their own losses in lines like, ""The most powerful one-line prayer is: 'Let me not die while I am still alive.' I would have never understood that prayer before losing Dave. Now I do. I think when tragedy occurs, it presents a choice. You can give in to the void, the emptiness that fills your heart, your lungs, constricts your ability to think or even breathe. Or you can try to find meaning. I have spent many moments lost in that void. And I know that many future moments will be consumed by the vast emptiness as well. But when I can, I want to choose life and meaning. So I am sharing what I have learned in the hope that it helps someone else. In the hope that there can be some meaning from this tragedy.""

The use of Facebook for this post and the pathos in its content was a perfect example of what perhaps the platform was originally intended for. Making connections and bringing people together.

And as New York Times said in its recent piece, ""like other technology executives, Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg cast their company as a force for social good. Facebook's lofty aims were emblazoned even on securities filings: ""Our mission is to make the world more open and connected."" But as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform. When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them.

Facebook had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher. Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many Facebook executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.""

In December 2015 for instance, Presidential nominee Donald Trump, reminds New York Times, posted a statement on Facebook calling for a ""total and complete shutdown"" on Muslims entering the United States. And the post was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, and as the piece puts it, this was an illustration of the site's power to spread racist sentiment.

At this point, Zuckerberg actually comes up looking better than Sandberg because he asked Sandberg and other executives if Mr Trump had violated Facebook's terms of service. But the fact that nothing was done contributes to the impression that both he and Sandberg let things go.

More opportunism was displayed by Sandberg when post Trump's victory, she installed a well-connected Republican Joel Kaplan in the company .

We quote, ""The company also hired a former aide to Trump's new attorney-general, Mr Jeff Sessions, along with lobbying firms linked to Republican lawmakers who had jurisdiction over Internet companies.""

The thing that would come back to haunt both Zuckerberg and Sandberg was their refusal to act when as early as in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyber warfare unearthed how Russian hackers were probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns.

During the US general elections, says the piece, the team also found Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen e-mails.

The fact that Sandberg was angry at the examination of Russian activity without approval, and not at what the activity entailed, has been fatal for her reputation.

That her pick Kaplan was against the issuance of a public paper about these findings also shows her up in an uncomplimentary light.

We quote, ""Ms Sandberg sided with Mr Kaplan. Mr Zuckerberg - who spent much of 2017 on a national ""listening tour,"" feeding cows in Wisconsin and eating dinner with Somali refugees in Minnesota - did not participate in the conversations about the public paper. When it was published that April, the word ""Russia"" never appeared.

Ms Sandberg's subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Mr Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, and Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat. Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators' concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on Facebook.""

By August 2017, the situation had become too dire to ignore and as the piece puts it, had become a ""five-alarm fire.""

Even when Zuckerberg and Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings with a blog post on September 6, 2017, the day of the company's quarterly board meeting, they decided to go easy on the specifics.

The atmosphere at the full board gathering was uneasy with Sandberg bearing the brunt of most of the queries and later having the melt down we have talked about earlier.

We quote, ""Later that day, the company's abbreviated blog post went up. It said little about fake accounts or the organic posts created by Russian trolls that had gone viral on Facebook, disclosing only that Russian agents had spent roughly $100,000 - a relatively tiny sum - on approximately 3,000 ads."" Unquote. That Sandberg was a willing party to the suppression of truth has been now established. Her other actions have not been spared scrutiny either.

We quote Cnet, ""It turned out Sandberg asked her staff to look into Soros' financial motivations after he called companies like Facebook and Google a ""menace"" during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Facebook's board defended Sandberg's actions, but by then her image had been tarnished.""

Zuckerberg had once described Sandberg thus and we quote, "" She's unique in that she has an extremely high IQ and EQ, and it's really rare to get that in any single person."" Needless to say, there was perhaps a system failure that somehow corrupted the head and the heart of the company.

An opportunity lost

Sheryl Sandberg is now the object of attention of many culture analysts and multiple writing exercises that try to make sense of her journey. As Anne Helen Petersen, a senior culture writer for BuzzFeed News put it, ""Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg -- the person largely responsible for the revenue behind that huge valuation -- had been figured as a kind of super-unicorn herself: the rare woman capable of wielding power while preserving her likability. In dozens of profiles and interviews about the company and Sandberg's role in it, that uniqueness was emphasized time and time again.""

Facebook board member Jim Breyer had told Bloomberg Businessweek in 2011, ""I can say very simply I have never seen anyone with her combination of infectious, enthusiastic spirit combined with enthusiastic intelligence.""

Reams had been written about her interpersonal skills and sharp intellect and her endearing ability to be playful and businesslike.

In a thriving office that had a frat boy culture, Sandberg was a breath of fresh air.

BuzzFeed news writer Ann describes her as a ""half empath, half Spock"", and that ""rare powerful executive with a soft touch"" who knew how to monetize Facebook's product without cramping its style.

We quote, ""Between Sandberg's arrival in 2008 and Facebook achieving ""mega-unicorn"" status in 2013, Sandberg developed an almost mystical reputation within Silicon Valley."" That she did all this without overshadowing Zuckerberg showed she had tactical smarts.

Ann quotes, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen who told Fortune, ""Every company we work with wants 'a Sheryl. I keep explaining to people that we haven't figured out yet how to clone her.""

Her book Lean In, as we said before, further perpetuated her aura as a successful woman who was easy going and supportive, who had it all and wanted everyone to have it all too.

But things have changed and how. The piece quotes John Herrman who said in the Times, ""Facebook is in a constant state of crisis such that its executives' responses to scandals end up becoming scandals themselves."" Unquote. And as Ann puts it, even more so than her boss, and the platform's primary architect, Zuckerberg, Sandberg's gone from Facebook's saviour to the embodiment of all that's gone wrong with it.""

The critical shift in how she is being perceived now can be traced to the destruction of the feel-good myth that she was at the behest of a higher calling.

As Ann says, people are beginning to realise that big corporations are built to make money, and consolidate enough power to keep making it -- and the executives that lead them to excel by doing so with ruthless efficiency. We quote, ""Unicorns aren't real, and never have been; the vast majority of us are not Sandberg's mentees or her friends. We're customers, and Sandberg's most pressing business has always been business itself.""

And that is exactly something her admirers are finding difficult to come to terms with. But as the piece suggests just as her glorification was excessive, her vilification is also extreme. The piece suggests that the critical pile-on against Sandberg may be sexist and may be providing ammunition to those who always argue cynically that this is what happens when women attempt to ""have it all.""

So while cultural theorists like Leo Lowenthal call her an ""idol of production,"" Zuckerberg continues to be seen as an innovator.

The fallout

In the recent times, Facebook has removed fake accounts tied to Iran with over 1 million followers but in the years to come, its role though unintentional in impacting the political climate of the world, and spreading divisive agendas will be studied by political pundits and startups hoping to connect the world further. As of now, it is facing the inevitable backlash from not just US lawmakers but in Europe where reports www.cnet.com, lawmakers and regulators were digging into the company's data practices.

We quote, ""Italian regulators fined Facebook $11.4 million for misleading users about how their data is used.And in a rare move, the UK Parliament seized internal Facebook e-mails and documents that were part of a lawsuit involving now-defunct app developer Six4Three. The documents reinforced the public's privacy concerns about the social network, which has denied selling user data.

Critics argued that Facebook, which makes billions of dollars from advertising, not only lacked an ""ethical roadmap"" but also had a history of placing its profit before user privacy. "" Unquote.So who will pay the bigger price for Facebook's failures? Sandberg or Zuckerberg? Well, your guess is as good as ours."

As seven freshly dug up graves became a new abode of the seven slain civilians at Pulwama, the former justice of India Markandey Katju drew parallels with Jalianwalla Bagh carnage and My Lai massacre. But the civilian killings have only added to a growing sense of fast-blurring line between combatants and civilians in the Kashmir Valley.

Yet another chilly Saturday morning in Kashmir turned bloody as its seething south witnessed the killing of seven unarmed local civilians that include a newly-married husband, a class 9 student, a carpenter's son, a lone-bread winner, a government worker, a son of a farmer and a young 14-year-old cricketer who used to be locally addressed as Virat Kohli for his batting.

All of them were killed post a deadly counter-insurgency operation that consumed three local militants and an army man in Pulwama district's Sirnoo village.

The incident has put the entire valley on the boil, as, for the third straight day Kashmir remained shut to mourn what the former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah termed as a ""massacre"".

Aqib Ahmad Bhat, 14

The youngest of the lot, 14-year-old Aqib Ahmad Bhat was one among the hundreds who had marched towards the gunfight site in a bid to 'rescue' the 'armed brethren'.

After falling prey to the Indian armed forces' bullet-spree, he was brought dead to a hospital in Srinagar. For very long, he remained unidentified, until his aged father stumbled upon Aqib's dead body and wailed: ""He is my son!""

Passionate about cricket, he was locally addressed as Virat Kohli for his batting technique. Three days before he was killed, Aqib had scored an unbeaten 75 runs in a local match. The deceased teenager is now survived by two siblings, mother, and a labourer father.

A bullet in his head claimed the 14-year-old's life.

Suhail Rasheed, 15

Son of a mentally-unsound farmer, Suhail, too, was one among the crowd, who was present near the gunfight site. He had recently passed class 9 and was admitted to the tenth standard. A vivid anti-India protestor, Suhail was picked up during a late night raid this year's summer, beaten up and was kept in a custody for a couple of days.

The season changed, and on one chilly winter morning, he was shot in the head by the Army. He died on the spot.

Liyaqat Majeed Dar, 17

Liyaqat had just completed his class 11 and on the day of the incident, had left his home to pay the admission fee for the twelfth class, but, could not. While returning back, he along with his student friends marched towards the gunfight site, only to become a victim of the army bullets.

When the army opened fire, reports say, Liyaqat was running away when he got shot in the back of his head.

He died on the spot.

Amir Ahmad Palla, 18

Reportedly the first civilian to fall prey to the army firing, Amir was the sole breadwinner for his family at the age of 18. He had to drop out of the school because of poverty, and was working at a Pollution Checking Centre.

A resident of Ashmandar village, which is not far away from the spot of the gunfight site where he breathed his last, Amir leaves behind two sisters, a younger brother, and ailing parents.

Shahbaz Ahmad Najar, 19

Shahbaz was reportedly killed in his neighbour's courtyard when a bullet indiscriminately shot by the army pierced his head. Shahbaz, a BA first year student, was with his family when he encountered death.

A resident of Monghama village, he used to work as a part-time mechanic to financially support his family. His father is a carpenter by profession.

Shahbaz has left behind his parents and two brothers, of which, one is handicapped.

Abid Hussain Lone, 28

Abid's is one of the most tragic stories. He has left behind a three-month-old daughter after recently getting married to an Indonesian woman. A management graduate, Abid had just recently moved to his hometown along with his family.

As per reports, Abid was almost half a kilometer from the gunfight area when a bullet hit the left side of his face that bore through his throat and exited from the neck.

""I had heard Kashmir is a heaven on earth,"" Firstpost quoted Abid's wife as saying. If only she knew how routinely it burns.

Touseef Ahmad Mir, 29

Touseef, was shot when he was rescuing a fellow local who had been hit by a bullet. The bullet-victim survived, but in that process, Touseef lost his life. A resident of Urichursoo, Touseef was his father's only son, among five daughters. He was married and had two kids.

Reports say Mir had gone to a local milkman with his surplus milk for sale. While returning, he joined a group of locals in an auto that was moving towards the gunfight site.

He was shot dead on the spot.

La-I-Matti War Nongbri, Student, Globsyn Business School, who will soon be joining the corporate world as a young manager, said, ""I came from the city of Shillong and never really had much confidence in myself. I was never a topper in my class but believed that I can achieve my dreams through dedication and hard work. It is through my dedication and belief in my abilities that I got placed in one of the fastest growing industries. I would like to thank GBS for giving me this opportunity and molding me into the person that I am today. And, I am also happy to see my batchmates going through the same journey.""

Earlier this year, Globsyn Business School was conferred with the esteemed Education Excellence Awards 2018 for 'Best B-School in Placements' by ASSOCHAM (Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry of India). This award, which was lauded by the Hon'ble Governor of West Bengal, Shri Keshri Nath Tripathi, coupled with the soaring placement season this year, reaffirms that Globsyn Business School, beyond being the B-School of choice for the student community and their parents, is also the B-School of choice in Eastern India for the corporate community.

Hi Todd, what is your background, and what is included in your current role at Universal?

I grew up in the media monitoring industry as my father had purchased a press-clipping bureau in 1959. I started developing broadcast monitoring solutions in 1983 while in junior high school.

I attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I majored in Communications and minored in Psychology. I didn't plan to come back to the company business, but I saw an opportunity related to data mining and retrieving information from content databases, aggregators.

I came back in 1991, and started developing solutions for TV, radio and Internet monitoring and measurement; Internet monitoring turned into web monitoring in the late 90's. I have seen a lot of growth from our company and had a lot of fun creating new solutions for our clients. Although I bought the company from my father a few years ago, he is still involved with our work. I am the CEO, but Jim Murphy retains the President's title. He still comes in to work every day!

As CEO, I tell most people my current role mostly involves knocking down hurdles for my team. Removing hurdles lets my team move more quickly. I also focus on research and development of new services for our clients, as well as developing strategic partnerships and opportunities.

What differs Universal from other media intelligence companies?

Our two main competitive advantages are content and accuracy. We are the only ones that are comprehensively tracking all media types and using valid analysis methods to create highly reliable measurement data.

In contrast to software as a service vendors (SaaS), we get all the newspapers articles, TV and a large cross section of radio across the country. Along with the traditional media, we're also monitoring web and social content. Together this makes us unique because we have the ability to track all the content, and not just a portion of it, then analyze the full sample as needed.

Our analysis team can go in and look at the resulting data and then pull true insights out of it. Our approach follows a methodology that is accurate and replicable. In this way we avoid semantic errors, like those found with automated sentiment analysis, and we can deliver much more reliable insights.

What are your greatest challenges ahead at Universal when it comes to serving your customers and developing your offer?

Our biggest challenge has been re-educating customers coming from our competitors. Over the last 4-5 years, we have had to ""re-program"" customers who have used other services because they have often been mislead about what ""complete coverage"" means, or what ""real PR measurement"" includes. Automated measurement tools are very inaccurate. We let our technology do much of the heavy lifting, then our trained analysts provide the reasoned insight needed to fulfill an exacting order.

We have to tell them what it really means -- TV monitoring isn't only monitoring a TV station's website, but actually monitoring what's broadcast in addition to the website.

Earlier this year, you released Alpha Clips, a service that tracks article origin of shared news stories. How does that service work, and how have your customers received it?

Alpha Clips identifies the first point of entry for a story, where and how it broke. It tracks feeds from press clipping content and web content on a 24-hour cycle. We can show our subscribers the story's true origin, and whether it was published or digital.

We are able to pull that information into our system, and, based on timing, identify which story was released first, thus identifying the alpha clip.

For example, if Los Angeles Times released a story to commonly owned outlets, it could appear in dozens of newspapers across the country. Our software will identify it as the same story, and the alpha clip will label it as a +1 or +30 (depending on the quantity of outlets that ran the story). This reduces the text our clients have to read because artificial intelligence uses journalistic rules to pull out the key elements of the story.

The benefits of Alpha Clips is the ability to show the origin of the story, save customers time by summarizing it and reducing content volume our PR and corporate clients have to go through by clustering the same story rather than identifying it as a series of repeated stories in a report.

Have you recently, or do you plan to, release any new technology-based solutions that will add to or improve services for your clients? If so, what solutions, and how will your customers benefit from them?

This January, we plan to take a big step in relation to our media measurement services. We have created a more interactive and dynamic process for our customers when it comes to the graphics and insights we offer them.

While I was at the international congress in Copenhagen, FIBEP, I realized that being able to provide our users with more support should be our focus for 2019. In line with that, we're going to offer additional consultative services with our services. We will provide our customers with strategic insights that will help them move their outcomes in a positive direction in relation to their goals.

We're not going to offer PR strategy, but we will suggest what customers can do to improve their outcomes based on what we know and can show them.

All clients have different levels of understanding how media can be analyzed; what is the most common misconception that your clients have?

What are valid results?

What is reliable data?

Clients who came from a software as a service (SaaS) environment that didn't provide a lot of support, but shifted the work to the customer, have the biggest misconceptions about those questions.

Those customers often aren't prepared to structure a focused search strategy or objectively look at data results according to a sound methodology. They may have invested a lot of personal time and money into a campaign, and subconsciously be ""looking"" for outcomes that may not exist.

We try to deprogram them, if you will. We provide our clients with complete transparency of our methodology and earned media results. We want our clients to see how we arrived at their insights, rather than hide them behind server code.

With the experience you have in this industry, being with Universal for 27 years, what changes have been the most unexpected over the years?

It's been most surprising to see the largest organizations moving away from a model that focuses on customer service and support. That has been to our benefit, which is where all our growth comes from these days.

Customers have always needed support because they're busy and shifting work to them makes their jobs even harder. Why haven't my peers used technology to make information more easily consumed? That is what we focus on.

With your great experience, is there a specific mouthwatering case that you know of where media intelligence has played a crucial role for a client? If so, what case was that?

I'd like to think everything -- without mentioning specific clients, certain crisis management clients that would involve mass shooting situations in public places have benefited from our services. We have been able to assist them in real time by tracking and reporting the way news is shared and delivered so that our clients can understand if the media is getting facts out correctly.

We have also helped school districts avoid hiring a new superintendent who should never have been around children. We uncovered media exposure that indicated that the candidate wasn't a good choice for the position. This information was only found due to media intelligence services -- because the person was never prosecuted, a criminal background wouldn't reveal this information. We saved the district a possible PR nightmare and prevented them from wasting a lot money.

Currently, copyright and licensing for data used for monitoring differs depending on the region and type of media. How do you see changes regarding copyright as affecting the data that is used for media monitoring in the future?

I'm optimistic that in the U.S. we still have the opportunity to do it right. Globally, we have examples all along the continuum -- from dysfunctional to fully functional.

The difference in the U.S. is that we have so many more media outlets that it makes it cumbersome. There is opportunity for us to do it right because we haven't done anything comprehensively, yet we have the chance to.

Content owners and users have to be amicable with each other because they're in the same boat. There is not one media outlet so valuable that they can charge high licensing fees, because now clients can just get their content elsewhere.

A more common playing field is good; and opportunity to get comprehensive copyright licensing solution for the U.S. is possible. I am optimistic the U.S. can do it right.

When it comes to the actual data behind the media intelligence you do, what kind of data or media not currently used for media intelligence can be interesting in the future?

All types of data. We're in the early stages of working with previously ignored data to overlay with media intelligence and measurement tools, creating better predictions and outcomes, such as:

● demographic data

● psychographic data

● financial data

● weather statistics

● event and crowd metrics

● behavioral modeling

How do you think the media intelligence industry will change in the next 5 years, and what are the greatest challenges ahead?

Those that focus on providing highly comprehensive and reliable data will excel. Those that are only sampling a small portion of content or those who are solely relying on software as a service will compete at the bottom for low priced clients who may not care how accurate the information is.

Those who can't afford to miss a story or put an incorrect chart in front of their CEO are my clients, and where the growth is."

Veteran Congress leader Kamal Nath on Monday took oath as the 18th Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh in the presence of several UPA leaders, including Congress president Rahul Gandhi, at the Jamboree Maidan in Bhopal.

Nath took the oath of office at 1:30 pm and the ceremony was preceded by an all-religion prayer meeting. BSP chief Mayawati and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, whose parties have extended support to the Congress government, were conspicuous by their absence.

Kamal Nath was ex-minister of Urban Development. He is one of the longest-serving and senior most members of Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament).

Nath represents the Chhindwara constituency of Madhya Pradesh. Interestingly, nine times, he has been elected from this constituency.

In May 2018, to lead the party in the upcoming assembly election, he was elected as the president of Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee. In 1980, he was first elected to the 7th Lok Sabha. In 1985, he was re-elected to the 8th Lok Sabha, in 1989 to the 9th Lok Sabha and in 1991 to the 10th Lok Sabha.

In June 1991, he was made Minister of Environment & Forests. He also served as union minister of State, Textiles (Independent Charge) in 1995. He has close ties with the Nehru-Gandhi family.

Pilot, 41, who took oath on Monday as Deputy Chief Minister of the state, was appointed Rajasthan Congress chief in 2014 to revive the party in the state after it suffered its worst defeat managing only 21 seats in the 200-member Assembly.

He worked meticulously over the last nearly five years in cooperation with senior state leaders to ensure that the Bharatiya Janata Party is voted out of power.

But the verdict was not entirely to the satisfaction of the Congress as the party fell two seats short of the majority.

It was the nature of the verdict, with the Congress dependent on a bit of external support, that perhaps prompted party President Rahul Gandhi to choose Ashok Gehlot over Pilot in the leadership sweepstakes.

But Pilot staked his claim strongly and the power sharing formula was worked out after prolonged discussions extending over three days with both the leaders staying put in Delhi to convey their views.

During the campaign, Pilot highlighted the ""agrarian distress"" and unemployment as key issues as he also sought to harp on the anti-incumbency against the Vasundhara Raje government.

The big challenge now before Pilot and Gehlot is to deliver the state to the party in the Lok Sabha polls that is five months away.

That will call for coordinated efforts in governance and early fulfilment of key promises.

The BJP's better-than-expected performance shows that it is capable of bouncing back in the Lok Sabha polls and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to run an intensive campaign.

Son of former Union Minister Rajesh Pilot, Sachin is a prominent next-generation leader, who has an easy connect with people and is approachable and affable.

The Congress will require a sizeable backing from the youth for winning the Lok Sabha polls and as such younger leaders such as Pilot are likely to be in the forefront of the party's poll effort.

Pilot has multiple interests, including aviation, and received his private pilot's license (PPL) in 1995. He is also a keen sportsman and has been commissioned as a Lieutenant in the Territorial Army.

Born on September 7, 1977, he studied at St. Stephen's College (University of Delhi) and later pursued MBA from Wharton Business School in the US, where he specialised in multinational management and finance.

At 26, he was the youngest member of Parliament when he first got elected to the 14th Lok Sabha from Dausa in 2004.

Upon his re-election to Lok Sabha in 2009 from Ajmer, he was appointed Minister of State (MoS) for Communication and Information Technology and sought to bridge the technology gap between rural and urban areas.

In 2012, he became Minister of State (Independent charge) of Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Pilot was selected as one of the Young Global Leaders by the World Economic Forum in 2008.

Pilot is married to Sara, daughter of former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah.

Moreover, conjugate vaccines association a weak antigen with a strong antigen so that the immune system has a stronger response to the weak antigen. Vaccines are used to avert diseases by appealing an immune response to an antigen, the foreign part of a bacteria or virus that the immune system distinguishes. The conjugate vaccine is frequently proficient with a diminished or dead version of a pathogenic bacterium or virus in the vaccine so that the immune system can distinguish the antigen later in life. Whereas, as many of the vaccines encompass a single antigen that the body will identify. In addition, the key players of this region are playing an effective role by doing significant developments in the technology and acquiring the huge market share which further becomes profitable for leading the fastest growth in the forecasted period.

According to the report analysis, 'China Conjugate Vaccine Market (2018-2023)' states that some of the major companies which are recently functioning in this market more actively for leading the handsome amount of share by doing significant development in the treatment of doing vaccines with the effective technologies includes GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co., Novartis, Sanofi Pasteur, CSL Limited, Bharat Biotech, Biological E. Limited, Serum Institute of China and several others. Moreover, all Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines (includes polio, tuberculosis and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), meningococcal, rubella, mumps, Japanese encephalitis, and hepatitis A and B) in China are free and mandatory for school admissions. In China, the immunization clinic also offers non-EPI vaccines to children but for a fee (and are not covered by insurance programs), concerning influenza, Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib), varicella, pneumococcal vaccines, varicella and rotavirus, and several others.

On the basis of disease indication, the market is split into Meningococcal, Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, Pneumococcal, Haemophilus influenza type B and several others. Not only has this, with the end user phase the market is segmented into Adult and Paediatric. Whereas, China is predicted to be an effective market for conjugate vaccines during the near future. Extensively increasing geriatric population, growth in consumer awareness, rising disposable income and healthcare expenditure, modernization of healthcare infrastructure and a rising medical tourism industry will operate the growth of the conjugated vaccines market in China. According to the United Nations, China is aging more speedily than almost any country in the present history. For adult vaccines, this acts as a key driver, due to more requirements by the geriatric populace. Since the toll of pneumococcal disease in China in massive, pneumococcal vaccination could develop children's health and protect lives and is, therefore, a prime selection for attachment in the EPI schedule. The conjugate vaccine market in China is predicted to have significantly high growth. Moreover, this region spent marvelous resources on the eradication of measles, but such eradication efforts should be collected with other immunization initiatives, such as educating caregivers about the benefits of other vaccines. In addition, it is expected that the market of conjugate vaccine in China will increase more actively in the near future.

He has been in custody since 2012.

A top court in Pakistan had given the federal government one month to complete all formalities required to deport Ansari, after he completes his 3-year jail term in the country, on Saturday, 15 December.

It's been six years since Mumbai resident, Ansari, was caught with a fake Pakistani ID in his pocket in Kohat, a town near Peshawar. He had travelled to Kohat, Peshawar ""illegally"" in order to find and rescue the woman he loved, from being forcefully married to someone else. On being caught, a military court in Pakistan had found him guilty of espionage and convicted him for allegedly being an Indian spy.

A day ahead of his three-year jail term completion, Ansari's lawyer, Qazi Muhammad Anwar, informed the bench that despite it being the end of his term, the Ministry of Interior and prison authorities had been completely silent about his release and deportation to India, PTI reported.

Speaking to The Quint, Fauzia Ansari, Hamid's mother, expressed her helplessness in the situation.

We've tried everything we could, now we are waiting for the one month (designated to completing the paperwork for his deportation to India) is completed and he can come home.Fauzia Ansari, Hamid Nehal Ansari's Mother

As the Ansari family waits for their prodigal son to return home after six long years, here's a look back at his story of a cross-border love that led him to a Pakistan jail.

From Versova to Peshawar

Ansari was 27 when he left home for Kohat in Pakistan. With a degree in engineering and an MBA, Ansari was reportedly working as a management teacher for the education of Afghan Students when he was caught and taken away by the Pakistani authorities in 2012, according to Fauzia in a Facebook post.

Ansari lived with his parents- Fauzia and Nehal- in a rented apartment in Versova in Mumbai. Fauzia is a teacher at a school in Mumbai, and Nehal is a banker.

In an earlier interaction with The Quint, Fauzia had said that Hamid had left for Kabul on 4 November, 2012, on the pretext of having received a job as an airport manager in Afghanistan. Although his parents had advised him against the move, fearing for his safety, he had not relented.

He was in constant contact with his parents everyday for the next few days, until 10 November. He told them that he would return back to Mumbai in two days. But right after this, Ansari went missing, which we now know, is because he had been picked up by Pakistani authorities.

But what was the real reason behind Ansari's decision to visit Kabul? In an investigative piece by Scroll, Ansari's parents said that after he had gone missing, they logged in to his Facebook account and checked his emails. They found out that he had been talking to a Pakistani woman for two years, and seemed to be in love with her.

But the woman's sister had reportedly gone and ratted out Ansari's affair to her parents.

What Made Ansari Illegally Cross the Border?

The woman's father announced that she would immediately be married to someone else in Pakistan, and the woman, now desperate, allegedly asked Ansari to come and rescue her from her fate.

I found several of Hamid's conversations on Facebook after he went missing. The girl was desperate; she wanted to be rescued, and I could see that that the desperation had built in Hamid too. (sic)Fauzia Ansari, in conversation with The Quint

Ansari began to plan. He wasn't able to contact the woman he loved, so he managed to track down another woman in Kohat. Ansari asked her to find out what was happening with the woman. But she couldn't.

He also reportedly wrote several letters to the Pakistan High Commission and even requested Mumbai-based activist Jatin Desai of the Pakistan-India People's Forum for Peace and Democracy, for his help. Neither option worked.

He was then advised by friends he had made online to travel to Kabul, and then infiltrate into Pakistan. He was informed that the Pakistan-Afghanistan border did not have any serious checking and his friends told him that they would help him with a fake Pakistani ID.

Who Caught Hamid Ansari?

Ansari had reportedly managed to sneak into Kohat, according to reports of the incident in Scroll.in. Later it was found that on the day Ansari had gone missing, he had checked into a hotel in Kohat under a fake name and had been arrested by the police within an hour of his check-in. This information was unearthed by a Pakistan-based journalist named Zeenat, who had reached out to Fauzia for information on Ansari

Zeenat later found out that Ansari was then placed in the custody of the Pakistani military and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), who had accused him of being an ""Indian Spy"" and locked him up, Fauzia had told The Quint.

When Ansari's parents learnt of his arrest, fourteen months after it took place, they moved pillar to post to seek legal help and finally crossed paths with Qazi Muhammad Anwar, a renowned lawyer in Pakistan. Anwar helped file their habeas corpus petition, in the Peshawar high court.

Anwar had also said that the Lahore High Court had been informed that Ansari faced a court-martial on unspecified charges. The battle in the court has been ongoing since.

We're Helpless at This Point: Fauzia Ansari

Speaking to The Quint, a day ahead of the official end of Ansari's jail-term, Fauzia said that her family had hoped that the Pakistan court wouldn't agree to the one-month extension of Ansari's detention in jail, as recommended by the Interior Ministry of Pakistan.

""But, we're helpless at this point...all the communication is happening through our lawyer and I know that this (one-month extension) was also questioned, but they (the court) are saying they are following procedures.""Fauzia Ansari to The Quint

Speaking about how she has not seen her son since he first left Mumbai to travel to Kabul, Fauzia said that she had tried extremely hard for the first few years to secure a Pakistan visa, so she could meet him.

However, she realised that this wasn't a possibility, and instead, focused all her energies on communicating with the necessary court of law. Fauzia also said that the Ministry of External Affairs had done a lot of work on the case, on the behalf of their family.

""Our government has asked the Pakistan government, at least 95 different times for consular access (to Ansari).""Fauzia Ansari to The Quint

In November, 2017, Minister of External Affairs, Sushma Swaraj had said that the MEA had made 52 requests to Pakistan for consular access to Ansari.

Looking forward, Fauzia is hopeful of seeing her son again soon. She says,

Last month we were in Delhi, and we met with several MEO officials, who have assured us that as soon as the paperwork for his deportation is drawn up from Pakistan government, there won't be any delay from the Ministry's side to get him back home.

Louisiana law already prohibits the hiring and retention of a person convicted of, or who has pleaded no contest to, a crime which falls within La. R.S. 15:587.1(C) which, in turn, covers various crimes including, but not necessarily limited to, first degree murder, second degree murder, manslaughter, various sex crimes, kidnapping, criminal neglect of family, contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile, cruelty to juveniles, and child desertion. The sex crimes include, but are not limited to, rape, female genital mutilation, prostitution, pandering, carnal knowledge, ""crime against nature,"" voyeurism, and obscenity.

Act 634 adds to existing law to prohibit hiring any person as a teacher who submits fraudulent documentation to the Louisiana Department of Education or Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) as part of an application for a teaching certificate or other teaching authorization, even if that individual neither was convicted of nor entered a no contest plea for a crime listed under La. R.S.15:587.1(C). Act 634 also adds a prohibition on hiring a teacher who has been found to have facilitated cheating on any state assessment. A school board or non-public school, however, may hire a teacher who has been found to have submitted fraudulent documentation or facilitated cheating if the BESE approves a formal appeal request.

Act 634 also adds to existing law by allowing BESE to assess a civil fine against a school governing authority that knowingly employs a teacher in violation of either the pre-existing law or Act 634. Act 634 sets the civil fine at an amount equal to the average state yearly compensation for a public school teacher, inclusive of salary and benefits.

Act 634 became effective on July 1, 2018.

SB 209: This state senate bill would provide additional protections to workers facing massive layoffs. The legislature has not passed the bill.

SB 209, the ""Louisiana Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act"" or the ""Louisiana WARN Act,"" would require ""large corporations"" to warn employees of impending ""mass layoffs.""

The Louisiana WARN Act would not supersede the federal WARN Act of 1988, which applies to employers who employ 100 or more employees. The Louisiana WARN Act would apply to companies who employ between 50 and 99 employees.

The Louisiana WARN Act defines ""mass layoffs"" as the closure of a workplace (or portion thereof), modernization of a workplace (or portion thereof), relocation of a workplace (of portion thereof), or implementation or any management policy, in which the employer permanently reduces the number of employees by 50 or more during any 90-day period.

SB 209 would require the employer to refrain from a mass layoff until 60 days after the employer serves written notice of the layoff to each of the following: affected employees, the executive director of the Louisiana Workforce Commission (LWC), members of the state Senate who represent the parish (i.e. county) in which the workplace is located, members of the state House of Representatives who represent the parish in which the workplace is located, and the president of the parish-governing authority.

SB 209 would provide for limited exceptions to the 60-day notice period, such as mass layoffs due to natural disasters (such as a flood), disputes between labor unions and employers, layoffs at a construction site or other temporary workplace, layoffs that are the result of seasonal factors, layoffs which occur as a result of the completion of a particular project or undertaking where the affected employees were hired with the understanding that their employment was limited to the duration of the project or undertaking, or business circumstances not reasonably foreseeable at the time SB 209 would have required notice.

An employer violating the Louisiana WARN Act would face liability for lost wages and health benefits, as well as reasonable attorney's fees and costs, but SB 209 limits damages to a maximum of 60 days.

SB 209 is still in the Senate.

HB 126: The FLSA already requires that an employer shall compensate a tipped employee at a rate of $2.13 per hour, and if the employee fails to earn sufficient tips to bring his or her hourly earnings to the federal minimum wage rate, the employer shall pay the difference to ensure that the employee earns at least the federal minimum wage. HB 126 would create a state minimum wage rate for tipped employees and set it at the rate set by the FLSA. HB 126 would define a tipped employee as an employee who regularly earns at least $30 per month in tips.

HB 126 is still pending in the House Committee on Labor and Industrial Relations.

HB 605: Louisiana requires that women employed as public employees be entitled to the same compensation as men employed as public employees. HB 605 would extend the equal pay requirement to all persons employed in the state of Louisiana. HB 605 would also allow an aggrieved person to file suit in any district court of competent jurisdiction. Currently, since the state equal pay protection law applies only to state employees, an aggrieved employee must file suit in the Baton Rouge-based 19th Judicial District Court. An aggrieved individual must first file a complaint with the Louisiana Human Rights Commission.

In April 2018, the Louisiana House Labor & Industrial Relations Committee members voted 7-4 to involuntarily defer HB 605. An involuntarily deferred instrument may be rescheduled for a committee hearing only by motion adopted by the vote of two-thirds of the committee members present and voting. The author of HB605 vowed to continue to bring similar bills to address pay disparities between men and women.

HB 790: Currently, Louisiana law only provides for workers' compensation benefits for hearing loss when the loss is sustained in a single traumatic accident. HB 790 would delete the requirement that any hearing loss suffered must have been the result of a single traumatic accident in order to recover workers' compensation benefits.

HB 790 is still pending."

As India's development sector matures, it is increasingly getting professionalised. Leading to an increasing requirement for personnel trained and armed with the right academics, aptitude and skill set. A number of significant indicators point in this direction.

One, the organisational structure and managerial roles in non-profit organisations are getting specialised. Where talent is increasingly being sought out for roles ranging from strategy, communications, fundraising, CEOs office, managing M&E, programme leadership, CSR partnerships and COO responsibilities.

The social sector is rapidly evolving as one of the primary career destination and is moving beyond the traditional roles of volunteering or field jobs. This is a far cry from the days when organisations had more of general management roles. The narrative has become more specialised and specific to the challenges, limitations and essentials of the job description.

Second, people in the age group from 25 to 40 years are turning to the development sector for a meaningful career leading to purpose in their lives. Millennials who have just begun or are beginning their careers are opting for a career in the development sector. In the past, much of the roles in non-profits were filled up by those in the senior age of retired career brackets. That is fast changing. So much so, that talent experts suggest that recruitments in the development space are giving a run for their money to those opportunities in corporates especially the ones in the IT sector. This is, for example, borne out by the fact that ISDM (Indian School of Development Management) recently set a benchmark for placements in social sector with 90+ reputed development organizations and corporates coming to the campus to attract their first batch of 57 students. The students were offered at par or in some cases better packages than what are being offered to engineering students otherwise.

Third, with increase in funding to the social sector from newer avenues like CSR, there is a huge demand for a new generation of enthusiastic leaders and managers who can help the social sector deliver sustainable social impact at scale. The sector is offering challenges to those who are looking to build their lives working on improving the most complex social issues facing our nation. People who are passionate about these issues yet practical and innovative in providing solutions. Who can channel the available resources in the most efficient and effective manner. The sector promises a career full of substance.

The landscape of the social sector in India is widening with development organisations emerging as domestic and international NGOs, social foundations, CSR/Corporate foundations, social enterprises, social consulting organisations, funders, ecosystem creators and research organisations. Some of the leading ones in India include Central Square Foundation, Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiative, Actionaid, Samagra Development Associates, Wadhwani Foundation, Ashoka Innovators, PATH, Charities Aid Foundation etc to name a few. This has created varied opportunities for people who seek a holistic career which provides professional and personal growth along with financial stability.

Keeping the future in mind, the development sector needs leaders who can build world-class social organisations in India based on an intricate understanding of this space. It also needs a much large number of thinking and well-rounded youth to invest their time in solving some of the most challenging problems facing humanity.

Today career in social sector is no more restricted to just social science graduates. With the rise of development Management courses, surprisingly students from Science, Arts, Engineering and other backgrounds are joining the league of tomorrow's leaders and managers nurtured just for the social sector. The drive to join a meaningful and purpose driven career is leading youth to look beyond MBA and glamorous corporate sector jobs. Social sector career has moved from charity to rewards. Also a growing number of successful social entrepreneurs and impact investing is now challenging the conventional belief and method of making a career in the development space. Impact investors are investing heavily in workforce development and technology to transform social enterprises and ideas into established organizations for a larger impact.

But despite the positivism around the sector, all is not hunky dory. In a number of non-profits in India and overseas, there have been challenges of governance, ethics and leadership. Further, in many countries across the world, social sector organisations have come under the scrutiny and pressure of the respective governments. So, while the younger millennials turn to the non-profit sector where the basics of management can be imparted to them, leadership training at the senior levels are also the need of the hour.

So, while increasing numbers of professionals opt for a career in non-profits that brings more meaning and purpose to their lives, they also have to understand that it will not be a bed of roses. Only those who have the will to dive in deep and keep kicking their way ahead can be successful."

The row was sparked when one student shared the chicken sandwich with other students, who were vegetarian, during the recess. Other classmates started being harsh to the student, who claimed that he did not know that some classmates are vegetarian, Times of India reported.

As the matter became big and parents intervened, the school authorities had issued a notice asking students not to share non-vegetarian food with other students. Although the school has managed to resolve the issue with peace, but vegetarian versus non-vegetarian remains the basic problem with most of the school, forcing many of them imposing guidelines on food.

Earlier, a school in Hyderabad has come under criticism after it issued a diktat banning a variety of food including rice and eggs to non-vegetarian food. The diktat issued by Maheshwari Vidyalaya said that students are not allowed to bring noodles, eggs, non-vegetarian and even curries made with garlic and onion. After facing the heavy criticism by parents, the school authorities said that the dietary regulations have complied with the management's religious sentiments as it was a 'Maheshwari community' school."

The favourable signals were there from the party's earlier by-election victories in the two states. But despite the Congress's latest success, what must be worrying for the party is that it missed losing by a hair's breadth, given how close the voting percentages were for the two contenders - 39.3 per cent for the Congress in Rajasthan against 38.8 for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and 40.9 per cent in Madhya Pradesh for the Congress against the BJP's 41.

What this means for the Congress is that it doesn't have a moment to lose to show that it can provide better governance than its predecessor. There is no time for the party to bask in the glory of having risen like a Phoenix from the ashes of the 2014 drubbing. It has to hit the ground running, as the phrase goes.

It will not do for the Congress to bank only on populist measure like loan waivers for farmers which are frowned upon by economists as sops which ultimately help neither the farmers nor the agricultural economy. The loan waivers are in line with Sonia Gandhi's favourite rural employment scheme of the Manmohan Singh government which was of no help to the party in 2014.

Nor will the pursuit of a ""soft"" Hindutva line to project the Congress as a BJP minus the gau rakshaks be of any help. Instead, the party will have to take definitive steps to demonstrate that it means business in dealing with agrarian distress and unemployment - the two main factors which brought about the BJP's downfall.

Neither of the two steps will be easy for a state government, especially when there is an unfriendly regime at the centre, waiting to see how it fumbles. But an emphasis on irrigation and on groundwater and surface water management can underline the state government's serious intent.

An expansion of the formal credit facilities can also reduce the dependence of the farmers on rapacious money-lenders, as can efforts to ensure that the routine subsidies are not misappropriated by the richer farmers.

Similarly, joblessness can be partly alleviated by helping in the growth of small and medium businesses in states which haven't yet been able to shed the damaging BIMARU tag of being ""sick"" where the social and economic indicators are concerned.

But, in addition to such initiatives which are within the capabilities of the state governments, it is time that the Congress at the national level outlines its broad economic vision, which has been hazy so far as was evident from Rahul Gandhi's reluctance to specify what he means when he talks of supporting farmers, creating jobs and extending health care, as he did at the London School of Economics last summer.

The Congress and its president will have to realise that such generalities no longer pay political dividends. The voters, especially the youth, are interested in specifics, including the spelling out of targets.

Since the problem with the Congress is that it has been unable to make up its mind between populist and pro-market policies, it appears to be suspended in midair where economics is concerned with no one knowing what to expect from a Congress government - a return to Manmohan Singh's economic reforms or to Sonia Gandhi's focus on freebees.

So far, the Congress governments in Punjab and Karnataka have been run-of-the-mill ones with little to show them as result-oriented, especially in the matter of bolstering the economy.

But, now that three more states have come under the party's aegis, there has to be greater focus in its policies instead of a recourse to homilies.

For Rahul Gandhi, the unambiguous projection of an economic direction in the run-up to the next general election will be a bigger test than containing the Congress' age-old malady of internal factionalism dating to the Tilak-Gokhale split of 1907.

If Narendra Modi is perceived to be faltering, it is because he tried to tackle the country's economic ills with patchwork repairs like opening myriad bank accounts, providing direct cash transfers for cooking gas cylinders, extending rural electrification and undertaking faster highway construction. But he failed in carrying out what are called ""big bang"" reforms to rejuvenate the economy, which was the expectation behind his 2014 success.

If Rahul Gandhi, too, is found to be following in the BJP's footsteps not only in pursuing ""soft"" Hindutva, but also in the economic field, the unforgiving people of India, who are increasingly becoming impatient for quick results, will have no hesitation in dumping the Congress.

The Congress president's problem is that he will have carry with him his allies in the mahagathbandhan - if and when the grand alliance is formed - and so he cannot make unilateral announcements on key issues.

But he must remember that the eagerness with which many of them court foreign investors shows that the earlier aversion of the average politician to capitalism is dying out.

Rahul Gandhi will have to state whether he shares their views or still considers himself to be a foot soldier of the Niyamgiri tribals of Odisha who ensured the eviction of investors from their sacred hills.

The company is hiring for its newly inaugurated Gurgaon office.

Like a typical startup, AglaSem EduTech Pvt Ltd had a humble beginning. From a small rented room occupied by 4 people, today the company is a creative ground for 80 young people who are full of ideas and passionate about what they do. The company has opened its doors wide to hire 200 Graduate Freshers in various teams.

The new office of aglasem.com is in Gurgaon Sector 30, on NH 8. ""We were operating in Delhi for some years, when on the suggestion of a close friend, we decided to open a corporate office in Gurgaon. It was one of our best decisions!"", AglaSem co-founder Anand says. He adds, ""The corporate culture in this place is very conducive to building a team, which we are focused on right now. Metro connectivity, safety for employees, were our top priorities when we zeroed in on this location last year when we started operations in Gurgaon.""

Today the company works primarily from Gurgaon and it recently moved to a larger office to accommodate the growing team and make room for more team members which the HR department is aggressively trying to bring on board.

As soon as one steps into the office, the energy in the air is noticeable. Most of the team members are quite young. However, senior members and leaders are spread across and can be seen mentoring one on one.

While there is a palpable buzz of activities at the workstations, meeting rooms, conference, some members can be seen chilling in the cafeteria or sparring over ideas in the brainstorming room. The YouTube room also has an ongoing shooting.

Expanding team in ongoing projects, and to launch new projects they have in the pipeline, AglaSem is hiring 200 Graduate Freshers for aglasem.com. The teams in which candidates are invited to apply are Content Writing (English), Content Writing (Hindi), YouTube Specialists, Software Engineers.

The company encourages such candidates to apply who enjoy working in the respective fields. Candidates can send either apply through Naukri.com under AglaSem Recruitment or send their CVs with a short email to hr@aglasem.com.

""We are looking for passionate youngsters who wish to learn and grow in their career. They should be actually interested in that work. For example, a content writer should enjoy writing and a software engineer should enjoy coding,"" said Shivani Dagar who is handling Talent Acquisition at AglaSem. Candidates with graduation from any stream are welcome. She adds, ""All degrees (streams) are treated equally. However, internships do play an important role."" A quick peek at her day planner shows that there are more than a dozen interviews scheduled that day.

The selection process consists of three rounds. First is a written test which depends on the position applied for. Then is the HR round which is a PI. Third is a final personal interview. All the rounds help the company understand the candidate better and vice versa. Arunima who leads the content team at AglaSem throws some light on what she looks for in her team members. ""I always ask them these questions; Do you write for yourself? Do you read? Why do you want to be a writer in the education sector? It is very important that the person has a flair for writing.""

While the company has long been content focused, with 'Updated, Authentic, Free' being its motto, they have recently created a tech team. Led by Nikhil who has an industry experience of 7 years, the team aims to give users a better experience and provide useful tools, apps, models for them. Within a month of inception, the team has launched an AglaSem Mock Test platform which already has 50000 registered users. Enthusiastic developers are welcome in their team.

The management is focused upon team building and they understand it is a slow-and-steady task. Learning is an ongoing process for team members at all levels. The immediate goals of this process are to ensure that all team members have good learning opportunities, room for growth within the company, security and stability, and challenges at regular intervals for steady growth at all levels.

While many job seekers who come for interview research about the company, one of the most frequently asked questions is about what does AglaSem do. To answer it, here is a brief overview.

There are two aspects of education and career covered by the company; information and resources. There are over 1000 exams in India, including those taken by school students, entrance exams, government job exams. Say there is a student of class 10th who is about to appear for his board exams. He needs to know exam dates, when and how will he get hall ticket, and when are results. Also, he would like to appear in scholarship exams like NTSE.

So the information pertaining to these, all exams that are relevant to that student, is provided on time and accurately at AglaSem. Now the other aspect involves resources related these exams which comprise of study material, preparation tips, what books to read, and so on. Similarly, information and resources are provided to all students of class 6 to 12, students who seek admission in colleges, students who are wishing to pursue post-graduation, and candidates who are preparing for government job exams. All information and resources are provided free of cost. The motto of AglaSem is 'Updated, Authentic, Free.' (ANI-BusinessWireIndia)"

Hundreds of the company's consultants frolicked in the desert, riding camels over sand dunes and mingling in tents linked by red carpets. Meetings took place in a cavernous banquet hall that resembled a sultan's ornate court, with a sign overhead to capture the mood.

""I can't keep calm, I work at McKinsey & Company,"" it said.

Especially remarkable was the location: Kashgar, the ancient Silk Road city in China's far west that is experiencing a major humanitarian crisis.

About four miles from where the McKinsey consultants discussed their work, which includes advising some of China's most important state-owned companies, a sprawling internment camp had sprung up to hold thousands of ethnic Uighurs -- part of a vast archipelago of indoctrination camps where the Chinese government has locked up as many as one million people.

One week before the McKinsey event, a United Nations committee had denounced the mass detentions and urged China to stop.

But the political backdrop did not appear to bother the McKinsey consultants, who posted pictures on Instagram chronicling their Disney-like adventures. In fact, McKinsey's involvement with the Chinese government goes much deeper than its odd choice to showcase its presence in the country.

For a quarter-century, the company has joined many American corporations in helping stoke China's transition from an economic laggard to the world's second-largest economy. But as China's growth presents a muscular challenge to American dominance, Washington has become increasingly critical of some of Beijing's signature policies, including the ones McKinsey has helped advance.

One of McKinsey's state-owned clients has even helped build China's artificial islands in the South China Sea, a major point of military tension with the United States.

It turns out that McKinsey's role in China is just one example of its extensive -- and sometimes contentious -- work around the world, according to an investigation by The New York Times that included interviews with 40 current and former McKinsey employees, as well as dozens of their clients.

At a time when democracies and their basic values are increasingly under attack, the iconic American company has helped raise the stature of authoritarian and corrupt governments across the globe, sometimes in ways that counter American interests.

Its clients have included Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy, Turkey under the autocratic leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and corruption-plagued governments in countries like South Africa.

In Ukraine, McKinsey and Paul Manafort -- President Trump's campaign chairman, later convicted of financial fraud -- were paid by the same oligarch to help burnish the image of a disgraced presidential candidate, Viktor F. Yanukovych, recasting him as a reformer.

Once in office, Mr. Yanukovych rebuffed the West, sided with Russia and fled the country, accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. The events set off years of chaos in Ukraine and an international standoff with the Kremlin.

Inside Russia itself, McKinsey has worked with Kremlin-linked companies that have been placed under sanctions by Western governments -- companies that the firm helped build up over the years and, in some cases, continues to advise.

It has consulted in many sectors of the Russian economy, including mining, manufacturing, oil and gas, banking, transportation and agriculture. A McKinsey official sat on the Russian government's energy board. Former McKinsey consultants have gone to work in the Russian companies they once advised.

In August, VEB Bank -- which is wholly owned by the Russian state, intertwined with Russian intelligence and under United States sanctions -- hired McKinsey to develop its business strategy.

There is no indication that McKinsey has violated American sanctions, which prohibit only certain transactions with targeted companies and individuals. But the larger question is whether the company, in pursuing legitimate business opportunities abroad, is helping to shore up President Vladimir V. Putin's autocratic leadership.

Other consulting companies serve similar clients, but none have the stature to confer credibility quite like McKinsey, a confidant for 92 years to many of the world's most admired companies.

In China, it has advised at least 22 of the 100 biggest state-owned companies -- the ones carrying out some of the government's most strategic and divisive initiatives, according to a review of Chinese-language material by The Times.

While it is not unusual for American corporations to work with China's state-owned companies, McKinsey's role has sometimes put it in the middle of deeply troubled deals. In Malaysia, the company laid out the case for one of Asia's most corrupt leaders to pursue billions of dollars from China at a time when he was suspected of funneling vast sums of public money into his own pocket, drawing tens of thousands into the streets to protest against him.

McKinsey defends its work around the world, saying that it will not accept jobs at odds with the company's values. It also gives the same reason that other companies cite for working in corrupt or authoritarian nations -- that change is best achieved from the inside.

""Since 1926, McKinsey has sought to make a positive difference to the businesses and communities in which our people live and work,"" the company said in a statement.

""Tens of thousands of jobs have been created, lives improved and education provided thanks to the work we have done with our clients,"" it added.

""Like many other major corporations including our competitors, we seek to navigate a changing geopolitical environment,"" the company said, ""but we do not support or engage in political activities.""

Still, some analysts, veteran diplomats and experts on global governance see McKinsey's role in a different light.

While the United States pulls back from international cooperation and adopts a more nationalist stance, major companies like McKinsey are pursuing business in countries with little regard for human rights -- sometimes advancing, rather than curbing, the contentious tactics of America's biggest rivals.

""It is more likely they enable these regimes and likely become complicit,"" said David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state. ""They don't want to alienate regimes, or they would lose business.""

Oligarchs and Autocrats

His bona fides included two criminal convictions and a rigged election that, many assumed, had finally doomed his presidential ambitions.

So it was a bit surprising when McKinsey helped polish the battered image of Mr. Yanukovych and pitch him as something else: a forward-thinking leader with an economic vision of a better future for all Ukrainians.

McKinsey's role in resurrecting Mr. Yanukovych's political career has been lost in the clamor surrounding the conviction of Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, for secretly taking millions of dollars to help the Ukranian leader win the presidency in 2010.

But McKinsey was financed by the same oligarch who backed Mr. Manafort, and it wrote an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych wielded to disarm his critics -- before discarding much of it after becoming president.

On his 100th day in office, in a Soviet-era palace adorned with Cossack art, Mr. Yanukovych stiffly briefed the nation, laying out his economic plan. After sipping Cognac and Scotch, legislators and guests packed the hall, where the cameras conspicuously stopped on a man with a bright blue suit and a résumé that touched the lives of virtually everyone in Ukraine.

His name: Rinat Akhmetov, the country's richest oligarch. As much as anyone, he was the reason for the gathering, and he had reason to feel good.

He had rescued Mr. Yanukovych through a strategy that included hiring two very different consulting groups: Mr. Manafort, whose Russian-linked team had worked for dictators with little regard for human rights, and McKinsey, the purveyor of best practices for the world's most important corporations.

That these two disparate groups found common ground is a testament to Mr. Akhmetov's vast business empire and political skill. But for McKinsey, it underscored the risk of consulting in an unstable part of the world, where the company might be perceived as enabling autocratic or corrupt governments.

Mr. Manafort's job was twofold: to soften Mr. Yanukovych's reputation and strengthen his Russian-leaning Party of Regions, facilitating his rise to the presidency. McKinsey provided something different -- an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych could use to portray himself as a market-based reformer, tilting to the West.

To ensure that the message got through, Mr. Yanukovych and Mr. Akhmetov pointedly mentioned McKinsey in talks with American officials, according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Akhmetov assured the Americans that his candidate was ""a strong McKinsey supporter,"" while Mr. Yanukovych emphasized that he had instructed his aides ""to work directly with McKinsey experts.""

Diplomats remained wary. A respected Ukrainian journalist warned American officials that Mr. Yanukovych might ""sing a song one moment and knife someone the next.""

There were also questions about Mr. Akhmetov, who had long been suspected of links to organized crime, which he denied. One diplomat called his Party of Regions a haven for ""mobsters and oligarchs,"" noting that it might be trying to shed that image.

Mr. Akhmetov's financial ties to Mr. Manafort and McKinsey went beyond politics. He hired both to advise parts of his corporate empire, which included steel, mining, energy, finance, telecommunications, real estate, media, transportation, agriculture and soccer. He also hired former McKinsey consultants to help run his businesses, placing them in senior positions.

Mr. Akhmetov paid Mr. Manafort by wire transfers funneled through a Cypriot shell company, court records show. Other Party of Regions operatives paid Mr. Manafort through shell companies, eventually resulting in his conviction in the United States for failing to declare the money on his tax returns.

McKinsey, by contrast, was paid through a Ukrainian foundation financed by Mr. Akhmetov and run by a former McKinsey consultant now living in Moscow. Set up to promote economic reform, the foundation also sought to publicize McKinsey -- and by extension, Mr. Yanukovych.

To reach its prime audience in the United States, the foundation held two forums on the Ukrainian economy -- one at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York and the other in Washington. On the whole, McKinsey's work was well received.

But the promise of a better future didn't last long.

Within a few years, Ukraine careened toward economic collapse while Mr. Yanukovych looted the nation, living in a palatial residence surrounded by a private zoo, a golf course, a garage filled with classic cars and a private restaurant in the form of a pirate ship.

If that were not enough, he was also quietly building an enormous seaside retreat, complete with 40-foot ceilings and an indoor swimming pool, that eclipsed his presidential residence.

The capital soon turned against him. Mr. Yanukovych had long promised to tie Ukraine to the West by signing sweeping political and trade agreements with the European Union. Then he abruptly reneged, siding with Russia instead.

Protesters flooded the streets for months, chanting pro-Europe slogans. Mr. Yanukovych's government responded with a heavy hand, culminating in what the European Parliament's envoy called a ""Ukrainian Tiananmen,"" referring to China's deadly crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. More than 80 protesters were killed before Mr. Yanukovych fled the country in 2014.

The chaos didn't end there. Outraged, Mr. Putin pushed into Ukraine, annexed Crimea and stirred up a war that has claimed more than 10,000 lives. The West responded by kicking Russia out of the Group of 8 industrialized democracies and imposing sanctions. The standoff between Mr. Putin and the West had begun.

McKinsey defended its role in Mr. Yanukovych's rise by saying that the foundation was serious about promoting economic development in Ukraine and featured prominent Westerners on its board. The foundation quietly folded -- without achieving its goals -- just before Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia. Neither Mr. Akhmetov nor McKinsey would say how much money McKinsey earned.

""When we concluded that the government was not following through on its stated reform agenda, we ended our work,"" McKinsey said in a statement.

Mr. Akhmetov, who publicly broke with Mr. Yanukovych during the protests, declined to speak to The Times. Inside his gold and chrome headquarters, a spokesman said the foundation had been unsuccessful because politicians lacked the will ""to embrace the reform agenda.""

But critics like Anders Aslund, a Swedish-born economist who advised the Russian government in the 1990s and later the government of Ukraine, lamented how Mr. Yanokovych's image had been sold in Western capitals. It was clear, he said, that Mr. Yanokovych ""was about power and robbery.""

McKinsey's role in Ukraine did not end with Mr. Yanukovych's downfall. ""We build leaders who can deliver lasting, meaningful impact for Ukraine's major companies, its economy and society,"" the company wrote on its website

McKinsey quickly became a favorite of Mr. Yanukovych's successor, Petro O. Poroshenko, an oligarch known as ""the chocolate king"" for his confectionary business.

In a speech last November, Mr. Poroshenko praised McKinsey for its 15 years of work in Ukraine. His daughter-in-law also worked for the company during most of his presidency.

Meanwhile, McKinsey has continued to consult for Mr. Akhmetov, sharing the top floor of a Kiev office building with an Akhmetov company. Another Akhmetov company sits a floor below. In fact, Mr. Akhmetov owns the entire building, which includes a business in the lobby fit for an oligarch: an Aston Martin-Rolls Royce dealership.

Building China's Dream

Deep in the Malaysian jungle, a sprawling construction site sits abandoned, the relentless monsoon rain taking its toll on the rusting fields of steel girders.

It is supposed to be a railway -- part of China's signature Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion global undertaking financed by big Chinese loans, and usually built by Chinese companies.

Chief among them is the China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned behemoth whose initials are stenciled in black on the cement plant at the abandoned site.

China Communications, which was barred for eight years from doing business on some World Bank projects because of a corruption scandal, played a leading role in building artificial islands in the South China Sea that have raised tensions with the United States.

The company's subsidiary also built a new port for Sri Lanka. But the debt turned out to be such a burden that the Sri Lankan government had to give up the port and hand it over for 99 years -- to China.

Sri Lanka's fate was so alarming that Malaysia's new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, worried that the same thing might happen to him. So he suspended the railway project in July.

""That is not good for us,"" Mr. Mahathir said in September. ""Malaysian workers have no jobs that they can do. All the work is hired from China. You can see how one-sided it is.""

But for McKinsey, it was anything but one-sided. The company represented both parties involved in the deal.

In 2015, as China Communications was building the artificial islands and still under World Bank sanctions, McKinsey signed it on as a client, advising it on strategy.

Months later, McKinsey won another contract: this one with the Malaysian government, to review the feasibility of the rail line.

In a confidential PowerPoint report, McKinsey told Malaysian officials that the rail line could increase economic growth in parts of the country by as much as 1.5 percent. It was a figure that the prime minister at the time, Najib Razak, who now has been charged with corruption, liked to cite.

In bullet points, McKinsey also said the project would help improve ties with China -- ""build the nation-to-nation relationship"" -- because of its importance in China's Belt and Road Initiative.

And McKinsey endorsed the idea of heavy borrowing from China, referring to it as a ""game changer"" elsewhere in the region.

It isn't hard to see where McKinsey's enthusiasm for the Belt and Road Initiative came from: The firm had promoted the Chinese policy at the highest levels of the company.

Dominic Barton, McKinsey's managing partner at the time, made Belt and Road the theme of a keynote address in Beijing in 2015, recounting the Silk Road trade from the second century B.C. onward.

McKinsey's in-house research group, the McKinsey Global Institute, sprang into action, producing reports -- widely cited in the Chinese state news media -- extolling the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Mr. Barton -- who has served on the advisory board of China Development Bank, one of the two biggest Chinese lenders to the Belt and Road Initiative -- also batted down concerns in a 2015 interview with Chinese state media that the undertaking might be used as a tool to expand China's global influence.

""The world is waiting for the 'One Belt, One Road' grand blueprint to move from dream to reality,"" Mr. Barton and his colleagues wrote in a report published on the company's Chinese website in May 2015, expressing McKinsey's enthusiasm to work on it.

The feeling was mutual. Nine of the top 20 Belt-and-Road contractors are or have been McKinsey clients, according to research by The Times and figures from RWR Advisory Group, which tracks such projects.

In 2016, McKinsey's client, China Communications, won the $13 billion contract to build the Malaysian railroad. McKinsey justified the project at a time when Mr. Najib was widely accused of corruption, buffeted by street protests over the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars from a state investment fund, and badly in need of cash from an outside lender like China.

The scandal over the deal has enveloped both of McKinsey's clients. Mr. Mahatir told local reporters that China Communications, which won a no-bid contract for the railroad, may have deliberately overstated the costs in order to help Mr. Najib and his allies shovel extra money into the investment fund to replenish the missing amounts.

Tony Pua, a Malaysian lawmaker and an aide to the finance minister, said the deal was brokered by a hard-partying Malaysian businessman named Jho Low, who is accused of siphoning off hundreds of millions of dollars from the fund and is now believed to be in China, avoiding a Malaysian arrest warrant.

McKinsey says it has no knowledge of any collusion between China and Mr. Najib. It said that of course it would discuss China's sweeping Belt and Road plans but rejected the notion that, by representing both sides involved in the project, the company had a conflict of interest in any way. By the time China Communications won the bid, its work for Malaysia had already finished, the firm said.

""Our firm's rigorous internal policies and procedures"" ensure that ""we bring an independent perspective"" to help each client ""pursue its own strategic goals,"" McKinsey said.

But the political backdrop -- a government facing crippling corruption accusations and the prospect that Mr. Najib might turn to China for funds to cover his tracks -- should have been obvious to McKinsey at the time, argued Bridget Welsh, a professor at John Cabot University in Rome who focuses on Malaysian politics.

""They were choosing to engage with actors that were deeply tainted,"" Ms. Welsh said of McKinsey.

A Special Relationship

It was not the first time McKinsey had been drawn into questionable arrangements through its work in China.

The company opened its first office there in 1995, using consultants from the United States and Britain. By the end the decade, McKinsey was on hand to help as Beijing began pushing its moribund state-owned companies to adopt Western-style management, a McKinsey specialty.

The firm landed some big clients. Its star pupil was Ping An, an insurance company set up as part of a state-owned shipping company. Beginning in 1997, McKinsey began a two-decade relationship with the company as it rose from a footnote to one of the world's biggest insurers.

McKinsey's success soon reached into the pinnacle of Chinese politics, dragging it -- unwittingly and unknowingly, the company contends -- into a potential conflict of interest in the most glaring example of official enrichment in the history of the People's Republic of China.

Always in search of top talent, McKinsey brought on a 27-year-old named Liu Chunhang as a full-time associate in 2002. He had just graduated near the top of his class at Harvard Business School, according to school records, and stayed at McKinsey for less than a year. But in that time, his in-laws took steps that would turn them into billionaires.

Mr. Liu was the son-in-law of Wen Jiabao, the country's vice premier in charge of finance. Several months later, Mr. Wen became China's premier, putting him in charge of running the government.

At the time, McKinsey's client, Ping An, was preparing for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The Wen family and its business associates became secret shareholders of Ping An, having acquired their stakes at low cost in late 2002. And as premier, Mr. Wen presided over China's cabinet, which oversaw the insurance industry and signed off on big I.P.O.s.

According to McKinsey, Mr. Liu left the company in July 2003. It's not clear whether he played any role in his extended family's business activities. But when Ping An went public the next year, the Wen family amassed a staggering fortune, largely in company stock. By 2007, the family was worth at least $2.7 billion.

Mr. Liu, who is now a senior official at China's banking regulator, said through a spokesman that he ""never worked on any projects for the firm's Chinese clients,"" and that it would be ""misleading"" to connect him with McKinsey's work for Ping An.

McKinsey said that Mr. Liu had been hired because he was qualified, not because of his family connections.

""Any suggestion that Mr. Liu was hired or employed for improper purpose is false and extremely misleading,"" the company said.

Today, China's best and brightest clamor to work at McKinsey. Partners in the firm have sat in on Communist Party meetings at companies. More than 90 percent of the company's 350 consultants in China are of Chinese descent, according to its website.

And the importance of China to McKinsey over all is evident: The firm's last two managing partners, Mr. Barton and Kevin Sneader, were promoted from the region. Mr. Sneader now runs the entire company from Hong Kong.

McKinsey's name has become so prestigious in the country that a Chinese copycat sprang up, adopting the company's Chinese name.

The copycat firm -- Chengdu McKinsey Management Consulting Company -- even won a contract to advise Sichuan Province on its economic planning. Its ruse was so successful that the China Economic Weekly, a magazine under the Communist Party's mouthpiece People's Daily, wrote a cover article about the spreading influence of the real McKinsey, likening it to an octopus, and marveling at the success of the fake one.

McKinsey said it had not worked on the economic planning in Sichuan Province.

The company, however, has not shied away from contentious programs like ""Smart Cities,"" worrying scholars and human rights advocates who say the approach will strengthen China's surveillance state.

The idea of smart cities is to make them more manageable by collecting data from sources like cameras. In an authoritarian state like China, that raises broad concerns.

""Police patrols cannot be everywhere, for instance, but predictive analytics can deploy them in the right place at the right time,"" McKinsey wrote in a report in June.

""It is about political control,"" said Samantha Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

McKinsey is now working with Ping An to put smart cities into practice in the Chinese city of Nanning to monitor financial fraud.

The company has also championed -- even parroted, critics say -- the Chinese government's ""Made in China 2025"" initiative to become a global leader in sensitive fields like artificial intelligence and aerospace, a policy rattling European and American leaders who fear the plans will undermine their economies and set the stage for Chinese dominance.

In October, Vice President Mike Pence warned that ""through the 'Made in China 2025' plan, the Communist Party has set its sights on controlling 90 percent of the world's most advanced industries.""

McKinsey has produced at least 10 reports in Chinese focusing on ""Made in China 2025."" But earlier this year, China's government ordered the news media to stop writing about it, given the intense criticism from the United States and Europe. McKinsey's reports also stopped mentioning the policy.

""They sometimes seem to be almost like an arm of the People's Daily,"" George Magnus, a former chief economist at UBS, said of McKinsey. ""Obviously they do it in a slightly more subtle way -- sometimes not so subtle.""

Clients Under Sanctions

When Senate investigators wanted to know why Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, met with the head of a Russian bank under sanctions shortly after the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Kushner explained that, as far as he had been told, the bank chief had ""a direct line to the Russian president.""

It is easy to see how. The bank -- Vnesheconombank, or VEB -- is owned by the Russian government and overseen directly by Mr. Putin's inner circle. The bank's former chief -- the one Mr. Kushner met -- graduated from the training school of the F.S.B., the successor agency of the K.G.B. The bank has also come under scrutiny in Congress and by the special counsel investigating possible collusion in the 2016 election.

And the bank is a McKinsey client.

In August, VEB hired the consulting firm to develop its business strategy -- one of several companies that are under sanctions and that McKinsey advises.

Sberbank -- a state-controlled bank that is on the sanctions list and that sponsored Mr. Trump's Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013 -- is also a McKinsey client. In 2016, it agreed to pay the firm up to $5.2 million for advice on restructuring.

Yet another state-owned bank under sanctions, VTB, agreed to pay McKinsey about $4.4 million in 2017 to develop information technology.

McKinsey's work in Russia is extensive. Its Moscow office, the largest of the Western consulting firms working there, has handled about 2,000 projects, working with market leaders in oil, gas, banking and retail, as well as the mining of diamonds, gold and coal. One of its senior partners is the son of the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

McKinsey is so valued in Russia that even as Mr. Putin and Western nations clashed over Ukraine, a partner in the firm served on a Russian energy commission until 2015, along with several business executives who were either the target of individual sanctions or had ties to companies under sanction.

McKinsey clients help expand Russia's reach abroad. One of them -- PhosAgro, a fertilizer giant with ties to the Kremlin -- is pushing hard for new regulations that would give it greater control over Europe's food supply. The European Union already had concerns about Russian influence over its natural gas supply, much of which came from Gazprom, another Russian company under sanctions that McKinsey has advised on strategy and pricing.

McKinsey says it takes jobs in Russia -- or anywhere in the world -- only when it believes it can make a positive contribution. McKinsey also says its consulting is not political in nature, but focused on helping people lead better lives.

The firm has plenty of accomplishments to point to. In Russia alone, it upgraded Aeroflot, the national airline, improved traffic flow in Moscow and improved worker safety.

And McKinsey is far from the only American company working in legal ways with companies under sanctions. Some American officials have long argued that getting involved in the Russian economy not only benefits the American companies working there, but can also help foster better business practices and a greater appreciation for democratic principles overseas.

Others see little evidence of that. Robert G. Berschinski, a State Department official in the Obama administration, said business leaders and policymakers often believed that actively engaging with authoritarian governments would lead to economic reform, which in turn would drive political reform.

""But what is becoming increasingly clear, in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia -- in all three of those instances -- that belief has not proven to be true,"" he said.

China is a prime example, argued Mr. Kramer, the former assistant secretary of state. He said the country had lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, yet companies that do business there ""have nothing to point to"" showing that Chinese people have been granted more civil or political rights.

In some cases, McKinsey's work may have made things worse.

The firm produced a report tracking how some of Saudi Arabia's most important policies were viewed by the public, singling out three individuals who drove often negative conversations on Twitter.

One was later arrested, according to a human rights group. Another said that Saudi government officials had imprisoned two of his brothers and hacked his cellphone. The third -- an anonymous account -- was shut down.

McKinsey said it was ""horrified by the possibility, however remote,"" that the report could have been misused. But the kingdom is a such a vital client for the firm -- the source of nearly 600 projects from 2011 to 2016 alone -- that McKinsey chose to participate in a major Saudi investment conference in October even after the killing and dismemberment of a Washington Post columnist by Saudi agents.

""The world is divided into people who are for beheadings and against beheadings,"" said Anand Giridharadas, a former McKinsey consultant and former Times writer. He added that the firm and other companies were lending ""their reputation and credibility to a regime that deserves none of that.""

For 19 months, Calvert W. Jones, a University of Maryland professor, crisscrossed the Gulf monarchies in the Middle East as part of her research evaluating the work of management consultants in what she calls ""the black box of authoritarian governance.""

""Even if democracy itself remains a distant hope, so the thinking goes, experts might improve the daily lives of citizens in fundamental ways,"" Ms. Jones wrote.

Her conclusions are not likely to make it into recruiting videos for consulting companies seeking idealistic college graduates.

""In the beginning, the best of them want to help, want to do real research, provide data and expert opinions,"" she said. But after initially speaking their minds, she said, they gradually stop.

""They engage in the art of not speaking truth to power,"" she said. ""They self-censor, exaggerate successes and downplay their own misgivings due to the incentive structures they face.""

Outside experts might even reduce, rather than encourage, domestic reform, Ms. Jones said, partly because consultants are often unwilling to level with the ruling elite. The issue is becoming increasingly relevant, she said, as ""the number of experts circulating around the world continues to grow.""

The expansion is clear enough in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh on a weekday morning. There, a former Western diplomat quipped, you can watch the consultants departing for their jobs ""like bats leaving a cave."""

Krithik, who studies at Cherry Creek High School at Greenwood village in Denver, was appalled at the sight of the school. ""My images were shattered when I stepped into the school. It was unclean and did not have adequate amenities. Schoolteachers there said this was the state of many government schools in India. That's when I decided to do something,"" he said.

With help from his grandfather and his father M Ramesh Babu, Krithik, an Overseas Citizen of India, started an NGO, Empowering Rural India Foundation, about two weeks ago. When funds became an issue, his family members suggested him to find sponsors.

But the 16-year-old donated his own money of 6,000 US dollars. ""In May, I won the first prize in an international science fair held in Pittsburgh and received a cash award of 3,000 US dollars. Besides, I decided to put another 3,000 US dollars from my savings,"" he said.

When funds in hands, he approached the school management and asked them about their needs. Headmaster Perumal said installation of solar panels would help the school as it was affected by frequent power disruptions.

Krithik immediately accepted the idea and started searching for companies that install solar panels along with his father and mother Karpagavalli. They zeroed in on one and installed solar panels recently.

""The school is incurring about Rs 15,000 as electricity charges every two months. With solar panels, we can save that money,"" said a teacher, on the condition of anonymity.

Krithik said the solar panels could produce 2kw of power. ""The requirement of school is less than 2kw. It could sell excess power to the Tamil Nadu electricity board,"" he said.

Ramesh Babu said his son's idea was to build sustainable and renewable energy systems that would serve schools in India for decades. ""Our goal is to improve academic success and create self-sustaining solutions to build up a strong infrastructure,"" he said.

Krithik, who will return to the US by the end of the month, said, ""I will participate in more science fairs, will get more money and contribute something to government schools in India."" He also requested schoolteachers to contact his NGO when they need anything for their schools."

Is the case of two 'meticulously selected' IPS officers to head the CBI a reflection of a deeper malaise that has afflicted the civil service? Is it just the tip of the iceberg? Is there something wrong with the process of selection? Despite a much-touted 360-degree assessment, why are so many senior officers being shifted so often? There are many more such questions that beg answers.

Why was Rupak Dutta, an IPS officer with impeccable credentials and with a long tenure in the CBI, shifted and attached to the home ministry? Why wasn't he considered for the post of director? Why were Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana brought to the CBI when they had no experience of working in the organisation? Were competence and integrity not the criteria to select officers on these critical and sensitive posts? Were they not assessed through a '360-degree' evaluation?

As many as 17 ministries/departments have each had four-five secretaries or more during the past four years. Not all these postings were necessitated on account of superannuation. The social sector has suffered the most. The rural development ministry has had five secretaries, same as the case with crucial ministries/departments like health and school education. How can these sectors develop with such frequent changes at the top?

Also read: Modi govt is very 'unstable' for top IAS secretaries, transfers them too often and abruptly

Secretaries are supposed to be selected after due diligence (read 360-degree). If that was the case, then why were two home secretaries - L.C. Goyal and Anil Goswami shifted even before they could complete their tenure of two years? Some other changes were equally baffling. Vrinda Sarup, rated as one of the finest IAS officers and with a very high experience in the school education sector, was shifted out suddenly. J.S. Deepak, then secretary, telecom, was attached to the ministry of commerce in an overnight order while he was representing the country at an international conference in Barcelona. Anuj Bishnoi who was ultimately considered fit for Central Administrative Tribunal, was shifted three times during his tenure as secretary. Why was C.K. Mishra shifted out of the ministry of health and family welfare? And if he wasn't good enough, how did he end up getting the ministry of environment and forest?

A large number of public sector undertakings (PSUs) have been left headless and without directors for months together, adversely impacting the performance of these entities. Coal India Limited is one such example where the absence of a CMD has created havoc. The coal sector was going through a serious crisis on account of coal shortages till 2014. The infamous coal scam was an outcome of this shortage. However, this was turned around on account of the outstanding contribution of Sutirtha Bhattacharya who headed the company for three years. Coal production saw an unprecedented jump in the years 2014-15 and 2015-16 primarily on account of his efforts. The incremental growth of 32 million tonnes was more than the cumulative growth during the previous four years. However, on completion of his tenure, Coal India Limited was left with an officiating chairman for more than a year. The consequences are there for everyone to see. There is yet again an acute shortage of coal in the country. The situation is gradually improving because there is a full-time CMD now. This is true of a number of public sector undertakings.

Every time one interacted with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one could not but be impressed with his sincerity of purpose and clarity of thought. The intent was always there and this reflected in his thought, expression and action. There were indeed some brilliant initiatives and decisions. The setting up of secretaries' groups, getting trainee IAS officers for a three-month stint in Delhi, posting of some senior level officers well ahead of the retirement of the previous incumbent, amendment to Section 13(1)(d)(ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act were indeed praiseworthy and reflected the positive intent of the Prime Minister in the context of human resource management. But then, where did it all go wrong? Why and how did human resource management get messed up? Who is advising the Prime Minister in taking these crucial decisions that are repeatedly going wrong?

Also read: Hiring non-IAS officers as joint secretaries may be too radical a step for India

The answer perhaps lies in the humongous task of managing India's army of civil servants. With almost everything getting concentrated in the hands of a few civil servants, the task has become too big to handle. This has also led to enormous delays in decisions related to postings resulting in vacancies for long durations. There is indeed something amiss. Can some of the work be delegated to different levels? Will it help? Can competence and integrity, and not allegiance, become the criteria for selection? These are, as they say, million dollar questions that beckon answers. Only those that matter can perhaps answer them. However, before they are answered, someone will have to muster the courage to ask these questions.

Fatherhood is one of the most important journeys a man can undertake, one that works towards no destination but makes the process as fulfilling as can be. Unlike the looming feminine biological clock, men are a little more at ease to chalk out plans for this journey. Or so we think. Popular culture and social stereotyping reiterate the notion that most men just stumble upon fatherhood and bumble their way through it as providers for children. That is increasingly getting farther from the reality of modern parenting.

While men may still be at more ease to defer parenting, it by no means is indicative of their lack of interest. Far from it -- for a variety of reasons -- men experience late fatherhood and with it cope with a gamut of other scenarios.

Is there a right age?

Kaushik S. Roy married the woman of his dreams. It didn't matter that she was seven years older than him. It didn't matter that he was barely out of management school when they tied the knot after four years of courtship. Within a year of marriage his wife was keen to have a child; he not so much. Today, he can sympathise and see how they were both looking at the situation from their own age points. ""I was 22 then and she was 29. Obviously, she wanted to start a family. I still wanted to be suitably placed in a good corporate job. There was too much bitterness, we wanted different things and we didn't last more than two years. By the time I was 25, I was divorced while my friends were still looking to solidify relationships.""

Advertising

Finally, at 36, Kaushik met someone who he knew immediately had to be the person he would marry. He adds, ""But I still waited four years to marry her and then two more to have our first child. She was very understanding about my need to not mess this one up. You wouldn't believe that in all of this, I have always wanted to start a family. I love kids. I couldn't wait to have a child with her, but I wanted to be sure that we're both ready for it. She had a prominent role in a mutual fund company and I didn't want her to do something without carefully seeing the repercussions on career and life in general.""

Praveen Singh spent much of his 20s and 30s consolidating on his career. He also treasured his singlehood at a time when he was jet-setting around the world. It never occurred to him ""that there would be something more satiating and meaningful in life"" than the pace and thrill that he was accustomed to. ""By the time I found someone worth settling down with, I was already past 45. But then we both knew only too well that we can't defer starting a family. Not just because we felt we were biologically running out of time, but because there didn't feel any need to delay it further,"" says Praveen.

Deferred fatherhood

Life throws a lot of spanners in the path to deciding on fatherhood. While a crux of decision-making process should rightfully lie with the mum-to-be, fatherhood is life-altering for the man too. And more often than not, it's a journey a lot of men wish to defer. From wanting to focus on their careers, to not wanting to stop sowing their wild oats, from financial obligations to even space constraints in overcrowded households, the reasons to defer parenthood are all usually not without sense or logic.

Neeraj Mehta lived with his parents, older brother, sister-in-law and their two children. When he got married, his bachelor room was converted into a habitable young couple's space. For a good 10 years, his wife and he focused on their careers, travelled the world, and did everything they set their mind on. ""Despite the fact that our families inundated us with requests, threats and sighs over our decision to not yet raise children. When we decided to start a family, we silently suffered two miscarriages because we knew the barbs that would come our way. So we decided to adopt children. With that comes a fair bit of a waiting period. In this duration, we decided that we wanted the personal space to raise children and so we moved out on our own. I was 43 when we adopted our first daughter. And our son came home four years later,"" says Neeraj.

Anxieties of delayed parenthood

Praveen didn't factor in his physical anxieties while settling down to start a family. Up until then, being free-spirited was never slowed down by his sexual prowess. It wasn't until they consciously worked towards starting a family that Praveen started being stressed out about both the length of his lifespan and his own fertility. ""I got myself checked. My wife got herself tested. We couldn't figure despite all normal results why we weren't conceiving fast enough. The doctor then told us to just calm down and not kill the pleasure out of the process. I had had so many friends complain about their fertility that I was a mental wreck until the doctor had to calm me down,"" he laughs.

Neeraj believes that most people simply focus on the process of childbirth but not so much factor in that late fatherhood is an ongoing battle between carrying out your responsibility against your advancing age. He adds, ""As our child grew, we were a part of various school activities and events. I recall being called for Father's Day to my son's preschool, where there were some fathers who looked like they could've been my kids! Someone actually asked if I, 'as a grandfather', was filling in for my son's father!"" That really got him thinking about his own longevity and being able to extend his lifespan for his son's sake. ""It made me want to get fitter, to be able to run at his Sports Days, to play a more active role in his life as long as I can live. It was a kick in the gut, but a good one.""

When Kaushik's wife was pregnant with their first child, both of them were 42. They knew they wanted more than one child, but they were both reluctant to physically have the mother go through the process. One of his friends suggested surrogacy as an option. ""The first three years of raising the child in our 40s made us realise that we're not getting any younger both physically and mentally. As soon as our daughter got into a playschool, we started researching the option of surrogacy. Today, we have a wonderful surrogate mother who is carrying our child, who is set to be delivered in February. Fingers crossed."""

It was a rare genetic disorder called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (a brittle bone disease in which the patient's bones break easily) that taught the 21-year-old Anaida Stanly all about determination and passion.

""I first saw sand art in a television show and was interested. Seeing this, my father [Stanly Louis] made a light box for me. After watching a few YouTube videos, I began doing sand art myself. Sand art is something one performs on stage. The concept of Odiyan interested me. Doing the transformation in sand art was exciting,"" says Anaida.

She gives motivational talks and does sand art in various stages. Recently, Anaida also did a tribute performance to late violinist Balabhaskar which was much appreciated.A second-year animation student in Rajagiri College of Management and Applied Sciences, Kakkanad, Anaida is also talented in pencil sketching, cartoon drawing, playing violin and singing. ""During my childhood, my body movements were limited due to my condition. People used to gift me colour pencils and colour books. Sketching was a hobby at the time. It was later that I began taking it seriously. My favourite one among my pencil sketches is a series of Bahubali characters,"" says Anaida.

Anaida has endured pain since birth. However, she grew up understanding that disability is just a state of mind. ""The doctors told my parents not to send me to school. However, my mother insisted I go to school like other children. She taught me to never step back from what I want to achieve,"" she says.

Adding to this, this strength taught the mother to fight another struggle. Rani Stanly was diagnosed with cancer in 2015. ""I was able to fight my disease only because of my child. I realised my pains are nothing before what she has been suffering,"" she says.

Anaida, like many others, did not know anyone suffering from the brittle bone disease. ""In 2014, I joined an organisation Amrithavarshini, an NGO which has been working for the welfare of those afflicted by the disease. There are so many others suffering much more intensely than me. Many don't even get to school. Only parents can bring a change their lives,"" she says.Rani says Anaida and a few other help many children complete their Class XII through IGNOU.

Anaida gives motivational talks. ""If at least one person changes after hearing my words and seeing me live, it is the best thing I can do,"" she says.This girl with an unbreakable spirit has set sights for the future. ""I will continue doing sand art and want to secure a full-time job as an animator. In Amrithavarshini, there are many children who are economically backward. We dream to create an inclusive society. I really want to bring these children to the forefront of society,"" adds Anaida."

The market dynamic forces have been determined after conducting a detailed study of the Global Recycled Metal Market.

Europe recycled metal market share is projected witness gains of more than 4% during the forecast timeframe. This is primarily due to stringent laws and legislations imposed by environmental regulatory bodies in Europe, which has triggered metal recycling to reduce the carbon footprint and help save the environment from hazardous waste generated. For instance, Directive 2008/98/EC imposed by European Commission defines basic concepts related to waste management.

According to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc. Recycled Metal Market size is forecast to exceed USD 125 billion by 2024

Industry Growth drivers are

* Rapidly growing construction industry in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East

* Strong product demand from electrical & electronics industry in North America

* Stringent & supporting legislations for metal recycling in Europe

It signifies terms and conditions related to waste, recycling and recovery. Moreover, Directive 2012/19/EU prevent the generation of electrical & electronic waste and to promote reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery to reduce the quantity of waste to be eliminated, whilst also improving the environmental performance. These trends are likely to make significant impact on the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Recycled non ferrous metal market size was valued more than USD 90 billion in 2017. Non ferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, lead, precious metals and other metals such as nickel, zinc, tin, palladium, etc. These metals find wide-ranging applications across construction, electrical & electronics, transport, consumer goods, industrial machinery, nuclear, military and several other end-user industry. For instance, lead is widely used electronics in batteries, ammunition, cable sheathing, etc.

Lead batteries are used in transport industry and constituted approximately 35% of the total industry share in terms of volume in 2017. These trends will help boost the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

In terms of volume, recycled metal market share for building & construction constituted close to 45% of the total business share in 2017. It is mainly due to comprehensive recycled metal applications in the building & construction industry. For example, ferrous metals (iron and steel) are broadly used in the construction of large steel frameworks in the building, bridges, drainage components and various other architectural frameworks.

Furthermore, non ferrous metals including aluminum, copper and lead are also utilized in the building & construction sector. Lead sheets are used for roofing, cladding of vertical walls, soundproofing in partitions and ceilings in office, school and hotel buildings. These trends will help make considerable contribution to reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

North America electrical & electronics industry is on the rise which is due to consistently changing consumer's preferences and continuous technology upgradation. For instance, the electrical & electronics industry was valued more than USD 900 billion in 2016 and accounted for a total of 21% of the global electrical & electronics industry. These trends will drive reprocessed metal demand owing to its wide spread applications in metal plating electronics via electrodeposition. It provides improved corrosion resistance, enhanced electrical conductivity and improved solderability which helps in protecting against wear.

Furthermore, precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, rhodium, etc. are also widely applicable in the electronics industry owing to its unique physical and chemical properties which provides reliability to the electronics sector. It will help attain significant gains to the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

Ineffective metal reprocessing is a key constraint which is probable to impede the global reprocessed metal market size by 2024. For instance, only 40% of the total copper produced is attained from recycling and 33% of the total aluminum produced is attained from recycling process. Nevertheless, rising emphasis on metal processing and reusability to reduce carbon footprint and impact of hazardous waste will generate plentiful opportunities for the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Key reprocessed metal market players are Sims Metal Management, Steel Dynamics, European Metal Recycling, Nucor Corporation, ELG HanielGmbh, Schnitzer Steel and Novelis. The market players are expanding their capacity to process metal to attain profitability in the market. For example, Novelis announced to build flat-rolled aluminum plant in January 2018 in Kentucky U.S. for USD 300 million.

Difficult roads, they say, often lead to beautiful destinations. There may be multiple challenges, but one thing binds India's change-makers together - they view problems as means for innovation. From tackling unemployment to becoming financially independent and providing livelihoods to others at a time of personal tragedy, YourStory brings you stories of social impact through the Monday Motivation series.

As we draw closer towards the end of 2018, here are some of our top picks from the year.

Recognising the vulnerabilities of migrants who move from rural areas to urban India, Vinod Pandey started a ""tea stall"" with a difference - Rozgar Dhaba, at Shehore district's Nashrullaganj block in Madhya Pradesh. The dhaba not only sells tea and refreshments, but acts as a centre for the exchange of information on livelihood and employment opportunities.

""I am from Bihar and have seen how people from Bihar migrate to different cities in search of jobs, especially for daily wage labour. An elder cousin migrated to Punjab and died because he did not get proper work in the city; he lived in slums, without proper healthcare. The city failed him,"" Vinod says.

Started in January 2018, Rozgar Dhaba caters to over a 1,000 people a month and has hosted over 20 job fairs, and five farm produce sale displays till date. It has over 70 registered entities such as government agencies, skill centres, NGOs, district agriculture centres, grameen centres, and small local businesses that provide regular job information. The dhaba itself provides employment to almost 10 people and has revenue of Rs 8,000 to Rs 12,000.

At a time when rote learning and academic-based examination continue to dominate the Indian school system, a 21-year-old student from IIT-Madras is on a mission to change the way knowledge is imparted. Using the peer teaching model, which has Harvard University's stamp of approval, Divanshu Kumar hopes to improve the learning ability of students through his startup, Involve.

""Most of the world believes that we can improve the quality of learning and have better results by putting more qualified teachers in the classrooms. And while this is true, it fails to address one very important need: capability building of students,"" he says.

Involve's peer teaching method involves a nine-month fellowship where students from higher grades, like from Class 8, can teach and mentor juniors. By getting students who can teach and learners together in a classroom, Involve aims to create a school ecosystem that defines a student's potential not merely in terms of examinations, but through overall academic and personal excellence.

Till date, the team has worked with over 400 students across four schools in Chennai and Bengaluru. These include more than 100 student leaders.

To introduce food processing techniques and create links in the agri-business model, Balaji Balaraman, 35, started Agribolo. The startup aims to create a market linkage opportunity that can become a farm-to-fork, farm-to-mill, and farm-to-warehouse model for farmers and the ecosystem at large.

""The primary necessities include creating multiple pre-processing or primary centres at the farm or village level. That will provide a basic value addition to farmers and an opportunity to develop a cluster-based model,"" Balaji says.

The farmer engagement platform allows an individual to get an umbrella of services under one roof at his location and according to the season, relevance, demand, supply, and in a timely and efficient manner. Agribolo engages and connects farmers with experts, NGOs, and development institutes for training, capacity building, and outreach programmes.

The startup offers a platform to aggregate services in the form of farm mechanisation, plant nursery, protected cultivation, seed production, input demonstration, collateral management, financial inclusion, and local processing that could be co-owned and operated by the community at large.

The farmer is also provided an opportunity to partner with a business solution - available on the platform - that empowers him towards rural employment and social empowerment.

Josephine Arokiya Mary, a National Award winner for apiculture, started her journey with 10 bee boxes. She now has 7,000 bee boxes, and has helped create more than 1,800 entrepreneurs in her district.

In 2010, a year after her daughter's death, Mary took a loan of Rs 10 lakh from Canara Bank to start Vibis Natural Bee Farming with 1,000 bee boxes. Targeting diabetic patients, she accumulated and harvested jamun honey, which gave her good revenues; soon, Mary started harvesting honey from more than 10 varieties of bees. Apart from selling honey, she diversified her business by selling bee wax candles and the pollen bees carry on their legs.

Mary is now known as Queen Bee in her village and sells honey to 23 districts in Tamil Nadu. She offers 25 varieties of honey with flavours like jamun, neem, and amla among others, through her enterprise. She now earns more than Rs 1 lakh per month, and her venture has an annual turnover of Rs 3 crore.

Besides providing employment to over 50 people and helping over 400 women set up honey bee farms, she is training more than 50,000 people in bee harvesting under the National Honey Mission and creating awareness to save bees from going extinct.

Prem Singh's lush green farmland paints a vivid picture of sustainable farming: organic produce and homegrown compost, fruit-bearing trees, livestock shelter with water bodies, well-nourished soil, natural fertilisers, and, most importantly, a continuous source of income.

""I too was captured in the cycle of debt and crop failure; we couldn't control climatic conditions and bank loans kept increasing. And then I started thinking about our ancestors, our traditional farming methods, and knew that this was the key to success. Today, I am debt-free. I am a pragatisheel kisaan,"" he says proudly.

Advocating Avartansheel Kheti, or periodic proportionate farming, Prem Singh believes that farming has to be a self-sustaining occupation for the farmer. The practice encourages a farmer to divide his land into three parts: one-third to be used as a garden to grow fruits and crops, the second part for rearing livestock, and the third to grow timber. His approach advocates crop rotation, organic farming, animal husbandry, food processing, improving soil fertility, and seed development.

This farming method is currently followed by 28 percent farmers in his district and also has followers from the agrarian community of Belgium and France."

Even as cyclone Phethai makes landfall along the Andhra Pradesh coast, Hyderabad, the capital city of neighbouring state Telangana, will not stay untouched, says private weather forecaster Skymet.

For the next 12-18 hours, dry weather will continue, but cloud cover increased over the city in the last 24-36 hours because of the cyclonic storm over Southwest Bay of Bengal. It could lead to increase in surface winds with light to moderate rain and thundershower activity possible over the entire city.

SCR has made elaborate arrangements to tackle any situation arising due to the impending 'Cyclone Phethai', which is expected to make a land fall on the Andhra Pradesh coast by Monday (17 December).

3. TRS Unlikely to Fulfil Promises: TDP

The Telugu Desam Party Telangana State unit has expressed doubts that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi led Government was trying to delay the implementation of its promises like Rs 3,016 a month unemployment allowance to youth and doubling the quantum of social welfare pensions that are being given to different sections.

TDP polit bureau member Ravula Chandrasekhar Reddy, in an informal chat with reporters here, said Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's claims on providing unemployment allowance from the next financial year after studying the implementation of the scheme in other States was a pointer to the moves to delay the implementation of the scheme. The TDP was committed to mounting pressure on the government in a democratic manner for ensuring the implementation of the scheme at the earliest.

The row was sparked by a student sharing a chicken sandwich with some of his classmates, who happened to be vegetarians, during the tiffin break. Others in the class then roughed up this student, who claimed he did not know that his classmates were vegetarian, and parents got involved. The school authorities had to issue a notice asking students not to share non-vegetarian food in class.

This school may have somehow managed to resolve this incident peacefully but school authorities across the city acknowledge that they have a problem on their hand. The debate on the contents of the tiffin box may have followed the wider vegetariannon-vegetarian social and political debate, say leading schools, forcing many to frame guidelines on food.

Some schools have explicitly asked students to avoid bringing non-vegetarian food to class, but others have preferred to avoid a stricture, choosing instead to prohibit consumption of meat, fish and eggs only within classrooms; yet others have asked students to declare the contents of their tiffin box before sharing it with classmates.

A leading English-medium girls' school near Park Circus, for example, has given out a list of suggested food items that students of junior classes can bring to campus. This list does not have any non-vegetarian item though the school has insisted to parents that it ""is not forcing anything on students but merely suggesting something"". Students and parents, however, say carrying non-vegetarian food to school often evokes snide remarks and even bullying. That this problem has not had a resolution is clear from the school's request to stay ""off record while it tries to bring out a solution"".

Don Bosco (Park Circus), too, does not allow non-vegetarian food till Class II. ""Students of other classes are told to not share their food if it is not vegetarian. Students from Class VI onward can buy food from the canteen,"" principal Father Bikash Mondal said.

Food packets distributed by the school, during school events or celebrations, are strictly vegetarian, which is the practice followed by an overwhelming majority of other city schools. Rammohan Mission School, too, ""does not bar non-veg stuff but sticks to vegetarian food for school programmes"", says principal Sujoy Biswas.

Tiffin Row

Parents tense despite advisory

One of the city's oldest Catholic girls' schools in central Kolkata encourages students to have non-veg food at the canteen rather than bring it from home. Girls are not barred from having non-vegetarian food on campus, but the school makes it clear that it would rather students avoid them in classrooms. ""This preempts confusion and conflict,"" a senior member of the management said.

Another new-age school off EM Bypass-Rashbehari Connector has asked students to disclose the nature of the food they share with classmates. A parent says it has worked out well. Another school of the same group has asked parents to put stickers on tiffin boxes if they contain non-vegetarian food; it has also asked students bringing non-vegetarian food ""to move away from vegetarians"" before opening their lunch boxes.

But some parents of the school where the sandwichsharing controversy happened continue to remain tense despite the school issuing a similar advisory. ""Senior students, too, have fought over non-veg food recently. I now make sure that my son doesn't carry non-vegetarian stuff to school,"" the parent of a Class IX student said.

Modern High School for Girls director Devi Kar believes supervision is necessary to preempt such controversies. ""We closely monitor primary section students' food. There is no bar on nonvegetarian food but our canteen is vegetarian,"" she added.

There are some others, like The Heritage School, which forbid non-veg food on campus, ""but not because of any recent controversy"". ""We are a vegetarian school. We have a dietician and it is mandatory for students to have food from canteen. Around 700 children have breakfast and lunch along with teachers and no one is allowed to carry food from home,"" principal Seema Sapru said."

It is largely a disease of the poor. This is the first in a three-part series on the disease and those it affects.

Ten days after taking miltefosine tablets, 51-year-old Lalmati Devi Rai, stopped her medicines. She was taking the medicines for Post-Kala Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis, a neglected form of Kala Azar that manifests into skin disease.

""The medicine increased the heat in my body. I can barely eat food. The disease is not going away,"" said Lalmati.

While Kala Azar is potentially life threatening, PKDL is by and large a disease which creates very few problems in the life of the patient. The patient suffers no fever, or even itching for that matter. The problem is by and large cosmetic.

Lalmati Devi. Image: Arrangement with Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative

However, from the epidemiological perspective, the disease has to be treated as soon as possible as it acts as a reservoir of the leishmaniasis parasite that causes Kala Azar. The parasite spreads via the bite of a sandfly. Kala Azar is a life-threatening disease if not treated. The government has committed that it will eliminate the disease by 2020. Elimination means that the disease has to be brought down to less than 1 case per 10,000 population in a block.

PKDL is being treated with a three-month course of miltefosine tablets. The drug was earlier used to treat Kala Azar before scientific reports of developing resistance appeared after ten years of use. It is also used to treat cancer. The oral drug has side effects, the most common being vomiting, diarrhoea, gastritis, toxicity in the kidneys, among others.

After a bout of Kala Azar earlier year, nine-year old Shristi was detected with PKDL this August. She has mild discolouration of skin which is called macular variety of PKDL.

""She cries every time we have to take the medicine. She says her stomach hurts. She also vomits. She lost weight after we started the medicine. She barely goes to school,"" said her mother, Rinku Devi Rai, who lives in Rampur village in Saran district.

Her mother gave her the medicine in the night after dinner only so that she can sleep through the side effects.

This medicine is hard to comply with. ""It is hard to motivate patients to continue taking the medicines. Only if we keep in touch constantly with them do they comply,"" said Raj Kishore Rai, a treatment supervisor working with Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative or DNDi.

Besides, the medicine cannot be given to pregnant women, and is teratogenic, that is, it can either disturb the pregnancy or cause congenital malformations.

""We ask women if they are pregnant before prescribing the medicine. Even after the medicine ends, women cannot become pregnant for the next five months,"" said Dr Ram Shankar, who handles all the Kala Azar cases in Chhapra District Hospital.

A pregnancy test is mandatory before prescribing the medicine, as per the guidelines issued by National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme or NVDCP. The guidelines also say that the treating doctor should ensure that women take a contraceptive for a short while. If either testing or contraceptive is not available, the woman should be offered alternate treatments or just wait before these two are guaranteed. However, Dr Shankar said that they just ask the women, and women are usually aware about their own pregnancies.

Srishti Kumari, who suffered from PKDL, found the medicines hard to manage. Image: Arrangement with Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative

These pre-conditions make miltefosine a hard drug to administer.

A 2007 study published in Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management by a renowned clinician, Dr Shyam Sunder from Banaras Hindu University and a World Health Organisation official, Piero Olliaro reviewed the various studies related to miltefosine use for treatment of Kala Azar (not PKDL) and urged governments to devise strategies to monitor the treatment closely.

""It is therefore important to devise strategies to monitor the effects of miltefosine (both in terms of real-life efficacy and toxicity) during large-scale deployment,"" the study said. Another study in 2015 led by Dr Shyam Sundar said that perhaps that treatment should be directly observed, or that patients should get their medicines from a health worker everyday, like in the case of TB treatment

Case studies described in research papers have shown alarming side effects such as corneal defects. As per a study published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, five patients from Bangladesh were found with corneal complications, with one patient losing his eyesight after taking miltefosine. The authors of the study urged effective pharmacovigilance of the drug and periodic follow-up of patients and preparing a drug-brochure explaining the side effects of the drugs.

The patients, so far, are called every month to the clinic. But the follow up of the patient if he or she falls off the radar is not very good, said health workers in Bihar.

In the meanwhile, the government claimed there are no cases that are lost to follow-up in the state. ""The states are showing 100 percent compliance,"" said Dr Nupur Roy, additional director, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme.

Rajendra Prasad Memorial Research Institute in Patna along with Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative or DNDi is conducting a clinical trial trying to reduce the treatment period. ""We are trying to simplify the treatment from 12 weeks to 3 weeks,"" said Dr Suman Rijal, director of DNDi Regional Office in Delhi. ""That can increase compliance.""

On the morning of December 15, Bashir Ahmad Bhat was among the many who thronged the Pulwama district hospital in South Kashmir to help with the constant stream of injured people being brought in. A gunfight between security forces and militants in Sirnoo village that morning had seen civilians come out in large numbers to protest. Seven civilians, including two teenagers, were killed in the firing, and many more were wounded.

Of the 30 civilians that the district hospital received on Saturday morning, six were brought dead, hospital officials said. While five of them were identified immediately, the attendants were having a tough time with the identification of a young boy's body - until Bashir Ahmad Bhat saw his face.

""It was my son Aqib. When I saw his face, I fainted,"" said Bashir Ahmad Bhat, merely an hour after his 14-year-old son was buried in a local graveyard. The 35-year-old father works as an orchard labourer. ""In South Kashmir, we have become accustomed to massacres,"" he said. ""It's very common for locals here to lend a helping hand or provide food at the hospital in such crises. I had no idea that my son would be among the dead.""

Abdul Rashid Para, medical superintendent at the district hospital, said they started receiving injured patients around quarter past nine in the morning. ""I received the first panic call at 9.13 am,"" Para said. ""After that, it was chaos all around. With a huge number of people accompanying the injured, it was hard to manage. Six civilians were already dead when they reached the hospital. Most of the injured or killed civilians were shot in the upper parts of body.""

The gunfight, which started in the early hours of Saturday, had led to the killing of three local Hizbul Mujahideen militants and one soldier of the Indian Army. According to the police, it took place in an orchard where militants had built a hideout. A statement issued by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on Saturday said the civilians ""got injured"" when ""a crowd came dangerously close from different parts"" while ""the operation was going on.""

Later on Saturday evening, Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik directed Baseer Khan, divisional commissioner, Kashmir, to launch an inquiry into the firing. The official statement from governor's office also deviated from police's version of the incident. The police had claimed that civilians were killed while the operation was on, but the governor's office said that they died in clashes after the operation was over.

Aqib Ahmad Bhat was the youngest among the seven civilians killed on Saturday. The class nine student was hit by a bullet in the head. A resident of Pulwama's Prichoo village, Bhat was the oldest child of his parents. He has a 10-year-old sister and a seven-year-old brother.

According to relatives gathered in his house in Prichoo village, Bhat had left home in the morning without having breakfast. ""The encounter began at around 7.45-8 am. I woke him up when we heard gunshots. At around 9 am, he ventured out. We have no idea how did he reach the encounter site,"" said a relative.

In Prichoo, nobody buys the police version. ""The encounter was over in just half an hour. It was targeted fire. We will see who will get a reward for gallantry on January 26 for killing this child,"" said Bhat's uncle, Abdul Hamid Bhat.

His 14-year-old nephew had been crazy about cricket, he recalled. ""His stance was like that of Sachin Tendulkar,"" Abdul Hamid Bhat said, looking around the courtyard of his brother's house. Whenever he was free, he would go to the stadium and play cricket. His batting kits must be lying somewhere here only.""

At the Pulwama district hospital, Para said 17 injured civilians were referred to various hospitals of Srinagar for advanced treatment. While most of them reached Srinagar hospitals in time, it could not save 30-year-old Tawseef Ahmad Mir.

On Saturday, dozens of youth from the adjacent villages had started on foot towards the site of gunfight in Sirnoo. Tawseef Ahmad Mir had joined one such group of youth. He would be hit in the chest by a bullet.

A resident of Urichersoo village in Pulwama, he had worked for the Power Development Department. He was also father to a six-year-old girl and three-year-old boy.

""He was my only son. I have five daughters and all of them are unmarried. All of my hope is gone now,"" said Mohammad Ahsan Mir, his father. ""He had an active personality. He wasn't afraid of anything. For him, the word fear didn't exist at all.""

Ten kilometres away, the family of 17-year-old Liyaqat Ahmad Dar in Parigam village is struggling to make sense of their loss.

""Till 8 in the morning, Liyaqat was with me. He helped me in collecting the milk from sellers. After loading the milk containers on the vehicle, I asked him to go home directly as I had to go to Srinagar to distribute milk. At 11 am, I got a call from home that he's dead. He was shot in the head,"" said his father, Abdul Majeed Dar, a milkman.

Known for his business acumen and management of his father's business accounts, Liyaqat Dar had chosen commerce subjects in school. Every day, after his evening prayers, he would pick up a container and collect milk for distribution next morning.

""He was a responsible son,"" Abdul Majeed Dar said. ""He had all the knowledge about pending dues or customers who owned us money. Despite being a student, he never shied away from helping me out.""

According to Liyaqat Dar's cousin, Arshad Ahmad, it was ""jazbaat"", emotion, which drove Dar towards the site of the gunfight on Saturday morning. ""The oppression we face every day would force everyone his age to pick up the gun. To visit the site of gunfight was his idea to show support for the militants. They could have shot him in the leg or arm. Why in the head?""

On Saturday afternoon, as news of the civilian deaths spread, there was ferment in Srinagar as well. At the Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital, there were chaotic scenes as injured patients from the south arrived.

Appeals for blood donation and food for attendants were shared on social media. In many areas, there were shut downs to protest against the killings. After pictures and updates about the killings flooded social media, the mobile internet speed in Srinagar was brought down.

Separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq announced on Twitter that the joint leadership of the Hurriyat had decided to march to the Badami Bagh army cantonment on December 17. They also called for a three-day shutdown to protest against the killings.

Saturday's gunfight was the second in recent months to extract such a heavy civilian toll. In October, a stray explosive at the site of a gunfight in South Kashmir's Kulgam district had gone off, leaving seven civilians dead.

In November, a series of pre-dawn operations in South Kashmir had left 37 militants dead. Nine commanders of the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Hizbul Mujahideen were among those killed. The strategy of launching operations before daybreak was aimed at avoiding civilian casualties, police officials in the Valley had earlier said. In an interview earlier this month, Anil Kumar Bhatt, general-officer-commanding of the army's Srinagar-based 15 Corps, had said the crowds trying to disrupt military operations had thinned over the last two or three months. Saturday's killings suggest that may not be the case.

According to the police, a first information report was registered on the incident. But the nature of the FIR, the details of the accused and charges, have not been revealed. None of the families that Scroll.in spoke to asked for an investigation into the incident."

If yes, visiting a physical therapist early can reduce the consumption of opioids that can lead to their abuse as well as other health complications, suggests a study.

According to a new study by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine and the Duke University School of Medicine, Patients who underwent physical therapy soon after being diagnosed with pain in the shoulder, neck, low back or knee were approximately 7 to 16 percent less likely to use opioids in the subsequent months.

Patients who use opioids for back, shoulder and neck pain, early physical therapy was associated with a 5 to 10 percent reduction in how much of the drug they used, the study found.

""This is not a world where there are magic bullets. But many guidelines suggest that physical therapy is an important component of pain management, and there is little downside to trying it,"" said Eric Sun, Assistant Professor at the varsity.

""What our study found was that if you can get these patients on physical therapy reasonably quickly, that reduces the probability that they will be using opioids in the longer term,"" said Sun.

For the study, researchers included 88,985 patients.

Findings, published in the JAMA Network Open, showed that if a patient sought out physical therapy within the first 90 days of their diagnosis, he or she, on average, were less likely to fill an opioid prescription three months to a year after being diagnosed.

The results could be helpful to clinicians in search of pain-management options that carry fewer health risks than opioids, reduces pain and improves function for some musculoskeletal conditions, Sun noted."

Former President Pranab Mukherjee Saturday lamented that the country does not have proper environment in its institutional system and called for the development of both infrastructure and quality of education. Mukherjee mentioned three graduates, who had been products of Indian universities but got the coveted prize while working abroad.

""After 1930 no Indian working in basic research in Indian University got Noble prize. Sir C V Raman was the first and the last (Nobel winner). ""Side by side, I mention that three Indian graduates -- Amartya Sen from Calcutta University, Hargobind Khurana from Punjab University and Subramaniam Chandrasekhar got Noble prize,"" he said adding that they got the prize while working not in Indian universities. Therefore, it points out the basic lacuna that the country does not have proper environment in our institutional system, he said.

""What is needed that we should not only have physical expansion of infrastructure facility in higher education but also quality of education should start from the school,"" Mukherjee said here. Addressing the 10th Foundation Day celebration of the Indian Institute of Management, Ranchi, Mukherjee referred to how Rabindranath Tagore used to take classes at the primary level.

Stressing on the importance of research, innovation and total development of the faculty of the students, he said many a prominent personality, including Swami Vivekananda and Sarvapali Radhakrishnan, repeatedly pointed out that education is not just collection of information. ""That type of information is of no use. It must assimilate and along with assimilation it must build up the inherent strength of the learner, the student,"" the former President said.

Touching upon the GDP growth, Mukherjee said how India had less than one per cent of growth in the first half of the last century and reaching 7.1 per cent in 2015-16. He said important economies by and large agree that 8 per cent to 10 per cent GDP growth for one-and-a-half decades at least is needed to address the basic problem of hunger, poverty and disease. ""Therefore, it is utmost important that we must have not only educational institutions but also quality education,"" Mukherjee added.

Saying how former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao initiated and encouraged liberalization in 1991-92 and another former Prime Minister and the then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh implemented it, Mukherjee said India has to continue its march forward and has to sustain the growth rate."
