Police said the 53-year-old teacher sustained injuries to his head and was taken to a nearby private hospital for first-aid, following which he was referred to the AIIMS trauma centre.

The incident took place around 8.30 am at a south Delhi school.

Police received a PCR call at 9.35 am informing them that a teacher had been attacked by a student inside the class. Police said they have registered a case under IPC Section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) and teams have been formed to look for the student.

""The student who carried out the assault had very poor attendance; neither he nor his guardians attended the parent-teacher meeting held last week, during which report cards were given. After taking attendance, the teacher asked the boy why his attendance was so poor and why he didn't attend the PTM. He then handed over his report card to him. The boy tore the report card and flung it at him. This angered the teacher, and he said he would call the boy's guardians. He asked the boy to open his bag to check if he brought his books. When the boy refused, he called up his family and spoke to either his uncle or brother. After he hung up, the boy took out an iron rod from his bag and hit the teacher,"" said fellow teacher at the school.

According to the teacher, students said the boy allegedly hit the man until he collapsed, after which he jumped over the school wall and fled. Some students reportedly tried to stop him, but claimed that he tried to hit them too.

Students called the other teachers, who took the injured man to hospital.

Following the incident, the school was visited by officials from the Directorate of Education and teachers' associations. An official from the DoE confirmed that though the boy allegedly tried to hit some students while running away, none of them were injured.

According to teachers, the incident has left both students and teachers scared.

Recently, the BMC suspended 20 teachers from across the city for unauthorized absence ranging between three months to almost four years and affecting the quality of education.

According to the BMC education officer, Mahesh Palkar, the civic body took stock of teacher attendance in the past and a few teachers would be suspended. ""The attendance was collated but action wasn't taken on most occasions, only one or two teachers were suspended. But, now we have taken stock of the situation and found a large number of them not reporting to work regularly. Some of them have been suspended for not conducting classes when being present or other malpractices,"" he said.

Along with the suspension orders, the BMC has also sent show-cause notices to the 20 teachers which include four heads of schools. While 16 teachers have been suspended over absence, three others are suspended for other reasons. ""Further action will be determined on the basis of the responses to the notice. The teachers will remain suspended until the end of the inquiry,"" said Palkar.

The BMC will now conduct the exercise more regularly. ""Every three months we will check the report and initiate action against those who are found to be at fault. This way, the unauthorized absence will not go unchecked for more than three months,"" he added.

Ramesh Joshi, who heads Brihanmumbai Mahapalika Shikshak Sabha, the BMC teachers' union, said the teachers had begun approaching them to respond to the notices. ""Teachers need to understand the importance to taking permissions from the department before going on long leaves. If there are medical reasons, they need to provide supporting documents,"" he said.

Member of the BMC education committee, Sainath Durge said, ""It is a good initiative if it is done through natural justice."""
