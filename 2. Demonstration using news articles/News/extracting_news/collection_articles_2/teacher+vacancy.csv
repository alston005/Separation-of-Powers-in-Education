Out of the 1,172 vacant headmaster posts in government schools across the state, 1,167 posts were filled through the counselling. Of these, 1,040 posts were filled with postgraduate teachers, said V M Michaelraj, state information and communication secretary of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers' Association.

""Already, there were around 2,000 postgraduate teacher vacancies in the state. After the headmaster promotion counselling, it has gone up to 3,000 vacancies. The state government should fill the vacancies soon taking into account the welfare of Class XI and Class XII students.""

A section of school teachers said the vacancies should be filled by deputing surplus teachers from high schools. ""Earlier, vacant posts were filled by deputing qualified graduate teachers. The school education department should think of filing these vacant posts too in the same way,"" said a government school teacher, who didn't want to be named.

However, another section of teaches said if graduate teachers were already burdened with work as they handle Classes VI-IX, postgraduate teachers could be deputed. T Arulanandam, Coimbatore district president of Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers' Association, said postgraduate teachers with lesser work allotment could be deputed to nearby schools, where there are vacancies.

Promotion counselling could be a better solution, opined teachers. ""A promotion counselling should be held to fill the vacant postgraduate teacher vacancies, as there is a danger of an acute shortage of such teachers across the state to handle Classes XI and XII,"" Arulanandam said.

When contacted, Pradeep Yadav, principal secretary to the school department of school education, said the department had not yet decided on holding a counselling. ""But we will take measures to fill the vacant postgraduate teacher posts in government schools immediately.""

After six years, the school education department had on July 2 conducted counselling to fill vacant headmaster posts in government high school across the state. Counselling was stopped for a long time as a petition seeking a direction to the state government to include postgraduate teachers as eligible candidates for headmaster posts was pending before the Madras high court. The plea was filed by postgraduate teachers in 2012."
