They also arrested the driver of a backhoe loader as work by the heavy machine allegedly led to the mishap.

The owner and driver of a backhoe loader were among the six named in an FIR over the incident, the police said.

""Two of the accused were arrested on Thursday by officers from Sector 49 police station. One of them is the owner of the school, while the other is the driver of a backhoe loader. The principal has already been arrested. The police will nab the other three accused soon,"" said Noida City Superintendent of Police Sudha Singh.

Owner Amit Bhati has claimed that he had rented out the plot for â‚¹10,000 per month in March 2017, and that K.M. Public School was run by principal Sanjeev Jha and vice-principal Raghvender Solnaki. The principal was arrested earlier.

Two students died while three others were critically injured after the boundary wall of the unauthorised school in Sector 45 here collapsed on them around 9.30 a.m. on Monday. The students were writing an exam at the time the incident.

The police said the construction material used to build the boundary walls was of poor quality. The trigger for the collapse was construction in an adjacent plot. It is alleged that as the backhoe loader and excavator being used at the adjacent site reached the school's boundary wall it collapsed on the students.

The parents of the deceased students accused the school administration for the accident and demanded strict action against the management. They said the school had claimed it was affiliated to recognised boards. The parents had protested on a road in front of Sector 49 police station, leading to a jam.

The deceased have been identified as Vivek Kumar (7) and Bhupender Singh (10), while the injured students are Naitik (8), Amit (7), Ashish Kumar (8) and Akaash (9) -- all students of Class I.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had ordered a magisterial-level probe into the matter."

An unrecognised school lost two entire batches when parents pulled out their children from classes 8 and 9, and admitted them in government schools.

The private unrecognised school in Kayyur-Cheemeni gram panchayat is reduced to up to class 7 this academic year, said panchayat president K Sakunthala, who led the campaign. In the run-up the admission season this year, the CPM-controlled panchayat had launched a sustained 'people's movement' against unrecognised private schools.

""Our target was to bring at least half of the students in unrecognised schools back to government-run schools,"" she said. ""There was a perception that private schools are better. We showed the facts. This particular private school does not even have a playground,"" she said.

Ahead of the campaign, the panchayat conducted a survey and found that 354 students from Kayyur-Cheemeni were studying in unrecognised schools. ""We managed to get 132 of them to government-run schools this academic year,"" she said. The president said the panchayat was not wrapping up the campaign. ""It is an ongoing conversation with the parents to convince them that government schools are better than unrecognised schools,"" she said.

The panchayat has set itself a target of 2020 to bring all the students in unrecognised schools to government-aided or run schools, and stop new enrolment in such schools. There are two unrecognised schools in the panchayat.

""In the second school, only 50% of its UKG students joined its class I,"" said K M Anil Kumar, a school teacher and convenor of the Panchayat Public education Protection Committee, formed to steer the campaign. He said Government Higher Secondary School in Cheemeni attracted 35 of the 132 students who left unrecognised schools. ""It is the highest,"" he said.

The private schools which lost two batches had 26 students in class 7 and nine students in class 8.

""Instead of joining the next level, all the 33 students took their TC and joined neighbouring schools,"" said Anil Kumar.

In all, 77 students joined government schools in Kayyur-Cheemeni and 55 students joined schools in neighbouring Pilocode. Kelappaji Memorial High School at Kodakkad in Pilocode got 20 students because of the campaign.GUPS, Padikeen enrolled 19 students, Government Welfare UP School, Kodakkad, got 15 students, and GUPS, Nalilkkandam, got 13 students from unrecognised schools.

The panchayat said it had conducted Education Gram Sabhas in all wards and door-to-door campaigns to persuade the parents to exit unrecognised schools. It said it was planning to conduct special tuition classes for students weak in mathematics, English and science.

""It was a demand that came from parents during gram sabha meetings urging the panchayat to make an intervention,"" said the convenor. The panchayat said it would roll out a scheme for the students this month itself."

A school without recognition since 2014, its van ferrying children for the last four years without registration or permit, a driver without the requisite experience and an unmanned level crossing -- these are the many administrative failures that the police say led to Thursday's tragedy in Kushinagar that killed 13 students.

A team of officers from the district administration, basic education department, as well as police, began a detailed inquiry Friday.

The manager and principal of Divine Mission School, K J Khan, where the students studied, was arrested and sent to jail on Friday. Amongst the charges slapped against him are IPC sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (endangering life of others), 304 (culpable homicide) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy).

""The fact that he was running an unrecognised school and allowed van without proper documentation to ferry students saw the charge of criminal conspiracy against him,"" said Bishunpur police station house officer (SHO) Sanjay Kumar Singh.

Without recognition, it was allegedly a neighbouring school that gave transfer certificates to students of Divine Mission School.

District Inspector of Schools, Kushinagar, Uday Mishra said, ""As per the information given to me, the school had classes till grade VIII and the Seth Bansi Dhar School was giving certificates to students of this school but a detailed inquiry would reveal further facts.""

The Basic Education Department issued a fresh reminder on Friday to all the District Basic Education officers to check unrecognised schools in their respective regions and take action.

""We have regularly conducted drives against unrecognised schools and have taken action against those we have detected,"" said Sarvendra Vikram Singh, Director, Basic Education Department. When asked if they had any information on Divine Mission School during previous drives, Singh said he had no knowledge of it.

Meanwhile, he said, the driver Niyaz Ansari had got his driving licence just over a month ago. ""The Supreme Court had ruled that only drivers with at least five years of experience to drive school vehicles,"" he added. Ansari's age is also being questioned. While police were told he was 22 years old, this would also be looked into during the detailed inquiry, SHO Singh said.

Out of the four students admitted at BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur soon after the accident, two were reported to be out of danger Friday. The other two are still unconscious, while the driver Niyaz Ansari remains critical.

In a bid to map ""out of school"" children (those who are not attending school according to government) and bring them back to mainstream education system, the Ministry of Human Resource Development is going to conduct a survey and all those enrolled at such unrecognised institutions such as madrasas, gompas (Buddhist schools) and Vedic pathshalas, will be tagged under this category.

There are a large number of unrecognised madrasas, which are attached to religious institutions in the country and so are Vedic pathshalas, which impart basic knowledge on chanting mantras and teach Sanskrit texts.

This was one of the major suggestions that emerged in the report of the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) sub-committee, which was submitted to the ministry recently. CABE is the largest decision making body on all matters related to education. The report, a copy of which is with DNA read, ""There are a large number of children attending unrecognised schools/institutions. These schools/ institutions may or may not provide regular, mainstream education. Children attending all such institutions are to be treated as 'out of school', even if they provide regular education.""

""It is very important that at the time of mapping these unrecognised institutions, madrasas, vedic pathshalas, gompas, and other form of non-formal education centres are mapped and children enrolled there are counted as 'out of school',"" it added.

Apart from this, the ministry is also considering having a standardised definition of ""out of school"" children, which will be included in all government data bases.

The committee also suggested steps to mainstream children and once they are brought into the mainstream, their status should be changed to ""in school"" child in the database."
