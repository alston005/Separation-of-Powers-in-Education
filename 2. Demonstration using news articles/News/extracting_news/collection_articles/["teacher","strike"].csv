Congress on Monday, 31 December, said in Lok Sabha that it is ready for a debate on the Rafale jet deal on Wednesday, 2 January.

""Jaitley ji has thrown a challenge ... we are ready for a debate on 2 January. Please decide a time,"" Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said.

He made these remarks soon after the House gave its nod to additional gross expenditure of Rs 85,948.86 crore during the current fiscal ending March 2019.

At 2.00 pm, when the House was to take up discussion on Supplementary Demands for Grants, Kharge repeated his demand for a joint parliamentary committee to probe the Rafale deal.

2. Bhima Koregaon: Before Memorial Day, Fear Under Security Blanket

Many who will welcome the new year under flimsy pandals around the Bhima Koregaon war memorial have spent every December 31 here, swatting mosquitoes and singing Ambedkarite songs to distract from the cold. But January 1, 2019, is different. It marks a year of deepening faultlines at the site of the 1818 war that saw a Colonial army, helped by a Mahar regiment, defeat the Peshwas. This new year, the day that marks the overthrow of upper-caste rule is time to mull over what remains a divided society.

""It's going to be peaceful tomorrow,"" says Santosh Davne, 35, from Nanded. A vendor of trinkets featuring Dr B R Ambedkar and the Buddha, the disabled Davne has been visiting the Jaystambh, the obelisk to honour soldiers who died on January 1, 1818, on the banks of the Bhima, for 12 years. ""I set up a stall every year, but I have never seen such police presence or such quiet fear among people,"" he says.

4. MP, Raj Governments Must Withdraw Bharat Bandh Cases or Lose Support, Mayawati Warns Cong

Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Monday threatened to reconsider support to the Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan if they failed to withdraw the cases lodged against people who participated in the 'Bharat Bandh' organised on April 2 over the alleged dilution of the SC/ST Act.

The BSP is supporting the Congress governments in both the states from the outside.

Mayawati said there was a need to warn the Congress regarding unfulfilled promises on the New Year's eve as well as in view of the coming Lok Sabha election.

The Congress governments should not back away from the promises the party had made during the assembly election in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, she said in a press statement.

6. Gujarat Changes Roll Call: Jai Hind, Jai Bharat to Replace Present, Teacher

Taking inspiration from a Rajasthan teacher who was honoured in Ahmedabad last Saturday by RSS-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the Gujarat government Monday asked all schools to ensure that students respond with ""Jai Bharat"" or ""Jai Hind"" during roll call from January 1.

The Government Resolution (GR) was issued in a circular by the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, and Director, Primary Education. ""In order to instil nationalism from a young age, it is directed that students of all schools, government, grant-in-aid as well as private, should say 'Jai Bharat' or 'Jai Hind', instead of 'Yes sir' or 'Present sir' across the state from January 1, 2019. Ensure this is followed across all schools,"" the circular states.

7. 30 Lakh Reapply for Inclusion in Assam NRC

About 30 lakh of the 40.07 lakh people left out of the final draft of the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) published five months ago have applied again for inclusion during the claims and objections round that ended on Monday.

During the phase, 600 objections also came in from those who doubted the citizenship of others included in the draft.

The window for 40.07 lakh of the 3.29 crore applicants excluded from the complete draft was opened on 25 September. It was to have closed on 15 December, but the Supreme Court, which is monitoring the exercise, extended the last day to 31 December after the Assam government said the panchayat election, held on 5 and 9 December, had robbed the people and officials of precious time.

8. Pumps to Remove Water from Meghalaya Mine on Tuesday

Personnel of multiple agencies engaged in the search and rescue operation for at least 13 miners trapped in a coal mine at Ksan in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills, found a wooden structure, coal and mud near the bottom of the pit on Monday.

Six divers of the Indian Navy and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had on Sunday detected a few rat-holes - narrow tunnels where miners have to crawl into to extract coal.

R. Susngi, spokesperson for the district administration, said the site had been cleared for the Odisha Fire Service to start pumping out water from the main shaft measuring about 150 sq ft in area and about 350 ft deep. Other shafts were being prepared to keep at least three of the 10 high-power pumps brought from Odisha operating for longer durations, he said.

9. Pujara and Kohli Difference Between Two Sides, Says Australia Coach Langer

Australian coach Justin Langer has lamented a lack of world-class batsmen in his side's line-up and pointed out that Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara have been the difference for the visitors in the on-going four-match Test series.

India won the third Test at the MCG by 137 runs to take an unassailable 2-1 lead in the series. The fourth Test begins in Sydney on Thursday, 3 January.

""At this stage, the difference in the series is Pujara and Kohli, if we're frank. Pujara averages 53 and Kohli has averaged 46 and got a duck in the second innings. The lesson we learn from that is he just absorbed all our pressure,"" Langer said on Monday.

The one word that fascinates Indian cricket team's bowling coach Bharat Arun is consistency. He will talk pace, wrist and seam positions, control, mindset, attitude, aggression, but it's consistency that is his underlying mantra. Consistency in lines and lengths and, most importantly, in execution.

The former India pacer is masterminding what is clearly the nascent stages of the golden era of Indian fast bowling. At his command as the bowling coach of the national side is a bunch of exciting and electric talent that has made the cricketing world sit up and take notice. From the unquestioned land of tantalizing spin, India has graduated into a nursery for quicks of all ilk; more by design than accident, the man who played two Test matches and four One-Day Internationals in the mid-1980s has been entrusted with the responsibility of carrying the stock of Indian fast bowling forward.

A job he is performing with aplomb.

At first glance, Arun doesn't give the impression of being a guru to developing young quicks. Stocky of frame, he is far removed from the modern-day lithe, athletic backroom staff that drive international teams. But then again, it is not for the 56-year-old to bustle in and deliver the ball at ferocious pace. He is the guide and mentor, the teacher who makes subtle alterations while empowering his charges to make their own decisions, and take responsibility for those calls.

Arun's was a first-class career less fulfilled - in 48 matches, he picked up only 110 wickets at 32.44. One of several young quicks tried out as a potential new-ball partner to Kapil Dev, he never played for the country after two home Tests against Sri Lanka, only to find his true calling as a coach.

At the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore, then with the Tamil Nadu and Hyderabad teams, and now with the national side in his second stint as the bowling coach, Arun has been integral to the explosion of India's pace riches. To suggest that the quick-bowling array is delivering only because of the bowling coach will be a disrespect to athletes' skills and their other coaches, but there is no denying the fact that Arun has nudged them in the right direction, whispering the right words in the right ears at the right time, occasionally wielding the stick but generally happy to dangle the carrot and encourage the bowlers to think for themselves.

Arun joined the Indian set-up in England in August 2014 when Ravi Shastri came on board as the team director, and held that position until July 2016 when Anil Kumble assumed charge as head coach. Once Shastri returned, this time as the head coach, in June 2017, so did Arun, who shares a fabulous relationship with his one-time mate at the junior level.

Without a doubt, his greatest contribution is in resisting the temptation to tinker with Jasprit Bumrah's unique and singularly unorthodox action. Unlike Sri Lanka where quirky (not to be confused with suspect) actions are dime a dozen, India have generally tended to place their faith in the conventional, though things are clearly changing with the arrival of Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav, the first wrist-spinner to represent the country.

So remarkably ungainly is Bumrah's action that the obvious thing to do would have been be revamp it in toto to get him to fall in line with the accepted norms of pace bowling, notably getting side-on at the time of delivery.

""The first time when I went to the NCA, he was there and he saw my action,"" Bumrah said in Melbourne the other day of his first interaction with Arun. ""I have been lucky in that he saw my action and he didn't want to change that. He always believed in this action, but he said I had to become stronger. 'We won't change your action, instead we will work on the consistency and everything else will follow', is what he told me.""

Arun explained why he backed Bumrah, with his strange delivery style, to stick to what came to him naturally. ""I felt that Bumrah was able to generate a lot of pace with his action, which is unique, but it puts a lot of strain on his body. It was a challenge and we had a discussions with the physios and trainers,"" he pointed out.

""We came to the conclusion that we need to work on him to become extremely strong to be able to sustain his bowling. What makes him so special is that he is so unique. Maybe the batsmen pick his balls a little later than they normally do from a clean action, that makes him so much more potent. Most batsmen who played him even during the IPL have said that it was difficult to pick him. He was someone who did exceptionally well in the domestic championships as well.""

Bumrah has repaid the faith by establishing himself as the pace spearhead in red-ball cricket in exactly 12 months, picking up 48 wickets in nine Tests including five-fors in match-winning causes in Johannesburg, Nottingham and now Melbourne. Even though he is the youngest, he is the leader of a sniping pack that includes Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Hardik Pandya. Waiting in the wings, or playing white-ball internationals, are Khaleel Ahmed, Shardul Thakur, Deepak Chahar and Mohammad Siraj, who burst through with 41 wickets in the 2016-17 Ranji Trophy season when Arun was the Hyderabad head coach and plotted their march to the quarter-finals.

""Every time I have something to sort out or to look for moral support, I speak to Arun sir, he has been a huge source of encouragement always,"" Siraj has said. ""I asked him what I should do as I transitioned directly into red-ball cricket. He told me to focus on the same things I've always done and not to try anything new. So I kept at it.""

To Arun, consistency gives bowlers the ability to take factors such as flatness or otherwise of the surface, and atmospheric conditions, out of the equation. ""It's not just about doing well - it's the effort and consistency with which we are able to perform over a period of time that's very encouraging,"" he said ahead of the Perth Test a fortnight back.

""Consistency was a bit of an issue on previous tours and that's something we've addressed with the bowlers. It's something we've really worked hard on. The one-percenters which we insist even during practice - the bowlers have responded exceptionally well. It's very simple. Each time they bowl in the nets, they need to be aware of their plans and what they need to execute. Each time, it's a little different. We test as to how well they've executed, that feedback allows them to be more consistent. I ask the bowlers what their plans are, and as long as those are in line with what we want to execute in the game, that's perfectly alright.""

It isn't just the pacers who have benefitted from Arun's expertise. R Ashwin, the off-spinner with towering numbers, told this writer three years back, after India's tour of Sri Lanka in 2015, ""The amount of knowledge and the amount of confidence and the grip that I have over my skill now is definitely a marked difference from what I had some years ago. The major reason I have to attribute that to is Bharat Arun because the amount of questions I had, he had all the answers for it. When you have answers and when you have someone who is empowering you to do all these things, it makes my job a lot easier.

Ashwin met Arun at Chepauk when he was director of the TNCA Academy and set about trying to become the best in the world.

""Where we met and drew a line was that we were never hesitant in trying or experimenting because you try and rediscover and discover new things every single day. The one thing he always says is everything is inside you, it just needs to be brought out. And what exactly is bringing out? Bringing out is giving yourself a chance to succeed, at the same time not worrying about your failures. We worked on angles, we worked on actions. I understood from him what exactly loading is, where are the allowable leeways in terms of making an error. I thus started delving into technique. He gave me manuals and books. I started thinking like a coach and wherever I had doubts, I used to put it across to him,"" Ashwin said.

Arun has, understandably, an easy relationship with Ashwin, especially given that they both hail from Chennai.

""Ashwin has been extremely confident, he's aware of what he's doing. It's important that a spinner discovers the things he can do,"" Arun said. ""For that to happen, a coach can give the necessary feedback because most often, what the bowlers think they're doing and what they're actually doing can be two different things. If you can bridge that gap, that's when the bowlers can grow.""

India's bowlers have truly grown over the past 12 months in particular, which has manifested itself in enhanced overseas results to go with customary stirring success at home. Arun hasn't bowled a single ball himself, but there is an Arun hand in every strike. As the bowlers themselves testify."

He told PTI that although in 1993, Delhi got a legislative assembly, 2018 saw ""another milestone"" in terms of governance and democracy.

Also, 2018 saw less of rabble-rousing between the AAP government and the Lt Governor's office as compared to the past after the July 4 Supreme Court order.

The apex court had ruled that the lieutenant governor of Delhi is bound by the ""aid and advice"" of the Delhi government. Earlier, both the AAP government and the LG had been on loggerhead over administrative issues.

""In 1993, Delhi got the power to elect government, but Delhi's democratically-elected government got full power to work in 2018 after the SC verdict.

""It was a major breakthrough to strengthen democracy... 2018 will be remembered as a 'landmark year' in the history of Delhi,"" Sisodia said.

2018 also saw passing of several ambitious projects of the AAP government, including doorstep delivery of ration, installation of CCTVs across the city among others.

However, the deputy chief minister rued that as services do not come under the Delhi government, the AAP dispensation cannot create new posts.

A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court reserved its order on services and other issues and an order in this regard can come anytime.

""As the Delhi government does not have power of services, we cannot create new posts. We can open news schools, but when it comes to hiring teachers, it will be done by the LG. We can open new hospitals, but hiring of doctors will be executed by the lieutenant governor,"" he said.

Sisodia hoped that in 2019, services will come under the Delhi government.

In 2019, the Aam Aadmi Party government plans to conclude its ongoing or pending projects such as free Wi-Fi, setting up of 1,000 mohalla clinics and doorstep delivery of ration among others.

Giving details about the government's upcoming projects, Sisodia said that the AAP dispensation will start entrepreneurship curriculum for students of class 9 to 12 for 2019, a move aimed at giving an opportunity to youths to become job providers instead of job seekers.

Also, the government will open teacher-training university and sports university in 2019, he said, adding that the process of executing these projects is in the final stage.

According to Sisodia, the proposed teachers' university is aimed at giving quality training to teachers. Sports university will offer various curriculum to youths, intended to encourage youths towards sports.

Another project which will be executed in 2019 is free Wi-Fi. The government is considering two-three modules to provide free-Wi-Fi, a pre-poll promise of the Aam Aadmi Party.

""We are currently considering two-three modules. The Delhi government is on it. Technologies with regard to Wi-Fi are getting changed day-by-day. I can say that in 2019, Delhi will get free Wi-Fi,"" Sisodia said.

Talking about AAP government's doorstep delivery of services, Sisodia said that as of now, 40 services, including driving licence, certificates of birth, death, income and marriage, are being provided to Delhiites at their doorstep.

""We will start providing a total of 100 government services by the end of current financial year,"" he said.

Looking back at 2018, the tussle between the AAP government and former chief secretary Anshu Prakash was a major issue.

In February, Prakash had alleged assault by some AAP legislators in front of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Sisodia at the CM's residence.

The incident triggered a political storm, with the BJP and the Congress seeking to attack the AAP which vehemently rejected Prakash's allegations.

Following the alleged assault, IAS and DANICS officers boycotted attending meetings with cabinet ministers, including the chief minister, to register their protest demanding an apology over the issue.

In June, Kejriwal, Sisodia and cabinet ministers Gopal Rai and Satyendar Jain staged a sit-in at the LG's office, demanding that the lieutenant governor direct IAS officers to end their ""strike"" and order action against those who had struck work for ""four months"".

The ministers had also demanded the LG's approval for the doorstep delivery of rations. Following the sit-in, Lt Governor Anil Baijal started working from home."

The doctors want promotions for nearly 40 medicos in the hospital.

The passengers, however, remained a little jittery. Police, meanwhile, arrested four more persons from Baguiati on Friday in connection with Thursday's agitation, taking the total arrest count to 18.

The agitators, police said, belonged to the same group, members of which were arrested in Lake Town on Thursday for forcing passengers out of cabs. Police said this is the group that had probably vandalised Uber's office in Salt Lake. ""So, the agitation was a planned one,"" said an officer. Police booked the arrested persons under IPC sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 427 (mischief to cause damage).

Commuters were upset over the violent attitude of the cabbies. ""People choose app-cabs over yellow cabs even if the fare is higher because of a sense of security. The riders can even share their real-time travel route with family and friends. We expect Uber-Ola drivers to be ahead of those of yellow cabs as far as behaviour is concerned. But what happened yesterday will make me think twice before allowing my wife and daughter to travel alone in an app cab,"" said Biswanath Dasgupta, a teacher.

In fact, some of the agitating cabbies were blocked from accessing the app meant for driver-partners because they did not make commuters feel secure in cabs. App-cab aggregators claimed that the current conflict between cabbies and aggregators is because of the temporary or long-term blocking of 'errant' drivers.

The second reason behind blocking a driver is cancellation of multiple rides. ""We block drivers who cancel rides frequently. Our policy is to ensure no refusal to commuters. This makes app cabs different from yellow taxis. We will keep blocking such driver-partners to sustain the model,"" said an aggregator.

Leaders of Online Cab Operators' Guild, which had called the strike and whose members allegedly disrupted the services by other operators, admitted that a section of cabbies certainly exceeded the limit of civility.

The passengers want administration and aggregators to clamp down on such rowdy elements and bar them from driving cabs. Tapas Pradhan, a Haridevpur resident, said, ""I was so unnerved to see the aggressive body language of the cabbies on Thursday that today I travelled by a yellow cab. But I had to wait for long to catch a yellow taxi. After this three-day strike, I feel that we have gone back to the yellow-cab era, when you are at the mercy of the cabbies.""

Some of the agitating drivers had vandalised Uber's office in Salt Lake. Uber said that they were in the process of lodging FIR against the cabbies involved in the attack."

I told them that, on the contrary, the movie was for them and their children. It helps society become aware that this is not happening in a faraway land, but right in our neighbourhood. We can't view the world with rose-tinted glasses. I wanted to be a part of such a story, that too, told from the point of view of a female police officer. Hichki was about a teacher with Tourette, who is asked to tutor a bunch of underprivileged children. In a strange way, both of them are in the same boat. Together, they learn that you can turn your weakness into strength.

They are based on subjects that are relevant -- child trafficking and issues with the education system. They also pointed to the fact that people judge you for your outer appearance instead of your merit. When you see a woman in a cop's uniform, you may wonder whether she will be able to protect you. But that shouldn't be the case because an officer is that, irrespective of the gender. Similarly, a teacher's Tourette Syndrome doesn't mean she won't be good at her job. There were so many layers to these characters.

I think, when people look back at these films, they will realise how important they were. When a movie releases in the midst of what you are living in, you may not realise its importance at that point in time but you will, five years down the line. It will impact change in the society and the thought process. It takes time for an actual change to come about in a society, but these films will help kick-start that process.

I have always believed that content is king. Whenever a story tugs at your heartstrings and has an emotional connect, it will find an audience. Now, how big a viewership it will get is when you need to look at the box office. Even if it's a moderate hit, you know that it has been liked. For me, the learning has been to always listen to your gut and instinct because when I signed both these movies, I didn't expect them to become the hits that they did. But I believed in the stories. I knew that I wanted these stories to be told because these subjects were relevant. It was about believing in myself and the stories. I also realised that if there is a producer willing to make a film like this, then as an actor, I have to back it too. Whether or not it does well, the intention is right. And when the film succeeds, that's a bonus because what you had set out to achieve, you have managed to meet it.

With Hichki, there were many more question marks because I was married, a mother. So, would the audience want to see me? That myth was broken and I realised a lot of people wanted to see me (smiles), so that was great. I can be part of the cinema and the stories I want to tell. At the same time, I love entertaining films, so whenever I do a film with a message, it is necessary to make them entertaining as well. Nobody wants to hear a lecture that's boring. I want to be part of films that can strike a balance between both these aspects. When I know that there's an audience who wants to see me, I can dabble in various genres. It gives me happiness to know that the viewer doesn't shut you out because you are married or have kids. They do that when you don't make good films, it's as simple as that.

I think there are some similarities between our cultures, backgrounds and family values. Perhaps, Hichki worked so well over there because they related to the teacher-student relationship. It's the victory of the script and content. The Chinese government really loved the movie and agreed to release it there. I remember being in a room full of Chinese audience watching a Hindi movie, clapping and crying. That was a surreal feeling. Then to meet professors from the university and for them to say they wanted to be like Naina... it was something else. Even when we had a screening in Mumbai for 300 teachers across Maharashtra, they and the principals got emotional. Many of them said Naina has become an inspiration to them. And I got to hear the same thing in China. That was amazing.

I can't really say that because I never faced that problem. In fact, I've always got meaty roles, right from Raja Ki Aayegi Baarat to Yuva or Black and Bunty Aur Babli. They were equal to the men or even more, but never less. As an actor, it's our responsibility to choose the right characters. It doesn't matter if it's like the one I did in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (Tina's part) but it has to be impactful. Length of a role is never the issue, the substance is what matters. Actors shouldn't confuse a bigger role with an important one. You could have a small part in the film, but it should leave an impact rather than being in the entire film and not making one. I have always wanted to do films that talk about the modern Indian woman. My roles have always depicted her. So, there's always a direct connect.

I don't really make any resolutions. Every new project that I sign becomes my resolution. I know that for this project, I need to achieve a set of goals. For Hichki, I needed to look like I did pre-motherhood. I wanted to get back in shape so that I would look the part. Now, I need to look like a cop for Mardaani 2, so my entire process will be dictated by that. Also, for me, it's very important that each day I spend with my daughter is special. So, to maintain a balance between my work and personal life is my resolution every year (laughs)."

Cricket has always been bursting at the seams with rags-to-riches stories. This by itself is not surprising for a sport that requires so much infrastructure and capital (aerodynamic bats, pads, chest guards, little boxes to protect the family jewels). Especially in India, where the Indian Premier League (IPL) has converted an already cash-rich situation into a seemingly bottomless pit of money. Earlier this year, STAR won the telecast rights to Indian cricket for the next five years -- the cost was an eye-popping ₹6,100 crore. And so we have well-meaning stories about boys from small towns or villages literally becoming millionaires overnight -- Munaf Patel, the Pathan brothers, among others.

Netflix India's latest original series, Selection Day (based on Aravind Adiga's 2016 novel of the same name), at first glance seems to be a tragicomic commentary on this Great Indian Cricketing Dream, before gently unfurling its larger story and revealing itself to be a far subtler beast. Shifting roles, like some of the great all-rounders of the game, the show is, at various moments, a high-school comedy, a cautionary Mumbai fable, and an underdog sports drama in the vein of classics such as Miracle and Any Given Sunday.

Created by Marston Bloom (actor Anil Kapoor is one of the producers), the series -- six episodes of 20-23 minutes each -- was released yesterday.

Radha (Mohammad Samad from Tumbbad) and Manju (Yash Dholye) are brothers brought up by the soccer-dad-to-beat-all-soccer-dads -- a petty, single-minded, violent man called Mohan Kumar (Rajesh Tailang from Mukkabaaz). We're told that Mohan married a hockey champion from Karnataka specifically to produce athletic kids -- he's the sort of man who drops nuggets like these in casual conversation, with visible relish. It is implied that he beat up his wife, who then left for her mother's place. His sons are afraid of him but have no real avenue to express their frustration. Friendless, they trudge in and out of their brutal, custom-made daily training routines. Even their long-term plans of emancipating themselves hinge on cricketing success.

The beating heart of the story is the way almost everybody -- and not just Mohan -- views Radha and Manju as resources rather than people. The once-famous cricket coach Kulkarni aka Tommy Sir (Mahesh Manjrekar) sees the brothers as the cricketing legends he always wanted to discover. Their principal Nellie Weinberg (Ratna Pathak Shah) sees them as vehicles for her school's sporting revival, and a way to honour her late husband Max's passion for cricket. Real estate jackal Anand Mehta (a character very different from his book counterpart, played by up-and-coming actor Akshay Oberoi) has ulterior motives of his own when he steps in to sponsor the brothers. The rich kid/school bully Javed (Karanvir Malhotra), who's also the captain of the cricket team, views them as a distraction from his privileged, anodyne existence -- until he and Manju strike up an unlikely friendship, one that forces the latter to confront suppressed truths about himself.

Shiv Pandit, in a cutesy experiment, plays Lord Shiva -- or a pop art version of him, who speaks to Manju in a series of visions, offering sage advice and the occasional wisecrack. It's unclear whether someone at Netflix made the let's-get-Shiv-to-play-Shiva joke, but Pandit wears the role lightly -- clearly having a lot of fun while at it.

The standout performance, however, comes from Manjrekar as Tommy Sir, once seen as the kingmaker of Mumbai cricket. Manjrekar's weary dialogue delivery, his eye-bags and his air of wounded pride are inch-perfect for the role. We are shown how Tommy Sir turned his back on cricket and slipped into his new role as Art teacher, how he pulls the blinds in his classroom to stop students from watching a cricket game at the school ground.

Manjrekar brings gravitas to a cricketing tragedy that could just as easily have descended into self-harm and a never-ending series of drunken evenings. Bollywood, sadly, has tended to use Manjrekar the actor in hammy, over-the-top villainous roles (viewers of Marathi cinema know better). This, for me, is as good as we've ever seen the veteran director in front of the camera.

Not everything is immaculate, though -- the real estate part feels a little underwritten, despite another solid performance by Oberoi. Some high school scenes are uncomfortably close to caricatures, and prompt eye-rolls. Overall, though, Selection Day is a worthy adaptation of a fine novel, especially wherever it diverges from its source material and forges its own path.

""What is an Indian, after all? Picture today's young man from Mumbai or Delhi as a vulture above the nations, scavenging for his identity. He sees a pretty thing in Dubai, and he brings it home; he sees a pretty thing in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and he brings it home. One day he looks at his life, finds that it makes no sense at all, and then he turns to religion.""

In the novel, this is the passage where the Indian penchant for imitation is punctured -- luckily, the show chooses not to follow any one television template, and thank god for that."

It has been republished from The Quint's archives on the anniversary of the deadly tsunami that hit Chennai in 2004.)

26 December 2004

Wails and cries filled the air as everyone was screaming and running away from the shore. No one knew what a tsunami was and they didn't expect that the life-giving sea would change everything forever. The way they look at the ocean would never be the same again.

A number of government agencies and NGOs stepped in to help and most of them now live in pucca houses away from the coast with decent facilities, but every time they hear the roaring waves, their hearts still tremble with fear.

The fear resides in them even today.

""We fear to even look at the sea...even today. I would say don't come to this town at all. This has been ruined completely. This is like a graveyard but that's where we are living today.""

Kokila still remembers seeing the dead body of her best friend Sathyavani when she was just 10. Her school was completely ravaged to the ground but today she is serving as a teacher in the same school which has been transformed into one of Tamil Nadu's finest.

""My sister's hair was stuck in a tree and she struggled and died. I cried for help - there were so many people around but no one to help. Her dress was torn off. They buried her along with 80 people in a hole. I gave a new dress for her but they told me to get clothes for all, otherwise they cannot dress only my sister. I dropped the saree and ran back home.""

Roja was washed away in the tsunami and somehow managed to swim back to safety. Today, she doesn't go to the beach as much.

""If that day had been a working day, then all of us would've died. When tsunami happened, I wish we had died instead of so many children... because we didn't know what we would tell the parents of so many children who were killed. Even today, the wails and screams of the parents echo in my ears and I start tearing up.""

R Balu is the principal of Union Middle School of Keechankuppam who resurrected the school from ruins. It is now a smart school with all facilities and approved by the ISO.

""I had returned from the market and I heard that my two nephews who were trying to drag the boat to safety were washed away. We still haven't got their bodies. Even now my children are going into the sea, I am going to sit here till their return because I am scared.""

Rajamani sells dried fish on the beach near Velankanni Church in Nagapattinam, Tamil Nadu, and has built a house far away from the shore because of her fear of the sea.

""We were standing at the beach with our cameras as the then chief minister Jayalalithaa was going to survey the area on her helicopter. Suddenly someone said there was an earthquake in Indonesia and in half an hour, it will strike our coast. We ran for our lives and found higher ground near the bridge. But the Collector Radhakrishnan just stood strong looking for the helicopter.""

Senthil is a freelance journalist in Nagapattinam and Thiruvarur and has documented the struggles of the fisherfolk after the 2004 tsunami till date.

""We remember their sweet memories. We thank them because if they had been alive, we wouldn't be doing any of this. They sacrificed their lives so that we can prove to be good parents,'"" Parameshwaran.

Parameshwaran and his wife Choodamani lost their three children and seven relatives to the tsunami. When they were on the verge of committing suicide, they saw hundreds of children orphaned. They immediately adopted several of them and are living as a family of 34 today.

""The government thinks that by giving 2 lakh rupees, they have compensated our loss. Will that bring my children back to life? Since the tsunami, all us fisherfolk have not made any profits... living on 2 meals a day.""

Latha lost her sister-in-law and mother-in-law and today fears sending her son and husband for fishing everyday.

""Water entered our homes and my mother, brother and nephew died. We have seen rough waters but nothing like that. The word tsunami makes me run.""

Ramu is a fisherman who is still haunted by the tsunami as the people he used to go for fishing with are all dead today. He could never find their dead bodies.

""Everyone got compensation but no one realised people like us, carpenters and electricians, also suffered losses. Our lives are dependant on fishermen, if they are affected where will we get the food from?""

Karthikeyan was working as a carpenter before the 2004 tsunami and after that when everyone switched from wooden boats to steel, he began doing welding work.

""Tsunami came around 9:30am and I was standing on top of the lighthouse. I luckily escaped because I was on higher ground but I saw pilgrims who were at the beach doing the last rites for their loved ones being engulfed in the waves.""

V Chinnasamy works at the lighthouse at Nagapattinam and the stories of his fellow workers killed in the tsunami haunts him till date.

""My father died in the tsunami. My mother couldn't take care of me. A couple came to me and asked if they could take me home. With nowhere to go, I held on to their hands. When I first entered, there were 16 kids and everyone called each other sister, brother. So it began to feel like home.""

Saravanan was brought to Nambikkai, a children's home when he was 10. He has forgotten the scars of the past and is currently an MBA graduate working in Coimbatore.

She, however, urged them to withdraw their strike and join the schools, as students have already suffered a lot due to the long agitation.

Yadav, while addressing media at the state secretariat, said, ""State government is serous over para-teachers' issue and ready for dialogue, as it is the only way for solution of any problem. However, para-teachers should withdraw their agitation before the talk, as the ongoing strike has paralysed the education system in schools.""

She said para-teachers are spreading light of education in remote rural Jharkhand. ""So, their role cannot be ignored but they should also think about future of the school students,"" she said, adding, government understands their problems. ""It has been increased their remunerations at regular intervals,"" she said.

The minister said a TET pass teacher for Class-6 to Class-8 used to get Rs 8,400 a month before 2015. After a dialogue in 2015, TET pass teachers' remuneration increased to Rs 10,164. ""Now, government has decided to give them Rs 12000 a month,"" she said. Similarly, a trained teacher for Class-6 to Class-9, who used to get Rs 8,000 before 2015, would now get Rs 10,000.

She further said a TET pass teacher for Class-1 to Class-5 used to get Rs 7,800 per month before 2015. After the talk with para-teachers in 2015, their remuneration increased to Rs 9, 438. Now, government has increased their remuneration to Rs 11,000.

""Untrained teacher did not get any increment. Government is considering on the issue,"" Yadav said, adding, government is also setting up a corpus of Rs 10 crore for welfare of the para-teachers. Besides, their retirement age was also increased to 60.

The minister further said, ""Since it is an issue related to children's education, political parties should not take advantage of it for mere political mileage. It's a serious issue and all have to cooperate in it.""

Office bearers of Ekikrit Para Sikshak Sangharsh Morcha (EPSSM), an umbrella body of all para-teachers' associations, however, said they would not talk to government until it assured of regularization of services on pattern of Chhattisgarh. ""If government really wants to talk to us, it should invite through a formal letter and government should be ready to meet our demands,"" said EPSSM member Sanjay Dubey.

Over 45.000 para teachers are on strike since November 16 in support of their demands. They started hunger strike before residences of all legislators of Jharkhand from Monday. ""Excluding few ministers and legislators, para teachers sat on hunger before residences of most of legislators, which would continue government meets our demand,"" EPSSM member Vinod Tiwary."

Although from school and college records, he is now 72 years old. A striking persona with his carelessly wrapped turban and walrus moustache, he is an easy man to talk to, what with the treasure trove of anecdotes he can recount from key moments in India's post-Independence history.

He says he was just five or six years old when Master Maadu Ram, a local Arya Samaj leader, visited his father's simple home in Gorakhpur village. Maadu Ram, Swarup says, fascinated him with his fearless advocation of rationalism against blind faith and idol worship. ""I have never since stepped inside a temple, mosque, church or gurudwara,"" says the man who now devotes all his time to educating others, including young school and college students, employee unions, farmers' collectives and even local khap panchayats (caste councils) who care to hear his unorthodox views.

Starting out in student politics in the early 1970s, Swarup, then a postgraduate student of history, recalls how he was rusticated from Hisar's Jat College in 1973, when he preferred to support a statewide school teachers' strike instead of taking a prized opportunity to work as a stipendiary teacher. ""The government was offering the jobs to break the teachers' strike and I refused,"" he says. The early influences and the heady days of student politics made for that inevitable drift to the Left (he became a card holder of the CPI(M).

But it was after 2008, when he withdrew from politics (he says, ""I simply did not renew my card in 2012"") that Swarup, who is now respectfully referred to as 'Comrade Krishan Swarup Gorakhpuria', really came into his own.

Back in Gorakhpur, he spearheaded the establishment of the Comrade Prithvi Singh Yadgaar Committee (a tribute to a local Left leader), which now has bustling premises on one edge of the village. It is among several places where he engages with youth, both of the village and from settlements nearby. Discussions range from sports, afforestation, organic and zero-budget farming to advances in science and education. The centre also serves as a sports academy, which sent as many as seven boys to the volleyball nationals this year, and a coaching centre to prepare young boys and girls for competitive examinations.

And while he watches over the centre in Gorakhpur, Swarup spends the remainder of his time addressing employees' unions, farmers and students. ""This is to inform people of their rights and responsibilities,"" he says. For instance, he spent weeks during a recent roadways union agitation in Haryana, talking to workers unions, advising them on how best to press for their demands. And he regularly visits government and private schools to similarly engage with students, whom he sees as the workforce of the future. ""I engage in agitational and educational activity,"" he chuckles. He is also head of one of the most progressive Khap panchayats in Haryana, through which he continues to wage a virtual war against female foeticide and honour killings amid Haryana's intensely patriarchal rural society.

But the comrade isn't merely a preacher. Two of his four children are in inter-caste marriages; on his insistence, his matriculate daughter-in-law went on to graduate and to teaching in a local school; and the delight on his face while visiting his grand-daughters in Chandigarh is telling."

Review: Ever since the reality show host and property-mogul Donald Trump became the President of the USA, bashing him has become the easiest thing to do. After a point, the exercise can get boring because the guy has been the butt of jokes even before he became a President. However, Michael Moore, in his documentary 'Fahrenheit 11/9' provides some much needed perspective as to how a 'wrecking-ball' of a personality could rise to become an American President. Moore tries to answer just why Hillary Clinton, the far more popular candidate, lost the vote. And he does not stop at that. Taking off from the loss of the Democratic party, Moore goes deep into the heart of America's grassroots movements to show how Trump's win, more than anything else, is about the failure of the Democratic party to keep its promises.

The filmmaker keeps the momentum going as he examines a bunch of incidents in USA including the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, the school shootings and the recent Teacher's Strike to make a point about how, the severely affected working class is fighting back.

Darkly funny at times, the film has several moments when you can feel the sheer injustice being meted out to the people, especially when the filmmaker goes back to his town of Flint and takes on the governor over the water crisis.

Moore shines the camera on the changing political system in America, where neither Democrats nor Republicans are absolved, as he shows how a new wave of public representatives, mostly from the Democratic Party, are coming to the fore on their own and facing down big corporations. It also dismisses the myth that America is divided on the lines of race. It shows, through the several crisis that the citizens face, that the real divide is on social lines of rich and poor.

This is a movie that questions the current establishment asks whether the USA will turn into a fascist, racist state. Or will a new wave of people rise and truly make America great again."

It expressed concern about the JNUTA ""inciting the students to indulge in illegal activities of the kind"" they have indulged in.

""Such activities, particularly staging protests in prohibited areas of the campus in clear violation of university rules and court rulings, have adversely affected peace and stability in a campus that is known for its intellectual works,"" varsity's registrar Pramod Kumar said.

On Monday, the students' association held a public meeting outside the Dr BR Ambedkar Library over library fund cuts.

A photograph of Marx overlooks stacks of plastic chairs, crammed bookshelves and an old desktop computer in an office on the ground floor of a building in central Mumbai. On the evening of January 12, a group of electricity workers affiliated with the Mumbai Electric Employees Union met here. They worked for Reliance Energy, which supplied electricity to homes in the city's suburbs. Despite working for the company for around two decades, laying cables and excavating new lines, they were not permanent employees - they were hired by contractors, who supplied labour to the company.

The previous few weeks had been tumultuous. The company was in the middle of a major transition: its ownership was changing hands, with the Adani Group in the process of taking over.

During this period, a worker died on December 19. He was returning home from work when he fainted and hit his head, resulting in a brain haemorrhage. All the workers in the area - permanent and contract - went on a one-day strike to force the company to pay full-duty compensation to his family.

It seemed like a victory - except, on January 1, the contract workers found they had been marked absent for the day of the strike, while the permanent workers had not. When the union raised this, four workers were suspended on January 9.

Three days later, the union met in their Dadar office to discuss this suspension. Hours later, close to midnight, four of its members found men in plain clothes at their doorstep.

""At around 11.45 pm, around 15 to 20 people came to our door,"" said Rajitha, wife of Satyanarayana Karrela, 40, one of the union members. ""We did not know who they were as they were in civil dress. When we asked they just told us they had work with us.""

The men made the couple sit with their backs to each other and asked them to stay silent as they went about ransacking the house. At the end of the search, they said that they had to take Karrela with them. Panicking that he was about to be kidnapped, Rajitha seized her husband's arm and refused to let go. At this point, she said, the men announced they were the police. They said Karrela would be released in the morning. When she still refused to let go, they wrote an address and phone number on a piece of paper and told her to come there the next morning.

Similar stories played out at the houses of other union members that night - Babushankar Vanguri, 30, Shankar Gunde, 40, and Ravi Marampelli, 40. Large groups of police in plain clothes appeared close to midnight, searched their houses and took them away.

This was no ordinary police detail - it was the Anti-Terrorism Squad of the Maharashtra Police. As the families of the union members found out later, the arrests had been made under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which punishes those proved guilty of working with banned organisations. In this case, the ATS claims the workers had been funding the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), which has been fighting a protracted guerilla war in central and eastern India for decades with the aim of overthrowing the government.

How exactly had low-paid workers in Mumbai, who barely earned enough to support their families in India's most expensive city, saved money to send to an underground organisation?

The police claims they did so by raising money from contractors.

At the heart of the police claims, as outlined in its 5,000-page chargesheet submitted in May, are two bank cheques of Rs 1.5 lakh each. Issued in May 2017, the cheques was signed by three office bearers of a contractors association that supplied labour to Reliance Energy. The police claim the workers encashed the cheques and passed on the money to a Maoist operative, who further transferred the money to underground Maoists in Telangana.

But other union members have a simpler explanation for the cheques: they say they were written in support of the union's annual May Day function.

""The workers organised May Day functions every year and get donations from the contractors association for this,"" said N Vasudevan of the New Trade Union Initiative that backs the contract workers' union.

On the same day that they arrested the four union members, the police also arrested Narsaiah Jumpala, one of the three signatories of the cheques and a member of the contractors association. Anjaiah Anthati, president of the association, said there was no coercion at the contractor association meeting at which they decided to sign the cheques. The association, he claimed, makes donations to all workers unions every few years and that too in ""white"" money, by cheque, not cash.

""We can conduct our business only if we have good relations with them,"" said Anthati. ""If we tell them, 'No, go, we won't give you anything', then at some point, the union people will cause trouble for us. That is why we tell them we will take care of them. For this, we have to give them chai paani (money).""

But the police has cited witness statements from at least unnamed 12 contractors in support of its claims. These feature as part of the chargesheet, among the 100-odd statements which have been cited after redacting witness names.

Strikingly, all 12 statements contain identical paragraphs about how the workers introduced a man named ""Mahesh"", who they claimed worked for ""the Party"". ""As I am a resident of Andhra Pradesh, I know that in our native place, Naxalites are recognised as being of the 'party,'"" reads every single statement as translated into Marathi, purportedly made independently in Hindi by each contractor. ""Since then, we became afraid of the topic of Mahesh and whenever Ravi Marampelli, Satyanarayana Karrela and Shankar Gunde asked us for money, we always gave them money out of fear.""

Said Atul Chandra Kulkarni, additional director general of police in charge of the Anti-Terrorism Squad, ""If they have made identical statements to us, that is why we have recorded it that way.""

On January 12, along with four workers and the contractor, the police also arrested a man named Ajay Dasari, who they allege is the Maoist operative who workers introduced as ""Mahesh"". The seventh arrest, also made the same day, was of Ramesh Gondiala, 37, a pro-Telangana poet and activist who worked as a milk delivery man near Kalyan, on the outskirts of Mumbai. In February, another worker, Saidulu Singapanga, 36, was taken into custody, taking the total number of arrests in the case to eight.

This isn't the only Maoist case brought by the Maharashtra police against urban residents. Over June and August, Pune police arrested ten lawyers and activists, accusing them of working with the banned CPI (Maoist) and labelling them ""Urban Naxals"". These arrests too were made under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. Often described as draconian with vague definitions, it allows the police to hold the accused in prison for long periods by prohibiting the courts to grant bail as long as the accusation made by the police appears ""prima facie true"".

""As far as Maharashtra is concerned, there are very few UAPA cases,"" said Nihalsingh Rathod, a Nagpur lawyer with the Indian Association of People's Lawyers. ""Most cases are invoked against Islamic terrorism. The rest are concentrated in Gadchiroli district [in eastern Maharashtra, where there is a Maoist presence].""

Of the few in western Maharashtra, one is the union workers' case. Another is the 2011 case against alleged Maoist Angela Sontakke and the Kabir Kala Manch, a cultural organisation based in Pune, members of which have since been released on bail. In 2015, the Anti-Terrorism Squad arrested Konnath Muralidharan, a Maoist leader from Kerala while he was being treated at a hospital near Pune.

Given the prominence of the ten activists arrested between June and August, and a legal challenge to their arrests in the Supreme Court, discussions on the misuse of this 1960 law were briefly revived, before receding again.

According to Indiaspend, as many as 2,700 cases were filed under UAPA in three years between 2014 and 2016. Of the 33 trials under the law completed in 2016, it reported, 67% ended in acquittals. Evidence in several of these cases tends to be vague.

""I think a lot of leeway is given to the prosecuting agency at the pre-charge stage because it's their word against what the accused have to say,"" said senior advocate Rebecca John, who has argued several cases under the act. ""I don't think enough judicial scrutiny takes place at this stage. And very few of these cases end in conviction. For the prosecution, the period of incarceration is itself the punishment.""

A common thread that connects all of the men arrested on January 12 is the place where they came from: Telangana. Or more specifically, the two districts of Nalgonda and Karimnagar. Also common is their caste background: the workers are all Dalits.

The Mumbai Electric Employees Union was established in 2005, after a worker died while on duty. As contract workers, they were entitled to a compensation of only Rs 25,000 but as union members claim, they successfully forced the company to increase it Rs 6.5 lakh. Since then, the union grew in strength, attracting a large membership of around 1,000 of the company's 4,000 contract workers, many of whom are Telugu-speaking migrants. The Shiv Sena-affiliated Mumbai Electric Workers' Union, which is the only union which is recognised by the company and the Labour Commissioner, claims to represent all contract workers, apart from the 3,500-odd permanent workers, many of whom are Marathi-speaking.

All the arrested workers were office-bearers of the Mumbai Electric Employees Union and played a crucial role in every negotiation with the company and contractors. They all lived in and around Ghatkopar in central Mumbai with their wives and young children and had each been with the electricity company for around at least 15-20 years.

Work conditions were severe at first, say members of the union who worked with their arrested counterparts. Each day, they would go to the company's electricity office and contractors would tell them how many of them would get work for that day. Often, workers would return home empty-handed. With the formation of their union, however, working conditions changed. One of their first struggles was to ensure that all contract workers would get work daily. The arrested workers were active in ensuring this.

In their spare time, they organised reading groups and kept their fellow workers updated with political pamphlets and books related to Marxist, Ambedkarite and pro-Telangana ideology, said Vasudevan. Despite their long stint in the metropolis, the union members had strong connections to their homelands and were active in supporting the movement for a new Telangana state. When Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the new Telangana Rashtra Samiti government promised three acres of land each to landless Dalit farmers. The workers, said Vasudevan, made several trips back home in the hope of getting land.

A Telangana-based researcher specialising in human rights and law, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that many migrants did indeed come back in droves in the first year of the new government, thinking they had to be physically present to avail of the scheme. However, the scheme has not materialised. The workers had grown disenchanted with the new government, said Vasudevan.

According to their co-workers, all the arrested shared an interest in Ambedkarite and Marxist ideas. At all their homes, the police found books, magazines and pamphlets related to this ideology. At Singapanga's home, the police found copies of Veekshanam, a magazine edited by N Venugopal, a Telugu poet, literary critic and journalist.

""We have even published their letters in Veekshanam,"" said Venugopal, who knew six of the eight accused. ""That way they are socially active. But the charge the police is making now is preposterous and unbelievable.""

The police chargesheet contains a screenshot of an email sent by one of the arrested workers, Vanguri, to another arrested worker, Singapanga, inviting him to an event at Ramabai Nagar to protest the arrest of Manda Krishna Madiga, a Telugu Dalit rights activist living in Telangana. Krishna, who was subsequently released, has spoken against the Maoist party for betraying the cause of workers.

But an official of the Anti-Terrorism Squad, who did not want to be identified, claimed the workers' union itself was as an overground organisation of the Maoists. Such organisations are part of the Golden Corridor Committee plan, he said, through which Maoists seek to infiltrate industrial areas in western India.

By all accounts, the workers, however, showed greater interest in Ambedkarite ideas. On December 31, they travelled to Pune in a group of 40 to take part in the anti-caste commemoration at Bhima Koregaon near Pune, where Dalit soldiers with the East India Company had trounced the casteist Peshwa-led army of the Maratha empire in 1818. ""I had gone there for the first time because it was the 200th anniversary of the battle,"" said Saidulu Gondrigalla, one of the suspended workers who was part of the group. ""We saw the [memorial] pillar in the morning, while the garlands were still being put up, then returned to Pune for the Elgaar Parishad,"" a conference being held to mark the anniversay.

While they returned to Mumbai on January 1, back in Bhima Koregaon, Dalits came under attack that day, sparking a strike and caste clashes, which spread across western Maharashtra. By the second week of January, police had conducted sweeping arrests of Dalits they believed to have participated in the violence.

When news of the workers' arrests first came, their colleagues thought this might be related to this action. However, given that the arrested workers were all union members, they also wondered whether this had anything to do with their last protest against the management in December.

The chargesheet is silent on both.

Spokespersons of both Reliance Infrastructure and Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited declined to comment on the case or the suspension of the employees.

""We are not pursuing any such past matters,"" said a spokesperson for Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited in response to a detailed questionnaire. ""It's a brand new company and a brand new way to do things. We took over on August 29 and this is a matter of last year December and January.""

A representative of Reliance Infrastructure, the holding company for Reliance Energy, also declined to comment. ""As discussed, as this business is now with Adani Electricity, you may write to Adani Electricity,"" a Reliance Infrastructure spokesperson wrote in reply to Scroll.in's questions.

Other than the workers, those arrested in the case include Jumpala, the contractor, Dasari, the alleged Maoist operative, and Gondiala, a poet and activist whose connection to the workers is tenuous.

As general secretary of the contractors association, Narsaiah Jumpala was one of the authorised signatories for cheques issued by the organisation. He had a reputation within the association for being sympathetic to the cause of workers, according to both his wife, other workers in the union, and even the head of the contractors' association.

When the worker who later died was admitted to a hospital in December, the contractor who was his employer called Jumpala for advice, according to his wife. Jumpala told the contractor to go to the hospital. ""[The contractor] said he was afraid to go there alone as the workers would be agitated,"" she told Scroll.in. ""He then asked my husband to accompany him in the morning, as my husband has good relations with workers of other contractors as well.""

Anthati, president of the contractors' association told Scroll.in that Jumpala did indeed have good relations with the workers. ""Vo worker ke piche hi rehta tha,"" he said. ""Jumpala was always with the workers, particularly that union...He used to favour them.""

The donation to the union came out of Jumpala's initiative, but the decision was taken collectively by 12 committee members, said Anthati. ""This fellow [Jumpala] only arranged the meeting for the workers,"" Anthati said. ""He asked me three times and I did not give him a time. The fourth time he asked me, I said all right and the entire committee sat and decided to give them money.""

There is not much information available about Ajay Dasari, the man the police claims the money was diverted to. The police chargesheet says he lived in Kalyan and even lists an address. But the address, a squat building adjacent to a larger bungalow, is occupied by families of Bihari and Jharkhand migrant workers, living there on rent. The wife of one of the workers confirmed the Anti-Terrorism Squad had visited this address on a Saturday in January, asking for Dasari.

The woman, who did not want to be identified, said Dasari was her husband's friend. They had met about five years ago while working at a cola factory in Kalyan and Dasari used to visit their home once or twice a month.

""Even now none of us can believe that he could be a terrorist like they said,"" the wife said. ""He always kept his eyes down, he spoke softly, did not look at any women, and never fought with anybody.""

Dasari told them that he lived with relatives in Thane, but that his wife and children were in his village in Telangana. They did not know much else about him.

The Telangana-based researcher found the police claims about a Maoist operative meeting openly with workers suspect.

""It is highly unlikely that if this person was a Maoist, he would go around telling people he was one,"" he said. ""In general, Maoists use cities as safe zones, where they don't take up any activity.""

An Anti-Terrorism Squad official familiar with the case who asked not to be identified agreed that ""Maoists keep their open activities away from secret ones to prevent detection."" However, he claimed that if Dasari was ""allowed access to both sides"", it indicated that he was in fact a ""high level functionary"".

It is not clear how Ramesh Gondiala, a poet and milkman, came to be linked to this case. A pro-Telangana activist from Nalgonda district, his connection with the workers is tenuous - according to Gondrigalla and Vasudevan, he met them in November 2013 at a meeting to support the formation of the state.

Venugopal, who wrote the preface to a book of poetry that Gondiala published, said his poetry covered issues of gender, Dalit rights, labour and the Telangana state.

Gondiala worked to deliver milk to houses in his neighbourhood and also worked as a driver. His wife told Scroll.in that he also regularly helped construction workers to arrange compensation or treatment for them if they suffered injuries or died while on duty.

The ATS also questioned another writer and translator, Prabhakar Macha, in the case. A teacher who was quite popular in Telugu writing circles, Venugopal said Macha was a significant link between Marathi and Telugu literature. He had written a 200-page book on the contribution of Telugu migrants to the building of Mumbai city.

In the first week of January, Macha's wife died. On January 23, a week after he was questioned by the ATS, he killed himself.

In the First Information Report filed hours after the arrests, the ATS claims its operative received a confidential tip-off from an informer, who told them that members of the Maoist party were raising money, recruiting new members and spreading Maoist propaganda to destabilise the nation. The informer said the members were going to congregate at Kalyan station at around 4.30 pm. The FIR charges seven men - excluding Singapanga at this stage - under sections 20, 38 and 39 of the the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which pertain to membership of and recruitment to banned organisations, but not to fundraising for them. The charges of fundraising appear only in the chargesheet.

In the chargesheet, the police claims to have CCTV footage from an apartment building in Tilak Nagar, which purportedly shows Dasari meeting the arrested workers between 12 pm to 3 pm.

The ATS claims in the FIR that it arrested Dasari at Kalyan station at 5.30 pm. Through his interrogation, within a matter of hours, it was able to get the residential addresses of seven accomplices. At midnight, in simultaneous raids, six men were arrested.

Saidulu Singapanga is not among the seven individuals named in this FIR. Like several other union members at the time, Singapanga too did not appear for work for some weeks after the other union members were arrested, fearing that it was the union itself being targeted. When he reported for work on February 5, he was arrested immediately.

But questions have been raised over the police claims.

Jumpala's wife pointed out only her husband was arrested, even though cheques from the contractors association require three signatures. The union's founding minutes, a copy of which is in the chargesheet, designates three individuals - the president, general secretary and treasurer - as elected officers for bank transactions.

""When I confronted [another contractor in the association] about this, he became very aggressive and started shouting at me,"" Jumpala's wife told Scroll.in. ""He said he had nothing to do with the cheques, and that my husband had signed a cheques in his personal capacity and handed them over for illegal activities.""

Anthati, president of the contractors' association, said that all three signatories had indeed signed two cheques, each amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh, but did not hand them over to the union representatives at the meeting because they did not have a receipt book with them.

""I told them we would give them the cheques only after they gave us the receipt,"" Anthati said. However, he added, a few days later, Jumpala took the cheques from the office assistant, saying that he was going to Chembur, would give them to the union people and bring back a receipt. This never happened. Instead, the cheques were made out to two individual members of the union and the receipt never made it to the association office, he claimed. Scroll.in could not independently confirm this.

It is not clear from the chargesheet how the money from the cheques was passed on to the Maoists, nor is it clear whether or how the accused recruited new members for the Maoist cause.

Most of all, what is mysterious are the 12 near-identical statements purportedly made by contractors to the police.

Anthati said that as he operated in Kandivali zone in another part of the city, he did not know what the others had said to the police and whether they knew that their statements in Hindi had been identically translated into Marathi. Contractors in the east zone deflected numerous attempts by Scroll.in over almost two months to speak with them.

Advocate Rebecca John said that identical statements were a common feature of the UAPA cases she was familiar with. ""It is common to have nebulous evidence, nothing very concrete,"" John said. ""The police looks into their personal lives, including their computers, so that even if you download an article, you can become a member by association. The police also gets surrendered Maoists to make statements in which there is a fair degree of police control. In a fair world none of these cases would see the light of day.""

However, Atul Chandra Kulkarni, additional director general of police in charge of the Anti-Terrorism Squad staunchly defended the investigation. ""UAPA cases are especially serious because I know that people don't get bail or they will get a longer prison term if convicted,"" he said. ""That is why I don't cook up evidence nor do I let my officers do so. But of course, I have the prerogative to take X [fact or person] and not Y in my case if it supports that. Facts will be chosen to marshal evidence.""

He pointed out that his team was simultaneously working on a case involving Hindutva extremists who had been arrested with large caches of weapons and bombs.

Ten months after the arrests, the families of the union members are struggling. Reduced to single-income households, one family left for their village in Telangana, unable to pay the rent for their room. The others are being supported by women who have taken up domestic work to make ends meet. There is uncertainty over whether they would be able to pay their children's school fees.

There are other consequences too. The families of the workers were reluctant to meet Scroll.in in their homes to avoid drawing more attention to themselves. They said the ATS officials still visit them regularly, making their neighbours wary of them. One of their landlords even asked them to leave, to avoid the police attention.

Since the arrests, the scrappy union, which took on the company to fight for provident funds, safety equipment, identity cards and even a kind of job security with assured daily work to all its members, has become somewhat dormant.

""Because of this atmosphere, the workers are scared that if they remain with our union, they too will be arrested,"" Vasudevan said.

There are other losses which the workers rue, including the hard-earned one of dignity.

""When we go to make demands of the contractor now, they tell us to go away or we will also be arrested,"" said Laxman Bomma, one of the workers suspended on January 9. ""They normally give us our new uniforms in January, but we have not got that this year. We now have to go to Vile Parle to collect our salaries, when earlier they would give it at the offices where we report for work.""

Said Gondrigalla, ""Earlier, they would treat us with some respect and dignity. That is no longer there."""

The Kendriya Vidyalaya in our locality is not far from my university residence. Every morning as I take my tea and look at the newspaper, the echo of the national anthem - a wonderful gift from schoolchildren - envelops my being. Yet, at this very moment, an anxiety begins to overcome me. Is it merely a school ritual - a disciplinary practice? Or are there teachers who engage with these tender minds, and make them understand the meaning of being part of a nation?

I am anxious because the very idea of nationalism is paradoxical. While it is capable of arousing feelings of love, togetherness, inclusiveness and service, it can also invent 'enemies' and sanctify some sort of a militarised consciousness for the 'protection' of the nation.

History bears testament to the many wars and mass atrocities that have taken place in the name of the nation. While Tagore's Jana Gana Mana arouses positivity and a feeling of sublime prayer, the routinisation of a ritual in a highly mechanised school assembly - and that too in a time when political authoritarianism, militarism and nationalism go together - I am afraid, might miss it altogether.

Seeing the nation through children's eyes

There are many perplexing questions that confront the mental landscape of children. Every morning as they start their journey towards school, they see a terribly fragmented nation - a nation that reproduces gross inequality through stratified schooling. While air-conditioned buses take well-dressed English-speaking children to all sorts of 'international' schools, visibly malnourished faces move towards municipality schools.

Instead of 'common schooling', children learn the harsh realities of hierarchy, stratification and class division not through books, but through everyday experiences. Do any of them ask the question: for whom does the nation exist?

They see that not everyone is treated equally in the classroom. It is not surprising. After all, teachers don't come from a different planet, and some of them carry the baggage of violence and exclusion rooted in our society. It is not impossible to find the traces of a patriarchal or casteist mind, nor is it impossible to see the impact of a communal mind that stigmatises 'others' based on religious identity.

Does the teacher's gaze objectify, humiliate and differentiate a child with a 'problematic' identity - a Dalit child, a female or a Muslim child? As ethnographies of schools suggest, this violence - call it cultural, psychic or symbolic - has not yet disappeared from schools. Do the children seek to ask a question: why is the nation so insensitive and violent?

It is not impossible for them to think (even if they can't verbalise it all the time) that the nation, far from being egalitarian, privileges certain kinds of cultural and intellectual capital at the expense of others. What else do they see at schools? Knowledge, they realise, is merely bookish - a chapter on the Newtonian law of gravitation, a note on the downfall of the Mughal Empire, or a set of puzzles on trigonometric equations.

Here is a system that doesn't unite the mental and the manual, books and the world, or intellect and practical wisdom. Look at a typical mode of evaluation that exams generate: Mathematics-96, English-99, Hindi-84 and, History-92. It has no scope for appreciating other forms of capital - whether a child knows something about farming, whether she can milk a cow, or whether she can swim and save a man drowning into a river.

No wonder, children - particularly those who get labelled 'failure' - may feel like asking: does the nation degrade labour, and promote elites and intellectuals separated from common folks' knowledge?

Waiting for inspiring teachers

Are there teachers to entertain and understand these questions? Can they see beyond the ritualisation of school assemblies, the invocation of 'Bharat Mata' and all sorts of disciplinary practices causing hierarchisation and normalisation? Such a challenging task merits reflexive and inspiring teachers: teachers who see immense possibilities in children, and love to be in communion with them, who encourage 'problem-posing' education and inspire students to overcome the silence imposed on them, and articulate their apprehensions, anxieties and confusions.

This means the willingness to rethink the nation and the discourse of nationalism. Where is the egalitarian and inclusive nation? What is nationalism? Does it mean merely following a school ritual, singing in tune with Vande Mataram and celebrating India's victory over Pakistan in the cricket match? This requires new sensibilities - not bookish knowledge.

Imagine a situation. Instead of celebrating the surgical strike day, the teacher asks children to think whether India and Pakistan, despite their poverty, should spend excessively on the army, and neglect the real concerns of farmers, cobblers, or artisans.

Feel the moment if a teacher rescues Bhagat Singh from being reduced to a photograph in the principal's office, and tells children how the nation we worship is negating his dreams and struggles for equality and collective emancipation. Think what would happen if, instead of the compulsive ritualisation of the national anthem, a teacher asks students to read a short story by Manto or a poem by Muktibodh.

What if when the principal dares to speak out that it is not only the prime minister who works for 16 hours a day, but that a construction worker in Delhi's metro project or a peasant in a Himalayan village, too, works for that long - at times without even roti-sabji.

Who knows, one fine morning I might be surprised and hear the echo of yet another song - children singing of love, not war. Cosmopolitanism, not parochialism. Reciprocity, not meritocracy. Maybe even children speaking of people and not the fetish of the nation."

Since its release in October and as recent as this week, her latest novel ""Unsheltered"" has stood toe-to-toe with the likes of Stephen King, Nicholas Sparks and John Grisham on the weekly New York Times bestseller list.

What many local residents may not know, however, is when she's not on a coast-to-coast book tour, it's the mountains of Southwest Virginia, and more specifically Washington County, Va., that she calls home.

And it's there where community members from throughout the region will have an opportunity to meet the award-winning author during a free community celebration.

Friends of the Washington County (Va.) Public Library will host an evening with Barbara Kingsolver at 7:30 p.m., Thursday, Dec. 6, in the ballroom of the Martha Washington Inn and Spa in Abingdon.

Kingsolver will read from and discuss her latest book and answer questions from the audience. The event, presented as the Friends' holiday gift to the community, is free and open to the public.

""Unsheltered,"" which has been near the top of the New York Times bestseller list since its release in October, is the story of two families, in two centuries, who live at the corner of Sixth and Plum in Vineland, New Jersey, navigating what seems to be the end of the world as they know it.

""Unsheltered"" is about the uncertainties of our time, in which many of the ""shelters"" of the past are collapsing. The central characters are a family, in which the husband has lost his job, the wife's firm has gone out of business, and the adult children are struggling to find their way in the world.

In another time, a troubled husband and public servant asks, ""How can a man tell the truth, and be reviled for it?"" A science teacher with a passion for honest investigation, Thatcher Greenwood findshimself under siege: his employer forbids him to speak of the exciting work just published by Charles Darwin. His young bride and social-climbing mother-in-law bristle at the risk of scandal, and dismiss his worries that their elegant house is unsound. In a village ostensibly founded as a benevolent Utopia, Thatcher wants only to honor his duties, but his friendships with a woman scientist and a renegade newspaper editor threaten to draw him into a vendetta with the town's powerful men.

The two stories are linked by the history of the house in which both families live. Kingsolver develops these two stories in alternating chapters, with the last phrase of each chapter being the title of the next.

Copies of the book will be available for purchase at the event and there will be a signing time as well.

Born in 1955, Kingsolver grew up in rural Kentucky. She earned degrees in biology from DePauw University and the University of Arizona, and has worked as a freelance writer and author since 1985. At various times in her adult life, she has lived in England, France and the Canary Islands, and has worked in Europe, Africa, Asia, Mexico and South America. She spent two decades in Tucson, Arizona, before moving to Washington County in 2004.

Her books, in order of publication, include ""The Bean Trees"" (1988),"" Homeland"" (1989), ""Holding the Line: Women in the Great Arizona Mine Strike"" (1989), ""Animal Dreams"" (1990), ""Another America"" (1992), ""Pigs in Heaven"" (1993), ""High Tide in Tucson"" (1995), ""The Poisonwood Bible"" (1998), ""Prodigal Summer"" (2000), ""Small Wonder"" (2002), ""Last Stand: America's Virgin Lands,"" with photographer Annie Griffiths Belt (2002), ""Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life"" (2007), ""The Lacuna"" (2009), ""Flight Behavior: A Novel"" (2012) and ""Unsheltered"" (2018).

Kingsolver's books have been translated into more than two dozen languages and have been adopted into the core literature curriculum in high schools and colleges across the country. She has contributed to more than 50 literary anthologies, and her reviews and articles have appeared in most major U.S. newspapers and magazines.

She was named one the most important writers of the 20th Century by Writers Digest. In 2000, she received the National Humanities Medal - our country's highest honor for service through the arts. ""The Poisonwood Bible"" was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the Orange Prize, and was an Oprah Book Club selection. ""Animal, Vegetable, Miracle"" won numerous prizes, including the James Beard award. ""The Lacuna"" won Britain's prestigious Orange Prize for Fiction in 2010 (the best novel in the world written in the English language by a woman). In 2011, she was awarded the Dayton Literary Peace Prize for the body of her work.

Kingsolver established the Bellwether Prize for Fiction, the nation's largest prize for an unpublished first novel, which since 1998 has helped to establish the careers of more than a half dozen new literary voices. Through a recent agreement, the prize has now become the PEN / Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction.

She has two daughters, Camille and Lily, and a grandchild. Her husband, Steven Hopp, teaches environmental studies at Emory & Henry College and owns the Harvest Table Restaurant in Meadowview."

Rai is the fifth para-teacher to lose his life since the techers went on an indefinite strike after November 15. Agitating para-teachers claimed that they lost two lives --Kanchan Kumar Das and Jeenat Khatoon-- due to cold while staging protests, while Bahadur Thakur and Shankar Pandey, died of shock and depression.

""Rai, who was posted at the Upgraded Middle School at Baski-1 at Sarath in Deoghar, died after he was injured severely while protesting before CM Das during Foundation Day celebration. He had returned from Vellore on December 14 after undergoing treatment for his injuries, but could not recover,"" said leader of Ekikrit Para-Teacher Sangharsh Morcha, Bajrang Prasad.

Rai was first admitted to a local hospital and later shifted to Dr KK Sinha for better treatment from where he was referred to CMC Vellore for advance treatment, he added.

Prasad further said that the organisation has demanded Rs 25 lakh as ex-gratia for the victim's family and a government job for the nearest kin.

""Such incidents will further add fuel to our agitation as the State government is non-responsive towards our problems. They will have to take initiative to find a way out to end the deadlock as we are always open for talks,"" said Prasad.

Prasad said that a meeting of para-teachers is planned to strengthen their agitation to press their demands. 40-year-old Kanchan Kumar Das also died on Sunday while he was on a night-long sit-in outside the house of the Social Welfare Minister.

The leader of Opposition Hemant Soren has asked the government to find out an immediate solution.

""The State Government should immediately end the deadlock by taking a decision on the demands of para-teachers,"" said Soren."

Someone opens the door and stage whispers my name. ""You've four minutes,"" she says, and asks if I would like some tea. The cuppa loses to the questions and I wade through droves of fans with phone cameras on the ready, special guests, and bouncers as sturdy as oaks, into a room at the Park Hyatt hotel. One of India's most recognisable men is seated on a chair, filling it like he did the throne when he played Mughal emperor Akbar.

Hrithik Roshan, in jeans and a denim Beatles jacket, 'love' embroidered on his muscled bicep, rises to shake my hand. There is a Skeleton strapped to his right wrist. ""If I had to pick a favourite watch right now, I'd pick the Skeleton,"" says the Bollywood actor, who was in the city last weekend to launch the latest from the Rado collection at VR Mall.

Hrithik has been Rado's ambassador for six years now, but the brand is a childhood memory. ""When I was a kid, I was fascinated by how the watch looked on my father's wrist. I didn't know the brand then. Years later when Rado approached me and I saw the collection, I recognised the watch that first enamoured me,"" he says.

Hrithik has been the Hindi film industry's Adonis for nearly 19 years now, his career peppered in equanimity with box office smashes and duds. He's played the workaholic lover boy (Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara), angry young man (Agneepath), heroic Army officer (Lakshya) and super hero (Krissh series) in equal measure, and has an untitled film with Tiger Shroff on the cards.

But as he pushes 45, Hrithik cheerleads the story of a common man and a gifted mathematician who inspired youth to successfully ace the entrance exams to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT). Super 30, scheduled for release on January 25, 2019, is a bio-pic on Patna-based Anand Kumar, best known for his Super 30 programme that coaches economically backward students for one of India's toughest entrance exams. It is a story that mirrors poverty and genius and showcases the struggles of youth in a classroom with unplastered walls, tutored by a man who sells papads in the evenings to supplement the family income.

Hrithik, who plays Anand, says the film called for a lot of prepping and not just in the scruffy looks department. ""I've played emperor and the common man. But this was especially different and difficult as I did not speak Bihari and since it is based on a person's life, the responsibility is so much more. I had to get into the skin of that character and I truly enjoyed doing it.""

Would the film be endorsing India's craze for the IITs? ""If the film endorses anything, it is the spirit of education, the spirit of teaching,"" says Hrithik. ""Even if you are not a teacher, it should inspire you to add growth to the people around you, to help them pursue their dreams. Somewhere, it'll strike a chord to do more for the people who work for you.""

With Krissh 4 due for release in 2020, has he thought of revisiting his roles in Lakshya or Jodhaa Akbar considering he still has the Greek-god attributes to carry off a sequel? ""That really is the call of the director. I wish I could think of things I want to do but I have to depend on filmmakers and the things that inspire them. My favourite role has always been the one I am currently doing, whichever film that may be.""

What does Hrithik, an exercise freak who endorses a fitness startup and has his own line of fitness merchandise, listen to when he works out? There's a pause before his eyes crinkle with laughter, ""The workout is very intense. But I love grand orchestral music and old Hindi songs on my playlist. Something that is calming. I love the contrast.""

And just like that, the minute-hand sweeps past the allotted four minutes."

The teacher was identified as Kanchan Kumar Das, a resident of Nonihat village under Hasdiha police station in Dumka district. He had been a para-teacher at the Upgraded Middle School in Chinadangaal under Ramgarh block since 2005.

""A postmortem of the body has been performed at Sadar hospital. We are waiting for the report to know the exact cause of the death,"" Dumka superintendent of police Y Ramesh said.

""Chill effect in the weather could be a reason for death. But, it cannot be established until postmortem report comes,"" Ramesh said.

Over 45,000 para teachers across the state are on an indefinite strike since November 16 forcing over 12,000 schools to shut. They are demanding the regularisation of their services after their counterparts in Chhattisgarh, who have served for eight years, have been regularised as assistant teachers.

They launched 'Ghera Dalo, Dera Dalo' programme at residences of BJP ministers, parliamentarians and legislators to push for their demand from November 25.

As part of the programme, Das and other para-teachers were protesting before Marandi's house on Saturday night in Dumka, around 300-km northeast from capital Ranchi.

""After participating in a protest rally in Dumka market in the afternoon, we reached the sit-in venue before the minister's house in the evening. Kanchan was already there in our makeshift tent,"" one of Das' companion Yudhir Mandal said.

Mandal said they went to bed at around 8pm but Das went to the market. He returned around 10pm and they chatted for a while before sleeping.

""We woke up around 5.45am on Sunday and was preparing tea. Around 6.30am, we called Kanchan but he did not give any response and his body shrank in cold. We immediately called an ambulance and took him to Sadar Hospital Dumka. But, the doctors declared him brought dead,"" he said.

Dr Dilip Kumar Bhagat, who examined Das, said his body was brought late. ""He had already died. So, it was hard to find out the exact cause of his death,"" he said.

Das' father Akhilesh Das, 60, said his son had no serious health complications. ""My son died due to cold. It is the state government, who is responsible for his death. The government has killed my son,"" Akhilesh said.

Kanchan was unmarried and lived with his father. His elder brother works in Kolkata.

Opposition parties also held the government responsible for the teacher's demise. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has demanded centre's interference in para-teachers' issue.

""The current BJP government in Jharkhand has lost its sensitivity and humanity. A teacher dying before a minister's house is very shameful. A case of murder should be lodged against the minister,"" said JMM spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya.

Meanwhile, Ekikrit Para Sikshak Sangharsh Morcha (EPSSM), an umbrella body of different para teachers' associations, has threatened to intensify the agitation.

""The government is not ready for any dialogue over the teachers' issue. We do not know if chief minister has made it a personal ego. We have a simple demand to regularise us on the line of Chhattisgarh,"" said EPSSM state member Vinod Tiwary.

Marandi, who was in Ranchi on Monday, expressed grief over the teacher's death. ""I will talk to the chief minister Raghubar Das and education minister Neera Yadav to sort out the para teachers' issue at the earliest,"" she said.

Marandi said that the government was serious about their issues and agreed to concede demands to some extent. ""I would request the agitating teacher to withdraw their strike,"" she said."
