And of the 2018 recruits who finished the 15-week foundation course last month, 2.16% took the CSE in Hindi.

Of the 370 new civil services recruits trained at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBNSAA) in Mussoorie, eight took the Civil Service Examination (CSE) in Hindi compared to 48 of 202 in 2013; five recruits studied at Hindi-medium universities; and 30 attended Hindi-medium schools.

Data obtained by The Indian Express show that since 2013, there has been a sharp dip not only in students taking the CSE in Hindi -- for services like the IAS, IPS and Indian Foreign Service -- but also in recruits who studied in either Hindi-medium universities or schools. According to the data, there is also a steady increase in students preferring English.

An analysis of the profiles of recruits who took the foundation course available on the LBNSAA website shows the decrease: while students took the CSE in Hindi accounted for nearly 17% in 2013, it stood at 2.11% in 2014, 4.28% in 2015, 3.45% in 2016, 4.06% in 2017. And of the 2018 recruits who finished the 15-week foundation course last month, 2.16% took the CSE in Hindi.

The sharp fall stems from reforms implemented in the CSE when the UPA government brought in the Civil Services Aptitude Test (CSAT) in 2011. Following a backlash in and outside Parliament, the compulsory CSAT Paper-2, comprising Maths and English comprehension, was made just a qualifying paper with effect from the CSE-2015.

In 2013, the pattern of the CSE Mains was also changed. Instead of two optional subjects, only one subject was made optional and General Studies papers were increased from two to four. Experts believe this limited the space for students from Hindi-medium schools and universities.

Satyanand Mishra, who retired as Secretary, Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), the nodal department for UPSC and cadre controlling authority for IAS said: ""The quality of vernacular teaching and the number of academically bright students opting for their mother tongues in colleges and universities can be one more angle to look at. Besides, more middle-class small/medium town parents increasingly prefer an English-medium education for their children.""

Data show that in 2013, there were 48 -- or a quarter -- of 202 recruits at LBNSAA, who studied in Hindi-medium schools, 22 (or nearly 11%) studied at Hindi-medium universities and 34 (nearly 17%) took the CSE in the Hindi.

Before the CSAT was introduced, the performance of Hindi-medium students was a little better, according to data. Profiles of the LBNSAA recruits for 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 show that the representation of students who took the CSE (written) in Hindi was between 12 and 15%. In 2008, for instance, 32 out of 239 students took the CSE in Hindi - over 14%.

Incidentally, of the 370 recruits at the foundation course in 2018, 280 have studied Science subjects including Engineering and Technology, Medicine, Pharmacy or pure sciences. Among them, as many as 149 were B.Tech graduates and 75 were B.E graduates. Only 55 were from Arts and Humanities while the remaining were from management and commerce. This follows the trend in 2017 when of 369 recruits, 287 were from Science fields and in 2016, when 280 of 377 had studied science subjects."

The tests are conducted by the state education department to track and improve the learning ability of government school students.

Students of Mahendergarh topped with a pass percentage of 69%, with Yamunanagar bringing up the rear at 36%. English is the subject most students struggled with, especially in higher classes. Across the state, barely 35% students managed to clear it.

Satyanarayan Yadav, state secretary of Haryana School Teachers Association, said, ""Most students find it hard to learn English as they speak in Hindi. Effort is needed to ensure students improve their English scores."" In contrast, most students performed well in fine arts and music scoring overall 91% and 81%, respectively.

The SAT results are shared with district education officers to evaluate performance of students and teachers, followed by classes under the learning enhancement programme to bridge gaps.

Terming it a ""New Year gift"" for PwD, the Minister said the reason for the delay in notifying the rules was that Delhi was not categorised as a ""State"" in the rules so the government had to get clearance from the Lieutenant-Governor to approach the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.

Britto, who died on Monday, had led his life on a wheelchair as a paraplegic after being a victim of violence on the Maharaja's College campus.

But, that does not happen in many medical colleges, though the situation in government medical colleges is better. In Ernakulam, a group of 20 students studies one body, because of the shortage of cadavers. In other government medical colleges, there are about 30 to 40 human bodies at a time.

The Trump administration filed its notice to withdraw in October 2017 and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu followed suit.

The Paris-based organization has been denounced by its critics as a crucible for anti-Israel bias: blasted for criticising Israel's occupation of East Jerusalem, naming ancient Jewish sites as Palestinian heritage sites and granting full membership to Palestine in 2011.

The US has demanded ""fundamental reform"" in the agency that is best known for its World Heritage program to protect cultural sites and traditions. UNESCO also works to improve education for girls, promote understanding of the Holocaust's horrors, and to defend media freedom.

The withdrawals will not greatly impact UNESCO financially, since it has been dealing with a funding slash ever since 2011 when both Israel and the US stopped paying dues after Palestine was voted in as a member state. Since then officials estimate that the US which accounted for around 22 per cent of the total budget has accrued $600 million in unpaid dues, which was one of the reasons for President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw. Israel owes an estimated $10 million.

UNESCO Director General Audrey Azoulay took up her post just after Trump announced the pullout. Azoulay, who has Jewish and Moroccan heritage, has presided over the launch of a Holocaust education website and the UN's first educational guidelines on fighting anti-Semitism initiatives that might be seen as responding to US and Israeli concerns.

Officials say that many of the reasons the US cited for withdrawal do not apply anymore, noting that since then, all 12 texts on the Middle East passed at UNESCO have been consensual among Israel and Arab member states.

In April of this year, Israel's ambassador to UNESCO said the mood was ""like a wedding"" after member nations signed off on a rare compromise resolution on ""Occupied Palestine,"" and UNESCO diplomats hailed a possible breakthrough on longstanding Israeli-Arab tensions.

The document was still quite critical of Israel, however, and the efforts weren't enough to encourage the US and Israel to reconsider their decision to quit.

In recent years, Israel has been infuriated by repeated resolutions that ignore and diminish its historical connection to the Holy Land and that have named ancient Jewish sites as Palestinian heritage sites.

The State Department couldn't comment because of the US government shutdown.

Earlier, the department told UNESCO officials the US intends to stay engaged at UNESCO as a non-member ""observer state"" on ""non-politicized"" issues, including the protection of World Heritage sites, advocating for press freedoms and promoting scientific collaboration and education.

The US could potentially seek that status during UNESCO Executive Board meetings in April.

The United States has pulled out of UNESCO before. The Reagan administration did so in 1984 because it viewed the agency as mismanaged, corrupt and used to advance Soviet interests. The US rejoined in 2003."

Gram panchayats owe ₹15 crore.

The MCC is hoping to recover at least ₹10 crore dues a month, starting this year, to drum up its revenue for carrying out development works. Dues on domestic connections stand at ₹105 crore, while it is ₹18.94 crore on non-domestic connections. The MCC is owed ₹7.58 crore on commercial connections and ₹4.97 crore on industrial connections.

The MCC, unlike electricity supply companies, does not follow the system of disconnecting supply in case of non-payment of dues. This has resulted in a steep rise in water dues to the corporation.

The civic body is targeting recovering all the dues by May this year. It has proposed a scheme of waiving interest on dues (subject to consent from the government). But the MCC has no plans of going for disconnection.

MCC Commissioner K.H. Jagadish told reporters here on Tuesday that recovery of water dues is being taken up and a target of ₹10 crore set for January.

He said that many government departments and agencies owe ₹27 crore, and MCC officials were individually approaching the heads of such departments and urging them to clear the dues in one go.

According to him, Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation owes ₹1.51 crore, the Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC) owes ₹85.83 lakh, the Railways ₹69.99 lakh, and the Education Department ₹2.75 crore. Among the other defaulters are the departments of Public Works (₹53.61 lakh), Health and Family Welfare (₹73.77 lakh), Medical Education (₹50.11 lakh), ATI (₹20.91 lakh), Police (₹3.03 crore), Karnataka Exhibition Authority (₹5.09 lakh), KEB Jyothinagar (₹58.87 lakh), and Mysore Urban Development Authority (1.78 lakh).

Besides such attempts to make this language weaker, what shocked the cultural fraternity was the assassination of veteran journalist and Rising Kashmir founder, Shujaat Bukhari- whose immense contribution is well known in cultural circles. Bukhari was not the only renowned journalist but an avid language activist -- who tried his best to save cultural identity of Kashmiris at several world forums.

The attack on our native language bought together cross-sections of people including our literati to raise their voices and organize demonstrations to get their voices heard.

Rising Kashmir gathered some of the events which surprised the Kashmiris and triggered anger among the masses.

Removal of Kashmiri translations from Bhasha Sangam

Ministry of Human Resource and Development first withdrew Kashmiri translations from its language-promoting portal -- Bhasha Sangam -- after Kashmiri Pandits objected to the version of the language it put out.

The Valley-based Kashmiri literary circle ridiculed the MHRD move to remove Kashmiri translations from its language-promoting portal -- Bhasha Sangam and called it a direct attack on ""Kashmiri identity"".

The Valley-based experts of Kashmiri language condemned and expressed displeasure over the move.

Banning Pheran

A controversy erupted in Kashmir following an order banning the use of the pheran, a key part of traditional Kashmiri attire. The order was originally meant for the state secretariat in Jammu and Kashmir.

In September, the General Administration Department of the Civil Secretariat in Srinagar asked government officials to ""be attired in proper formal dress while appearing before any court of law and while attending offices in the State of Jammu and Kashmir and strictly avoid casual or party attire"".

The decision was a security directive. However, the zonal education officer (ZEO) in Langate, following the civil secretariat directive, issued an order last week banning the pheran in educational institutions.

After facing widespread criticism, the school department, later, retracted the order.

Removal of Kashmiri programmes from Kashir channel

Scores of Srinagar based artists registered protests against what they call as ""extinction"" of Kashmiri programmes from Doordarshan's Kashir channel.

The protesting artists -- including freelance producers, directors, singers, actors and professionals associated with production and among others affiliated with the profession.

The artists, who are affiliated with Doordarshan from decades, lashed out at the government and said that there was an ""onslaught"" on Kashmir language as well as on their livelihood as Prasar Bharti wasn't producing any Kashmiri programmes for which the channel was launched.

The channel was launched in 2000 with an aim to cater to the Kashmiri population and also keeping in view the promotion of local talent.

Unfortunately, the artists have not been given an opportunity to work from a decade now.

The artists said the irony is that the channel has been turned into a ""money minting machine for Mumbai-based producers whose flop movies are run at a prime time while local artists suffer.""

They asked the authorities to restore the Kashmiri content on the DD Kashir channel.

Protest to save the dying ""mother tongue""

Scores of the people associated with Kashmiri Language Union (KLU) including students of Kashmiri language department asked the government to save the dying ""mother tongue"" of the place.

""The Kashmiri language is dying and we are losing our identity day by day,"" shouted protestors at Press Enclave Srinagar.

Besides raising slogans like ""Kashrin Henz Pehchan, Kashir Zaban Kashir Zaban (The identity of every Kashmiri is Kashmiri langue, Kashmiri language), the protestors asked governor administration to make this language compulsory at the higher secondary level in all educational institutions.

They appealed the administration including Director of School Education Ghulam Nabi Itoo to implement the order Via 333 edu of 2017 which states that mother tongue of Jammu and Kashmir (Kashmiri, Dogri and Bhudhi) should be made compulsory till higher secondary level throughout the state including Chenab valley.

Announcements in the Kashmiri language stopped at Srinagar Airport

The Airport Authority of India (AAI) stopped making important announcements in the Kashmiri language at Srinagar airport.

AAI had recently announced that the Kashmiri language would be used in their daily announcement at the airport, the move was also welcomed by locals.

As per the frequent flyers, the announcements in the Kashmiri language have been stopped for unknown reasons.

They complained that announcements are made in Urdu and English languages only and the Kashmiri language was not used.

This move has fumed many flyers, who blamed AAI for the step-motherly approach towards the Kashmiri language.

""Many travelers don't understand Urdu and English language. Why authorities have stopped making announcements in the Kashmiri language,"" said one of the passengers.

A revival of Kashmiri Music

The Kashmiri music was back on the track as it became popular among the youngsters.

In 2018, the videos of youngsters singing traditional Kashmiri songs were making rounds on the social media.

Young and professional singers reviewed traditional music by giving it a new feel. The new Sufi music, playing the traditional instruments like Rabab was trending.

The new music trends in local Folk and Sufi music helped in the restoration of the pristine glory of Kashmir language.

Besides, Kashmiri chaker, Rouf, Wanwon and Sufi lyrics also gained popularity among the masses."

The Department of Collegiate Education, last month, issued an order stating that it was compulsory for lecturers from all 412 government first grade degree colleges to undertake these tests. The order states that academic audits will have to be undertaken in April every year.

Officials said that self-assessment would also help teachers reflect on their strengths and weaknesses. ""It will help them identify areas of improvement and how the classes can be improved,"" said a senior official from the DCE. Besides self-assessment, the department also seeks feedback from students on the performance of their lecturers.

The self-assessment exercise, which is mandatory, requires lecturers to fill a detailed form with 35 questions. These include details of the paper they are teaching, the workload they have every week, preparation of teaching material, and use of teaching aid. Besides this, it also asks lecturers to key in the assignments given to students as well as the seminars and field visits conducted for the students. Lecturers also have to submit details on the trainings, research and professional development programmes they have undertaken.

It also asks lecturers to write down the additional responsibilities they have undertaken in college and seeks feedback about the viability of the student strength, with the intention of addressing the challenges they face.

H. Prakash, president, Karnataka Government College Teachers' Association, said the assessment would help develop accountability among lecturers. ""It will also develop healthy competition among the lecturers. This positive reinforcement will boost the morale of the lecturers and break monotony. It will help lecturers who are slacking pull up their socks,"" he said."

Finance Minister Abhimanyu was also present in the meeting.

The database of about 46 lakh families based on the Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC)-2011 has already been prepared.

A 14 digit Id number has been created for each family, it was informed in the meeting.

To update the data based on SECC-2011 following the migration of families, deaths or new births in the family, a massive exercise is being carried out in all districts of the state.

At present, there are about 54 lakh families in the state, which has a population of over 2.5 crore, and these would be covered under this exercise, for which the Department of Planning is the nodal department.

The chief minister directed the deputy commissioners to place hard copies of 'Parivar Pehchan Patra' performa in all offices of public dealing like SDM offices, tehsils, Block offices, schools, ration depot, gas agencies etc so as to ensure that the people visiting these offices for various services update their family details.

Besides, wide publicity should be given to encourage the people to fill the 'Parivar Pehchan Patra' performa, he said.

He directed that it should also be ensured that the people need not to fill the form every time they visit any office or education institution.

He said that the data base that would be finalised after this exercise would serve as a base for all the welfare policies and programmes of the government.

The data would be used by the departments to give benefit of various welfare services to its actual beneficiary by removing duplication as Aadhaar number and phone number of the beneficiary would also be updated in the 'Parivar Pehchan Patra' performa.

The low bed occupancy rate at the six new AIIMS indicates that there is a ""prevalent distrust"" in the healthcare facilities at these institutes, a parliamentary panel has said.

The remark was made by the department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Union Health Ministry in its 111th report on the functioning of the six new AIIMS (Phase-1) under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna.

""The low bed occupancy rate speaks volumes about the prevalent distrust in the healthcare facilities of the new AIIMS,"" the panel said, adding that these institutes have failed ""miserably"" to accomplish the desired objectives.

The committee also noted that only 37 per cent bed occupancy existed in the obstetrics and gynaecology departments of the six new AIIMS.

The panel, in this case, drew a comparison with ""hitherto neglected institute"" Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Imphal, where, it said, it had witnessed during the course of study visits that the bed occupancy rate was 100 per cent.

""The committee also noted that there were 210 beds in the department of obstetrics and gynaecology (at RIMS) with 100 per cent occupancy throughout the year and RIMS carried out 11,000 deliveries per year.

""The committee would appreciate if the new AIIMS-like institutions match at least 25 per cent of the performance delivery of RIMS, Imphal, which the committee witnessed for itself during the study visits,"" the panel said.

The committee recommended for quarterly assessment of the bed occupancy rate in all the six AIIMS and said the institutes should submit a status note citing reasons for its failure towards optimum utilisation of tertiary care facilities and low bed occupancy rate.

The AIIMS brand in itself should reflect a premium medical institute. Therefore, it is more imperative for the new institutions to take all possible measures to ensure high standard of medical education and care is maintained, it said.

""The committee is of the opinion that the AIIMS-like institutions that were anticipated to serve as an excellent centre of medical care have failed miserably to accomplish the desired objective,"" the panel said.

The committee also said a proper mechanism could have addressed construction delays, under-utilisation of budget and other problems that are plaguing the institutions.

The lack of such a surveillance mechanism led to unnecessary delays and cost escalation, it said.

Each Institute should submit a quarterly report to the Health Ministry updating it about the status of infrastructure, faculty and construction activities, the parliamentary panel said.

The committee also recommended that the AIIMS-like institutions should be included in the Mera Aspataal (My Hospital) initiative of the ministry that captures patient feedback for services received at the hospital through multiple channels such as SMS, outbound dialling (OBD) mobile application and web portals.

""The committee is of the opinion that patients feedback is critical for ensuring accountability of the health care system in the country.

""Therefore, the committee recommends for inclusion of all AIIMS-like institutions in the Mera Aspataal initiative in order to enhance its operational proficiency,"" it said.

The committee recommended that PMSSY make frequent visits to the institutions and carry out regular inspections

The ministry should also ensure that the work on paper corresponds to the actual performance of the Institute, it said.

"24","1030517366","2019-01-01","https://freepresskashmir.com/2019/01/01/kashmiri-juveniles-in-the-dock-criminalised-for-life/","Kashmiri juveniles 'in the dock': Criminalised for Life?","Free Press Kashmir",FALSE,"After acquitted by court, juveniles often land in a vicious loop in Kashmir, which ends up derailing their normal way of life.

The presumption of innocence -- a principle that one is considered innocent until proven guilty -- is a basic legal right guaranteed to people in many countries. However, in Kashmir region, there is altogether a different ""law"" in place, which stresses, ""guilty even after proven innocent.""

This illegal ""law"" is operational especially for youngsters, whose future stands hostage of a Public Safety Act (PSA) or an FIR tag. Life suddenly changes, rather comes to a halt, for juveniles, against whom a criminal case is registered.

Many juveniles over the past many years have been slapped with PSA. However, even after their PSA and detention orders were quashed, life became no better for them. Most of them still struggle to lead a normal life, as they are denied of various essential facilities, like admissions, jobs, passport, visa, license, banking and other facilities.

Criminal record of an acquit is often being produced before the inquiry team during their verification process for a government job, passport and other services.

""I have seen many cases, wherein even after juveniles are acquitted, police prepare an adverse report against them that denies them of many rights including employment. They apply for passport but they don't get that as well,"" laments Mir Urfi, advocate at Lower Court, Srinagar.

Advocate Mir Shafkat Hussain, who has represented thousands of PSA detainees in J&K High Court since early 1990s, says, when someone's detention order is quashed, it means nothing was proved against him.

""In that case, the person is entitled for everything. However, in Kashmir, people get nothing after an FIR is registered against them, be it job or admission,"" Hussain says, adding that juveniles and their parents suffer a lot even after the detention orders are quashed.

Representational Picture.

As per a Supreme Court ruling, an employee, who has been detained in preventive custody, may be considered on duty for the period of preventive confinement once his detention orders are quashed and his salary should be released for that period.

""Contrarily, it takes decades for a person to prove his innocence and a person hardly gets any benefit of the law,"" says Hussain. Recently, the advocate continues, he came across a case, wherein a person, who has now got regularised in a government department, has been asked to clear some FIR that was registered against him way back in 1995 even though he was acquitted long back. ""Now he is being dragged from pillar to post for something that happened 23 years ago,"" he says. ""Such is the situation in Kashmir.""

Constant state surveillance is another torture for juveniles. Even after being given clean chit, they are required to report in the concerned police station on regular -- weekly, or fortnightly -- basis. Besides, they are detained for several days on the eve of Republic and Independence days of India, any VIP visit in the Valley and whenever some untoward incident takes place.

""No matter for how many days or weeks they are detained, their food and other expenses have to be borne by their parents, which drains them emotionally as well as financially,"" says Advocate Hussain.

This arbitrary detention of children in Kashmir violates Article 14(4) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which requires that ""all proceedings against juveniles shall take into account their age and the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation"". It also violates the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2013.

To understand the state's wisdom behind such a prevalent practice, I made repeated calls to DG Police Dilbag Singh. The calls went unanswered. Even ADGP Law and Order, Munir Khan, known for his 'easy' police take and talk skipped to respond. ""I will get back to you on this,"" he hung up.

Some low-rung police officers cited the official orders not to speak on record. On anonymity, however, most of them offered their own versions on the issue.

""Police is here for people, however those found taking law and order in their hand, will have to face the law,"" said a young SHO posted in south Kashmir. Regarding the regular summons and repeated arrests, another officer said, ""such steps are being taken in selective cases, keeping the security sensitivity in view.""

However, the rights activists and the legal experts term such approach problematic. ""This vicious police cycle is never-ending even after the case is disposed off. It has a negative impact on the psyche of the children as well as disrupts their social life,"" says Advocate Urfi.

Such recurrent harassment is proving to be detrimental, especially for the career and education of the juveniles apart from affecting their social behaviour.

""I want to pursue my further studies from outside India, but how can I do that? It requires proper verification, which will only go against me. I cannot apply for the passport because of the FIR registered against me,"" shares Taseer (name changed) of Lal Bazaar area of Srinagar city.

His younger brother, Haseeb (name changed), is keen to move to Dubai for his higher studies. Both the brothers, however, stand helpless. The duo was apprehended by local police in May 2016 from their home under stone pelting charges, which they claim to be false. Both of them were detained in Nowhatta Police Station. Taseer, who was barely 16 then, was later shifted to Central Jail, Kotbalwal Jammu, for two months, while his brother was released on bail.

""Even after our parents pleaded before them that we were minors and innocent, the police officials did not listen and detained us. In this process, our education suffered a great deal,"" says Haseeb.

Representational Picture.

Another juvenile, Basit (name changed) of old Srinagar city, too has been struggling hard for his passport. He was apprehended by police a couple of years back under stone pelting charges and was released three months later after his detention orders were quashed.

""My family wants to send me outside for higher education, so that I can stay away from the distressing situation in Kashmir. But then non-issuance of the passport has become a hurdle in way of my education,"" says Basit, who claims to have been detained under false charges.

Experts deem that not being able to pursue education or get a job adds to the mental trauma of the juveniles. ""Such situation is no doubt traumatic for the juveniles. Then there is a possibility that some of them may indulge in heinous crimes,"" warns Advocate Hussain.

Muhammad Sharif Bhat, General Manager, Save the Children -- a non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights -- stresses that children want a peaceful life and wish to continue with their education.

""Life after detention becomes quite difficult and challenging. Someone who stays under detention, only he can explain what effect it has. There is a stigma from society as well as police attached to it. Children suffer from a lot of trauma,"" he says.

Officials at Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), Srinagar, admit that there are still certain loopholes in the juvenile justice system ""for it is still in infancy in the state.""

""This is true that police is illegally detaining juveniles in custody because they are not sensitized enough yet, despite that we often invite the juvenile police unit to our training programmes,"" says Khairulnisa, member, JJB, Srinagar.

She maintains that the juveniles should report to the board about any hurdle they are facing. ""At present, 1,954 cases are pending before the JJBs in the state, of whom no child is facing PSA charges. However, the juveniles who are being constantly harassed by police even after their cases have been quashed should approach us so that we could help them out,"" she stresses.

Justice (R) Hasnain Masoodi, Chairperson, Selection and Oversight Committee monitoring implementation of the law in the state, explains that they can resolve the issues faced by someone only when they bring it to their notice.

""Even as some juveniles raised some issues, say trouble in getting jobs or admissions, they did not follow it for long,"" he says, adding that there is a need to conduct a survey as to how many juveniles had previously been booked under PSA so as to provide required assistance to them.

Justice (R) Hasnain Masoodi (right) with Governor of JK Satya Pal Malik.

""In first place, we need to identify juveniles who were placed under preventive detention and thereafter were released after judicial intervention. We need to see how it has impacted their studies and other aspects of life,"" he says.

Under ICPS, two statutory bodies, viz., Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) are operating. CWC is meant for children who are in need of care and protection. JJB caters to only those cases that are registered through police.

""But then if we receive even an anonymous case, we still entertain them. So the children must approach us with their problems,"" says Khairunisa.

Following complaints that some transport agents engaged for delivery of rice under the scheme in Bhadrak and Keonjhar districts are diverting the food grain for purposes other than providing supplementary nutrition to school children, the State Food Commission had sought immediate intervention of the Government.

Since corrective measures were not taken promptly, as normally expected, the Food Commission moved the Finance department with a request to conduct a special audit into the allegations on a priority basis.

The special audit suggested recovery of '1,888.72 lakh from officials concerned as bulk of the amount relates to short delivery of MDM rice by two transport agents. ""The audit report clearly brings out the gross misconduct and indifference of the District Education Officer (DEO), Keonjhar and other Government employees,"" said a letter of State Food Commission Chairperson Ranglal Jamuda to School and Mass Education department.

The audit found excess consumption of MDM rice by one Manna Trust over and above the requirement. The cost of the excess rice used was estimated at '6.53 lakh. While shortage of rice stock worth '4.4 lakh was detected, the audit has recommended for recovery of '9.24 crore towards non-realisation of sale proceeds of empty gunny bags.Jamuda requested the department to take exemplary action against the culprits in the larger interest of school children."
"30","1030454015","2019-01-01","https://kashmirobserver.net/2019/opinion/where-are-winter-tutorials-last-year-39128","Where Are The Winter Tutorials of Last Year?","Kashmir Observer",FALSE,"The winter in Kashmir is known for its harshness as it cripples normal life and forces people indoors. Every year, authorities here announce the closure of schools with the onset of winter in the first week of December.

Closure of schools during winters becomes inevitable here given the very low temperatures and poor infrastructure of our schools which hinders the continuity of academic activities because these institutions San any kind of heating arrangements. Had been our schools equipped with proper heating arrangements, the long winter breaks could have been avoided.

That is not the case here. It will take us hundreds of years to develop our institutions on those lines. If authorities are really sincere enough to elevate our educational standards then such steps and measures should be kept in pipeline for coming future.

Traditionally, Kashmiri parents would arrange tutors for their children to overcome the academic deficit of winters. Some two decades back, winter tuition was preferably carried out in the homes of teachers or qualified unemployed youth. But, now, the concept of private coaching centers has revolutionized the concept of winter tutioning.

This coaching has become a big industry in our valley. I won't talk here about the role and contribution of these coaching centers but I would definitely talk about low access of poor children to these centres. Authorities had probably recognized the fact, and winter tutorials were made operational at selective schools, particularly during the last winter. The move of authorities was hailed by one and all particularly by the parents of the poor children.

Government schoolTeachers were deputed to teach at these centres which had been instrumental in the academic prosperity of the student community. Last year, I was part of such a winter tutorial where many hundred students of our own village and the children of adjacent of villages were taken care off.It had minimized the academic deficit of winters in our schools.

This winter, all the parents and children were waiting for such centres to be made operational. Many parents were in close touch with me for the winter tutioning of their wards. Even I too was anticipating an order in this regard but, alas ! Authorities have either linked the future of our children with unemployment or with the additional remuneration of teachers deputed at these centres. Bizzare and tragic ! The incumbent authorities should have appreciated and acknowledged the teachers deputed at these centres. Remuneration should have been increased.Even Authorities could have made it mandatory for teachers to work in these centres.

No, the case is not so. Teachers have been removed from the assignment. The children of lesser God are waiting for a compassionate direction from authorities but their wish will remain a wish only. Authorities have off late decided to run a few coaching centers in some higher secondary schools but to the utter resentment and surprise of parents, these centres are yet to be made operational. One-third part of the vacations is over. There is no clue of the people who are supposed to teach in these centres. The proposed centre at higher secondary school Naidkhai is just a kilometre away from my residence, and believe me, there is no one to teach the children.Many children from my own neighborhood are repeatedly asking me if the said centre will be made functional or not.

I can't reply them with authority. I wonder if authorities are really sincere enough to elevate our educational standards. I pity the plight of these children who are unconsciously wasting their precious time, playing with glass pebbles or marbles in the streets and alleys of villages.These children are supposed to assume the chairs of teachers, engineers and doctor of our nation. Who is jeopardizing the future of these children and the collective future of our society? Let people open their eyes.

Let people at the helm of affairs revisit their plans and policies. Don't link the education of children with unemployment or money. Let parents know that teachers are hapless to impart the education to their children.

After vacations, the teachers are blamed for all the mess in the department.When children remain out of touch with their books, how can they do well after the reopening of the schools in the March. Children are roaming like sheep and there is no one to take care of them. I don't want monetary benefits for everything. Let authorities force teachers to teach at these centres. I will be the first to volunteer myself for the cause. I hope most of the teachers of our department will turn up as volunteers but at least issue a simple order. Let you bell the cat and I guarantee people that our teachers will not give you any opportunity of complaint. I request parents and the respectable citizens of our society to stop blaming teachers alone. Let people at the helm be made accountable. Intellectuals and respected citizens of our nation must come forward for the rescue of our innocent children. Teachers are ready to face any kind of challenge lest you should test their potential.We are not lazy and shirkers but we lack a proper platform."

This article is part of Inc42's special year-end series -- 2018 In Review -- in which we will refresh your memory on the major developments in the Indian startup ecosystem and their impact on various stakeholders -- from entrepreneurs to investors. Find more stories from this series here.

In the last 10 years, India's foreign trade policy has transformed, with the country often enjoying the fastest growth in the world in terms of annual GDP growth rate. The Indian government has taken a slew of initiatives to boost exports and the year gone by shows this.

Although Prime Minister Narendra Modi's frequent foreign trips -- 41 trips to 59 countries -- have drawn a lot of flak, the trips have purportedly helped increase and strengthen India's international relationships.

India's strong existing and newly-forged international trade relationships have rubbed off on the Indian startup ecosystem as well, and with resounding effect. Startup India is one of the flagship programmes of the Indian government, and it has benefited in many ways from PM Modi's trips and his new foreign trade policy.

In his visits to Middle-east, Australia, UK, US, Japan, and many other countries, forged new bilateral partnership between Indian startup ecosystem and these countries.

Dozens of international agreements were signed involving entities in the startup ecosystem this year, including the UK-India tech partnership, Startup Konnect programme with the Silicon Valley, #StartupLink with Netherlands, India-Israel startup collaborations, Sino-Indian startup programmes, to name a few.

In this year-end special, we've bring you a recap of the international relations the Indian startup ecosystem strengthened this year.

India and the UK have been trade partners for a long time. India chose to continue the partnership after its Independence on August 15, 1947 as well.

Today, the UK, with its $2.62 Tn GDP is the fourth-largest economy in the world while India, with a $2.6 Tn GDP, stands at number five. By 2030, India, is set to become world's third-largest economy, ahead of Japan and the UK.

The UK has intensified its trade partnership with India since the Brexit announcement. The reason for this is that once Brexit is implemented, the UK's access to the EU market will take a hit and India can be another lucrative market for the UK. Trade and investment between India and the UK increased by 15% in the last one year with a significant creation of jobs in both the countries.

In April, the two countries even signed the UK-India Tech Partnership to invoke synergies in the technology space with the aim of improving the lives of their citizens and boosting their economies.

After the US, EU, and China, India is the top trade partner for the UK. In its 'Preparing For Our Future Policy' after Brexit, the UK's Department for International Trade stated, ""We can also conduct trade reviews with the aim of strengthening a bilateral trade relationship by identifying options to overcome barriers to trade, improving our links in the immediate future, and laying the groundwork to develop future long-term trade relationship. For example, we are starting to undertake a trade review with India.""

As of 2016, the top exports from the UK to India are nuke, pearls, stones, metals, coins, electronic equipment, iron and steel, pharmaceutical products, and beverages. India's exports to the UK are services, apparel articles, vehicles, and pharmaceutical products.

The UK-India Tech Partnership: Key Initiatives

The UK government has also committed up to $48.4 Mn to the Indian startup ecosystem under the UK-India Fast Track Fund. The fund will be invested in fintech, edtech, agritech, healthtech, and technology-driven manufacturing startups.

The UK has also been negotiating Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with India, but the Indian government has been reluctant to go ahead with the discussions as it will likely wait till the Brexit terms are finalised between UK and EU. The UK is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019.

India-US relationship is as strong as ever. -- Barack Obama, Former US President

There has always been a people-to-people and corporate connect between two of the largest and oldest democracies in the world -- India and the US -- resulting in a robust trade partnership between the two countries. In the past decade, however, India-US bilateral relations have developed into a strategic partnership, based on shared democratic values and increasing convergence of interests on bilateral, regional, and global issues.

According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) of the Indian government, India-US bilateral trade in goods and services increased from $104 Bn in 2014 to $140 Bn in 2017. Out of $140 Bn, the two-way merchandise trade stood at $66.7 Bn. Of this, India's exports of goods to the US were valued at $46 Bn and India's imports of goods from US were valued at $21.7 Bn. Meanwhile, India-US trade in services stood at $47.2 Bn. Of this, India's exports of services to the US were valued at $26.8 Bn and India's imports of services from US were valued at $20.3 Bn.

In January 2015, during the-then US President Barack Obama's visit to India, both countries made a commitment to increase the bilateral trade to $500 Bn. Further, as India announced a number of infrastructure-related mega-projects, including the Smart City project, Delhi-Mumbai Corridor, Bharatmala project, and more, in 2017, the largest-ever US delegation (comprising 120 members) visited India with a special focus on facilitating foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio investment, capital market development, and financing of infrastructure.

According to the MEA, a US-India Infrastructure Collaboration Platform has been set up to deploy cutting-edge US technologies to meet India's infrastructure needs.

For Indian startups, entrepreneurs, and entrepreneur-turned-investors, Silicon Valley (San Francisco Bay area) in the US has been mecca of inspiration. A large number of first-generation entrepreneurs started up in India based on their experience in the Valley or inspired by it from afar.

In a step further, Silicon Valley-based companies such as Intel, Google, NetApp, Cisco, Amazon and IBM have been harnessing Indian startups in India with their incubation programmes.

In order to keep the spirit of this collaboration alive, India's premier trade bodies NASSCOM, TiE, and IIM-Ahmedabad's CIIE India (Centre of Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship) hosted the first India-US Startup Konnect (a bilateral startup exchange and collaboration programme) in Silicon Valley on September 2. to highlight the strengths of the Indian startup ecosystem. More than 30 Indian startups selected for this programme exhibited their products, prototypes, and achievements to investors and other potential Valley partners at the event.

In the aftermath of Brexit, a number of EU countries have come forward to encash the 'London' opportunities, with the Netherlands, Ireland, Finland, Germany and Estonia leading the race.

For the Netherlands, the Dutch companies Phillips and Unilever, which for long have been part of India's DNA, made the road easier. The trade has been perfectly a balanced one as India 's two top companies in their own sectors -- TCS and Tata Steel -- have been among the biggest employers in the Netherlands.

More than 200 Indian companies have already set up their bases in the Netherlands. The European country's GDP, meanwhile, is completely dependent on foreign trade, which comprises more than 50% of its GDP. The Netherlands is also the sixth-largest FDI maker in India.

As both the countries commit to strengthening their trade relationship further, unlike, the US, the UK and China who have been more interested in corporate collaboration, the Netherlands has been primarily focussing on university exchange programmes, startups and the SMEs sector, promising a readymade infrastructure with the availability of incubation support and funding.

Focussing on the same, the Netherlands has also been organising the India-Holland Connect programmes at various cities of India for the last few years. The Netherlands seeks the contribution of Indian startups in the areas of logistics, cleantech, and medical science. After the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency (NFIA) India invited Indian technology companies and startups to carry on their R&D related activities in the Netherlands, which already has a readymade and conducive infrastructure, the European country is now looking to join hands with Indian startups to catalyse its port-related developments.

In May this year, the two countries officially launched Indo-Dutch #StartUpLink platform to open-up the Indian and Netherlands market for startups from both the countries that are looking to expand to international markets.

The platform has been developed by Startup India in collaboration with the Netherlands Embassy that provides startups access to relevant information to networking, pilot opportunities, and many more. The Startup India Hub under Invest India and the Netherlands Enterprise Agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Change of that country will act as a single point of contact and the navigators for their respective countries.

Speaking to Inc42 during the StartUpLink launch, Dutch minister for foreign trade and development cooperation Sigrid Kaag had said, ""Over 130 companies and 240 participants, this is a sign of our commitment. The MoUs have been signed in the areas of education (between the universities), waste management, health, water, food and agriculture, waste management, ecommerce, and fintech.""

The India-Israel partnership has a long, long history. Started in 500 BC, with Jews migrating to the Indian subcontinent, India recognised Israel as an Independent nation in 1950 while Israel opened an immigration office in Mumbai, which as the trade and bilateral relationship strengthened, was further made to a trade office and later a consulate.

Israel has always been one of India's major defence partners, second only to Russia. From $200 Mn in 1992 (primarily in diamond trade), merchandise trade diversified and reached to $5.02 Bn (INR 36,500 Cr) (excluding defence) in 2016-17, with the balance of trade being in India's favour by more than $1 Bn (INR 7271 Cr).

More importantly, Israel offers one of the best startup ecosystems in the world. This can be understood by the fact that as of 2017, Israel had about 4000+ startups, which had raised venture capital per capita at two-and-a-half times the rate of the US and 30 times that of Europe, according to a World Economic Forum report.

This year, the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA), an investment arm of the Israel government, launched a new pilot programme for Israeli startups to test their products in India.

Last year, the two countries had launched a bilateral innovation challenge called the India-Israel Innovation Bridge for startups in both the countries. The Innovation Bridge has selected six Israeli tech startups specialising in the fields of healthcare, agriculture, and water management. The programme is designed to help Israeli startups develop, adapt, and commercialise their innovation in the Indian sub-continent.

These initiatives were kickstarted last year when PM Modi and Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu came together to launch the India-Israel Innovation Bridge, aimed at facilitating bilateral collaborations between startups, tech hubs, corporations, and other key innovation ecosystem players in both the countries.

Intel India and the Israel Consulate General have also collaborated to drive technology development and innovation by connecting startups and enterprises from both the countries. ""Intel India will shortlist 50-100 Israeli startups in the course of next three years,"" Intel India head Nivruti Rai told Inc42 at that time.

We should keep on going along the path of globalisation. Globalisation is good... when trade stops, war comes. -- Jack Ma, Alibaba

Be it the spread of Buddhism by Indian missionaries in 300 BC and afterwards or Bodhidharma, an Indian Buddhist monk, who spread martial arts, famously called Shaolin Kung Fu in Mainland China in around 500 AD, India and China share perhaps one of the oldest cultural relations in the world. And their trade partnership was a natural corollary of this relationship.

Since Indian Independence, the two countries, despite being on not-so-good terms, have been amplifying trade rapprochements year after year. For the past decade, both India and China have been the among the fastest-growing countries in the world, according to GDP growth rates.

The two countries signed a Trade Agreement in 1984, paving the way for the most-favoured nation treatment. In 1994, the duo entered into another agreement to avoid double taxation.

According to the MEA, in 2016, India was the 7th largest export destination for Chinese products, and the 27th largest exporter to China. India-China trade in the first eight months of 2017 increased by 18.34% year-on-year to $ 55.11 Bn. India's exports to China increased by 40.69% year-on-year to $10.60 Bn while India's imports from China saw year-on-year growth of 14.02 % to $44.50 Bn. The Indian trade deficit with China further increased by 7.64% year-on-year to $33.90 Bn.

From a startupper's lens, India's strategic investment partnership with China is the second-most crucial partnership after its relations with the US. In 2017, Chinese internet companies such as Alibaba, Fosun, Baidu, and Tencent invested a whopping $5.2 Bn (INR 378.1 Bn) in 30 Indian companies. The number is nearly a five-fold jump from the $1 Bn (INR 7271 Cr) that companies from China pumped into 41 Indian firms in 2016.

This makes China rank among the fastest-growing sources of FDI in India.

Chinese VC funds are scouting for the next big Indian internet investment. Nearly half a dozen such firms, including Tencent, Qiming Ventures, Morningside Ventures, CDH Investments, 01VC, and Orchid Asia Group are looking to buy stakes in Indian startups across financial and education technology, ecommerce, content and online classifieds.

Recently, furthering the Indian government's agenda of fostering innovation and entrepreneurship among Indian youth, the Embassy of India in China, in partnership with Startup India Association (SIA) and Venture Gurukool, organised the 2nd Startup India Investment Seminar on November 12, 2018 in Beijing. The 1st Startup India Investment event was organised in November 2017.

According to global consultancy firm KPMG's 'India - China: Startups & Beyond' report, ""In 2017, Indian startups received $2 Bn from China, a growth of 3X as compared to the previous year. The surge in investments indicates an inclination of Chinese to shift or expand out of China to leverage the benefits of cheaper labour, new markets and less domestic vulnerability.""

Chinese angel investors Jor Law, Tang Yang, Yu Yongfu, and many others have now started aggressively investing in Indian startups. India-China bilateral trade has now reached to a new height of $84.4 Bn.

Similar to China, India's ties with Japan started with Buddhism entering Japan back in 600 BC. Japan's relations with independent India kickstarted in 1949 (after World War II) when India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru donated an Indian elephant to the Ueno Zoo in Tokyo and empathised with what Japanese had gone through (in the War). Japan signed its first-ever peace treaty with India and the two established diplomatic relations on April 28, 1952.

In 2015, Japan and India entered into an agreement for the execution of Mumbai-Ahmedabad 505-km high-speed rail corridor at the cost of $14 Bn (INR 98K Cr). Japan also announced facilitating the training 30K Indian people over the next 10 years at the Japan-India Institute for Manufacturing (JIM), providing them with Japanese-style manufacturing skills and practices as part of Make In India campaign.

Meanwhile, Japanese investment giant SoftBank, led by Masayoshi Son, has been investing aggressively in India in recent years. A majority of leading startups in the Indian startup ecosystem -- including Ola, OYO and Paytm -- have the Japanese investor as a major shareholder.

According to Inc42 Datalabs, Japanese investors channelled cumulative investments of over $8 Bn (INR 581.6 Bn) into the Indian startup ecosystem between 2014 and mid-2018 across more than 80 deals. It is interesting to note that over 45 unique Japanese investors have contributed to this investment volume.

Despite increased international collaborations, not everything is as fine as one would expect it to be. Since Trump's came to power in the US, a new trade and tariff war has emerged across the world, with the US trying to renegotiate the previously agreed trade terms with other countries.

This has also affected Indian startups adversely as the US has kept delaying the startup visa for Indians, a violation of International Entrepreneurship Rule (IER). While the US's new protectionism policy has been affecting India directly, it is also expected to affect Sino-Indian trade adversely.

The latest US-China trade war has forced China to increase its export prices on numerous products. This, therefore, is also affecting Indian companies, including startups which are largely dependent on imports from China.

In the wake of 'America First' and 'nationalism over internationalism', the US's withdrawal from the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Mitigation has also adversely affected international efforts with regard to cleantech and EV policies.

""Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,"" said French President Emmanuel while addressing the peace forum this year.

In another aftereffect of US policies, the melting rupee has added to startup worries. While launching its mobiles in September this year, Xiaomi global vice president Manu Jain told Inc42, ""If the rupee continues to fall free, we will have to soon revise our prices."" Most product startups which buy raw material from abroad and operate on thin margins have been facing similar issues.

Despite some immediate barriers, with the transformed foreign trade policy 2015-2020, India's export is expected reach $750 Bn by 2018-2019. India's share in the world trade is also expected to double from 3% to 6%.

However, in the upcoming year 2019, the trade wars will continue to affect the global economy adversely and India will be no exception this time, unlike 2007, global economic slowdown."

Bose's novel derivation of Planck's formula without relying upon classical electrodynamics resolved a conceptual inconsistency which had troubled all famous scientists of the day.

The significance of his paper can be gauged by how Abraham Pais in his biography of Einstein, Subtle is the Lord, describes it: ""The paper by Bose is the fourth and last of the revolutionary papers of the old quantum theory (the other three being by, respectively, Planck, Einstein, and Bohr).""

On the first day of the new year, ThePrint celebrates the 125th birth anniversary of one of India's greatest physicists.

Bose was born on 1 January, 1894, in Calcutta. His father Surendranath Bose was an accountant in the Executive Engineering Department of the East Indian Railways.

Bose completed his high school from the Hindu School, and thereafter, joined Presidency College for further studies. He completed his BSc from the science department in 1913, and his MSc in Mixed Mathematics in 1915. Standing first in both, he enjoyed the privilege of having minds like Meghnad Saha, N.R. Dhar and P.C. Mahalanobis as either his classmates or seniors, men who would later become great physicists, chemists and mathematicians themselves.

After completing his masters, Bose along with Saha started to teach at the newly formed University College of Science in Calcutta. Those were difficult times for any Indian researcher as not only advanced books were unavailable in the library, it was also difficult to order them from abroad because of the ongoing World War I.

Moreover, a lot of the advanced research in physics existed only in French and German, and so Bose and Saha had to teach themselves the two languages. It proved helpful, though, as Saha translated Einstein's 1905 paper on special relativity into English and his 1916 paper on the foundation of general relativity theory, making them the first translations of Einstein's famous work in English.

In 1921, Bose moved to Dhaka University from where he would make his most significant contribution to physics.

In 1900, German physicist Max Planck came up with his famous formula describing distribution of energy from a black body radiation. It was one of the seminal events in the development of quantum theory. However, there was a fundamental problem that had to be resolved.

Before Bose, all derivations of Planck's formula had relied upon classical electrodynamics even though the basic principles of quantum theory are irreconcilable with laws of classical electrodynamics. Bose, however, managed to overcome this problem and came up with a novel derivation. Thereafter, in June 1924, he sent a letter to Albert Einstein in which he attached his research and sought Einstein's opinion. He also requested him to get the paper published if he likes it.

Einstein not only translated the paper into German and got it published, but also added a translator's note at the end: ""Bose's derivation of Planck's formula appears to me an important step forward. The method used here gives also the quantum theory of an ideal gas, as I shall show elsewhere.""

He also sent a letter to Bose in which he acknowledged his work as an ""important contribution"".

Bose used the letter to get a two-year research leave in Europe where he made acquaintances with other famous scientists of the period like Paul Langevin and Madame Curie. He joined the laboratory of Maurice de Broglie where he learnt techniques of X-ray spectroscopy and crystallography. He continued his occasional correspondence with Einstein and also managed to meet him in Berlin.

In late 1926, Bose returned to India and was appointed professor of physics and Head of Department at Dhaka University in 1927. He continued to make other important scholarly contributions to physics and wrote papers on a range of subjects like 'D2 Statistics', 'Total Reflection of Electromagnetic Waves in the Ionosphere', 'On Lorentz Group' (concerning relativity), 'On an Integral Equation of the Hydrogen Atom Problem', etc.

In 1945, he moved back to Calcutta University from where he retired in 1956. Thereafter, he became Vice-Chancellor of Visva Bharati University, an office he left in 1959.

Bose was a proponent of providing education in the local language (which in his case was Bengali). This belief strengthened after his visits to Japan where he noticed that even complex scientific ideas were discussed in Japanese. He also presided over a meeting that passed a resolution to create a society ""Bangiya Bijnan Parishad"" with the objective of promoting and popularising science through the regional language.

Bose died on 4 February 1974 at the age of 80."

For many students, it also led to loss of their precious documents. In this environment of despair, there was a welcome announcement. As a special gesture to students from CBSE affiliated schools, whose board exam academic documents such as marksheets, migration certificates, pass certificates were lost or damaged in the Kerala floods, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) decided to facilitate and provide digital mark sheets, migration certificates and pass certificates, made possible due to the integration with DigiLocker. With over 1,300 schools are affiliated to the CBSE in Kerala, this was a significant step as board exam academic documents are crucial for admission for higher studies and employment. This announcement also showed India the importance of electronic storing and validation of documents.

Targeted at the idea of paperless governance, DigiLocker was created as an electronic platform for issuance and verification of documents and certificates in a digital way, thus eliminating the use of physical documents. Organisations that are registered with Digital Locker can push electronic copies of documents and certificates (e.g. driving license, Voter ID, School certificates) directly into citizens lockers. Citizens can also upload scanned copies of their legacy documents in their accounts. These legacy documents can be electronically signed using the eSign facility.

As part of the Indian Tech Leaders Series, we are honoured to bring you the views of Amit Ranjan, Architect, National DigiLocker Project (National eGov Division, Ministry of IT, GoI) who shares the key aspects that were considered while building DigiLocker, the role of open source, and his future vision for DigiLocker

As the CTO / key architect of DigiLocker, what are some of the key aspects that you have kept in mind while designing the platform for scalability?

DigiLocker is a key Digital India initiative for paperless governance and its goal is to create a nationwide federated document exchange network operating across the public and private space. Accordingly, scalability has been one of the key design principles for the project right from the inception stage. The selection of technology and architecture was made in a way that would allow the platform to scale vertically and horizontally. The platform uses concepts like Open APIs, microservices based architecture, cloud storage, caching etc. to achieve this goal.

The partners which integrate with DigiLocker as ""Issuers"" host their data (or documents) individually on their own servers, without any centralised aggregation, thus reducing the risks that may be associated with a single point of failure.

The project was divided into phases with realistic targets. The phases provided concrete goals in terms of key metrics like anticipated number of users of the platform, file storage parameters, database performance etc. Additionally, the infrastructure is constantly monitored, adjusted and fine-tuned with every major release. Scaling an application isn't a one-time activity, but a dynamic, continuing process that needs constant changes and iterations in architecture and solutions used. The technology and product teams running DigiLocker are in a constantly learning mode to face the unique challenges that come up with every stage of the fast-growing platform's evolution.

How important is open source to the overall development and design of DigiLocker?

DigiLocker runs almost exclusively on open source technologies. This is in line with (MeitY) Ministry of Electronics & IT's policy of encouraging open source with a view to promote reuse, reduce cost, invoke community participation and allow peer review. Open source promotes innovation by giving the freedom to try, test and scale your solution, one step at a time. An additional advantage of using open source over proprietary solutions in a government set-up, is reduced time cycles due to absence of RFPs, tendering etc.

DigiLocker is based on open source programming languages like PHP, Python and Node.js. On the server front, it uses Apache, Nginx, MemCache, databases like MongoDB & MariaDB, file systems like GlusterFS etc. The DigiLocker user application (DigiLocker portal) is based on an open source application called OwnCloud. OwnCloud is a very popular solution globally for building open sourced, cloud based, document management systems. DigiLocker with over 15 million users, is the world's largest OwnCloud installation. The DigiLocker team is in constant touch with OwnCloud's open source developer community for feedback and constant iterative learning.

In your view, what are some of the major areas/functions on which DigiLocker has made a major impact in the country? Can you cite some examples?

DigiLocker's impact can be gauged from the fact that it has digitised 294 crore citizen documents and made it available on a user-friendly cloud application that be accessed across web and mobile devices. 64 issuers comprising government and private organizations have been integrated with DigiLocker; prominent amongst them are UIDAI (for eAadhaar), Ministry of Transport (for digital driving licenses & vehicle registrations), Income Tax Department (for PAN verification records), Ministry of Petroleum (for LPG subscription vouchers), CBSE (for Std X & XII marksheets and certificates), NSDC (for skill certificates), eDistrict applications of 13 state governments, secondary education boards of 12 states (for school marksheets and certificates) etc. Citizens have started using DigiLocker in ways that make their lives simpler and paperless.

Here are some notable examples:

* Thousands of citizens are showing their DigiLocker driving license and registration certificates to traffic policemen everydaywhen stopped on the road

* Railway passengers are showing DigiLocker's digital documents to ticket collectors for identity verification

* CBSE announced Std X & XII board results in May 2018; on that day itself, digital marksheets of students was made available to them in their DigiLocker accounts

* Many Fintech startups into consumer lending have integrated with DigiLocker for digitally verifying loan applicants in a few minutes (versus hours or days earlier)

* After the recent Kerala floods, where over a million state residents have lost their identity documents, the state government is working with DigiLocker for reissuing of digital documents directly into citizens' DigiLocker accounts to safeguard against a natural calamity occurring again. So overall one can say that DigiLocker's usage is growing, though a lot more needs to be done.

Your future vision for DigiLocker

DigiLocker's vision falls under the ambit of the Digital India mission to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. The goal of the project is to provide to all Indian citizensa digital platform for paperless services, that they can use in their daily lives. In many ways, the project is ""competing with paper"" through the use of innovative technology.

The entire ecosystem of paper - from its creation, to printing, to storing, transferring and verifying it is slow, inconvenient, wasteful, corruption inducing, besides being unfriendly to the environment. We think DigiLocker can be a transformative game-changer here and make the lives of Indian citizens simpler and more convenient than before. It will also lead to reduced bureaucracy, result in massive cost savings and usher in a new era of technology enabled governance.

The announcement was made as part of a new health scheme which will promote menstrual hygiene. PTI had reported that Rs 76 crore was also allotted for this initiative. As the world welcomes 2019, Rajasthan's new scheme will soon become a reality.

Sanitary napkin vending machines will be installed in all 189 government colleges, Times of India reported. The decision was made by the department of higher education and will be implemented from next academic session starting July 2019.

As per the scheme, sanitary napkins will be distributed to women aged between 15 and 45 in schools, colleges, anganwadi centres as well as sub-health centres. Bhanwar Singh Bhati of the higher education department told TOI that the proposal was being sent to the government. ""An allocation of Rs 2.5 crore is required."" he further said.

Health and education remain two important areas that need immediate attention in Rajasthan. The measure is a part of the newly elected government- Indian National Congress' 60 day programme where government college education was also made free for girls.

Menstruation still remains a taboo in many states of India, especially in rural areas. Not maintaining proper menstrual hygiene can result in serious infections and health issues among adolescent girls. Absence of or expensive cost of sanitary napkins makes them a luxury for many women residing in backward areas.

Many awareness campaigns have also been organised in the state. Local level village representatives, women self help groups, and corporate organisations have been roped to break eerie silence around this topic among young girls and women.

Taking a cue from a Rajasthan school teacher, Sandeep Joshby, who was recently awarded by a RSS affiliated student wing for instilling nationalism among his students, the Gujarat government has asked all the government and state-funded schools to ensure that its students respond with ""Jai Bharat"" or""Jai Hind"" during roll calls instead of ""present sir/madam.

The circular was issued by the State Education Department on Monday and would be enforced from January 1 across the Gujarat Schools from class 1 to 12. The notification said that the directive was issued by the State Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama.

It further states ""in order to instill nationalism among the students from a young age, the sudents of all schools, government, grant-in-aid as well as private, should say 'Jai Bharat' or 'Jai Hind', instead of 'Yes sir' or 'Present sir' across the state from January 1, 2019. Ensure this is followed across all schools.""

The Education department officials told the Indian Express that the decision came after a school teacher from Jalore districtn of Rajashthan was recently awarded by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidya Parishad (ABVP) with Yashwantrao Kelkar youth award for his work as well as making his studens say ""Jai Hind"" and ""Jai Bharat"" during roll call.

The education minister justified the decision by saying that it was an old practice in Gujarat schools to say ""Jai Hind or Jai Bharat"" during roll calls which somewhow was not followed now and the same has been revived.

Earlier, the former BJP government led by Vasundhara Raje had come under heavy critcism for changing the school curriculum and forcing the ideas of nationalism and culturalism among the students.

The Rajasthan Education department had defended is the decision of including the native history and culture as well as that of India by saying that the young children should first learn from their own society than from the outside world."

The conference will be held at IIM-Bangalore on January 4 and January 5, 2019.

The future of learning (FoL) conference 2019 aims to highlight innovation and foster dialogue between the major actors shaping the 21st-century learning models, namely, academics, entrepreneurs, regulators and technologists.

Despite the emphasis on a digital transformation of the economy, the rural-urban divide is huge, with the internet penetration in urban and rural areas pegged at 65 per cent and 20 per cent respectively leaving over 50 per cent of India's population unserved or underserved with regards to educational services. The situation in much of South Asia is similar with 65 per cent of the population with limited or no access to the internet.

The conference will discuss factors that account for these gaps in technology, policy and practice, and how advances in technology can be leveraged to make high-quality education affordable, accessible and empowering.

The SMSB had a few days ago issued a circular to the principals of all 313 municipal schools in the city, asking them to conduct the General Knowledge test for Class VIII students. The exams were conducted between 9 am and 10 am, and 1.00 pm and 2.00 pm. They were given 40 minutes to complete the test.

Congress member in Surat Municipal Education Board Shafi Jariwala said, ""Now the BJP is playing with the brains of students by putting questions related to different schemes started by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We will not tolerate this and will protest. If a question paper is on General Knowledge, then there are many questions that can be asked.""

Surat Municipal Administrative Officer Vimal Desai could not be contacted despite several attempts.

But, reacting to the incident, chairman of Surat Municipal Education Board Hasmukh Patel said, ""The purpose of the GK Test is that we want to check how much our students know about the central government schemes. The second reason is that in the municipal schools majority of the students come from poor backgrounds. We wanted to make them aware of the government schemes so they can avail benefits.""

""The OMR answer sheets will be checked by schools supervisors who have been supplied with answer keys. We will start a drive in schools where maximum numbers of students fail the test, and make them aware of the central government schemes. The reason for conducting the test for Class VIII is that from next year they will switch over to other schools so they should know about different government schemes.""

What emerges is that systemic violence and discrimination against women, especially in rural areas, runs deep, and goes beyond just the sexual.

Bundelkhand, as of late 2018, is poor, dry and stuck in a paralysis of governance, far from the 'feel good' narratives that most state-sponsored PR and blindsided patriotism seems buoyed by. Things are not getting better here, but things are also not the same. Cheap internet connections and smartphones are aglow in villages that dot the barren ghats. Women are at work, 'lower castes' are in public spaces, changing and redefining them. Large bribes are paid so that the women of the family can be teachers and nurses, earning hefty permanent salaries, and supporting unemployed male members.

But what of the dark lining below these stories of social and economic change? What does the workplace look like for these women who are resetting centuries of gender, class and caste oppression? Can they speak truth to power as we hear women in other places speaking? Or is silence a small price for the slow-moving liberties that they have gained? What shape can #MeToo take here?

I. Rajkumari*, 25, Journalist

The editorial structure of the media here is shaped like an inverted pyramid, with the number of paid editorial staff reducing to a pinpoint as you go lower and deeper into up country or rural locations, and where advertising revenues are slim. Large media corporations may have stringers, who, since they are not on the payroll, work for multiple organisations, and double as advertising agents with revenue targets and hefty commissions. In this game of mobility, networking, insecure finances, blackmail and political and administrative power brokering, women are rarely seen or heard. The ones who are, are treated with some curiosity and a lot of lewd relish.

Her Story

He made it impossible for me to go to the administrative offices.

Everyone was under his thumb.

No one would speak to me.

I stopped reporting.

Rajkumari never finished school, and in her late teens when she had the opportunity to be trained as a professional journalist, she took it. A Dalit, her family has had few avenues of livelihood, and there were many sisters to support. Rajkumari began working as a reporter. After her marriage, her marital family wasn't supportive of her 'gallivanting about' at unpredictable hours, and so she had to leave.

Years of economic and domestic strife later, she pleaded her way back to journalism. She began to work in the Ajaygarh block of Panna district in Madhya Pradesh, a short bus ride across the border from her village in Banda. Rajkumari saw no other women reporting, as she began to establish herself in her new beat, familiarising herself with villages, panchayat level workers and local influencers. When she went to the block office to question a few relevant officials on her first lot of stories, she was accompanied by a colleague, a senior reporter. It was clear immediately that the block office was controlled by one man, Ram Milan Pande, the Block Pramukh. (The Block Pramukh is the highest level of elected official at the block level.) Panchayat elections are both overtly and implicitly political, and Pande was a longstanding Congressman, with strong influence in the region. He had ambitions of running for an MLA position, in the upcoming Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, and he saw Rajkumari, a young, confident and mobile woman in the area, as a creative tool for campaigning. ""He was pretty friendly and quite aged, must have been more than 50 years old,"" Rajkumari's colleague Rajni told us.

In the weeks after, as Rajkumari began to report independently, she was a frequent visitor to the block headquarters. This was when Pande 'started sharing things with Rajkumari to win her confidence'. Well aware that this was par for the course, she suffered Pande's overtures just to get her stories done. But then, one morning in July this year, at the block to interview Pande for a story, Rajkumari's repeated requests were ignored. There was a meeting on she was told, and many officials from the block were present. Pande dealt with the issues at hand, and slowly, the room emptied out, leaving Rajkumari alone with him. He asked her to wait, have tea, he wanted to speak to her about something. He said he would pay for her fuel costs, and she should do some campaigning for him in the block. When she backed away, he grabbed her hand and said,""Not a leaf in this area moves without me. I'll have your newspaper shut down.""

Rajkumari left the office.

In the weeks that passed, she wasn't entertained by any official in the block, none of her requests for interviews or bytes were acknowledged. She slowly stopped reporting in the area.

Within a month, citing domestic reasons, Rajkumari left work again.

II. Seema*, 25, lawyer and activist

Dalit politics in Uttar Pradesh has been a dirty, petty thing, resulting in deep and complex shifts in caste dynamics and social structures in the region over the last three decades. One important historical factor was the establishment of the Bahujan Samaj party in 1984 by Kanshiram, and its mobilisation in Uttar Pradesh. Kanshiram's successor, Mayawati, played a key role in the grassroots mobilisation and spread of an empowering Dalit politics in the state. Increasing political awareness worked alongside policies (including affirmative action for 'other backward castes') that benefited the 'lower' castes in Uttar Pradesh, significantly differently from other north Indian states. Youth in Uttar Pradesh have grown up in this atmosphere of political and social opportunism and opportunity, both frustrated and buoyed at the promises of political emancipation, as well as disappointed by the poverty and unemployment that deep-rooted gender and caste based discrimination still has them trapped in.

Her Story

If I say that I was wrong, people will say I brought it on myself, through my own actions.

I can't name people in the party (BSP) who have abused me. It will give the party a bad name. But many have. They've posted abuse on Facebook, photos and comments. If they see this Dalit girl stepping beyond her boundaries, they do everything they can to pull you down.

Seema was married at 13, in a village that was shadowed by the threat of the notorious 'Babli Kol daku' of Bundelkhand. She is Dalit, and like many Dalit parents, hers brought her up to value education above anything else. She studied even after she was married, and despite resistance from her in-laws, got a job in the labour department in Chitrakoot. Her friendship with a distant relative proved to be a lifelong trauma for Seema, as the boy, observant of her ambitions and perseverance, took photos and posted them online, in the early days of Facebook, resulting in public shame and the end of Seema's marriage. He would call her from different numbers, blackmail her, even come to her home and abuse her. Work became more and more important for Seema to survive both personal strife and economic upheaval,""When I have scars, I lie and say I fell from the roof. Even though everyone in my mohalla knows I'm being harassed and abused, everyone knows I'm being used. Now if he says something or does something, I won't stay quiet. I will fight back. If I don't fight, what hope is there for the next generation? Even though I feel that I'm so aware, I've had to bear so much.""

Meera lives in the district headquarters now, and has been studying law and running her own practice in the district court in Chitrakoot. Over the years, to cope with public and domestic abuse, she has networked with women's groups, political parties and bureaucracy, to help her along the thorny path of a Dalit woman trying to get by in the world. The more mobile and aware she is, the more the forces seem to close-in to throttle her. The district court in Karwi, Chitrakoot, is a sea of upper caste men fighting to maintain the status quo, and make a quick buck as and when they can. ""You know how it is, when you should charge 50, they charge 100; when they should charge 500, they charge a 1000,"" she says. Enter Seema, young, slight, Dalit, smart and articulate.""When I go into the courts, and see women testifying about rape, and see what questions and comments they have to face, the filthy abuse, so loud and aggressive, I understand how someone would be driven to say, it didn't happen, I wasn't raped, I've filed a false case - even if that is entirely untrue. I've seen this happen.""

Last year, her Facebook account was hacked and controversial videos and posts were circulated from it, causing her great stress and public shame.""They plant their people in cyber cafes to watch which Dalit girls are coming and what their Facebook IDs are. And then they post objectionable videos and photos from your accounts. I couldn't eat for days, I was terrified my parents would find out, and commit suicide. But if you work in an office, you have to compromise. People will say, 'Bring us tea, if we come to your home, won't you serve us tea?' And you ignore them, else, how will you feed your children?""

Even as a politically conscious and mobile young woman, Meera is not enough for the forces of gender, caste and feudal power that conspire to hold her down in the world.

III. Susheela*, 53, Auxillary Nurse Midwife

The Auxillary Nurse Midwife or ANM is a permanent or contractual government health worker located in a village level sub-centre. She is responsible for catering to the basic healthcare needs as well as childbirth for a population of 5000. The ANM is a salaried worker, and has a joint account with the village pradhan, into which she receives a fund of Rs 10,000, for various equipment or tasks. The job of an ANM is a prestigious one. It also involves being beholden to a network of village and block level officials, health department staff and politicians. The ANM is crucial to the system of maternal and community healthcare, but is also a woman embroiled in the highly corrupt and chimerical world of local politics and bureaucracy.

Her Story

I was abused.

Let me tell you the story.

It was the 25th of September.

I was at the Panchayat Bhavan.

It's been four months, but every time I think of that incident and those people I become a mess.

It was evening, most people had left. I was waiting for my son to take me home.

My husband is dead, people know I am alone.

Susheela has worked as an ANM for the past 18 years in a remote area of Bundelkhand's Banda district, surrounded by mountains and forests, and regularly visited by dacoits.""You can go to any family in this area and ask about my credentials, if I have ever had a complaint against me,"" Susheela says. She does not stop weeping throughout our interview. Through her tears, Susheela explains the topography of her area of work, through the network of men she must 'work' with -- the sarpanch, local BJP leaders, the Chief Medical Officer, doctors, police superintendent, constables, and local thugs.

As a long-term government employee of the area, she is regularly asked to pay the pradhan ""for expenses of the party, I don't even know what the party is and what they want the money for"". The money that comes into her (joint) account, recently for sanitation tasks in the health centre, is paid to the pradhan. On the fateful evening she describes, Susheela was asking the pradhan to sign in her register to acknowledge she had given him the money -- Rs 8,000.""There were many people around, but I only recognised the three of them, the pradhan, his brother, and the (BJP) treasurer. They began to abuse me loudly, beat their chests. They grabbed my register and tore it, looked at me in a way that terrified me. So many people saw, but no one said a word. Isn't this molestation?""

Susheela went into shock, but later that evening, called the local police station.""They told me I should have dialled 100. I said I wasn't feeling well. Then I spoke to the CMO. Within a day, they had arranged to get me transferred. They don't want me creating trouble."" For months, Susheela resisted this transfer away from her family, her government housing and her familiar area -- at the age of 53.""They told me to go from one official to the other, one doctor to another -- each wants a cut. How can a woman be tormented like this? People ask me to pay them money, then circulate these rumours that I extract money from people. Ask anyone whether I ever did any wrong. The SP, DIG or the Mahila Aayog hasn't heard me out."" She went into a kind of trauma, still visible in her broken, rambling speech. She hasn't been paid a salary in four months, since the incident took place. She received death threats from the pradhan and his brother, and calls from the local police station -- ""Madam, thane mei aakar FIR kar dijiye"" -- calls she recognised as barely concealed threats if she didn't 'compromise'.""Why will I file a case? I need to live in this area. I want my posting cancelled.""

As of 19 December, her transfer has been nullified. She has been reinstated to the sub-centre where she has been working for 18 years, where she slowly adjusts to living in fear.""I haven't slept in four months. I feel like I should call the BJP (party workers, media) and kill myself in front of them.""

Although the water level is low, their trousers get drenched.

MORE THAN two months have passed since Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar laid the foundation stone of the bridge so that villagers in Morni, especially school students, may not have to crawl across a water pipeline to cross over the Ghaggar river, but the work has still not started because according to the PWD officials, ""the contractor was busy completing the work of a government rest house meant for VIPs"".

Harpal Singh, executive engineer of the Haryana public works department, which has to execute the work, said, ""In fact, the contractor was busy with the work of the construction of government rest house which is in front of the DC camp office in Sector 1. He is almost done with it and the next task is this bridge.""

The rest house has suites for the Governor and the Chief Minister, six VIP suites and 59 rooms for officers. It is apart from meeting hall, conference rooms, gymnasiums. Disappointed villagers of the area said that each day counts for them as they still have to wade through the river. Although the water level is low, their trousers get drenched.

""Students who have to cross the river literally shiver when they reach the school. It is already so cold. After their trousers get drenched in water, we make them sit out in the sun and take classes with others,"" Brij Kishore Gautam, a local teacher of the school, said. He added, ""I personally took the number of the contractor and he told me that he was busy in the construction of some rest house."" The villagers stated that the situation will deteriorate in the monsoons and the government won't be able to complete the work in just five months.

Bhola Nand, a local villager, said, ""Barely five months after the monsoons are going to start, they won't be able to construct the basic foundation as well. We will suffer the same way we did last monsoons.""

Residents of 59 villages of Morni have to risk their lives and use a four-inch-wide water pipeline over the Ghaggar river to reach their destinations. After Chandigarh Newsline, in a series of stories had highlighted the plight as to how, in the absence of a bridge, these villagers, especially students of Government Senior Secondary School Koti (located across), had to cross using a 20-foot-high water pipeline over the Ghaggar -- the only way to access their school or other destinations daily -- Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had laid the foundation stone on October 23. It was promised that the work will start in one week but all in vain.

Haryana Education Minister Ram Bilas Sharma had visited the school last month and announced that the work would start soon.

Talking to Chandigarh Newsline, Sharma through his spokesperson said, ""I will inquire as to why the work has not yet been started. I will get it expedited.""

The bridge is being constructed at a cost of Rs 5 crore. It will be a two-lane 110-metre-long bridge. The height will be around 60 feet from the ground and it would help access the Government Senior Secondary School, Koti. The residents had been waiting for the bridge for decades.

This time in August, many students missed their half-yearly exams as the water level in the Ghaggar increased and students could not access their school. There are around 263 students in this school. Over 100 students have to cross the river every day to reach the school. About 60 other young men have to cross the river to reach Raipurrani, Bitna, Kalka, Pinjore or Panchkula for work or to study in colleges or pursue vocational courses."

A circular to this effect has been issued by the state education department, making it mandatory for school students. A government resolution on the mandate was also released by the department on Monday.

Officials of the state education department said the move is aimed at promoting patriotism among students from an early age. ""When I was a student, it was compulsory for me and other students to confirm attendance by saying Jai Hind/ Jai Bharat. The practice was later discontinued. We have taken a decision to resume the practice from Tuesday onwards,"" said Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, state education minister.

""A student says yes sir/ yes madam at least 10,000 times during their schooling. If they replace this with Jai Hind/ Jay Bharat, it will harbour sentiments of patriotism among them,"" he added.

The notification says, ""District education officers (DEO) are supposed to ensure that the circular is strictly implemented across all the government, grant-in-aid and self-financed schools.""

During the recently held 64th national convention of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in Ahmedabad, the recipient of Professor Yashwantrai Kelkar Award, Sandeep Joshi, a schoolteacher based in Jhalor, Rajasthan, said, ""We implemented this practice in our school as a pilot project. However, it later got extrapolated to being implemented across Rajasthan.""

Chudasama was also present at the ABVP convention, when Joshi shared this. When asked if the Rajasthan Model is being followed in Gujarat, he said, ""There is no harm in adopting best practices in education that are implemented in other parts of the country"".

The move will take to scale a Vasundhara Raje-government measure to install sanitary napkin vending machines at a few schools and railway stations. ""The department is sending the proposal to the government. An allocation of Rs 2.5 crore is required,"" said Bhanwar Singh Bhati of the higher education department.

Rajasthan has 2.8 lakh girls in government colleges. For many poor and low-income families, sanitary pads are still out of reach. The move came after a consistent drive by health advocacy groups to install such machines.

The Ashok Gehlot government is about to make superficial changes to usher in visibly and academically different schooling for lakhs of students enrolled in public schools, which will have financial implications for both the state treasury and parents of students.

One of the proposals put up before the government is to change the uniforms of the students in government schools. School education minister Govind Singh Dotasra reviewed the department's works on Monday and said, ""The BJP government has changed the school syllabus to impose ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).We will review the school uniforms of students.""

Other things under scanner are transfer of teachers effected by the Vasundhara Raje government, colour of the bicycles that were painted saffron and given away to meritorious students and the syllabus, he added.

Congress leaders, said sources, pointed out that the existing school dress is identical to khaki colour worn by the members of right-wing outfit. This was brought to the notice of the state education department and has been placed under review. If a change in uniform is ordered, it will impact students in 69,000 government schools across state.

A change in the uniform will lead to financial burden on the parents. The uniform of students was changed only last year. More than 84 lakh students are studying in government schools across the state. On an average, a set of uniform costs Rs 500. In such a situation, there will be an additional financial burden of Rs 420 crore on parents of 84 lakh students, in case they choose to purchase one set of uniform.

Over the last twenty years, the uniforms were changed twice in the state government schools. The BJP government changed the uniform both the time. ""We changed the school uniform after twenty years. This uniform colour is also in practice in several private schools of the country and in state. Changing the uniform after a year is wrong,"" former education minister Vasudev Devnani told DNA.

The Raje government had introduced the new uniform in government schools in the academic session 2017-18. After two decades, the uniform of students enrolled in government schools was changed. In the year 1997, the then BJP government's education minister Gulab Chand Kataria had ordered a change in the uniform of government schools.

The BJP government introduced shirts of light brown colour and khaki pants for boys. For the girls, light brown kurti and salwar and khaki-coloured dupatta was finalised. The uniforms of RSS members include khaki pants.

Congress has earlier accused the BJP government of attempting to impose RSS ideology on students by effecting a change in uniforms. In spite of opposition from the Congress, the BJP government went ahead and implemented the new dress.

Before 1997, the colour of school uniforms was khaki and white. Gulab Chand Kataria who was the education minister then replaced sky blue tops in place of white. In 2017, the uniform in light brown and khaki colour was introduced replacing the sky blue colour."

THE incessant drilling continues throughout the conversation, as it does through most of the day. Their home a stone's throw from where tunnelling work is underway for the Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ Metro rail, 88-year-old Narayan Lavate's forehead is creased. ""I don't know whether we'll be alive when the first station comes,"" says Narayan, a resident of the Laxmibai chawl in Kalbadevi's Zaobawadi area.

Exactly a year ago, Narayan and his wife Iravati had written to the President of India, seeking permission for physician-assisted suicide before they become bed-ridden or before they die a slow natural death, of old age or terminal illness. Certain now that their plea will not be accepted, the couple is bracing for a city where they have seen change intimately change some more.

The Lavates' letter was forwarded to the Maharashtra government chief secretary for consideration. After some correspondence, the couple says they know their wish won't be fulfilled. ""We never thought we will see 2019 coming. But I guess we will,"" Narayan says as Iravati nods.

The couple lives alone in Laxmibai chawl, Narayan's home for 75 years. Iravati moved in 51 years ago, upon marrying him. Through the decades that Narayan spent working with the state transport department and Iravati as a teacher at the Aryan Education Society High School, they have seen Mumbai's transition. From a tram ride at 10 paisa per head to the death of the city tram in 1964, to buses to CNG buses and now electric buses, from taxis to Ubers, and now the Metro rail, the Lavates have watched keenly.

Iravati's evening strolls have ceased. Blue barricades with ""Mumbai is upgrading' painted on them dominate the roads outside the chawl. ""I would walk to the Ram temple in Kalbadevi every evening. Now the roads are dug up. There is no footpath. I am afraid I'll fall,"" says Iravati (79). It's getting increasingly tough to hail a taxi, so every time she needs a ride, she calls a former student to come pick her up.

Two chawl buildings near their home will be pulled down soon as they prepare to undergo redevelopment. Narayan's visits every afternoon to his old office in Mumbai Central have also stopped. ""There's too much traffic,"" he says. The only thing that remains constant in their lives is the limited water supply in their chawl building. There's water in the taps from 5 am to 6 am, like clockwork. Every morning Narayan immerses himself in five newspapers, regional and English, to stay updated. He still does not wear spectacles. Iravati switches to television every evening to watch a Marathi soap.

Since their letter to the President, several NGOs approached them throughout 2018 to place them in old age homes. The two refused. ""We don't want to depend on anyone. That is why we did not have children,"" Iravati says. ""But now even to walk outside on the lane, I need help.""

A maid buys them vegetables every day and cleans their house. Iravati receives Rs 25,000 in pension every month, they spend Rs 500 per day. The couple disagrees on multiple topics, including who will operate the TV. But they agree on one point. What would they wish to change about the city? ""The space for pedestrians. Hawkers have been pushed to the footpaths,"" Iravati says, as Narayan nods."

After becoming MLA, Pankaj Singh had written to the CM in March 2017, suggesting that super-speciality paediatric hospital and post-graduate teaching institute (SSPHPGTI) be handed over to AIIMS.

The MLA said the proposal to hand over the new district hospital building to AIIMS was hence the ""second option"". ""We've to see how the centre wants to take it up. I had suggested this in a meeting with the health minister and the medical education minister, Ashutosh Tandon. They've been positive about the proposal,"" Singh told TOI.

Pankaj Singh said he had also written to the Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate in November, following which the latter had written a letter to UP chief secretary Anup Chandra Pandey, principal secretary SP Goyal, principal secretary (medical health and family welfare) Prashant Trivedi and principal secretary (medical education) Rajnish Dubey. The DM had suggested that the existing SSPHPGTI be ""merged"" with the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Kasna and the state government can think on handing over the upcoming building of the new district hospital to an AIIMS-like institute later.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Rajasthan government scraps minimum education criteria for civic poll candidates

Context: Rajasthan government has approved to do away with the minimum education qualification required to contest panchayat and urban bodies' elections.

Few experts are of the opinion that the requirement of minimum qualification for contesting elections is against the very spirit of 73rd and 74th amendments.

It also violates the right of every citizen to vote and to contest elections, which form the basic structure of the constitution.

It may be noted here that due to these restrictions, many able candidates were debarred from contesting elections. In one way, it can be said that this law has prevented many people from coming to the mainstream.

Even Haryana had passed a similar law mandating minimum education qualification for those contesting in Panchayat Raj Institutions. The constitutional validity of this law of Haryana was questioned in the Supreme Court.

Rajasthan Literacy Rate 2011: Literacy rate in Rajasthan has seen upward trend and is 66.11 percent as per 2011 population census. Of that, male literacy stands at 79.19 percent while female literacy is at 52.12 percent. In 2001, literacy rate in Rajasthan stood at 60.41 percent.

UP is uniquely famous for product-specific traditional industrial hubs across 75 districts, including Varanasi (Banarasi silk sari), Bhadohi (carpet), Lucknow (chikan), Kanpur (leather goods), Agra (leather footwear), Aligarh (locks), Moradabad (brassware), Meerut (sports goods) and Saharanpur (wooden products).

Context: The Prime Minister dedicated the 6th International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), South Asia Regional Center (ISARC) to the nation. The Institute is built at the campus of National Seed Research and Training Center (NSRTC) in Varanasi.

The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) is an international agricultural research and training organization known for its work in developing rice varieties that contributed to the Green Revolution in the 1960s.

Aim: The Institute, established in 1960 aims to reduce poverty and hunger, improve the health of rice farmers and consumers, and ensure environmental sustainability of rice farming.

IRRI is one of 15 agricultural research centers in the world that form the CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research centres, a global partnership of organizations engaged in research on food security. It is also the largest non-profit agricultural research centres in Asia.

IRRI has successfully collaborated with Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) to introduce drought- tolerant, flood-tolerant and salt-tolerant varieties of rice in India. The Varanasi Centre would help increase farmers' income by enhancing and supporting rice productivity, reducing cost of production, value addition, diversification and enhancement of farmers' skills.

Context: The Union government has declared inclusion of 17 new minor forest produce (MFP) under the government's minimum support price scheme.

The Pricing Cell, constituted by the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Ltd (TRIFED), recommended inclusion of new MFPs under the scheme, given their importance to the economy of local communities.

A Planning Commission report had noted that MFP contributes to 20 to 40 per cent of the income of forest-dependent communities, especially the landless with a dominant population of tribals, and ""provides critical subsistence during lean seasons.""

In theory, an MSP is the minimum price set by the Government at which farmers can expect to sell their produce for the season. When market prices fall below the announced MSPs, procurement agencies step in to procure the crop and 'support' the prices.

The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs announces MSP for various crops at the beginning of each sowing season based on the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The CACP takes into account demand and supply, the cost of production and price trends in the market among other things when fixing MSPs.

Price volatility makes life difficult for farmers. Though prices of agri commodities may soar while in short supply, during years of bumper production, prices of the very same commodities plummet. MSPs ensure that farmers get a minimum price for their produce in adverse markets. MSPs have also been used as a tool by the Government to incentivise farmers to grow crops that are in short supply.

Mains Question: Will a rise in the minimum support price (MSP) solve the problem of farm distress? Critically examine.

For Prelims and Mains: Features, objectives and significance of the mission.

Context: Chinese probe, the Chang'e-4, has entered a planned orbit ""to prepare for the first-ever soft landing on the far side of the moon"". China launched the Chang'e-4 probe earlier this month, carried by a Long March-3B rocket.

The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, rotating at the same rate that it orbits our planet, so the far side is never visible from Earth. The probe, the Chang'e-4, is expected to make the first-ever soft landing on the far side of the Moon. Previous spacecraft have seen the far side of the Moon, but none has landed on it.

The far side of the moon known as 'South Pole-Aitken Basin' still remains a mystery among space scientists and by sending a probe there, China will outdo the historical achievements of the US and USSR.

According to experts, landing on the far side of the moon is undoubtedly one of the most challenging missions ever launched by any of the world's superpowers.

History of China's lunar exploration programmes:

China began their lunar exploration program in 2007 by launching a simple lunar orbiter named 'Chang'e 1'. The second mission in the program named 'Chang'e 2' was launched in 2010, and it was later followed by the third mission 'Chang'e 3'. 'Chang'e 3' made headlines all around the world as it marked the first soft moon landing since 1976.

Context: A new study by Delhi-based non-profit Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has revealed that Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), the programme initiated by the United Nations in 2005 to mitigate climate change through enhanced forest management in developing countries, has largely failed to achieve its objectives.

Since its formalisation in 2006, REDD+ had emerged as the most prominent global mechanism to integrate the role of forests in climate change. It was touted as a win-win situation for biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and local livelihoods.

In simple terms, REDD+ means ""Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation"", conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inaugurate 106 Indian Science Congress (ISC)-2019 on 3 January in Jalandhar, Punjab.

""Government's aim is to deliver the benefits of Science & Technology to the last man in the society and scientists being a pivot should put their heart and soul into finding new solutions to the problems facing the nation and improve the quality of life of common man"".

It is the only second time for a University of Punjab to organize their herculean science spectacle.

The Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA) owes its origin to the foresight and initiative of two British Chemists, namely, Professor J.L. Simonsen and Professor P.S. MacMohan.

The first meeting of the Congress was held from January 15-17, 1914 at the premises of the Asiatic Society, Calcutta.

The proposed Adhyatmik Vibhag (Spiritual Department) going to be formed by merging Dharmik Nyas Evam Dharmasv Department (Religious Trust and Endowment Department), Anand Vibhag (Happiness Department) in addition to the Directorate of Religious Trust and Endowment, Madhya Pradesh Teerth Evam Mela Pradhikaran and Rajya Anand Sansthan.

3 Andaman & Nicobar islands renamed as tribute to Netaji:

Context: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on December30, announced renaming of three islands of Andaman and Nicobar archipelago as a tribute to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

Significance of December 30: On this day in 1943, Bose had suggested that Andaman and Nicobar Islands be renamed as Shahid and Swaraj Dweep respectively. During the World War II, the Japanese had captured the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Netaji came here as the Azad Hind Fauz led by him was an ally of the Japanese force. This year marks 75 years of the event."

The horror of NEET continues

National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) has continued to haunt medical aspirants of Tamil Nadu, particularly those from government schools. Only eight government school students managed to secure a medial seat after clearing NEET this year, according to official data. Despite setting up 412 special training centres, ineffective operation have let down the students. KA Sengotttaiyan, state school education minister, admitted that Rs 20 crore amount sanctioned remained unused and promised better performance in the coming years.

Also, many students were given centres in other states like Rajasthan since there were not enough centres set up here. Strict checking which also led to stripping in few cases took toll on mental health of few examinees. Of the 1.2 lakh candidates, around 60 per cent were unable to clear the entrance, according to official data. However, around 1,300 government school students who cleared the test were unable to obtain the necessary cutoff. With government showing no intent in clearing the bill which seeks a permanent exemption of NEET, private coaching centres have started to mushroom, collecting fees Rs 20,000-Rs 2,00,000 for a year. Some are also travelling to other states for coaching.

Revised syllabus cheers up students

After a gap of nearly 12 years, Tamil Nadu government revised school curriculum. The new textbooks, written based on the revised syllabus for state board students, have received a positive response from almost all the stakeholders. Besides enriching the content, value additions like Quick Response (QR) codes for reading reference materials, Information & Communication Technology (ICT) corners and career guidance sections have made the new textbooks better than the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), said an official from the school education department.

""The book is filled with worked-out examples, colourful illustrations and quick pointers which will help the students understand the concepts better and perform well in not only board exams but also competitive exams like NEET and IIT-JEE,"" he said.

Only one bus for Chennaiites

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy launched a total of 986 government buses this year -- 515 in July and 471 in October. However, despite the Corporation's proposal to replace 245 buses on an urgent basis, the city got just one new bus. According to official records, nearly 250 old MTC buses were declared unfit for operation. Also, more than 70 per cent of the 3,300 buses are being operated beyond the permissible six lakh kilometres.

M Chandran, vice president, Centre of Indian Trade Union (CITU) said a bus must ideally run for seven years. But, MTC buses have been running for more than 15 years. While the year started with the government announcing a steep hike in government and private bus fares ranging from 20 per cent to 55 per cent in January, the failure to replace rickety buses has proved in further losses to MTC, with a major chunk of commuters shifting to suburban trains for travel. When contacted, an official from MTC said that at least 50 new buses will be allocated to Chennai next year.

Now, pay your fine online

In a bid to eliminate cash transaction and ensure transparency, the city police in May this year launched a cashless fine payment system for traffic violators. Police reviewed that it is a major hit. ""From May 10 to December 27, a total of 13,92,442 cases have been registered and fine worth Rs15,44,69,930 has been collected,"" said a senior official from the traffic department. As per the new system, besides swiping cards at point of sale machines already available with traffic police, those served with e-challans can make payments online.

The fine can also be paid through Paytm using QR Code. The fine can also be paid in cash at post offices, relevant courts and state-run e-sewa centres The official further added that when offenders pay digitally, they get an acknowledgement text from the city police. ""Also, from next month, we will announce an updated portal after tying up with the National Informatics Centre (NIC). This will help us know their previous details and nab repeated offenders,"" he said.

Metro yet to become the first choice

Two underground metro rail stretches, Nehru Park to Central and Saidapet to AGDMS were inaugurated after nearly six years of construction in May, this year. The ridership of Chennai Metro currently stands close to 60,000 against the estimated five lakh. Though the inauguration of the two stretches increased the patronage from 30,000 to 60,000, it still has to go a long way. It may be noted that in December last year, Chennai Metro came under fire from the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for several discrepancies in the Detailed Project Report (DPR), it prepared for the phase- II project. Even this year, Union Urban Development Ministry had reasons to doubt the feasibility of the 107 km second phase for which the agency had sent a detailed report to avail funds. An official of CMRL said the ridership will increase once Metro is connected from AG-DMS to Washermanpet via Central.

Chennai is becoming smart

While the Smart City project implemented by the Greater Chennai Corporation made little headway in 2017, an official said as many as seven projects were completed this year and several others have begun. ""The completed projects include exclusive bicycle lane, installation of storm water drains in T Nagar, development of Namma Chennai app for GCC, establishment of 28 smart classrooms in corporation schools, park renovation, establishment of sensory park and conversion of sodium lamps into LED lamps in almost all the areas,"" said an official. While projects worth Rs 26 crore are being implemented on the ground, projects worth Rs 336 crore are in various stages of implementation. Also, work to augment the water supply to city residents and increase the volume of supply, as part of the Smart City Mission, would be underway by March next year."

Rangappa - Star of Mysore","starofmysore.com",FALSE,"SOM: You are the first scientist from Mysuru, who is chosen as the General President-Elect of 106th Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA) to be held at Lovely Professional University in Jalandhar and you will take over as the General President of 107th ISCA during the Science Congress in January 2019. How does this responsibility feel?

Prof. K.S. Rangappa: I am proud to be elected General President of ISCA as the first Mysurean, especially coming from a city where the Maharajas ruled and the first University in the Princely State was set up by Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar in the entire country. And to be heading the Indian Science Congress, I am really humbled.

Scientifically it is a major responsibility. I have to get the topmost academicians and researchers in the forum which means those who are top scientists in the world in different disciplines and to get all of them is a major task. Nearly, 15,000 to 20,000 participants are expected and we have to tell all of them the kind of practice the scientific community is involved in. After all, Science Congress is a collection of scientists, where students, researchers, faculties irrespective of government or private organisations, including Nobel Laureates who will all definitely deliver the goods.

SOM: Some of the finest intellects and greatest scientists right from the first ISCA held in Calcutta in 1914 when Ashutosh Mukherjee was the General President, to the likes of J.C. Bose, C.V. Raman, Jawaharlal Nehru, C.N.R. Rao have held this prestigious post. You are joining their ilk. Do you feel that you have risen to such a level as a scientist to hold this post?

Prof. Rangappa: (With a wry smile) Otherwise they would not have elected me for the post. You know I will show you the emails sent by M.S. Swaminathan, Ashish Datta, Govardhan Mehta and many others of that calibre who by looking at my credentials and records said I must deserve this position. I am holding ten patents and published more than 500 scientific papers being in this University and more than 300 to 400 collaborators have worked with me in ten different countries and all these are facts. I have also published papers in the top journals in the world.

SOM: It is said that it is mostly scientists from East and North who are given the honour of the General President. How did you manage to break the mould?

Prof. Rangappa: I was given R.C. Shaw Memorial Award when I was a Reader in 1992. I did not know Indian Science Congress then and based on my publication they had given me the award in Chennai. Since then I am the permanent member of ISCA and have always involved in all its activities.

SOM: As the General President-Elect have you already made plans for your term to see what direction the Science in India takes? For instance the theme for 106th Congress is 'Future India - Science and Technology.' Have you already thought of a theme?

Prof. Rangappa: I am the General President-Elect now, I will be the General President in 2020 and the Past General President for another year. Hence, for three years I have a very active role to play. I have not thought of the theme as yet but there are several possibilities. It should be unique where the whole world works for Science keeping the present scenario of Science in mind; I am evolving my own theme. See the context 100 years back, 75 years or 50 years back was totally different. But now there is an entirely different scenario with competitive countries like China, Korea, Japan and Europe who have world class scientists. Also I am thinking of involving SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) countries' scientists. Still I have time and am working in that direction.

SOM: Where is the 107th ISCA going to be held in 2020 when you are the General President?

Prof. Rangappa: I have five invitations already on hand. One is University of Patna, Bihar; Agriculture University of Telangana; GKVK in Bengaluru as also Jain University and Dayanand Sagar Institutions. I consulted the Chief Minister of Karnataka H.D. Kumaraswamy and he is extremely happy to hold the 107th Indian Science Congress in Bengaluru.

SOM: You have claimed that your team of scientists as also your counterparts in China has come up with a wonder drug to treat all types of cancer. Is this true?

Prof. Rangappa: It is, otherwise this scientific paper would not have been published in the world's prestigious journal like PNAS (Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences) and that is where Nobel Laureates get published. Only 100 per cent true and new discoveries are published here. Luckily or unluckily I do not know, one of the molecules N-cyclopentyl-3-((4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl) piperazin-1-yl) (2-hydroxyphenyl)methyl) benzamide (NPB) synthesised in my laboratory turned out to be the best.

Let me put it this way, we will go to ten doctors and out of them one gave a medicine from which we recovered while nine others' failed. That is how it happened. In 40 years of my research, synthesising more than 6,000 molecules, this was one of the molecules that turned to be the best. Therefore, we have proved this efficacy in the animal examinations. Next step is the clinical trials.

For clinical trials China has come forward because one of the Chinese who worked in Singapore was my collaborator. They immediately jumped and offered a solution that they are going to invest money on the clinical trials of my molecules. Out of my ten patents, three are involved in the clinical trials. This group of my students and myself and the other counterpart from National Institute of Singapore designed the experiment and luckily the drug candidate worked very well.

SOM: This doubt arises because in spite of so much of research going on in the best laboratories in the world , how can a small team of scientists in University of Mysore achieve this breakthrough?

Prof. Rangappa: If you look at the history of Nobel Laureates, many of them were dirt poor or working in remote places, this is nothing. Archimedes' principle was so emergent that by him just getting into the bathtub it emerged. Nobody bothered about his laboratory and other things those days. So to invent something it need not be in the sky, anywhere it can happen. Today, we do not know where the talent lies. If today the molecule is proved, I do not need any certificate from any high quality laboratory as my result and my investigations are the same. Chemistry or Science is same whether you are rich or poor or anything else.

SOM: In nearly 35 years as a scientist doing research in Chemistry you have 10 patents to your credit. How many of those are utility patents? Has it ever resulted in any new drug production?

Prof. Rangappa: We have ten and we have applied for the 11th one now. None of them have yet resulted in drug production. Not yet. This is the first. I told you China is interested. See, it is very difficult as the whole world is working on these things. Not even one drug has come out to attack all types of cancer.

As far as patents are concerned we had applied for it. I discovered a molecule that worked on the animal and it has proved excellent. You cannot steal my molecule and do something else. For example, if I publish about this molecule you can simply grab it and put to clinical trial straight away. Now you cannot do it because it is my property and I have patented it. Just to protect my property we make patents.

SOM: That means all these ten patents are related to cancer?

Prof. Rangappa: Yes, all are related to cancer only. But they are different, different molecules like for cervical cancer, breast cancer and brain tumour. Only the latest one is unique while all others are for specific cancer which we have targeted. The tenth one is the unique one which is giving response. For instance, in Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research they are working on a molecule which works only for cervical cancer, whereas this molecule which has recently come out kills all types of cancers. The two unique properties of this molecule are that it responds to all types of cancers but does not touch the normal cells. Because of this uniqueness only it was published in the leading journal.

SOM: You lost the 2018 Assembly elections. Do you regret that as a former Vice-Chancellor you fought this battle and it would have been better if you had stayed away from politics?

Prof. Rangappa: Not really, because I wanted to have experience in this field also and that was my intention. After retirement, I thought I could do better things and politics is also one of the options where I could contribute, but it did not happen probably because of the kind of politics that is going on in the country.

I have no regret but do feel bad. Only after entering electoral politics I realised what kind of people are there where we could do good work or not. And I was able to gain this kind of experience at close quarters. I realised it is very difficult to change the mindset of the people. But had I been elected I would have contributed in the field of education or IT, BT, Science and Technology.

SOM: In spite of your defeat, a few people still say you are the backroom man running the Higher Education Department.

Prof. Rangappa: Not really or necessarily. Whenever Higher Education Minister G.T. Devegowda asks me, I give good suggestions that is why people say that. Even Chief Minister Kumaraswamy knows my depth in higher education. Hence, he wanted me to be there. But unfortunately or fortunately people did not elect me. Therefore, I have kept aloof, because people will start questioning me as to why this fellow pokes his nose. I don't want to give room for such talks."

In a video that went viral, Yadav was seen encouraging students not to hesitate to murder anyone they have an argument with.

""If you are a student of Purvanchal University, never come to me crying. If you get into a fight with someone, beat him, even kill him if you can, and then come, we will handle the matter,"" Yadav was heard saying at a college event on Friday.

The incident comes at a time when the state is reeling from the murders of two cops, who were killed by violent mobs in separate incidents.

The V-C has since claimed that the media had distorted his remarks and that his full statement should be heard to ascertain his intentions.

""My statement was intended at motivating students and boosting their confidence. Fighting for one's right, if he is correct, is not wrong. He should not pull back. I will keep filling fresh zeal in the students to make them brave in order that they can deal with the odds and work hard for achieving their goals,"" Yadav told Hindustan Times.

Born in Uttar Pradesh's Mahoba district in 1957, Yadav was in Allahabad University's physics department before he was appointed V-C of Purvanchal University by UP Governor Ram Naik in 2017, almost within a month of the BJP's rise to power in the state.

The V-C's social media posts say he is an RSS pracharak and has close ties with senior BJP leaders.

Slamming Yadav for ""inciting violence"", Samajwadi Party spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi said, ""The vice-chancellor must be booked for inciting and provoking students to indulge in criminal activities. He is not behaving like a vice-chancellor but as the warlord of a criminal gang. We cannot expect academic excellence from such criminal-minded people.

Congress spokesperson Anshu Awasthi, too, demanded that Yadav be removed from his post immediately, ""If a V-C level person will say such things, what will the students do? I think he should be sacked immediately. Already, the law and order situation is at an all-time low in the state. Action should be taken against him.""

Taking cognizance of the inflammatory statement made by the V-C, the Uttar Pradesh government has asked him to present his side of the story.

Telgi died at a hospital in Bengaluru on October 23, 2017. He was suffering from brain fever.

It is alleged that between 1993 and 2002, he cultivated officers in the government security press in Nashik and purchased machinery at government auctions to print counterfeit stamp papers.

Telgi was arrested several years back in connection with the multi-crore fake stamp paper racket. He was convicted in several cases of counterfeiting.

Telgi's mother was Shariefabee Ladsaab Telgi, and his father was an employee of Indian Railways. His father died while he was young. Telgi paid for his own education at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya Khanapur, an English medium school, by selling fruit and vegetables on trains. Eventually, he moved to Saudi Arabia. Seven years later, he returned to India, at which time he allegedly began a career in counterfeiting, originally focusing on fake passports.

Telgi was alleged to have moved to more complex counterfeiting when he began to counterfeit stamp paper. He appointed 350 people as agents who sold the fakes to bulk purchasers, including banks, insurance companies, and stock brokerage firms. The size of the alleged scam was estimated to be more than Rs 200 billion (US$3.1 billion). One aspect of the scandal that caused much concern was that it required the involvement of many police officers and other government employees.

On 17 January 2006, Telgi and several associates were sentenced to 30 years rigorous imprisonment. On 28 June 2007, Telgi was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 13 years for another aspect of the scandal. He was also fined Rs 10 billion (US$160 million). The Income Tax Department requested that Telgi's property is confiscated to pay the fine. He had been in jail for 13 years. Mudrank (The Stamp) was a film based on the stamp scandal. It was finished in 2008, but Telgi filed legal challenges to prevent its release. Telgi alleged that the details covered in the film would damage his legal appeals."

New Delhi: Caught on camera purportedly exhorting students to commit murder, Raja Ram Yadav, the vice-chancellor of a state university in Uttar Pradesh, is a geophysicist who has spent nearly four decades in academia.

Yadav, 61, an MSc topper from Allahabad University, was appointed the vice-chancellor of Veer Bahadur Singh Purvanchal University in Jaunpur last year. He came under scrutiny over the weekend after he allegedly made deeply controversial remarks in his address to students at an affiliated college in Ghazipur.

A video from the event, held Saturday, shows Yadav purportedly saying that students should not come crying to him if they get into a fight, and should instead beat up the other person, or murder them if possible. ""We'll take care of it later,"" he added.

Delivered in Hindi, his exact quote runs thus: ""Agar aap Purvanchal University ke chhatra ho to rote huye me... mere paas kabhi mat aanaa. Ek baat bata detaa hoon... Agar kisi se jhagda ho jaaye to uski pitaai karke aana, aur tumhara bas chale to uska murder karke aana, uske baad hum dekh lenge.""

With the video triggering calls for the vice-chancellor's removal, the Uttar Pradesh government has asked Yadav to explain his remarks.

According to a report in Hindustan Times, Yadav blamed the media for ""distorting"" his statement in a clarification issued in the wake of the controversy.

""My statement was intended at motivating students and boosting their confidence. I also tried to inculcate zeal and encouraged them towards their goals. Fighting for one's right, if he is correct, is not wrong. He should not pull back,"" the report quoted him as saying.

Yadav's stint with Veer Bahadur Singh Purvanchal University follows a long and distinguished career in education.

An alumnus of Allahabad University, the Bundelkhand native was named the topper when he completed his MSc in physics in 1979. He went on to secure a junior research fellowship, and pursued his PhD at the university while serving a five-year stint with Oil & Natural Gas Commission as a geophysicist between 1983 and 1988.

Yadav has spent most of his career teaching at Allahabad University, where he started as a junior research fellow and eventually became a professor.

In 2010, he was awarded the UP government's Prayag Gaurav Samman for his contribution to the field of education. He is the author of 117 published research papers -- two of them won the ""Best Research Paper award"" given out by the Acoustical Society of America, a US-based society for studies in the subject, in 2004 and 2010.

He has been a visiting fellow at the Roorkee and Kharagpur branches of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), and engaged in several projects sponsored by the Centre's Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the University Grants Commission (UGC).

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, In spite of many schemes including 'School Chalen Hum', running in the state, the number of children in government schools is declining year after year. This has been revealed in the report submitted by the school education department in the last assembly session.

In the last three years six lakh children have left the government schools. Chhindwara district tops in the number of dropouts, whereas Satna and Rewa are second and Shivpuri is in third place.

Children enrolled in government schools through school education department are counted through mid-day meal and free textbook distribution. The number of children in the year 2015-16 is 76,23,522, which fell to only 70,20,008 in the year 2017-18.

All the schemes are aimed at luring the children to the government school. Funds of crores are given under 'School Chale Hum' campaign by the Central Government. The entire budget is also being spent every year, but still the number of children is falling in schools.

Either this budget is being spent on paper, or the schemes are not proving to be effective in attracting children. In order to increase enrollment of children in government schools, the government is running schemes like free textbooks, uniforms and bicycles distribution.

Three women scientists of Indian- origin -- Onisha Patel, Devika Kamath and Asha Rao, have made it in the list of 60 Superstars of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), announced recently by the Australian government, reports The Indian Express.

The Australian government is reportedly planning to train them for over a year to become influencers for female students to address the gender gap in STEM.

""The Australian Department of Science and Technology aims to make sure that deserving female scientists get proper visibility so that they can be a role model for girls who wish to take up STEM."" Dion Pretorius, Communications and Policy Manager at Science & Technology Australia was quoted saying by IE.

Devika Kamath enquires about the origin of the cosmos matter with which stars are made of. About India, she said, ""When it comes to research, many Indian students face a lack of guidance. After this fellowship, I want to set-up a guidance initiative wherein I can help Indian students achieve what they want to in academics,""

When volunteers visited the wedding hall with social welfare officials, the mehendi ceremony was on.

The volunteers reasoned with the parents to call off the wedding. Then officials stepped in with a warning of the legal implications. The incident happened in Podanur, a favourite locale of the British and now a buzzing residential area in the city.

This was not a one-off incident of child marriage in an urban area. In November, Childline, the NGO that operates a 24x7 helpline for children, in Coimbatore stopped nine child marriage and half of them were in city limits.

There is a perception that child marriages are something that happen in the rural hinterland. But every third child marriage in Tamil Nadu is in an urban centre. A report by National Commission for Protection of Child Rights released in September says that 36.5% of child marriages are from urban areas of the state. TN ranks fourth among states with high urban child marriage rates. Goa tops the list with 77% of child marriages in the state happening in urban areas followed by Mizoram and Haryana.

""We have stopped a lot of child marriages within the city from places including Ramanathapuram, Irugur, Ondipudur and Athupalam,'' says S Umadevi, Coimbatore district coordinator of Childline.

Child rights activists say this trend started about 10 years ago, partly because of the influx of rural folk, who brought with them age-old customs. But even among urban populations this trend is picking up. While deep-rooted socio-cultural practices, matriarchal prejudices and economic factors drive parents in rural areas to marry off their daughters before the legal age, what prompts urban parents to marry off their minor children? Economic factors are key to urban child marriages. But equally, urban parents marry off their daughters early fearing they will fall in love with boys from different castes or that they will face sexual harassment, say activists who have counselled families.

Parents of Malathi (name changed) from Radha Nagar in Tirupur said they decided to marry off their daughter when she was studying in Class XI after they saw her speaking to a boy in 2015. ""We felt she would elope,"" said her father. But social welfare department officials intervened and stopped the marriage. After counselling, Malathi promised to pursue higher education. Now she is in the second year of her BCom course. ""In Chennai, we found most of the child marriages happen in the slums,'' says Girija Kumarababu, honorary general secretary of Indian Council for Child Welfare, Tamil Nadu.

""More than 90% of parents of child brides in Chennai say there is no protection for their daughters. When both parents are working, there is no supervision of children in slums where the tenements are so close to each other,'' she said. ICCW analysed 1,156 child marriages stopped in Chennai and found that poor economic conditions of the girl's family, concern for her safety and feat that she would have an affair were cited as reasons. There were instances of marriages planned with the consent of the minor, but in a large number of cases the child's consent was not obtained. ""Child marriage takes an emotional toll on the girl. Early pregnancy and child birth also have adverse effects on the health of mother and child,'' says a social welfare department officer.

In Tamil Nadu, a significant number of child marriages are reported in southern and western districts in rural and tribal areas. In villages, marrying within blood relatives is still prevalent, where a girl will be wedded to her maternal uncle. Caste and social status as well as bids to retain property within the family are reasons why parents force early marriages. But over the past decade, rural child marriages are coming down while the graph is rising in urban areas.

""Some 60% to 70 % of child marriages in urban areas are because of safety concerns. Parents feel protection mechanism is inadequate,'' said Andrew Sesuraj, state convener of Tamil Nadu Child Rights Observatory. Activists say a multi-pronged approach should be adopted to curb child marriage. A close watch and timely action is imperative, but long term action such as building awareness on the health implications of early marriage, which results in immediate pregnancy and financial burden, should be carried out, say activists."

Amongst all the higher education choices, a MBA program is top of your list for your future career goals. You are in search for a MBA program that launches you in the corporate world or upgrades your skill set for the next better job. So what are your expectations from the MBA program? Naturally you might be considering many factors to evaluate the right program for you. And they could be an appropriate mix of a few objective touchstones, and a few very subjective ones based on your individual choices. So here are some of the factors that you may consider to add to your list of evaluation criteria of choice.

So two main things you need to consider, first what do you want to do for the next two years, and secondly, what you want to do after these two years? These are important questions you need to ask yourself as they will help you decide the MBA program that gets aligned to your career goals. Not all MBA programs will be good at everything, for example, some produce good Marketing professionals and other good Human Resource professionals.

The batch strength of an MBA program matters a lot: it impacts your program experience, your networkingopportunities, your leadership opportunities, your faculty and other departmental connects and probability of getting a good job as the competition becomes tough. Though larger batch sizes attract more companies but smaller batch strengths offer a more personalized, individualized experience. An ideal batch strength should be around 120 like in case of our university.

Well, the academics matter no matter what. So it is essential for you to evaluate the MBA curriculum and its progression. An MBA program is completely different from your graduate programs. It is important that the curriculum matches with your career goals. You need to check that the curriculum is developed in collaboration with the industry. Some pointers here could be checking out the industry experts interaction with students, live and industry projects, sessions taken by industry experts or faculty's industry experience, student - faculty ratio - a 10:1 is ideal, and new electives introduced keeping the industry trends in consideration.

Most of the MBA programs provide placement assistance which can be student - faculty driven or centralized. So anMBA degree is not only about the academics! A good institute or University develops their students professionally and personally, so you need to find out that beside getting many companies to campus, how well the career support department helps you develop certain skill sets and prepare you to crack the best of the interviews on campus. Read employment reports, research employers, determine which programs offer the career support that matches your career goals. For example at Manav Rachna we have ""Corporate Resource Centre (CRC)"" which engages with the industry and constantly strives for expanding the industry-academia interface. Along with CRC is Career Development Centre (CDC)

which provides extensive process oriented and activity driven training on Personality Development, Business English, Business Communication and Aptitude Development.

Though Ranking matters, but I think it still cannot be the only criterion for selecting an MBA program. Anyways, rankings are based on many criteria like admissions, student diversity, infrastructure, placements, academics and research to name a few. Rankings use data provided by B-Schools and can provide prospective students and their families with useful information. But you should understand the methodology behind determining rankings and whether a particular B-school is rated high on the criterion most important to you. For example, does the B-school get a high rating on placement or research or infrastructure? Rankings can be one tool that students use early in the search process, but personal visits and interactions are the best way to find the ""perfect match.""

Job placement for many is a very important parameter for selecting a business school. Students join an MBA program for increasing their employability opportunity or upgrading their role and salary packages. Understanding this scenario,the business schools across India put a lot of emphasis in attracting good companies to campus. The following things need to be considered regarding the job placements in a B-School; first of all, the industry-wise bifurcation of companies visiting campus, number of student placed industry-wise, highest-average-lowest package industry-wise et al. Beside the salary, you should also understand the placement process of a B-school. The process may include: timing & period of placement, is the placement student led, faculty led or management led, criteria for Day I...Day II companies, how many interviews can you appear in, mandatory or choice based opting of interviews, placement offer conditions etc.

It's not all about academics, the B-School infrastructure also matters for an overall development of the student. You should check for the followings: number of classrooms, multimedia teaching aids, how well the library is equipped w.r.t. Journals, magazines and books, sports facility, auditoriums, canteens/mess, playgrounds, computer lab -student ratio, Wi-Fi, Learning Management System (LMS), Virtual class rooms, online library, hostel facility and medical facility.

In conclusion, your choice of the best MBA program emanate from a careful scrutiny of the targeted destination on all the above-said parameters. Do not let ""halo"" effect of any one aspect dominate your thinking - for instance, mere ranking may not be a suitable appraisal. Look at your needs. Maybe you are an introvert, and need a campus that opens up your personality. Maybe your quantitative skills are not strong, and you would gain if basics are taught very well. Or maybe your quantitative skills are exceptional, and you are yearning for advanced market research live projects."

The RSBY was launched by the Manmohan Singh government in 2008.

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on health and family welfare stated this in its 112th report on the action taken by the government on the recommendations/observations contained in the 106th report on Demands for Grants 2018-19 of the Department of Health.

It said the National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS), also known as the Ayushman Bharat scheme, was announced in the 2018-19 budget and it was the world's largest government-funded healthcare programme with 50 crore prospective beneficiaries.

""The new scheme is just a modification of the earlier scheme, RSBY. Over half the target beneficiaries proposed to be covered under the NHPS already stand covered today by existing government-supported schemes,"" the Parliamentary Standing Committee on health and family welfare said.

""What would indeed have been a step forward is if it covered out-patient treatment as well, but that is lacking. Many states have, in fact, opted out of the RSBY in favour of the state-run schemes and some states are trying out the trust-based model,"" the Parliamentary panel added.

The Parliamentary committee said a recent comprehensive review on various studies related to the RSBY revealed that in the majority of studies there was an increase in out-of-pocket expenditure related to the scheme, while only two of 14 studies showed a reduction in expenditure.

The NSS data on the RSBY showed that enrolment was quite low: only 57 per cent of those eligible were enrolled and less than 12 per cent of the eligible people got their hospitalisation covered through the programme, it said.

The committee, thus, recommended that the government form a panel to analyse the failures of the RSBY and ensure that inadequacies plaguing its operation and implementation were not repeated.

It also recommended that the NHPS must have first claim on the proceeds collected from health and education cess, and fund constraint should not be allowed to come in the way of its implementation.

The committee observed that the impressive economic progress made during the last two decades had not resulted in commensurate investment in the health sector, as a result of which India continued to lag behind many developing countries on health indicators on the global comparison matrix.

The lack of financial commitment for translating healthcare goals into action was evident from the fact that though the government expenditure in the health sector had marginally increased as a per cent of the GDP over the years, it has stagnated at around 1.2 per cent of GDP, it said.

The panel said the current pace of the year-on-year budgetary allocation for health was unlikely to reach the targeted level of 2.5 per cent of the GDP by 2025.

""Due to the low government expenditure on health, most spending on healthcare is paid out of pocket. Due to which out-of-pocket expenditures have emerged as a major cause of poverty for low- and middle-income families,"" it said.

Recognising this, the committee, while making its recommendation in the report, highlighted that the allocated funds would not only fall short of meeting the current requirements for certain proposed/ongoing health schemes, but also impinge upon achieving the target of 2.5 per cent of the GDP as public health expenditure by 2025."

Congress member T. Subbarami Reddy has moved a statutory resolution in the Rajya Sabha against the Triple Talaq Bill brought by the government. Both the resolution and Triple Talaq Bill are expected to be taken up at 12 noon if the house functions smoothly.

Today, the government will also table three important reports of Railway Convention Committee. These are: (i) cleanliness and hygiene in coaches and stations, (ii) facilities given by Indian Railways to differently abled persons (Divyangjan), and (iii) human resource development and manpower planning in Indian Railways.

The government will also table the reports prepared by the department related parliamentary standing committees of ministry of rural development and ministry of human resource development.

Nature is everything for them. The tribals, who migrated to this place from the erstwhile south Bihar and now Jharkhand decades ago, care and worship the forests, hills and ever-flowing narrow streams descending from the hills.

These tribals love, protect and preserve the forest as they believe they can only survive in the lap of woods. However, they do not lead a normal life as they have been deprived of basic infrastructure like road, electricity, water, educational institutes, primary health centres and transportation facilities. In the 21st century, they still live like jungle men and women -- ignorant of another world that claims itself to be civilised and modern.

What has held back the development activities is inaccessibility. One has to trek miles to reach these villages. All efforts to build roads and electricity infrastructure have fallen flat due to lack of coordination between forest and revenue departments. The forest department, as for Forest Conservation Act, 1980, considers residents of these villages illegal occupants. This has stood in the way of the villages getting the ""revenue village"" tag.

Non-recognition of the human habitations as revenue villages prevents the education department to build schools and the health department to establish hospitals. There are about 10,000 people living in 61 villages of Simlipal forests.

""We have no primary and high schools here. The only Anganwadi centre has no government teacher. It is managed by Centre for Youth and Social Development, a development organisation. Since we have no hospital here, people are left to fend for themselves. Last year, we lost two children and a pregnant woman died this year as we could not take them to the hospital which is 12 km from here. We carry the patients on slings and cots and walk down to hospitals,"" said Sadhu Makhud of Jharjhari village under Thakurmunda block.

Early-age marriage is seen to be continuing in these villages. This has resulted in both mother and children suffering from malnourishment and other health complications.

Birasingha Ugrasandhi, a resident of Bhaliadal village, said despite repeated requests to the Mayurbhanj district administration, there are no activities related to infrastructure development.

""Besides roads, schools and hospitals, we also fight to get drinking water. Our village does not have tubewells or dug wells. The narrow streams flowing down from the nearby hills shrink in the summer and get contaminated because of overdependence on them by human beings, domestic animals and wildlife. Villagers often get sick after drinking contaminated water,"" says Birasingha.

Lack of education has forced the people to continue with their primitive living style - herding goats and collecting firewood to cook their food, besides undertaking poultry activities.

Agriculture has been confined to growing paddy and vegetables, which is at the mercy of rain god.

""Since we have no government mandi or procurement centre here, we are forced to sell our paddy between '1,100 and '1,200 per quintal as against '1,750 minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the Union government,"" says Jagabandhu Ho of Bhaliadal.

The villagers are yet to see a television set. For them, radio is the only source of information and entertainment.

Today, the villagers are living a little better life as Oxfam, an international development organisation, in association with Regional Center for Development Cooperation, a Bhubaneswar-based non-governmental organisation, is intervening in those villages. Erection of solar-lighting and solar-irrigation systems has brought about significant changes in their lives.

People are now able to charge their mobile phones with solar battery. They can now irrigate their land with solar water pumps.

With the help of development organisations, the area is coordinating with the district administration. As a result, some villagers have got Individual Forest Rights (IFR) and Community Forest Rights (CFR). This has enabled them to undertake cultivation. Grant of CFR has helped them procure forest produces without hassles, process them and sell them to various government and agencies, including state government's Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society (ORMAS). Such activities are slowly improving the local economy.

Dillip Subudhi, a leading researcher who spent over 17 years in villages situated in Similipal and forests in other parts of the state, feels there will be remarkable improvement in the life of forest dwellers once their habitations are recognised as revenue villages and they are given IFR and CFR over their claimed lands as per the Forest Rights Act, 2006.

""Though the Odisha government has a good track record in settling IFR and CFR claims, a lot of activities remain to be done. In villages, people have got IFR and CFR titles over their claimed lands. However, many of them still cannot make productive use of these lands as the lands granted to them are yet to be demarcated by revenue officials,"" says Mr Subudhi.

Speaking to this newspaper, state ST & SC development minister Ramesh Chandra Majhi said the government had asked the district administrations to complete the titles of the IFR and CFR claims by March 2019.

""We have asked the collectors of all tribal-dominated districts to settle the IFR and CFR claims by March 2019. Once this process is complete, you will see significant change in the life of forest dwellers,"" the minister said.

Of the 4.19 crore population of Odisha, nearly 23 per cent (22.85 per cent, according to 2011 census) is tribal.

In almost all the tribal-dominated districts, the conditions of those living in forests are almost identical, say social activists who have been working among the marginalised sections of society."

On Hold

What's brewing in the state's excise department? According to sources, a controversial move of revalidating 205 liquor permits, which were found to have been irregularly allotted between 2010 and 2016, has been put on hold. While Excise Minister Chandrasekhar Bawankule had conducted fresh hearings for these cases in October itself, senior department bureaucrats have raised questions over the validity of this review exercise.

Retirement Perk

Three months after his retirement, former medical education department secretary Sanjay Deshmukh, a 1998 batch IAS officer, has landed a post-retirement assignment.

It is that time of the year when promotions are handed out to police personnel. In the IPS cadre, sources said this time officers belonging to the 1994 batch are eligible for promotion to Additional Director General (ADG) rank. Mumbai's Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Deven Bharti is among those in line for promotion. Others include Ashutosh Dumbare, Dr Sukhwinder Singh, Anup Kumar, Vineet Agarwal and Ramanand Bharma. Meanwhile, IPS officers belonging to the 2001 batch are eligible for promotion to Inspector General of Police rank.

Politicians are not the only ones who are reluctant to give up perks of office, especially spacious government accommodations, long after they have demitted office. Tales abound in the corridors of power on how several retired bureaucrats, including some who haven't even been accommodated by the government in post-retirement positions, have clung onto official accommodations in violation of norms.

The bureaucrat was then recalled and had to sit for the meeting.

Here's what to expect in key areas that touch your life. Learning beyond the four walls

Out of class learning is expected to be a key part of the Delhi government's education push in the coming year.

In Delhi government schools, which largely cater to children from economically disadvantaged families, ensuring attendance and establishing a classroom connect with students has been a struggle.

The coming year will see the flagship 'Happiness Curriculum' project completing one year, and implementation of the new 'Entrepreneurship Curriculum' for students in classes IX to XII.

Through storytelling, 'mindfulness' classes and interactive activities, 'happiness classes' for students of nursery to Class VIII have tried to help students ""get in touch with their emotions"". The objective of the 'entrepreneurship classes', an official said, will be to develop an ""entrepreneurial mindset"" in older children to help them re-orient their goals -- from simply seeking jobs towards innovation.

Advertising

Shailendra Sharma, principal advisor to the Delhi government, said these curricular interventions are laying the ground for changing the education discourse in classrooms. ""The whole point of happiness classes is to reorient relationships between teachers, students and parents. Students are getting the opportunity to reflect on their thoughts and express themselves without fear of judgement, while teachers can experience their relationship with students beyond just teaching. This is setting the ground for the larger goal of education beyond knowledge transmission.""

On the 'entrepreneurship curriculum', he said, ""Hopefully, this will also help take the discourse to the next level, in terms of what students feel like they're ready for after stepping out of school and what roles they see for themselves in the public arena.""

Education, many believe, is also tied closely to AAP's political fortunes. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has often spoken about education reforms in Delhi during his rallies outside the state; AAP leader Atishi, best known for her work in the field of education, has been made a Lok Sabha candidate; and AAP has frequently harnessed the 'happiness curriculum' for international recognition -- most recently during an education conference in Austria in December.

Even though heads of schools have given positive feedback on happiness classes in review meetings -- such as a greater sense of belonging and an increase in attendance -- some have expressed concern that the flurry of new interventions take away time, effort and focus from the core need to deliver examination results.

This year, several schools delivered zero pass percentages in the internal examinations. The ability to match these interventions with results will be tested in 2019, particularly with children in board examination classes being brought under their ambit.

Move to check overpricing by hospitals

The Delhi government is set to roll out guidelines to regulate private hospitals and nursing homes. Once implemented, the policy is expected to be a landmark decision for Delhi residents who have often complained of overpricing by various private hospitals.

Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain told The Indian Express that the government will implement the guidelines by early 2019. The advisory was framed after the AAP government formed a nine-member committee, headed by the then Director-General of Health Services Kirti Bhushan, to monitor functioning of private hospitals.

The aim is to ensure rates of surgery packages are ""transparent, without hidden charges"", and hospitals disclose whether they cover any complications during the procedure.

The draft advisory states that private hospitals can charge patients for medicines at the MRP mentioned in the National List of Essential Medicines, 2015, as their prices have already been capped. The policy also prohibits private hospitals and nursing homes from refusing to hand over bodies over pending bills.

""The department is finalising work on the committee report and will release it soon. The guidelines will change the entire scenario of the medical profession,"" said a senior health department official.

In 2019, Delhi will also witness implementation of the Centre's ambitious Ayushman Bharat scheme, which has run into some turbulence in the capital over the name of the scheme. At the moment, both sides are in a deadlock.

It has so far been implemented in four government hospitals -- All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College -- as well as a few private hospitals. The National Health Agency has asked private hospitals in the capital to join the insurance scheme, and 2019 will tell how many follow through.

AAP and Cong: Will they, won't they?

Wild swings in vote shares of the three big political players, AAP, BJP and Congress, which have come to characterise the city's politics since 2014, will largely determine the churning that lies ahead.

For the ruling AAP, doing well in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls is imperative for its ambition to go national. It has received jolts in the recent past owing to successive drubbings in state assembly polls, as seen recently in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

The AAP's political fortunes appear to be tied closely with that of the Congress, with the two parties competing for acceptance among the same sections -- from residents of unauthorised colonies to Purvanchalis -- while the BJP continues to draw support from traders and the upper-middle class.

This is where coalition talks come in: Despite their apparent mutual dislike, there has been no outright rejection from the AAP and the Congress that they are in talks to arrive at an ""understanding"" so that the BJP does not romp home once again by taking advantage of the possible vote cutting.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has so far shied away from giving a straight answer -- whenever asked by reporters, he has maintained: ""We will let you know."" He also insists that the AAP will do ""all that is necessary"" to keep the BJP out of power.

Behind the ambiguous statements are hard facts: In 2015, the AAP won with a 54.3% vote share due to the massive dip in the Congress's vote share, which was down to 9.8%. However, in last year's municipal polls, Congress showed signs of revival as it increased its share to 21.09%, while AAP's came down to 26.23%.

On the other hand, the BJP's vote share has remained more or less constant -- 33.07% in the 2015 Assembly polls and 36.23% in the 2017 MCD polls. Only in 2014 had the BJP notched up an impressive share of 44.81%, on the back of a country-wide Modi wave that swept the party to power.

While back-channel talks may or may not yield results, the AAP has been critical of the Congress in public. At rally after rally, Kejriwal tried to drive home the point that voting for the Congress will end up strengthening the BJP. Addressing one such rally in August, he had said that the Delhi Congress has been reduced to a ""vote cutter for the AAP"".

Leaders in the AAP also point to the fact that Delhi will go to Assembly polls in less than a year after the Lok Sabha elections, and any coalition with the Congress in 2019 may end up harming AAP's prospects in 2020.

""What happens in the Lok Sabha elections will also have a bearing on the Assembly polls. Some leaders in AAP are looking at an alliance because arithmetic says both parties together will be able to keep the BJP out of power. But the implications have to be seen in context of the Assembly polls. Will AAP want to align with the very party whose vote bank shifted to it en masse in 2015?"" said a former party leader.

The Delhi Congress, still smarting from the 2015 drubbing, currently under the leadership of Ajay Maken, disapproves of all coalition talks. It has maintained that the AAP is a ""B-team"" of the BJP and that the Kejriwal-led party is ""desperate to stitch an alliance for its own survival"".

Eight years on, 1,500 buses may roll out

For a city that has been waiting for new buses to join its fleet since 2011, the coming year is going to be a crucial one. At least 500 standard-floor buses, with hydraulic lifts to make them accessible to the differently abled, have already got a go-ahead from courts.

Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said 1,000 electric buses will also join the close to 6,000 buses on Delhi roads by June. ""The Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System is preparing a feasibility report, after which tenders will be floated,"" he said.

If all goes according to plan, Delhi will become the first Indian city to have such a large electric bus fleet. This will also be key to Delhi's fight against pollution -- according to recent studies by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and TERI, vehicular pollution contributes to over 35% of particulate matter in the city.

With construction of Metro Phase IV getting the green signal, the other gap that remains is providing last-mile connectivity.

Recently, the Delhi Metro tied up with private app-based cab aggregators to fill this gap. However, in an ever-expanding city, buses and a regulated e-rickshaw service are being seen as the only way to make sure people are incentivised to leave their personal vehicles at home and switch to greener modes of travel.

1.4 lakh cameras on streets, 1 lakh in schools

Education and health will be the focus of the Public Works Department (PWD) in 2019. According to a senior PWD official, ""by the end of 2019, the aim is to construct 12,000 additional classrooms in Delhi government schools"".

The department will also begin work on the hotly debated plan to install CCTV cameras inside schools. ""Over 1 lakh cameras will be put inside 726 schools. The project cost has been estimated at Rs 600 crore so far,"" said Sanjeev Rastogi, PWD PRO.

Cameras are also supposed to be installed in public places, such as markets, across the capital. ""The plan is to install 1.4 lakh cameras across the city; the allocated budget is Rs 350 crore,"" Rastogi said.

Also on the agenda is remodelling seven of the 17 government hospitals, and converting 94 dispensaries into polyclinics.

On the traffic front, PWD aims to clear congestion at Shastri Park and Seelampur by building a flyover. ""It's a two-year project to help manage traffic from Shahdara to Kashmere Gate,"" said Rastogi.

Staring at a financial crisis of Rs 3,000 crore, the North and East civic bodies have not undertaken any big projects for 2019, and will instead focus on completing pending projects.

The North Corporation wants to finish multi-level parking projects at Rani Bagh, Shiva Market, Shastri Park, Idgah and Gandhi Maidan to create parking space for 5,000 vehicles.

The East MCD is focusing on Krishna Nagar, Preet Vihar, Geeta Colony, Babarpur and Anand Nagri; and the South MCD on New Friends Colony, Rajouri Garden, Defence Colony and Hauz Khas.

POSHAN Abhiyaan - The PM's Overarching Scheme for Holisitic Nourishment (National Nutrition Mission). It was launched on March 8, 2018.

Objective: The programme through the targets will strive to reduce the level of stunting, under-nutrition, anemia and low birth weight babies. It will create synergy, ensure better monitoring, issue alerts for timely action, and encourage States/UTs to perform, guide and supervise the line Ministries and States/UTs to achieve the targeted goals.

The Goals of POSHAN Abhiyaan (NNM) are to achieve improvement in nutritional status of Children from 0-6 years, Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers in a time bound manner during the next three years beginning 2017-18.

*To create awareness relating to malnutrition amongst pregnant women, lactating mothers, promote healthy lactating practices and importance of balanced nutrition;

*To improve maternal and child under-nutrition in 200 high burdened districts and to prevent and reduce the under-nutrition prevalent among children below 3 years;

*To reduce incidence of anaemia among young children, adolescent girls and women.

*NNM targets to reduce stunting, under-nutrition, anemia (among young children, women and adolescent girls) and reduce low birth weight by 2%, 2%, 3% and 2% per annum respectively.

*Mission would strive to achieve reduction in Stunting from 38.4% (NFHS-4) to 25% by 2022 (Mission 25 by 2022).

*It also aims to bring down anaemia among young children, women and adolescent girls by three per cent per year.

*Under NNM, the ministries of women and child development, health and family welfare, and water and sanitation will work together.

*The mission will form an apex body that would fix targets and monitor, supervise and guide nutrition-related interventions across the ministries.

*The mission would include several components like an ICT (information and communications technology)-based real-time monitoring system, incentivizing of states and Union territories to meet their targets, social audits, and setting up of nutrition resource centres.

*Anganwadi workers will also be offered incentives for using IT-based tools such as smart phones.

*Aadhaar card is a mandatory requirement to avail the benefits of the mission,

NNM targets to reduce stunting, under-nutrition, anemia (among young children, women and adolescent girls) and reduce low birth weight by 2%, 2%, 3% and 2% per annum respectively. Although the target to reduce Stunting is at least 2% p.a., Mission would strive to achieve reduction in Stunting from 38.4% (NFHS-4) to 25% by 2022 (Mission 25 by 2022). More than 10 crore people will be benefitted by this programme. All the States and districts will be covered in a phased manner i.e. 315 districts in 2017-18, 235 districts in 2018-19 and remaining districts in 2019-20.

In NFHS(4), 35.7% children under 5 years of age are underweight and 38.4% are stunted indicating a reduction from the previous NFHS - 3 which reported 42.5% children under 5 years of age as underweight and 48% stunted. Further, 22.9% women (15-49 years of age) have chronic energy deficiency (BMI less than 18.5) which is a decline from the previous NFHS-3 levels which reported 35.5% women having chronic energy deficiency

The fifth such report, compiled by GNR's Independent Expert Group comprising academics, researchers and government representatives, was released at the 'Accelerating the End of Hunger and Malnutrition' conference in Bangkok, Thailand on November 29, 2018. The conference was jointly organised by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.

The Global Nutrition Report was conceived following the first Nutrition for Growth Initiative Summit (N4G) in 2013 as a mechanism for tracking the commitments made by 100 stakeholders spanning governments, aid donors, civil society, the UN and businesses.

*Global burden of malnutrition ""remains unacceptably high and progress unacceptably slow"". Under-nutrition accounts for around 45% of deaths among children under five in low- and middle-income countries.

*Overweight and obesity has led to around 4 million deaths and 120 million healthy years of life lost across the globe, with around 38.9% adults found to be overweight.

*Among children under five years of age, 150.8 million are stunted, 50.5 million are wasted and 38.3 million are overweight; while 20 million babies are born underweight each year, it says.

*The impact of malnutrition on global economy is close to US$3.5 trillion per year, with obesity alone costing US$500 billion per year.

*A major section of the study looks at the quality, nutrient content and type of food consumed across the globe. The results suggest a disparity between developed and emerging markets, says the report.

*The report says that regardless of wealth, school-age children, adolescents and adults are consuming too many refined grains, sugary foods and drinks, and not enough fruits, vegetables and whole grains.

*India is facing a major malnutrition crisis as it is the country with the highest number of 'stunted' children in the world. India holds almost a third (31%) of the global burden for stunting, the prevalence of which differs from state to state. As per the UNICEF, stunting, or low height for age, is caused by long-term insufficient nutrient intake and frequent infections.

*As for the nutrition status of children and adolescents aged between five and19 years, 58.1 per cent of boys were underweight while 50.1 per cent girls were underweight. This difference between the genders can likely be attributed to India's adverse sex ratio in the first place.

*Stunting varies greatly from district to district (12.4% to 65.1%), with 239 of 604 districts accounting for stunting levels above 40%. The differences between districts were a result of multiple factors, including gender, education, economic status, health, hygiene, and other demographic factors.

*India is the country with the largest number of children who are stunted at 46.6 million, followed by Nigeria (13.9 million) and Pakistan (10.7 million). The urban prevalence of stunting on average 19.2% compared with 26.8% in rural areas.

*While wasting, or low weight for height, affects a greater proportion of rural children than urban. India again tops the list with the most number of wasted children at 25.5 million, followed by Nigeria (3.4 million) and Indonesia (3.3 million).

*India is also among the countries with more than a million children who are overweight. As part of the report, a case study in Rajasthan found that key areas of infant and young child feeding and micronutrient supplementation were underfunded.

The Global Hunger Index(GHI) is a tool that measures and tracks hunger globally, by region, and by country

Created in 2006, the GHI was initially published by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and Welthungerhilfe. In 2007, the Irish NGO Concern Worldwide also became a co-publisher. In 2018, the GHI was a joint project of Welthungerhilfe and Concern Worldwide, with IFPRI stepping aside from its involvement in the report.

The main area of focus for 2018 year's report has been ""Forced Migration and Hunger""

Globally, the level of hunger falls into the ""serious"" category at a value of 20.9 on GHI Severity scale. Across South Asia: Child wasting is constituting a ""critical public health emergency"". Low Maternal body mass index BMI and lack of access to improved water and sanitation are more closely associated with rates of child wasting than household wealth, suggesting that a reduction in poverty alone may not be sufficient to correct the problem. Approximately 124 million people suffer from acute hunger, a steep increase from 80 million

India's ranking has dropped three places from 2017. India has shown improvement in three of the indicators over the comparable reference years.

The percentage of undernourished people in the population has dropped from 18.2% in 2000 to 14.8% in 2018. Child mortality rate has halved from 9.2% to 4.3%, and Child stunting has dropped from 54.2% to 38.4% over the same period

However, the prevalence of child wasting has worsened. It stood at 17.1% in 2000, and increased to 20% in 2005. In 2018, it stands at 21%. At least one in five Indian children under the age of five are wasted."

Public health services were bolstered by new schemes, even as the ongoing health projects continued to receive generous financial support from the State government.

Apart from sustaining direct cash transfer and KCR Kits scheme for pregnant women, the authorities launched a slew of initiatives to augment infrastructure, strengthen manpower, focus on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and improve last-mile delivery of healthcare facilities.

Kanti Velugu

By December, the unique health initiative of conducting eye screening camps had completed screening of 1.13 crore in over 6,000 villages in Telangana, thanks to the Kanti Velugu scheme, which was launched in August. Some 18,36,303 beneficiaries received reading glasses and another 7,39,047 persons were referred to secondary and tertiary care facilities in the State.

KCR Kits

KCR Kits and direct cash benefit scheme is the centrepiece initiative that is driving mother and child care in Telangana. Recently, the scheme achieved a unique landmark of completing registrations of 10 lakh pregnant women.

The scheme led to a huge increase in admissions of pregnant women in State-run maternity hospitals. Rough estimates suggest the number of admissions of pregnant women having increased from 20 per cent to 50 per cent, which is at par with private hospitals.

On its part, between January 1 and October 31, the authorities have released a whopping Rs 243.12 crore to the beneficiaries at four different stages of pregnancy to women in Telangana.

Last-mile delivery

To address logistic issues of field-level healthcare workers, authorities in January launched a fleet of 200 Amma Vodi ambulances to provide services to pregnant women in districts. As many as 50 bike ambulances were also launched to enable healthcare workers in urban areas to travel quickly and extend emergency care.

Recruitment delayed

The process of recruitment of doctors, nurses and other health staff under Director of Medical Education and Telangana Vaidya Vidhan Parishad was hit by inordinate delays this year. While authorities managed to complete recruitment of 980 specialist doctors under TVVP, recruitment of nurses, tutors and other support staff are pending with TSPSC and DME.

Infrastructure

2018 also saw steady improvement in infrastructure in the form of more dialysis centres and collaboration with Tata Foundation to set up cancer screening centres in districts. Already, nearly seven exclusive palliative care facilities for terminally ill patients were set up in districts. In the form of unique T-Diagnostics, the health authorities have incurred an expenditure of close to Rs 200 crore in the last few years to improve diagnostic equipment in State-run hospitals.

Gandhi development and OGH delayed

While the much-awaited twin tower project at Osmania General Hospital (OGH) was hit by inordinate delays, a lot of investment took place at Gandhi Hospital. Centralised drug testing laboratory with a cost of Rs 50 lakh, a new CT scan with a cost of Rs 3.5 crore and an MRI with a cost of Rs 80 lakh were installed.

Free transplantation at government hospitals

The foundation for conducting free organ transplantations at State-run hospitals was laid this year with authorities deciding to allocate Rs 70 crore to develop dedicated transplant facilities at Gandhi Hospital, OGH and NIMS.

The year 2018 saw a massive investment from the State government in providing free access to high-end diagnostic services for patients at all the teaching hospitals in the State, says Dr K Ramesh Reddy, Director of Medical Education (DME), Telangana.

""Advanced diagnostic facilities and high-end investigative services are available in all teaching hospitals of the State. Perhaps, this is the reason why the patient inflow in all the State-run hospitals has increased in 2018,"" he pointed out.

Among other major achievements in the field of medical education, the DME pointed out that the State government commissioned Siddipet Medical College and added 150 MBBS seats in 2018.

""We also initiated measures to add two more medical colleges, one at Suryapet and another one at Nalgonda, with 150 MBBS seats for the academic year 2019-2020. This is another major achievement for the department,"" he said.

Apart from inaugurating one infertility centre at Gandhi Hospital, the proposal to set up two more such facilities at Maternity Hospital in Petlaburj and another one at MGM Warangal also received green signal this year.

""This year, we also received permissions to set up 20-bed ICUs with 10 ventilators each in all the teaching hospitals. Already, we have started ICU at Gandhi Hospital, and it will be extended to other hospitals in due course,"" Dr Reddy added."

When they all wore black attire and accorded a celebratory welcome to actor Salim Kumar to their campus a few months ago, the students of C.H. Mohammed Koya College for Advanced Study in Varkala would not have imagined that the attire would lead a news channel to brand them as terrorists, much later.

A short video of the college annual day celebration, which took place on March 14 this year, was telecast on a television channel on Friday, as the ""latest example of Islamic State-Al Qaeda terrorism taking root on Kerala campuses"". However, officials of the Ayiroor police station dismissed these allegations and said it was a harmless celebration. Actor Salim Kumar too came out sharply criticising the report.

""The students had invited me to the college and told me that I should wear black as it was also a tribute to my character in CID Moosa. They welcomed me at the junction near the college, with all of them in black, accompanying me as a procession,"" he says.

""It is unfortunate that it has been twisted this way because it is a Muslim management college. The students did not indulge in any sloganeering as claimed by the channel. It is also funny that all the students have been branded as terrorists. Even I was wearing black. Today, the channel came to interview me and I told them what had happened,"" Salim Kumar says.

According to Ayiroor SI Sajeev, there was nothing provocative in the celebration organised by the students.

""Following the report, we had visited the college. We also inspected the toilets as the television report claimed that these had suspicious drawings supporting terrorism. We found only typical drawings found on campuses, with danger signs, pirate faces, and other scribblings. The video of the celebration also did not have anything suspicious,"" he says.

A. Shaheer, General Secretary of the Muslim Education Trust for Coastal Area that runs the college, says the college will initiate legal action against the defamatory report.

""It is suspicious how they had made up this story based on an old celebratory video. The flags shown in the video are our own department's flags, not IS flags as claimed in the report. More than 75% of our faculty and a majority of the students are from communities other than Muslim. We are a secular institution.

Suneetha and her classmates at Government Higher Primary School at Madrahalli in T. Narsipur taluk of Mysuru district have been reciting English rhymes in the last fortnight as the day to present their newly acquired English talent is fast approaching.

The school in the tiny village has around 101 students and each one has to speak English with their teachers, friends, and students throughout the day on January 1, 2019. While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T. Narsipur model' across the State by training teachers through the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) and the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET), another senior officer said."

In a meeting on Saturday, chief minister Kamal Nath asked all of his 28 ministerial colleagues and officers to make plans in a way that it could be fulfilled in 100 days. However, experts feel that it would be a tough for the government to keep all the promises with the state reeling under a debt of Rs 1.87 lakh crore.

The major promises of the government are to generate employment, permanent jobs to contractual employees, opening of Gaushala, making the state drugs free, unearthed corruption cases, cut the electricity bill to half, increasing old age pension, specially abled pension from Rs 500 per month to Rs 1000 per month and others.

Higher education and sports minister Jeetu Patwari said, ""We have to fulfill all the promises in 100 days. According to the promise made in Vachan Patra, the contractual teachers would be regularised and irregularities in the recruitment of class 2 officers conducted by MP Public Service Commission will be probed.""

Cooperatives minister Govind Singh also said the irregularities of state cooperative bank will be probed in 100 days and cooperative banks will be strengthened. Meanwhile, finance minister Tarun Bhanot said former BJP-led state government handed over empty coffers to them and they would inform common people of MP about it. Experts feel that the government would release the order as it did in loan waiver scheme for farmers but taking decisions on all its promises will be a tough challenge for the government.

""Citing financial crises a reason, this 100 days plan will focus more on populist measures like they created spiritual department to woo a section of people without spending any money now to make its road easy for Lok Sabha election., ""said Professor Zamirruddin.

The CM singed the loan waiver order but still, it is not clear how it will happen. Similarly, the government might release the order of regularisation of contractual employee or providing benefit to unemployed educated youth but the major question would be when it comes to reality. Congress government promised benefit to around 12 lakh registered educated unemployed youth in the state."

Chandrasekhar Rao was there on a visit to Sharada Peetham probably did not have parallels even in Telangana.

Among the several admirers of Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao who lined up outside the Peetham in Chinamushidivada area of the city was a middle-aged person Dusarlapudi Ramana Raju who identified himself as the representative of Kakinada based AP KCR Foundation.

Holding aloft a portrait of Satyanarayana Swamy temple at Annavaram which also had an image of KCR, Mr. Raju wanted an audience with Mr. Rao, but the on duty local police would have nothing of it and, instead, took him into custody.

Mr. Raju argued with the police that he broke 100 coconuts at the temple seeking the Lord's blessings for TRS winning 100 seats in recent Assembly elections in Telangana. He was there to ask Mr. Rao to visit the temple since his prayer was almost answered.

Another admirer, film actress Ramyasri, also failed to meet Mr. Rao after a long wait outside the Peetham.

The Excise Department appears to be sensing an opportunity to boost its revenues on the New Year eve.

The department has permitted the liquor outlets and bars to function for an extra hour over and above the allotted timings on December 31. Liquor outlets will accordingly remain open till the stroke of midnight to welcome the New Year while bars, clubs and permitted events will be open for one hour more.

While the move is seen as a gesture to allow the people to celebrate the advent of the New Year, the department on its part is apparently looking for more sales. The decision comes in the light of the reported downtrend in liquor sale during the election period contrary to expectations of high volume sales. Hopefully, the Department is not planning to make hay while the sun is down.

In Telugu commitment of an individual is described by the phrase 'walked their way till they wore out their footwear'. But, here is a supporter who campaigned walking without footwear for the victory of TRS candidate from Narayanpet constituency S. Rajender Reddy.

After the sweet victory of Mr. Reddy came the real reward for Mr. Kashappa of Narsapur village of Damaragidda mandal. He was felicitated on stage with a pair of chappals by Mr. Reddy at the victory rally of TRS in Narayanpet. The MLA himself slipped on the chappals on Mr. Kashappa's feet, sending the crowd into peels of laughter.

The century-old Osmania University may have suffered a beating of its prestige after it gave up conduct of the World Science Congress last year. Here is a modest attempt by the university to salvage some of it by proposing to host Engineering, Agriculture, Medicine Common Entrance Test - 2019.

It was nearly two decades ago that Osmania University had last conducted EAMCET when the test was held under the aegis of different universities and the Regional Engineering College at Warangal on a rotation basis each year. The infamous EAMCET question paper leak in Sri Venkateswara University in 1996 had rattled the government. The N. Chandrababu Naidu government then issued an order entrusting the responsibility of the test solely to JNTU - Hyderabad.

If the TRS government in separate Telangana concedes the request of Osmania University, the State Council of Higher Education which allots the common entrance tests to universities may have to provide a level playing field to new generation universities elsewhere in the State."

"128","1029391605","2018-12-30","https://starofmysore.com/kuchela-lord-krishnas-friend/","Kuchela, Lord Krishna's friend - Star of Mysore","starofmysore.com",FALSE,"By Prof. A.V. Narasimha Murthy, former Head, Department of Ancient History and Archaeology, University of Mysore

We have seen hundreds of people who are friends of kings, rich people, Maharajas, administrators and others. But we are not familiar with an ordinary person like Kuchela having friendship with Lord Sri Krishna, who is supposed to have flourished in Dwapara Yuga. Thus friendship transcends the boundaries of rich and poor, Gods and human beings and the like. The best example is the friendship between Kuchela and Sri Krishna. In fact, Kuchela's original name was Sudama.

Krishna and Sudama were classmates and studied under Guru Sandeepani. After their education, Sri Krishna returned to Mathura and was immersed in his social work, and administration of Yadunadu. On the other hand, Sudama returned to his village and was immersed in Vedic studies. In course of time, Sudama got married and had many children. Though he was a great Vedic Scholar, he was suffering from poverty of high order but was satisfied with whatever small amount he earned and never begged anybody for money. He did not have good clothes to wear and there was no money to prepare gruel and hence people began to call him Kuchela -- a person with rags (chindi).

Fortunately, Kuchela's wife was extremely good and followed the footsteps of her husband and everyone admired them by saying that they are made for each other. She was satisfied and happy with whatever her husband brought and her main aim was to rear their children by giving them good education and make them follow the dharmic path so that they can serve the society. Naturally what the husband had brought was not fully sufficient and she slept with no food on many days.

Unable to bear these difficulties and the poverty from which their entire family was suffering, she thought of a plan. She told her husband Kuchela, ""you are a great friend of Lord Krishna and he will not say no to any help you may request; hence I request you to go to your dearest friend and ask for help. I have heard if one approaches Lord Krishna with true love, friendship and devotion, he will not disappoint them. However, you are his dearest friend and hence he will not refuse the request you make.' Encouraged by this, immediately he decided and went to Dwaraka. However, his mind told him that he should not go to Lord Krishna with empty hands as it is against the usual practice and courtesy requires that he should carry something, however, trivial it may be. The problem still persisted because he did not know as to what he should offer to a dearest friend. He asked his wife for suggestion. She told him that the idea is excellent but we are so poor and I do not venture to suggest any gift to be given to Lord Krishna.

Finally both the husband and wife agreed that Kuchela should carry some quantity of avalakki (beaten rice). Nowadays this delicacy is becoming rare. However, it is being prepared and eaten in traditional homes as phalahara in place of cooked rice. He took this avalakki in his bag.

Kuchela began dreaming about meeting Lord Krishna at Dwaraka. He thought how to praise him with choices of epithets extolling his goodly qualities and his deeds which have helped thousands of people all over his kingdom and outside. He thought that his hands are the best in the world which have an opportunity of serving him and washing his feet, embracing him with his two hands. I am fortunate that I have this head which touches his holy feet and my ears are divine because I can hear Lord Krishna's praise from not only human beings but even Gods and Goddesses. He also felt that his eyes are the best in the world which can look at this divine person.

Another problem came to him. All these are fine in theory but even the guards will not allow me into Krishna's Palace. However, he made bold and entered Krishna's Palace. He felt supremely happy that no guard or door-keeper stopped him and he felt that it is nothing but Lord Krishna's grace. He sent word to Lord Krishna that his dearest friend Kuchela had arrived and waiting for a meeting.

As soon as Lord Krishna came to know about this, he welcomed him and took him to his personal living Palace. Krishna asked Kuchela as to what he has brought for him after enquiring about the welfare of Kuchela and his family. Krishna noticed that Kuchela was hiding a small packet and even without asking for it took it in his hands. He exclaimed that the packet contained avalakki which he liked. Immediately he took a handful of avalakki and put it into his mouth. It was so tasty that Krishna wanted to take some more avalakki. Noticing this his wife Rukmini prevented him from taking some more and she remarked that what he has taken so far is enough for this birth and also next many births.

Thus Kuchela spent fine time with Krishna and his family and with sadness took leave off Krishna and returned to this original agrahara. Never thinking of his poverty, Kuchela was thinking of the time he spent with Krishna, particularly his embrace and other courtesies shown to him. But he was sorry that Krishna did not give him any wealth, lands and other properties. But he consoled himself saying that Krishna should have done it deliberately so that Kuchela would not immerse himself in the pleasures of this world and forget the other more important world. With these thoughts he returned to his house and he was pleasantly surprised that a miracle had taken place. Krishna had ordered Viswakarma, the divine architect to rebuild Kuchela's house into a luxurious one. He could not recognise his original house. Just for the sake of some avalakki, Krishna had given him property and felt that God only can give this and we are all beggars to receive it.

In spite of all these wealth, Kuchela did not indulge in worldly pleasures but immersed in the thought of Lord Krishna. Thus Kuchela set an example to all other human beings. Ultimately the grace of God is the final gift to every human being and we should aspire for it and it alone. Krishna taught this moral to all human beings through the example of Kuchela. Kuchela is thus blessed."

According to a representation submitted by the forum, members stated that although the case was transferred to the CBCID in 2013, action against the teachers is still pending. While the CID had sought clarification from the University Grants Commission to ascertain competence of certificates submitted by the teachers, officials from the forum have termed it a ""clear case of cheating and forgery.""

""The persons involved should have been suspended and criminal prosecution launched but no such action was initiated. After 10 years of the commission of offence, the director of school education says that the reports from the DEO (district education officer) are awaited an the CID says that they are awaiting clarification from UGC,"" explained the forum in it's representation.

The forum suspects that the school education department has not initiated any action against the teachers as it is under pressure from various unions.

With no action taken against the teachers, officials suspect that many of them may still be in-service. ""While many of them who obtained such bogus certificates for promotions may have retired in the last 10 years. However, those who procured such fake certificates to secure jobs in government schools may still be working. It is a worrying factor as the quality of teaching that they impart may be poor,"" said M Padmanabh Reddy, secretary of the forum.

An RTI appeal by a citybased civil society had revealed that of the 878 teachers and headmasters, working in government schools across the state, highest number of teachers i.e. 345 with fake degrees hail from Medak. In some cases, the teachers even produced certificates of nonexistent courses from distance universities.

Officials said that most certificates submitted by the teachers were of bachelor of education and master of arts (English literature) and forged by unscrupulous elements. Some teachers even got away with forging certificates of different Vidhyapeeths that are not competent to issue certificates."

Stating that colour of bicycles was changed to saffron, which closely resembled the Sangh attire.

Stating that decisions taken by previous BJP government out of 'political vendetta' would be reviewed, Dotasara said, ""In the past five years, decisions were made as per the list provided to the government by the RSS. We have ordered officials that whatever changes were made in the education sector -- whether it is relocation of schools, change in textbooks and uniforms -- all of it should be reviewed.""

Alleging that the education sector became a laboratory for the RSS in the BJP rule, he said, ""The education department in Rajasthan had ended up being a laboratory for the RSS. We are forming a separate committee of educationists to review the changes made in textbooks and distortion of history. Gandhiji has been reduced to a note and they (BJP) forgot to mention the contribution of people such as Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and other figures.""

The Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, JSS Medical College, JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research, Mysuru, must be congratulated for having organised and conducted the Forensic Fair (Dec.19-21).

Here I would like to give a brief on the origin and development of Forensic Medicine and Science in Mysuru. The Government Mysore Medical College was established in 1924-1925. For a long time, there was no formal Forensic Medicine Department in the College. Post-mortem was, usually, conducted by a faculty from the Department of Physiology, Anatomy or Pathology.

In fact, the first such faculty was the late Kaniyar Narasimhiengar. Dr. Narasimhiengar had gained an MB&BS from the Grant Medical College, Bombay, and had been appointed in 1925, as Demonstrator in Physiology, on a salary of Rs.75. In addition to his normal duties, he was conducting post-mortems. A special pay of Rs.5 had been sanctioned to him for that work.

Such a system prevailed for long. However, in the year 1952-1953, a full-fledged Department of Forensic Medicine came into being. Dr. A.T. Sreenivasa Iyengar, a World War II veteran, was inducted as the Head of the Department.

Soon, Sreenivasa Iyengar was deputed for doing PG Diploma in Forensic Medicine in Osmania University, Hyderabad. After his successful return, the Department started growing. Thus, in Mysuru, the origin of Forensic Medicine and Science should be credited to Dr. Kaniyar Narasimhiengar and its development to the late Dr. A.T. Sreenivasa Iyengar.

(Incidentally, I am the son of the senior Iyengar and brother-in-law of A.T. Sreenivasa Iyengar)."

Tackling crime is, however, not the only way the constable tries to achieve it. Gondi is often the first contact point for most people in the area whenever the need for blood donation arises.

The 29-year-old constable, currently attached to Adur Police Station in Hangal taluk of Haveri district, has made it his mission to encourage and educate people about organ and blood donation, and sign them up for the cause.

For the last five years, he has been spreading awareness about the subject on every possible occasion in the area, and has led over 670 villagers in Hangal taluk to pledge their eyes while 11 people, including women, have pledged to donate their bodies. His mobile number is now widely in circulation, and he is often the first person called up by people during a medical emergency.

Gondi, who is now a household name in his native village of Akkialur of Hangal taluk and the surrounding region due to his zeal to save lives, has created a group of about 1,500 like-minded people who are ready to donate blood at any time. His efforts have led to a number of people becoming regular donors, such as Akkialur Virkat Mutt pontiff Shivabasav Swamiji, who donated blood for the fifth time on December 6, and Tanaji Gorphade of Adur village, who has donated blood 30 times so far.

Gondi's wife and his three-and-a-half-year-old son, Hoysala, have also pledged their eyes and other organs.

All the people who have pledged their eyes are enrolled for the cause with M M Joshi Eye Hospital in Hubballi. His efforts have led to a restoration of eyesight in nine persons who suffered from corneal defect in Hubballi and Sirsi.

Agricultural labour Fakkeriappa Talwar of Gejjihalli village in Hangal Taluk, who injured his right eye while he was cutting maize crop, cannot thank him enough. ""I'm a poor man and did not have the means to pay Rs 40,000 for an eye transplant. Hence I approached Karabasappa and got my eye operated upon. I am thankful to Karabasappa for the favour,"" says Talwar, who underwent an eye transplant in August this year at Shankar Eye Hospital, Shivamogga.

Gondi's commitment to the cause took roots in his mind when he faced a sight problem in childhood. He underwent laser eye surgery in 2009 before joining the police department. ""I always thought of doing something for the society in terms of eye care and eye donation,"" says Gondi. ""After I joined the police force, I started organising eye camps in my free time and convinced people to sign up for donations.""

Gondi organised the first eye check-up camp and donation drive at Akkialur five years ago.

He now holds an eye camp for villagers on the last Sunday of every month. He also visits schools to make children aware of the significance of blood and organ donation. In the last few years, he has also started using the social media to promote the cause. Gondi has Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram accounts on which he posts updates about eye camps, etc.

""In the beginning, it was not easy to persuade people in small towns and villages about donating their eyes. I had to convince them slowly before villagers started signing up,"" says Gondi, who is a graduate and a diploma holder in education. He often takes the help of mythological stories to dispel superstitions and taboos from people's minds, narrating to them, for instance, how Bedara Kannappa donated both his eyes to Lord Shiva.

""Initially it was very difficult to influence them, and they even made fun. But I did not lose hope,"" he says. ""I ask people to pledge their eyes on occasions such as marriages, anniversaries and birthdays. This will send a positive message in the society,"" he adds.

Gondi's mobile phone numbers -- 8861118881 or 8088318888 -- are also used by people during a medical emergency.

""Gondi has a large network of friends who have enrolled themselves for blood donation. The group comprises about 1,800 blood donors in eight districts of Karnataka. Whenever any patient requires blood, we call Gondi and we are never disappointed,"" Shankar, a villager from Adur, says.

Inspiring Act

All the members of Gondi's family have pledged their bodies to Haveri Sindagi Shantveereshwara Ayurveda Medical College. Inspired by their act, several families from Akkialur, Haveri and Shiggavi have also come forward to sign up for organ donation at the college. Mahantesh Salavatagi and Parvatewwa Shankrappa Bellad, both residents of Akkialur village, say, ""We have pledged to donate our eyes willingly. No one should suffer from lack

of vision.""

Green Thumb

Karabasappa Gondi is also passionate about environment conservation. He has so far planted 16 trees at his house in Akkialur village in memory of his ancestors."

Earlier, speculations were rife on relocating the proposed campus from Thiruvananthapuram to Higher Education Minister K T Jaleel's home district, Malappuram. However, the government later clarified that the headquarters will be in Thiruvananthapuram itself. The government has also set aside a fund of '60 crore for land acquisition proceedings including the rehabilitation of 22 families residing close to the proposed location.

According to KTU registrar G P Padmakumar, the survey proceedings are underway, including acquisition under the aegis of the Revenue Department.

""The acquisition is underway and hence an administrative approval was needed for sanctioning the fund for acquisition and providing compensation to 22 families. The whole process will take at least seven to eight months and the construction work is expected to begin after eight months,"" he said. Padmakumar had led the committee which was formed by the government to identify suitable land for a permanent campus. The proposed campus will come up at 50 acres of land at Vilappilsala where the old waste treatment plant was situated.

The site of the Vilappilsala solid waste treatment plant is lying idle after the plant was closed for the past seven years. The University plans to set up a residential campus with world-class facilities. Though the University officials were not happy with the site, later they agreed to set up the campus in the capital itself.

According to Section 3 (6) of the KTU Act, the headquarters of the University should be located in the capital. In order to get UGC funding for the University and affiliated colleges, KTU should obtain 12 (B) status. In order to obtain that status, KTU should have a campus with at least five departments.

The previous government had identified 50 acres of land belonging to the University of Kerala for setting up a permanent campus of KTU.

Though the Syndicate of the University ratified the proposal, the University later took a U-turn and said that the land could not be allocated and suggested that an alternate place is considered. In all, 210 institutions, including 153 engineering colleges, 23 MBA colleges, 25 MCA colleges and eight Architecture colleges in the state are affiliated to KTU."

The development comes close on the heels of another such incident in Aligarh where farmers in the district herded stray cows inside government buildings to prevent crop damage.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath recently directed the officials concerned to make immediate arrangements for proper care of stray cows.

He also ordered clearing of grazing grounds in different parts of the state from encroachments.

In Agra, police had to intervene in at least six cases to free cows locked in schools and public health centres.

On Saturday, villagers locked up stray cows in a school in Garhi Bachchi. A day earlier, cattle were locked up inside a primary school at Arela village in Etmadpur tehsil.

Officials of the Basic Education department had to intervene to get the premises vacated for children who had been forced to stay away from classes.

Farmers rued that the bovines were destroying crops.

""Cows and bulls have become a huge nuisance, eating crops and destroying greenery,"" complained a farmer of Barauli Ahir block, Ramesh.

A farmer from Bichpuri, Ram Bharosey, said a groups of villagers with sticks in hands have to keep moving around to ensure the cattle were kept away from fields.

Several farmers also raised concern over what they called as 'population explosion' of cattle.

People do not know what to do with cattle which are usually chased away towards the urban clusters. The bulls in the city have caused several fatal accidents, they said.

When contacted, the district authorities said plans for providing new pasture land and cow shelters will take time for implementation.

Child-friendly and safe infrastructure, trained teachers and tech-savvy classrooms are some of the criteria the state education department is looking at to include a school under the newly-formed Maharashtra International Education Board (MIEB).

On December 25, Maharashtra's education department formally launched the MIEB to bring international quality education in state schools. It was also announced that government schools that will be a part of the programme would be named 'Bharatratna Atal Bihari International School.'

The education department has received applications from 455 schools to be a part of the first batch of 100 schools that would have the MIEB curriculum in Marathi and has now started scanning the applications. Francis Joseph, head of MIEB's development and strategy, said that school teachers who are well trained and ready for upgrading their skills would have higher chances of getting selected.

""We are not looking merely at the school infrastructure or the facilities provided in schools. Schools that have a dynamic leadership and teaching staff who are ready to learn something new will be preferred. They should also have the safety of students as their main priority,"" he added.

Schools that have applied for the board's affiliation had to go through a rigorous application process. ""They had to mention all details -- including no-objection certificates from their respective managements, school heads and information about their teachers and infrastructure,"" Joseph said. ""We want all schools to have a wifi connection and to have a safe and child-friendly infrastructure as it is the need of the hour.""

While the department had earlier decided to allow only government schools to be a part of the drive, state education minister Vinod Tawde recently announced that 25 private schools, 25 aided schools and 50 government schools would be a part of the programme.

Members MIEB's governing board said private schools would be scrutinised further because they need to have the right infrastructure in place. So far, around 45 private schools have shown interest in becoming part of MIEB. ""Even after granting affiliation, routine audits would be conducted in schools to ensure that they are following all the guidelines laid down by the board,"" added an official from the state education department."

To cope with the situation, two sections of each class are clubbed and taught together. Further, students are compelled to sit on carpets to make optimum usage of space.

The school, which was constructed in 1995, has 306 children studying in classes 1 to 5. It has 10 sections, but only five classrooms to accommodate the strength. Two out of these five classrooms also function as the school's kitchen, administrative room, and a store house.

Pardeep Kumar, administrative head of the school, admitted that the institution was suffering for lack of classrooms. ""One single room functions as the kitchen, where mid-day meals are stored, school's record room, and even a classroom. We have very little space for construction of additional classrooms. We are not sure if more floors can be added to the current structure since it is old and already deteriorating. We don't even have a playground,"" said Kumar.

Vanshika Singh, a Class 5 student, said that she and other classmates had to sit on the floor during classes. ""I sit on a carpet that is spread over the floor. We don't have benches for all the classes,"" she said. The 11-year-old added that the school did not have enough play area. ""During the lunch break, the small courtyard area gets too crowded. There are far too many children and sometimes they even get hurt while trying to play in the limited space,"" added Singh.

Kumar, however, said that the school was trying to make the optimum usage of whatever little resources it had. ""We only have benches in two classrooms. In the remaining three classes, we use carpets so that more students can be adjusted in one class. During summer, at times, we move one section outside to study on the verandah, and students from the other section study inside the classroom,"" explained Kumar.

Apart from the space constraints, the school is grappling with crumbling infrastructure. Students study in classrooms where the walls are cracked, with plaster peeling off their surface, and ceilings that have been water-damaged. The portion of the school that houses the washrooms is also in a bad state, and is enclosed by a broken wall.

Kumar said that the school had recently received funds for routine repairs and work would be initiated during the upcoming holidays. ""The routine repairs will be taken care of, but the school should be given a new and bigger space for it to overcome the space crunch. The school needs a bigger space to operate and accommodate the increasing number of students,"" said Kumar.

Meanwhile, district elementary education officer Premlata Yadav said that the education department had not received any complaints pertaining to the matter of space crunch from the school. ""We will look into the matter if we receive a formal complaint. We have already directed funds for routine repair work,"" said Yadav."

Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy Saturday charged the Centre with misusing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

During the UPA rule there was no interference in the independent working of the CBI, he claimed.

Narayanasamy, who was the Minister of State in PMO in the UPA government, told reporters in Puducherry that ""the integrity of CBI has come down now during the current NDA government.""

""I do not want to elaborate any further,"" he added.

He said his government did not accept Lt Governor Kiran Bedi's contention that Pongal gift hampers should be distributed only to families coming under below poverty line (BPL) category. Narayanasamy said the government in Tamil Nadu was distributing the Pongal gift to all families and ""we want to toe the same line without any discrimination between above poverty line and BPL families.""

The chief minister, who has been at loggerheads with the Lt Governor on various issues, also objected to Bedi describing her office as the 'secretariat' although it is only the Lt Governor's office. The Lt Governor ""is only misusing her power and authority when she describes her office as the secretariat,"" he added.

He also hit out at Bedi for conducting 'tests' for staff of government departments in her office as was done recently for those in the Social Welfare Department.

""Who has authorised her to conduct the tests. Is she a college professor or a school teacher to conduct tests,"" he asked.

Despite shortfall in grants from the centre, the Puducherry government hadmade recorded achievements in health, education and other sectors during 2018.

All three of them want to encourage girls in India to pursue careers in STEM.

Three Indian-origin women scientists made it in the list of 60 Superstars of STEM list announced recently by the Australian government. These bright minds -- Onisha Patel, Devika Kamath and Asha Rao -- are born and brought up in India and have done pathbreaking work in the field of science. All three moved to Australia to pursue higher studies and wish to change the situation for younger girls back home.

Due to gender gap in STEM courses, the government there is planning to train these scientists for one year to become influencers for female students. Talking to indianexpress.com, Dion Pretorius, communications and policy manager said, ""When a child is asked to draw a scientist, two out of three will draw a man. The women scientists work is not reported much by the media as well. The Department of Science and Technology, Australia aims to change this scenario by making deserving female scientists get proper visibility so that they can be a role model for girls who wish to take up STEM.""

Alchemy of stars and everything around it

Born in Coimbatore, 32-year-old, Devika Kamath is researching where stars get the cosmos matter they are made of. ""Our universe is mysterious. The elements in stars are made of same elements that make up our bodies and everything around us. My core research is tied to understanding the uncertain physics of stars and demystifying their alchemy. It brings to light the connection we share with the Universe and this I think is very fascinating for most people which could have made my research stand out,"" said she.

Kamath wanted to pursue astrophysics in India but there were limited opportunities during those days. ""When it comes to research, many Indian students face a lack of guidance. After this fellowship, I want to set-up a guidance initiative wherein I can help Indian students achieve what they want to in academics,"" she said.

While she believes that her cultural diverseness and unique research topic could have got her through she also said that one has to break too many stereotypes to become a woman scientist. ""Every girl is taught to keep family as top priority. Society is such that if a woman pursues a career and that too in a male-dominated field, she has to overcome several challenges and break stereotypes,"" she said.

Finding cure of cancer

While growing up in Ahmedabad, Onisha Patel loved science and arts but did not know what structural biology was until she took admission in RMIT University, Australia. Though many questioned her parents' decision to enrol their girl child in Science, Patel's family was supportive. ""My dad told me about Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and that she went to Australia in the 1970s to study brewing which was a very non-traditional career path. This inspired me to pursue higher studies outside India,"" said Onisha who moved to Australia in 1998 in search of better opportunities in science.

Today her research has the potential to generate a cure for many cancers including breasts. She is investigating how proteins work inside human bodies and based on the information will design novel therapeutics for cancer.

While she believes the education system in India has changed since her childhood, there is still a need to have more female role-models to motivate young girls to take up STEM. ""I am very passionate about promoting art and science and I wish students are encouraged to combine creativity with curiosity to keep them interested in STEM. Every student has the ability to learn. What is important is to encourage them to think and generate ideas. When students are comfortable with failing, they will become more creative and confident to tackle challenging problems,"" she said.

Making mathematical science in fraud detection

Twenty seven-year-old Asha Rao is a cyber mathematics expert and specialises in detection of money laundry. She teaches mathematical science at the RMIT University. She has participated in the fourth United Nations Intergovernmental meeting on cybercrime held recently.

Rao also teaches at the universities and her classes have more boys than girls. ""Gender gap in STEM courses is as much a reality in Australia as in India. There are lesser women who pursue STEM in higher education and even fewer women in senior-level jobs. Most of this is because of societal pressure. Female students do not see themselves pursuing STEM and that needs to be changed,"" she said. ""We need to make young women believe in themselves and make STEM an interesting field for both boys and girls.""

Rao believes that if students are motivated to do their best, it would solve the issue of unskilled graduates. ""It is important to establish a personal relationship with every student in a class. I tend to call students by their first name and motivate them based on their performance. Even if a student has scored average marks but better than before, I congratulate them and give feedback. This often motivates them and strikes conversations between teacher and students,"" she said.

Keeping low enrollment of females in STEM courses in mind, Rao believes that it is important to show them the opportunities that are available around them. It is the society that has stereotyped certain courses and professions."

In a burst of early morning tweets, the president said the alternative to funding his controversial wall project would be total separation from Mexico -- including making US car companies pull out their factories based on the other side of the frontier.

The threat yet again upped the ante in a political row that has led to a partial shutdown of the US government and seems set to dominate the start to the third year of Trump's presidency.

Trump tweeted:

Trump said he would then take US-Mexican relations back to the days before the NAFTA agreement opened free trade across Canada, Mexico and the United States. That would ""bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs,"" he said.

It was not clear how separating the two huge neighbours would work. Bilateral trade totalled an estimated $615.9 billion in 2017, according to US government figures.

Neither did Trump make any mention of the new free trade agreement, known as the USMCA, which he only recently signed with the two neighbouring countries to replace NAFTA and which he has repeatedly praised as a huge boost for American commerce.

In Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador sidestepped Trump's threat, telling journalists: ""We don't want to be imprudent and we don't think we should get into this.""

$5 billion question

Trump wants $5 billion in funding for a wall along the more than 2,000-mile border, which he says is currently too porous to stop illegal immigration and which he claims has become a magnet for criminals, drugs and even terrorists.

Opponents -- especially in the Democratic party but also some in Trump's Republican party -- say that a physical wall is impractical and that the idea is being used as a political tool to whip up xenophobia in Trump's right-wing voter base.

Both sides have dug in. Democrats refuse to approve funding and the president -- who has made hardline immigration policies a centrepiece of his presidency -- has retaliated by refusing to sign off on a wider spending bill, leaving some 800,000 federal employees without pay.

Negotiations on lifting that partial government shutdown, perhaps by providing some border security funding, have sputtered out and no new debate is scheduled before next Wednesday.

The president, who had already scrapped a Christmas visit to his Florida golf resort, has also ""cancelled his plans for New Year's,"" his incoming chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said on Fox News.

Asked about the startling rhetoric, Mulvaney told Fox that Trump ""is trying to draw light to the fact this is a crazy discussion to be having.""

For one Republican Congress member, Brad Wenstrup, the paralysis over the wall reflected ""a lot of political posturing.""

""I would hope that it could be ended soon,"" he told CNN television. ""If you sit down and talk about that, why is that such a hard thing to do?""

Caravan 'invasion'

Experts are divided on solutions to policing the long, often inhospitable border separating the world's biggest economy from the far poorer countries to its south.

Although there is a huge cross-border drug trade and immigrants often enter illegally, others have genuine claims for asylum. Central Americans are also deeply integrated into the US economy, often performing physically demanding, low-pay jobs in construction, agriculture and other vital sectors.

Trump has consistently painted the asylum seekers and economic migrants in outlandish terms, raising the spectre of rapists, gang members and people with infectious diseases roaming freely across the border.

Trump has latched particularly on to what have become known as the ""caravans"" -- groups of several hundred or even more migrants who make epic treks across Central America and Mexico to try to reach the United States.

According to Trump, the ""caravans"" amount to organized attempts at invading the United States. In a tweet on Friday, Trump warned: ""word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it.""

As a result, he said, ""we will be cutting off all aid"" to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

The impoverished, often dangerous countries have long received American assistance to boost democracy, human rights, education and security. But according to State Department figures, the aid is already dropping steeply.

Honduras is currently set to receive $65.7 million in 2019, down from $105.6 million in 2017, while Guatemala is slated for $69.4 million, down from $145 million. El Salvador received $88 million in 2017 and is set for $45.7 million next year.

They include Woodrow Wilson, who was President of the American Political Science Association before he became President of the United States; Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, a left-wing professor of sociology who promoted right-wing economic policies while occupying the highest political office in his country; Andreas Papandreou, who was chair of the Department of Economics at the University of California at Berkeley before becoming Prime Minister of Greece; and the first President of free Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, who wrote a classic work of anthropology while his country was still under British colonial rule.

I was born long after Wilson died, and have never visited the countries that Cardoso, Papandreou and Kenyatta worked in. But as an Indian I have been witness to the imprint of Manmohan Singh's policies for much of my adult life. Thus, when I found myself in Delhi on the day his Collected Works were being released, I made sure I was in the audience for the event. In the front row sat various former cabinet ministers; alongside me in the middle rows were a range of scholars, students, and professionals.

Dr Singh's Collected Works run to six volumes in all. The first volume reprints his Oxford D Phil thesis, a precocious critique of export pessimism; the second and third contain his scholarly papers on trade, development, monetary policy, and the international economic order; the fourth principally contains the speeches he gave as the finance minister who oversaw the opening of the Indian economy; the fifth and sixth reprint a selection of his speeches and press conferences in his ten years as prime minister.

The evening began with presentations by the volume editors, these being three Professors of Economics -- K Sundaram, C Rangarajan, and Nicholas Stern -- and one Professor of History -- Rudrangshu Mukherjee. Listening to them speak, it struck me that Dr Singh's economic philosophy synthesises the work of his two great contemporaries, Jagdish Bhagwati and Amartya Sen. Like Bhagwati, he strongly advocates a freer play of market forces and a greater integration with the global economy; like Sen, he strongly emphasises the importance of social equity with access to health and education for all. Dr Singh shares neither the archetypal capitalist's contempt for the poor and vulnerable nor the archetypal socialist's contempt for innovation and entrepreneurship. The phrase he made his own, 'inclusive growth', captures an approach to economic policy that is pragmatic without being dehumanising.

After the editors had their say, Dr Singh ascended the stage, to be interviewed by his former Chief Economic Adviser, Professor Kaushik Basu. The conversation was both free-flowing and wide-ranging. Dr Singh spoke movingly about his early life and struggles; of how a child of Partition born in a modest home became a scholar. He remembered with particular affection his teacher in Hoshiarpur, S B Rangnekar, who urged him to go abroad for further studies; before paying his dues to his more famous mentors at Cambridge and Oxford; Nicholas Kaldor, Joan Robinson, John Hicks, and the like.

The conversation then returned to India, to his years first as a teacher and then as a public servant. Here too, the generosity of spirit was manifest. He acknowledged the support to his work of the prime ministers he had worked with, cutting across party lines -- Indira Gandhi, Morarji Desai, Charan Singh and P V Narasimha Rao -- of his colleagues in the bureaucracy, and of younger associates who had provided key inputs into his policies. And he told many humorous stories, several aimed at himself.

Through a long evening the audience sat silently listening, utterly absorbed. Dr Singh came across as a person of warmth and compassion. There were no boastful remarks about his contributions to the nation (or to the world of scholarship either). The tone was scrupulously non-partisan throughout, except at the very end, when, as he saw the compere come on stage to announce the event's closure, he leant towards the microphone and said, 'I certainly was not a prime minister who was afraid of talking to the press', before outlining several instances of unrehearsed press conferences that he had held while occupying that office.

This claim was reported widely in the press, as being aimed at the current prime minister, whose own conspicuous reluctance to be open to questioning in public is well known. On the other hand, it must also be said that Dr Singh was a Prime Minister who was afraid of the electorate. Before him, Indira Gandhi and Narasimha Rao had become PM unexpectedly and (as it were) accidentally, but had sensibly sought election to the Lok Sabha soon afterwards. Like them, Dr Singh should have fought and won a Lok Sabha election after becoming Prime Minister, and certainly when his party sought re-election in 2009. His reluctance or refusal to do so weakened him (and his office) considerably, in a symbolic as well as substantive sense. His inability to tame dissidence in his own party, to confront corrupt allies, and his perhaps excessively deferential behaviour towards the Congress president, are all owed in some measure to this failure.

I am glad I was in Delhi on December 18. Given whose intellectual legacy was being discussed, it was, as it were, a historic occasion. Dr Singh has led an unusually interesting life in unusually important times. He is a good and decent man who has made fundamental contributions to public life in India. While we honour these contributions, we must not allow ourselves to forget the mistakes he made that hurt him, and hurt us too."

""The Centre took and examined our 400 files to find irregularities, but could not find any. PM Modi himself gave us a certificate of honesty. I always say if PM Modi shows us four of his files, he will end up landing in jail,"" Mr Kejriwal said.

""You took our 400 files, show us Sahara-Birla and Rafale files and we can send you to jail with just these two files,"" he challenged Modi.

He said that the BJP in the past four years has not left any stone unturned to ensure that the AAP government could not perform.

""I don't see anywhere in the country or in the world that a Chief Minister elected by the people could not even transfer a peon working under him. The Centre holds the power to transfer the officers but we have been asked to make them work. The public has voted for us, but powers are with the Centre.""

He said that the Central government posted the worst officers in the education and health departments, soon after the two departments started doing good work.

""But Manish (Sisodia) and Satyendar (Jain) ensured that these officers worked. Only we know how we handled the dictatorship of the Centre. They also used all possible agencies against us including the police and CBI to humiliate us,"" Mr Kejriwal said, adding that the Centre also used the Income Tax department and the ED against them.

Mr Kejriwal added that the work done by the party and the government in Delhi was no less than a miracle.

""The Delhi government, which is going to complete four years soon, has done some work which the other political parties were not able to do even after being in power for 15-20 years. The BJP is in power for past 22 years in Gujarat, compare the government schools in the state with that of Delhi. The work the Congress and the BJP could not do in 70 years, we have done in just three years.""

Mr Kejriwal said that the nation can become number one in the world if a good party comes to power at the Centre.

He said the formation of the party was not an end to the revolution.

""Our fight will continue and we should be ready to dedicate ourselves to the nation and the cause. The challenge before us is big,"" he added."

Judge Achintya Malla Bujor Barua, in his order passed last week, said students from backward communities are required to be given special care and attention in higher education institutes so that they overcome their deficiencies and for competing with the others. ""The petitioner be allowed to pursue his studies further. During the tenure of the opportunity given to the petitioner, the respondent in the IIT-G shall also give him extra care and attention, as provided by the Supreme Court, so as to enable him to perform better,"" the judge ordered.

The student, Amit Kumar Khoiwal of Bhilwara district, was admitted to BTech degree course at IIT-G after he cleared the Joint Entrance Examination in 2011. But he could not perform well in the Semester-I examination and his Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) of 1.67 was far below the minimum CPI of 4. He did not fare any better in Semester II examination but was still allowed to register for the third semester. He could not score above CPI 4 in the 3rd semester as well but was again was allowed to register himself for the 4th semester where he again failed to cross the minimum CPI.

In 2013, IIT-G authorities issued a letter of termination, informing him that his name would be struck off from the rolls of the institute. He made an appeal, which was disallowed. But later, the authorities allowed him to join the 5th semester and 6th semester, where he again performed poorly.

The petition says that in Semester VII also, the petitioner could not obtain a CPI of 4 and secured 2.27 but was again, after appeals, allowed to be registered for Semester VIII, where again he fell below the required CPI.

In Semester IX, when the same thing happened, the authorities did not allow him to register for semester X.

""In the aforesaid background, the claim of the petitioner for being reinstated was given consideration at the 135th meeting of the Senate of IIT-Guwahati held on 07.09.2018. As per the minutes of the Senate, a conclusion was arrived that despite several opportunities being given, the petitioner had failed to show any improvement in his academic performance and the concerned department had also not recommended in his favour for reinstatement and secondly, the Senate did not find any merit to decide the appeal in favour of the petitioner,"" the court observed.

The petitioner moved the high court relying on an earlier judgement of Supreme Court in Avinash Singh Bagri and Ors.-vs-Registrar of IIT Delhi in 2009 and contended that he is a person belonging to the SC community and he is similarly situated as the petitioner before the Supreme Court in the earlier judgment.

Justice Malla Barua, in his order, noted, ""In the judgment by the Supreme Court, a proposition was laid that a candidate from a backward class is entitled to special care and attention, more particularly in an institution of higher education like that of IIT, so that they are able to overcome their inherent disadvantage to compete at that level. In the instant case, it is taken note of that the petitioner, who is from a SC community in Rajasthan, belongs to a backward community and may also have an inherent disadvantage of competing in an institute of higher education like that of IIT.""

The judge added, ""Following the proposition laid down by the Supreme Court, we are of the view that students like that of the petitioner, if so requires, are required to be given some special care and attention in the institute so that they are able to overcome their inherent deficiencies and are able to compete with others.""

The court stated that there was nothing on record to indicate that special care and attention was given to the petitioner in spite of having fared badly in all the examinations.

On December 14, complying with an order of the court, authorities of IIT-Guwahati informed the petitioner that he is being granted a further opportunity to continue with his studies by providing certain conditions therein that he shall undertake all the efforts required to come out successful in the course."

The agriculture department estimates the loan waiver to cost Rs 35,000 crore.

The first scheme to face the axe was the Deendayal Vananchal Yojna that provided health and education facilities to forest dwellers. On December 24, the Kamal Nath government issued an order scrapping the scheme on procedural grounds--the absence of approval from the finance department. The state spent about Rs 5.50 crore in the last financial year on the scheme introduced in 2016, according to forest department officials.

""We are compiling all the schemes introduced by the previous government and the money spent on these schemes. The status report will be presented before the state cabinet to take a call,"" said a senior officer familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.

The previous government introduced several schemes such as the Sambal Yojna, Mukhyamantri Teerth Darshan Yojna, Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojna, Ladli Laxmi Yojna, and Krishak Samridhi Yojna targeted at senior citizens, women, farmers, poor households and students.

Under the Sambal scheme, the government provides electricity at a flat rate of Rs 200 a month to labourers from the unorganised sector and farmers having up to five acres land; it reimburses the power distribution companies if the monthly bill is over Rs 200. As a result, the government has to spend about Rs 150 crore per month. At least 20 million people have registered for the scheme.

""There is concern of excessive consumption of power by beneficiaries. The new government will have to look into the same"", said an official in the energy department who asked not to be named.

Jayant Malaiya, finance minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party government, said: ""The schemes of the previous government may be affected as the new government may not have adequate funds after waiving the loans of farmers. If the loans are really waived, the government may not have money for other schemes and infrastructure of the state may also suffer.""

Government officials said the problem the new state government is confronting is that it may not be able to scrap or modify many of Chouhan's schemes for fear of alienating people before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Principal secretary, finance, Anurag Jain declined to comment on how the government will meet its requirement of funds to waive the farmers' loans.

Economist Jayantilal Bhandari said, ""The government may scrap some of the previous government's schemes. At the same time, it may look into tourism, industries, skill and development to generate more funds. But given the huge amount of debt and lack of balance in income and expenditure, its a huge task in the government's hands at present to fulfil its promise.""

State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, ""There is no problem in arranging money for the loan waiver, though the previous government left the treasury empty. The previous government spent most of funds on rallies, events and advertisements. With fiscal discipline and revenue realisation, the government can manage the funds."""

Pandya, who is a known structural engineering expert of Gujarat, was denied promotion since 2014 by a group that has been enjoying a brute majority in the syndicate body.

The syndicate body accepted the report of the committee of former vice-chancellor of Gujarat University professor M N Patel and resolved to promote Pandya as a professor under the career advancement scheme. The probe committee was constituted by the state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama in December 2016. Pandya's promotion will be effective from December 2010.

It was in 2011 that Pandya had cleared the interview for his promotion and the committee had recommended that he be promoted. But the selection committee's report was tabled in the syndicate meeting only in September 2014, but later withdrawn under pressure from the majority group. It was claimed that the promotion was denied on the grounds that Pandya did not fulfill the requirements laid down by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).

On the basis of series of representations made by Pandya including that to Gujarat governor O P Kohli and a series of ministers, the state education department had written several letters asking the university to rethink the decision. But as the university blatantly ignored directives of the state government, a group of BJP MLAs - Yogesh Patel, Jitendra Sukhadiya and Ketan Inamdar - started rallying behind Pandya and had even decided to join dharna program outside MSU head office in December 2016.

High drama was witnessed on Saturday too before the syndicate meeting commenced as the three BJP MLAs reached the university head office demanding that the issue be resolved today. The MLAs were of the opinion that if a state government's probe committee had submitted its report long back then why the university was not acting on it.

It was then that Chudasama himself appointed a probe committee headed by Patel. The committee had submitted its report in January 2017, but it was not placed before the syndicate until on Saturday.

The exhibition society has asked the Metro Rail authorities to increase the frequency of its services between Miyapur -Exhibition Grounds and LB Nagar during the Numaish period.

According to sources, administrative secretaries of over half a dozen departments recently met the Chief Secretary for devising modalities for merging the departments including State Sports Council, Horticulture, Animal and Sheep Husbandry and Technical Education.

The government is also mulling to create a new department for maintenance of all water bodies and irrigation projects by bifurcating the Public Health Engineering (PHE) and Irrigation and Flood Control department, sources said.

They said the PHE would be left with the mandate of providing drinking water facilities to the people while the new department would look after irrigation, flood control and maintenance of all water bodies including those being looked after by the Housing and Urban Development, Forest and Tourism departments.

The Agriculture department is likely to be mandated with its erstwhile departments of Animal and Sheep Husbandry and Horticulture departments, which over the years were severed from the department by the previous State governments.

The Youth Services and Sports department is also likely to take over the Sports Council department, which would be disbanded as a separate identity.

The intermingling mandate of the two departments had led to a feud between the Sports Council and Youth Services and Sports ministry during the previous Peoples Democratic Party-Bharatiya Janata Party led government.

The Youth Services and Sports department then led by former Peoples Democratic Party leader Imran Reza Ansari had run into a showdown with the then Sports Council Secretary Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra.

Keeping in view the similar mandate and work, the government has now decided to merge the Sports Council with the Youth Services and Sports department.

Similarly, the Technical Education department is also likely to be brought under the diocese of the Higher Education department to streamline the sector post higher secondary level.

The government's decision comes in the backdrop of expected shortage of administrative secretaries in the administration next year as two dozen officers of the Indian Administrative Service and Kashmir Administrative Service are due to retire next year.

An official said the decision of merger is also being taken in view of previous month's meetings of the committee on the languishing projects.

During those meetings, the pivotal reason for delay in projects was attributed to multiple control of similarly-mandated departments.

The government is also contemplating to create a single department for international funding of the development projects in the State on the lines of the other states.

Currently every department in the State has been pursuing the internationally-funded projects in their sector on their own including the projects funded by Asian Development Bank, World Bank and other global financial organisations."

Directions to schools on air quality

Making schools the nodal points for protecting children from the 'severe' air quality in the city, heads of all Delhi government and government-aided schools have been directed to appeal to parents to restrain their children from participating in outdoor activities and sensitise them on the air-pollution scenario.

This is following directions by the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority for Delhi and NCR to the Directorate of Education to do so, owing to poor air quality.

Creating a record of sorts, the municipal corporation completed five mega projects, including three underpasses and two flyovers to ease traffic congestion in different areas of the city, in just one year under Strategic Road Development Programme (SRDP).

The year 2018 began with the launch of Ayyappa Society underpass in January for GHMC. Living up to the expectations of the State Government and the citizens, the municipal corporation has completed four other much-needed projects, including the Mindspace underpass (April), Chintalkuna underpass (May), Kamineni LHS Flyover (July) and Mindspace flyover (November).

Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister KT Rama Rao, during the launch of Ayyappa Society underpass, had announced that this was just the beginning and 2018 would be the year of execution and, accordingly, five projects were completed.

After the launch of Metro services on the Ameerpet-LB Nagar route on September 24 this year, commuting has become bit easy for many passengers in the city.

L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad is now operating a train for every six minutes on the Miyapur-LB Nagar route (8 am to 12 noon and 5 pm to 9 pm). A train is being operated for every seven minutes on the route during non-peak hours (12 noon to 5 pm).

Hyderabad Metro Rail crossed 30 million cumulative ridership milestone in just 351 days after the commercial operations were launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 28, 2017.

The striking aspect is that the ridership increased from 20 million to 30 million in a mere 71 days. With 46 kms of Metro operations, Hyderabad Metro Rail is now the second largest Metro service in the country after Delhi Metro Rail.

Buoyed with the response, Metro officials are now working hard to launch the services on the Ameerpet-Hitec City route at the earliest.

Hyderabad drew national attention for many reasons this year. Among the many, Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board's exclusive Rain Water Harvesting Theme Park in Jubilee Hills and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation's first-of-its-kind Dog Park at Kondapur garnered attention of many nationally and are already a big hit with people.

Impressed with the initiatives taken by both the organisations, different departments from across the country are visiting the parks and drawing plans to replicate the same in their respective cities.

Kanpur Development Authority vice-chairman Kinjal Singh, along with a couple of others, visited the HMWSSB's rain water theme park at Jubilee Hills and complimented the good work done in Hyderabad.

Launched in August of this year, Kanti Velugu scheme in the State has not only identified eye-related ailments among the population but also has set a blueprint for the soon-to-be-launched universal health profile of every citizen in the State. All the health authorities in Telangana State now have to do is to simply replicate the Kanti Velugu scheme for other diseases.

The sheer scale of Kanti Velugu scheme is quite mind-boggling. For instance, between this August and December, over 8,000 healthcare workers in the State have covered a record 1.13 crore persons who underwent basic eye screening in as many as 6,603 villages in the State.

Perhaps, this is for the first time in the country that such a large cross-section of population has participated in eye screening. In the process, through the Kanti Velugu scheme, 18,36,303 beneficiaries received reading glasses. The mega eye-screening camp also identified 7,39,047 persons who were eventually referred to secondary and tertiary care facilities in the State.

The Telangana State took a major step towards strengthening medical education when the Centre gave its nod to set up All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at Bibinagar in April of this year. The sector also got a boost when Telangana received green signal to set up four more medical colleges, each in Mahabubnagar, Siddipet, Nalgonda and Suryapet.

While it takes at least four to five years, and sometimes even more, to actually operationalise AIIMS following Centre's approval, the health authorities here are looking at a possible start of the academic year from 2019 itself. All this is possible because of the presence of a NIMS Bibinagar hospital building, which was constructed at a cost of Rs 80 crore, spread over a campus of 160 acre. Already, authorities here have handed over 200 acres of land, including the NIMS hospital building, to the Centre at Bibinagar for AIIMS project.

The AIIMS will be completely run by the Ministry of Health, Medical and Family Welfare (MOHFW), New Delhi, and is set to play an influential role as a teaching hospital and research centre in Telangana State.

Facial Recognition System (FRS), a first-of-its-kind technology-driven initiative, was introduced by the State police in 2018 for detecting crime.

Kaleshwaram lift irrigation witnessed massive work turnout this year as six major works - lifts and barrages at Medigada, Sundilla and Annaram - were initially scheduled to be completed by the year end. Despite floods in Godavari that resulted in disruptions impacting the work progress, the implementation agencies have completed the key components of the six works barring concrete laying on the spill ways of the barrages.

Chief Minister, K Chandrasekhar Rao, who had a marathon review on the project works recently, pointed out the tardy progress in certain packages. The concrete pour on the Medigadda barrage spill way is in progress without any break for the past one week. All the three barrages and three lift irrigation schemes that are part of the multi-package integrated irrigation project will be completed in the next 90 days, according to the Project Chief Engineer, N Venkateswarlu.

The State government's decision to suspend a public information commissioner (PIO) for allegedly providing wrong information on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship bullet train project is setting a wrong precedent for public servants, Right to Information activists warned on Saturday.

Former Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) Shailesh Gandhi said, ""The government must provide the necessary documentation to back its decision to suspend PIO Sarangkumar Patil of the State Home Department or else it will only be seen as sending out the message that State officials handing over information not favourable to the government will be severely dealt with.""

Mr. Gandhi told The Hindu, ""If the Maharashtra government feels that the PIO has provided wrong information, it must make public minutes of the meeting or dates when the meeting [of the Cabinet sub-committee on the project] actually took place. Or else this decision will be considered a fiasco.""

On Friday, Mr. Patil was suspended for giving information regarding a meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee set up to monitor progress of the flagship rail project. According to the information provided to applicant Jeetendra Ghadge on September 29, no meeting of the committee had taken place ever since it was set up.

The sub-committee members include the Chief Minister; Minister for Revenue, Relief and Rehabilitation, and Public Works Department Chandrakant Patil; Minister for Education Vinod Tawde; and Transport Minister Diwakar Raote. Mr. Raote was quoted in the media saying he was not aware of ""any sub-committee and do not remember attending anything pertaining to it.""

Mr. Ghadge said if the government has suspended the PIO for giving the ""wrong"" information, it must also suspend Mr. Raote for giving the same information. As per the documents verified, there is no record of any meetings or minutes of the same on the files, Mr. Ghadge said.

""In my inspection, I did not find a single sheet of paper mentioning the meeting. If the government is suspending the PIO for the information on that basis, it must give dates when these meetings took place,"" he said. The RTI activist said the suspension was simply a pressure tactic by the government to ""bully"" staff and prevent them from giving crucial information.

Meanwhile, State Chief Information Commissioner Sumit Mullick said it was the prerogative of the government to take action against erring officials. ""The CIC has no role in it and neither is it binding on the government to consult the CIC on this matter,"" he said.

Mr. Ghadge's RTI query raised serious questions on the economics of the project. A report of the State Transport Department was found, which highlighted several objections raised by State departments over the economic viability of the Shinkansen train, which could result in losses in the form of wasted Floor Space Index and delayed loan repayment in the absence of proper frameworks.

The train, with a capacity of 750 passengers, will travel at speeds between 320 km/hr and 350 km/hr and is expected to reduce travel time between Ahmedabad and Mumbai to three-and-a-half hours or less from the present eight. The project is expected to be completed in seven years."

Medical College, Davangere, are anxious over payments next year

Medical interns and postgraduate students of KMC (Mangaluru) and J.J. Medical College (Davangere), who will start working in the State-run Chigateri and Wenlock hospitals from next year, are worried over payment of their stipends.

With the Medical Education Department stating that students studying under government quota should henceforth be paid by the colleges/hospitals (hitherto paid by the government), the students who will graduate and start interning from next year are not sure whether they will get the stipend.

In a letter dated October 30, the Additional Chief Secretary to Government (Medical Education) to the Director of Medical Education (DME) has directed payment of stipend to interns and postgraduate students under government quota only for the current year.

While medical interns are paid a monthly stipend of ₹20,000, postgraduate students are paid ₹30,000, ₹35,000 and ₹40,000 in their first, second and third years respectively.

Confirming this to The Hindu, DME P.G. Girish said from next year stipend payment to the ongoing batches has to done by the respective colleges/hospitals. ""As these hospitals are under the Health and Family Welfare Department and are attached to the two private medical colleges, so far the Health Department was funding the stipend through the Medical Education Department. But we do not want to intervene in the coming year and the matter now rests with the Health Department and the colleges. The colleges should pay the stipend and any violation or indiscipline will not be tolerated,"" the DME said.

However, M. Venkataraya Prabhu, Dean of KMC, Mangaluru, argued that the government's stand is contrary to a High Court order issued in 2001 which states stipend cannot be denied to ""postgraduate students working in government hospitals and attached to private medical colleges"". He said the college was paying for the current year, but it was too early to commit on the next year. ""Higher authorities will take a call,"" he said.

Sources said the Medical Education Department wants the Health Department to deal with the issue as the students from the two private medical colleges have aided the healthcare services at the hospitals.

Issue raised by CAG

Jawaid Akthar, Principal Secretary (Medical Education and Health and Family Welfare), said stipend payment to students in private colleges by the government has become an issue following an objection raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).

In October this year, medical interns and postgraduate students under government quota from these colleges had protested as their stipend had not been paid for eight months. The issue, which had earlier surfaced in 2017, was resolved after the DME released funds."

The Minister also said that the BJP government's decision to provide bicycles of saffron colour to students, posting RSS-affiliated officers in various Boards and Councils and changing the school curriculum with distortion of history would be shortly reviewed.

The Vasundhara Raje government had started carrying out revision of textbooks in 2015-16 as part of ""curriculum restructuring"" by the State Institute of Educational Research & Training, Udaipur.

The main emphasis was on slashing the contributions of Congress leaders of the Independence era, with the deletion of any references to Nehru, Sarojini Naidu, Madan Mohan Malaviya and other freedom fighters.

Later, the then Education Minister Vasudev Devnani carried forward the agenda by making changes in medieval history, for which textbooks for Classes I to VIII were rewritten with focus on ""Indian culture"". The traditional title of ""Great"" was removed from Mughal Emperor Akbar's name, 'Surya Namaskar' was made compulsory and the ancient Indian scientific discoveries were explained with greater prominence in the textbooks.

The agriculture department estimates the loan waiver to cost Rs 35,000 crore.

The first scheme to face the axe was the Deendayal Vananchal Yojna that provided health and education facilities to forest dwellers. On December 24, the Kamal Nath government issued an order scrapping the scheme on procedural grounds --- the absence of approval from the finance department. The state government spent about Rs 5.50 crore in the last financial year on the scheme introduced in 2016, according to forest department officials.

""We are compiling all the schemes introduced by the previous government and the money spent on these schemes. The status report will be presented before the state cabinet to take a call,"" said a senior officer familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.

The previous government introduced several schemes such as the Sambal Yojna, Mukhyamantri Teerth Darshan Yojna, Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojna, Ladli Laxmi Yojna, and Krishak Samridhi Yojna targeted at senior citizens, women, farmers, poor households and students.

Under the Sambal scheme, the government provides electricity at a flat rate of Rs 200 a month to labourers from the unorganised sector and farmers having land of up to five acre; it reimburses the power distribution companies if the monthly bill is over Rs 200. As a result, the government has to spend about Rs 150 crore per month. At least 20 million people have registered to avail of the scheme introduced in July.

""There is concern of excessive consumption of power by beneficiaries. The new government will have to look into the same"", said an official in the energy department who asked not to be named.

Jayant Malaiya, finance minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party government, said: ""The schemes of the previous government may be affected as the new government may not have adequate funds after waiving the loans of farmers. If the loans are really waived, the government may not have money for other schemes and infrastructure of the state may also suffer.""

Government officials said the problem the new state government is confronting is that it may not be able to scrap or modify many of Chouhan's schemes for fear of alienating people before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Principal secretary, finance, Anurag Jain declined to comment on how the government will meet its requirement of funds to waive the farmers' loans.

Economist Jayantilal Bhandari said, ""The government may scrap some of the previous government's schemes. At the same, it may look into the areas like tourism, industries, skill development etc to generate more funds. But given the huge amount of debt and lack of balance in income and expenditure, it's a huge task in the government's hands at present to fulfil its promise.""

State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, ""There is no problem in arranging money for the loan waiver, though the previous government left the treasury empty. The previous government spent most of funds on rallies, events and advertisements. With fiscal discipline and revenue realisation, the government can manage the funds."""

Mysuru: Two extraordinary individuals who went out of their way to face the challenges posed by the unprecedented floods and landslides which struck Kodagu this August, have shared the title of 'Coorg Person of the Year- 2018.'

The winners are Kolera Zaru Ganapathy, Chairperson, Sai Shankar Educational Institutions, Ponnampet and Chennai-based industrialist Ashok Kumar Shetty, owner of Sincona Estate.

Kodagu's first news portal www.coorgtourisminfo.com promoted by Journalist P.T. Bopanna picked these two persons jointly for the title of 'Coorg Person of the Year' after a poll conducted on behalf of the portal.

The year 2018 has been one of the most difficult years for Kodagu in living memory due to the unprecedented floods, death and devastation which ripped apart vast landmasses triggered by landslides. Under the circumstances, the choice for the Coorg Person title had to be from among those who played a critical role in reaching out to the victims of landslides. There were many people who came out of their comfort zones to rescue and offer help to the victims.

The Kodagu district administration and Central government agencies played a crucial role in the rescue efforts in the initial days of the landslides. Zilla Panchayat member Abdul Latif from Suntikoppa donated one acre of land to build houses for flood victims.

When educationist Zaru Ganapathy heard about the extent of the tragedy from one of his staff members stuck in his village following the landslides, he initially announced that he would take 25 students in his residential school. Gradually, parents of more children starting approaching him.

Speaking to this reporter, Ganapathy said: ""Seeing their desperate condition, I could not say 'no' to them. Meanwhile, several NGOs and individuals came forward to provide uniforms, provisions and other requirements. A mere WhatsApp message listing out the requirements, received prompt response from donors.""

Ganapathy said there were 130 students at present from the affected villages who are accommodated in the residential school. ""We are giving them free education. We are ready to look after them for another three years. They are living with the regular boarders and eating the same food. We have not segregated them.""

The second Coorg Person of the Year is Chennai-based Ashok Kumar Shetty, owner of Sincona Estate, on Madikeri-Somwarpet Highway, near Makkandur.

A 450 metre-long stretch of the Highway was washed away due to landslides, forcing villagers and students to trek through hills to reach their homes. Taking pity on the plight of the villagers, Shetty offered nearly two acres of his land to the Public Works Department for restoring the Highway link."

MLA and former Minister S.A.

The British ruled the country for over 200 years and destroyed and looted the nation, while Germans came and took away nearly seven lakh palm scripts. They also encourage the study of Sanskrit in Germany, whereas in our own country, the demand for the subject is almost nil, he regretted.

In fact the Vedic Science laid the foundation for Science, for the whole world to follow. Prime Minister Narendra Modi keeping this in mind has encouraged the students to take up science with a renewed vigour and these Inspire Awards are a part of that movement, he said.

Students from Mysuru and Bengaluru regions are participating in the exhibition. Out of this 15 per cent from each region will be selected to participate at the national-level. Each student, who is selected, is given Rs.10,000 to present the model at the District and State-level."

In May 2016, Nehru's name was dropped from Class VIII textbooks in the state, both as our first prime minister and as a prominent leader of our freedom struggle. Then, Gehlot and Sachin Pilot were quick to lash out at Vasundhara Raje's government.

The textbook revisions were carried under BJP government as part of ""curriculum re-structuring"" by the State Institute of Education Research and Training (SIERT), Udaipur.

Before these changes were made, the chapter on 'National Movement' had Nehru prominently in a box titled 'Major Leaders of National Movement'. However, in the revised chapter there is no mention of Nehru, Sarojini Naidu, Madan Mohan Malviya or other freedom fighters.

Reacting to the omission of Nehru from the textbook, Rajasthan Congress president Sachin Pilot had earlier told The Indian Express: ""This is taking saffronisation to the next level.

Accusing the Central government of scanning over 400 files related to the Delhi government, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday dared Prime Minister Narendra Modi to show four files of the Centre, including those of Sahara-Birla and Rafale.

Addressing the National Council Meeting of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Kejriwal also said through repeated examinations and scanning, Modi gave the AAP government in Delhi a certificate of honesty.

""The Centre took and examined our 400 files to find irregularities, but could not find any. Modi himself gave us a certificate of honesty. I always say if PM Modi shows us four of his files, he will end up landing in jail,"" Kejriwal said.

""You took our 400 files, show us Sahara-Birla and Rafale files and we can send you to jail with just these two files,"" he challenged Modi.

He said that the BJP in the past four years has not left any stone unturned to ensure that the AAP government could not perform.

""I don't see anywhere in the country or in the world that a Chief Minister elected by the people could not even transfer a peon working under him. The Centre holds the power to transfer the officers but we have been asked to make them work. The public has voted for us, but powers are with the Centre.""

He said that the Central government posted the worst officers in the education and health departments, soon after the two departments started doing good work.

""But Manish (Sisodia) and Satyendar (Jain) ensured that these officers worked. Only we know how we handled the dictatorship of the Centre. They also used all possible agencies against us including the police and CBI to humiliate us,"" Kejriwal said, adding that the Centre also used the Income Tax department and the ED against them.

Kejriwal, in his speech, mentioned Anna Hazare and said he is following Anna's lessons.

The party head also said that the Congress too is against the AAP.

""It is not the BJP which is against us, but also the Congress. Whenever there were raids on us, the Congress workers were the first ones to celebrate,"" he said.

Kejriwal added that the work done by the party and the government in Delhi was no less than a miracle.

""The Delhi government, which is going to complete four years soon, has done some work which the other political parties were not able to do even after being in power for 15-20 years. The BJP is in power for past 22 years in Gujarat, compare the government schools in the state with that of Delhi. The work the Congress and the BJP could not do in 70 years, we have done in just three years.""

He said that the party workers should be proud of the party and its work.

""Whenever you meet a BJP or Congress worker, just ask them to compare the schools in their state and in Delhi.""

He accused the two parties -- BJP and Congress -- of not doing any work in 70 years.

Kejriwal said that the nation can become number one in the world if a good party comes to power at the Centre.

He said the formation of the party was not an end to the revolution.

Praveen has been relieved from examination duties for two years and a fine of Rs.20,000 imposed, at the Syndicate Meeting of University of Mysore held here yesterday.

The Syndicate Members who felt that Prof. Praveen had shown negligence in printing the questions papers which were a repeat of the 2017 first semester exam, have not only taken this decision but also decided to hold the re-examination related to M.Ed first semester exam on Jan.6.

It was decided in the Syndicate meeting to impose a fine of Rs.20,000 on Prof. Praveen and not to allow him to participate in setting up question papers, printing and evaluation of answer scripts, said University of Mysore Vice Chancellor Prof. G. Hemantha Kumar who chaired the meeting.

Digital University

The meeting also decided to convert the University of Mysore into a Digital University by 2020 by computerising all its teaching and non-teaching Departments.

Already, a software has been developed and the university staff will undergo training for this purpose.

Since Vice-Chancellor Prof. Hemantha Kumar himself is from the Computer Science Department, the University will be digitalised very soon, said a Syndicate Member who participated in the meeting, expressing his confidence.

At every stage 'e-method' will be adopted and including approval and sanctions will all be done digitally. Right from the clerks, Deputy Registrars, Registrars and the Vice-Chancellor will all have to work through 'soft copy' process.

Once the process is digitalised, then everything will be seen on the computer and approvals and sanctions can be given sitting in the same place thus dispensing with file movements from chamber to chamber.

Thus University of Mysore will become the first 'paperless' office in the country. Already the technical development regarding this is in its final stages and both the teaching and non-teaching staff will be trained to use the digital format.

Various teachers associations particularly Tamil Nadu Government Colleges Teachers Association (TNGCTA) and Association of University Teachers (AUT) were demanding the government to create a post of professors in colleges.

During the recent meeting with the Director of Collegiate Education, TNGCTEA office bearers were informed that the Directorate of Collegiate Education has sent a proposal to the government for creating the post.

They were also informed that the selection procedure mentioned in the University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines may be made applicable to professors in private colleges, including government-aided colleges. Association of University Teachers (AUT) vice president N Pasupathy said, ""There are certain guidelines for promotion of assistant professor to associate professor and then to professor. If an associate professor completes three years of service, they will be eligible for promotion as professor.""

""According to the UGC PhD regulation, a professor can guide eight PhD scholars, whereas associate professor and an assistant professor can guide only six and four PhD scholars respectively. So, some of the private colleges have promoted some of their faculty members as professors to get a chance of admitting more PhD scholars. However, the universities are yet to approve these promotions,"" he added.

If the state government issues a G.O. accepting the University Grants Commission's 2018 regulation on faculty appointments and promotion, many of the problems which college teachers are facing will be solved, felt Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers Association president T Veeramani."

""I saw my friends bringing fidget spinners to school and playing with it, which is what prompted me to develop a game for free which can be played anytime and anywhere,"" said the 17-year-old student of Santa Cruz HSS, Fort Kochi.

He spends his free time coding, an interest he took up when he was just 16. The Infinite Spinner is the first app created by the teenager, who is always on a quest to develop more apps for people to enjoy.

""Just like a good reader can be a good writer, I believe a good coder can be a good software developer,"" said Sanjay.

""Sanjay is quite smart and talented, and coding is something he's been working on for a while now. We are willing to give him all the support he requires,"" said an ASAP member.

The Infinite Spinner app, which can be downloaded from the Google Play Store, allows the player to unlock a variety of designs and skins for their fidget spinners as they progress through the game and beat more levels.

Counselor's help was also not taken in this entire case. ASP Dinesh Kaushal told that on Tuesday evening, when the minor girl was cycling, she fell and was injured.

On Wednesday morning when mother was making her daughter bath, only then she saw signs of injury. When mother asked about the injury from daughter, she took the name of one of her classmates. After this the kin had taken the girl for treatment in AIIMS.

There the doctor also interrogated the child. But the doctor was also surprised by hearing that an 8 year old boy kidnapped her. But when she was asked about someone else's involvement in the incident besides the classmate, the baby girl shook her head.

Finally the case reached the police station. Then police had registered a case under various sections on 10 years old boy and on another. In the night, the girl's classmate was interrogated but he was unaware of the crime.

In which she informed that she fell down from bicycle. After this, the police have recorded statements under Section 164 in the court on Thursday.

According to ASP Kaushal, this case will not be concluded now. The whole matter will continue to be investigated closely. Since there was talk of involvement of an adult accused in this case, the police had immediately registered an FIR under serious sections.

Counseling was to be done, minor boy felt mental trauma

Archana Sahay, the director of the child line, says that in this case both the children had to be counseled. The big question is how can eight years old girl can allege about molestation, when she was injured after falling from bicycle?

Why did she take the name of her old classmate? At the same time, the 8 years old child also got hurt with mental trauma when he had been brought for brought for the interrogation on allegation of molestation.

""I don't see anywhere in the country or in the world that a Chief Minister elected by the people could not even transfer a peon working under him. The Centre holds the power to transfer the officers but we have been asked to make them work. The public has voted for us, but powers are with the Centre.""

He said that the Central government posted the worst officers in the education and health departments, soon after the two departments started doing good work.

""But Manish (Sisodia) and Satyendar (Jain) ensured that these officers worked. Only we know how we handled the dictatorship of the Centre. They also used all possible agencies against us including the police and CBI to humiliate us,"" Kejriwal said, adding that the Centre also used the Income Tax department and the ED against them.

""The Delhi government, which is going to complete four years soon, has done some work which the other political parties were not able to do even after being in power for 15-20 years. The BJP is in power for past 22 years in Gujarat, compare the government schools in the state with that of Delhi. The work the Congress and the BJP could not do in 70 years, we have done in just three years.""

He said that the party workers should be proud of the party and its work.

""Whenever you meet a BJP or Congress worker, just ask them to compare the schools in their state and in Delhi.""

He accused the two parties -- BJP and Congress -- of not doing any work in 70 years.

Kejriwal said that the nation can become number one in the world if a good party comes to power at the Centre.

He said the formation of the party was not an end to the revolution.

""Our fight will continue and we should be ready to dedicate ourselves to the nation and the cause. The challenge before us is big,"" he added.

BK Nandanoor: DDPI with a golden heart

A defunct government school at the remote Mallapur village in Raichur district in north Karnataka is now abuzz with activity, thanks to the efforts made by Deputy Director of Public Instruction (DDPI) B K Nandanoor. The school, which had shut its doors in August this year, started operating from December 18, and at least four children have resumed studies.Setting an example of a grassroots initiative, Nandanoor got the government school reopened after residents approached him.The school was shut after a teacher was suspended and the students dropped out, even though a new teacher was deputed. Nandanoor swung into action at once on December 17. Nandanoor says,""I read the admission list of the school and then set a target for visiting the students' houses. I visited all the houses.""

Karnataka High Court: Makeover moves for B'luru

Bengaluru's aesthetic beauty has been restored, city roads are free from potholes, and cleanliness has improved -- all thanks to the Karnataka High Court, which woke up BBMP from slumber. Acting on a batch of PILs, a division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari directed BBMP to preserve the city's visual appeal by removing illegal hoardings, flexes and banners. Due to this, new bye-laws are being evolved to regulate hoardings. BBMP officials even registered an FIR against Minister D K Shivakumar for not removing an unauthorised ad, despite being given time. Citizens also got relief from pothole-riddled roads and garbage piles in public areas. The court availed the assistance of Army engineers to check the quality of work done by BBMP.

Nanditha: The power of one student

Nanditha (11) gets the undivided attention of her teacher every day. The resident of Obenahalli in Kolar is the sole student in the Government Primary School. The school, which was shut down at the start of the year 2016-17 after most students left it for private institutions, was reopened on the insistence of Nanditha, her parents and well-wishers. Komala GK, Nanditha's teacher, recalled how her parents, who work as daily wage workers, came looking for her all the way to the new school where she was posted. ""I could see anger, fear and sadness in them. They asked me what their daughter should do with the school closed."" The government was forced to reopen the school at the start of the 2017-18 year and admit Nanditha. Now even when her teacher takes leave, another one is deputed.

Namma Thambis: Green warriors of Ulsoor Lake

On October 10 this year, over 1,000 Thambis of the Madras Sappers waded into the waters of Bengaluru's Ulsoor lake and fought a war against an invasion, and won it. The battle was against water hyacinth, a weed. Ulsoor lake, situated in the heart of the IT City,is also used by the Sappers for training. Tired of seeing their lifeline being suffocated owing to pollution, the Sappers took matter into their own hands. The soldiers,on boats, pulled out the waste using their bare hands. They also removed plastic waste, household rubbish and other garbage. At the end of the day, the Army also issued a wake-up call in their signature fashion, blunt and to the point: ""People should understand that it is not the business of the Army to become garbage cleaners.""

Ananya:Hero in the hills

Ananya Vasudev RM saved 15 families of Karike village in Kodagu district during this year's floods and subsequent landslides. Ananya Vasudev,an assistant lecturer of Geology at the National Institute of Technology, received a WhatsApp video from a friend which showed loud sound emanating from the ground. Ananya Vasudev asked his friend to send another video. After seeing the fresh video, he was sure the sound was due to soil piping and the area could see a landslide. Soil piping is a formation of voids within soil which causes internal erosion and seepage. He immediately spoke to Kodagu Deputy Commissioner Sreevidya who sent a team to the village and evacuated the families. As predicted by Ananya, the area saw a huge landslide a few hours later.

S B Vastradmath: Speedy justice his goal

Chitradurga district court judge S B Vastradmath has done his bit to ensure that the public reposes its faith in the judiciary by delivery of quick judgments. Recently, he was in new for sentencing a man who killed his wife to life imprisonment within 13 days of the crime. He pronounced another judgment within 11 days of the crime. In September, the judge delivered 153 judgments in 22 days without taking a day's leave. He has broken his own record of achieving 70 points in a single calender month, which was earlier set by him during his tenure as the Civil Judge (Jr division) at Molakalmuru. In the system to evaluate judges, a point is awarded for each judgment where the maximum is 70 points irrespective of the number of cases. Vastramath says awarding death penalty to 3 men accused of rape and torture of a woman in Kolar was his most memorable judgment.

Anita R:Lighting up cells

Inmates of Dharwad Central Jail have smiles on their faces now -- thanks to Jail Superintendent Anita R.Reason: She ensures that they, especially women, don't waste their time feeling guilty or unworthy. She has ensured that the inmates exhibit their talent and also earn some money when confined within the four walls of the jail. Each month, Anita comes up with unique programmes. From making diyas to undertaking a beautician's course to knitting winter wear, her ideas keep the inmates occupied. Men are sent to work in fields and run a vegetable shop within the Dharwad jail premises. They are taught baking too. Anita's measures have yielded results, with many inmates confessing that they have shown behavioural changes. Anita has more things planned for the inmates in 2019.

Ayub Ahmed: Dignified farewell mission

Meet Ayub Ahmed, who uses his own resources to shift unidentified and unclaimed bodies, and performs their last rites. This 38-year-old Mysuru resident has been carrying out this job for the past two decades. As soon as members of the public, hospitals or even the police inform him about unclaimed bodies, Ahmed reaches the spot in his old Ambassador car and takes the body. He works as a loader at the Mandi Mohalla Market in Mysuru. Though Ahmed has not kept an official count of the bodies that he has buried or cremated so far, Ahmed puts the figure at about 10,000. Ahmed posts photos of the bodies on his Facebook page in the hope of reaching out to the kin of the deceased. In absence of claims, he gets the paperwork done, after which he takes the unclaimed bodies to the graveyard and performs the last rites as per their religion.

Krishna Byregowda:Crusade against plastic

At a time when plastic water bottles were the norm in government offices, Rural Development Minister Krishna Byregowda decided to do away with them at his offices and meetings. He replaced the plastic bottles with glass tumblers and reusable water bottles. Byregowda even carries a personal water bottle to the Assembly and Council to avoid using plastic or paper cups. Each person who visits the minister's office is served water in a glass tumbler, unlike the popular practice in most government offices where water is given in plastic or paper cups. Such was the impact of his approach to the matter that the CM asked officials to refrain from distributing water in plastic bottles at all government events.

Randeep D: Official in public demand

That good work seldom goes unnoticed was proved in the case of IAS officer Randeep D, who was brought back as the Additional Commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) owing to public pressure after being shunted from the position. Randeep was transferred by an order signed by Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy as the Commissioner of Social Welfare Department. However, he had earned the confidence of waste management activists for his attempts to reform the ill-managed system in the city. Randeep was credited with setting up the Solid Waste Management control room, bringing proposals of GPS tracking of auto-tippers and compactors, and updating the microplan. Activists pointed out his role in implementation of standard operating with regarding BBMP's Animal Husbandry Department. This led citizens to launch an online campaign to demand his reinstatement. After the campaign got the support of about 1,000 people, Kumaraswamy had to take a relook at his decision.

Kempaiah: BEO answers the call

An inspiring act by the Block Education Officer of Bangarpet Taluk went a long way to show how personal involvement can improve the learning ambience for children. Kempaiah shocked the school administration authorities, as well as teachers and students during a visit to a Kannada Higher Primary School in the district -- he cleaned a blocked toilet. Kempaiah had decided to visit the school to see the conditions for himself after he received several complaints from parents about the unhygienic conditions in the classrooms and toilet. While checking the toilets, when he saw it blocked, he got to his knees and started cleaning it with a brush. He had expressed to TNIE that it was unfortunate that the teachers and anganwadi workers had not kept the school clean. The girls in the school were forced to walk to their homes in the village for toilet breaks during class hours.

Inscription Stones of Bangalore: Documenting city's history

A civic activism project, ""Inscription Stones of Bangalore"" aims at creating awareness about and protecting ancient stone inscriptions (shila shaasanas) found in the Bengaluru region. The group has discovered several new inscription stones and restored the neglected ones by relocating them to a respectful place. They have educated citizens through postcards, public talks, school visits, poster presentations and other group- funding initiatives. With the help of latest technology, they have created 3D models of critically-endangered stone inscriptions. This project follows in the footsteps of B L Rice, who between 1894 and 1905, documented the stones in his 12-volume book, Epigraphia Carnatica. The project also acts as a platform for interested Bengaluru residents to work towards conservation of these ancient stones, which speak a lot about the Garden City's rich cultural past."

The teachers at the IITs and other institutes across the country have been served with notices by the income tax department asking them to pay a levy for accommodation on campus.

Both government and non-government employees have to pay tax on prerequisite value when the employer provides accommodation. For non-government employees, the pre-requisite value is 15 per cent of the salary + 30 per cent tax.

Confirming the same, professor Errol D'Souza, Director, IIMA, said, ""Our issue is that everyone here has equal housing. Two people living in similar houses and paying different rent is not equal to the law. This will force faculty to stay outside the campus as the cost of staying on campus will be very high. This will impact educational outcomes as we have classes even at 8.00 pm and also hold surprise quizzes.""

""IIMA follows a gurukul system where everyone lives on the campus. If that goes away, we might not be producing industry ready students. One of the best advantages of our students is that they can be called in at any time. We believe it is bad in law as it does not treat equals equally. We have represented to the Ministry of Finance expressing our concerns over this and I must say the secretary has been very supportive,"" he added.

Citing an example of an IIT professor based in Delhi, he said, ""Fortunately or unfortunately, a professor in Delhi, doing consultancy, was asked to pay more than his salary. He eventually made a representation and now the authorities are looking into the situation more seriously.

A faculty member, requesting anonymity, said, ""We are a public institution and we were given housing as a perk. We never got an HRA and were paying the license fee for the housing. The new formula, if implemented, will compel us to move out of campus, which will impact education. Many a time, the faculty and students discuss projects at night after classes, which is only possible because we all live together on the campus.""

Another faculty member said, ""This is a stupid policy. While it will not impact faculty in cities like Mumbai where the cost of living outside the campus would be high, in small towns or a city like Ahmedabad, cost of living on campus would increase so much that a faculty would prefer to live outside the campus. This policy will discourage residential campuses in small cities.""

Unfortunately, IISC and IIM-Bangalore have agreed to pay. IIM-Calcutta went for advanced ruling and is not supposed to pay."

In a burst of early morning tweets, the president said the alternative to funding his controversial wall project would be total separation from Mexico -- including making US car companies pull out their factories based on the other side of the frontier.

The threat yet again upped the ante in a political row that has led to a partial shutdown of the US government and seems set to dominate the start to the third year of Trump's presidency.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall,"" Trump tweeted.

Trump said he would then take US-Mexican relations back to the days before the NAFTA agreement opened free trade across Canada, Mexico and the United States.

That would ""bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs,"" he said.

It was not clear how separating the two huge neighbors would work. Bilateral trade totaled an estimated $615.9 billion in 2017, according to US government figures.

Neither did Trump make any mention of the new free trade agreement, known as the USMCA, which he only recently signed with the two neighboring countries to replace NAFTA and which he has repeatedly praised as a huge boost for American commerce.

In Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador sidestepped Trump's threat, telling journalists: ""We don't want to be imprudent and we don't think we should get into this.""

$5 billion question

Trump wants $5 billion in funding for a wall along the more than 2,000-mile border, which he says is currently too porous to stop illegal immigration and which he claims has become a magnet for criminals, drugs and even terrorists.

Opponents -- especially in the Democratic party but also some in Trump's Republican party -- say that a physical wall is impractical and that the idea is being used as a political tool to whip up xenophobia in Trump's right-wing voter base.

Both sides have dug in. Democrats refuse to approve funding and the president -- who has made hardline immigration policies a centerpiece of his presidency -- has retaliated by refusing to sign off on a wider spending bill, leaving some 800,000 federal employees without pay.

Negotiations on lifting that partial government shutdown, perhaps by providing some border security funding, have sputtered out and no new debate is scheduled before next Wednesday.

The president, who had already scrapped a Christmas visit to his Florida golf resort, has also ""canceled his plans for New Year's,"" his incoming chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said on Fox News.

Asked about the startling rhetoric, Mulvaney told Fox that Trump ""is trying to draw light to the fact this is a crazy discussion to be having.""

For one Republican Congress member, Brad Wenstrup, the paralysis over the wall reflected ""a lot of political posturing.""

""I would hope that it could be ended soon,"" he told CNN television. ""If you sit down and talk about that, why is that such a hard thing to do?""

Caravan 'invasion'

Experts are divided on solutions to policing the long, often inhospitable border separating the world's biggest economy from the far poorer countries to its south.

Although there is a huge cross-border drug trade and immigrants often enter illegally, others have genuine claims for asylum. Central Americans are also deeply integrated in the US economy, often performing physically demanding, low-pay jobs in construction, agriculture and other vital sectors.

Trump has consistently painted the asylum seekers and economic migrants in outlandish terms, raising the specter of rapists, gang members and people with infectious diseases roaming freely across the border.

Trump has latched particularly on to what have become known as the ""caravans"" -- groups of several hundred or even more migrants who make epic treks across Central America and Mexico to try to reach the United States.

According to Trump, the ""caravans"" amount to organized attempts at invading the United States.

In one tweet Friday, Trump warned: ""word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it.""

As a result, he said, ""we will be cutting off all aid"" to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

The impoverished, often dangerous countries have long received American assistance to boost democracy, human rights, education and security.

But according to State Department figures, the aid is already dropping steeply.

Honduras is currently set to receive $65.7 million in 2019, down from $105.6 million in 2017, while Guatemala is slated for $69.4 million, down from $145 million.

El Salvador received $88 million in 2017 and is set for $45.7 million next year."

The year 2018 is ending with spectacular success of Indian scientists and technologists in space and defence sectors, with a series of high impact missions. But that's not all Indian scientists achieved in 2018. Several scientific developments, new techniques and promising technologies - in fields ranging from nanotechnology to space weather - made headlines during the year. Here is a collection of 15 such stories that gives a glimpse of important developments reported by Indian scientists during the year.

A gel that can protect farmers from toxic pesticides

Most farmers do not wear any protective gear while spraying chemicals in fields, which often leads to pesticide exposure and toxicity. Scientists at the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Bangalore have developed a protective gel - poly-Oxime - that can be applied on skin and can break down toxic chemicals into safe substances, preventing them from going deep into the skin and organs like the brain and the lungs. The research group plans to develop a mask that can deactivate pesticides.

World's thinnest material with novel technique

Pushing the envelope in nanotechnology, researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar have developed a material that is 100,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. They synthesized a two-dimensional material of just one-nanometer thickness (a human hair is about 80,000 nanometer wide) using Magnesium diboride - a compound of boron. This is said to be the world's thinnest material . It can find a range of applications - from next-generation batteries to ultraviolet absorbing films.

Gene editing applied to banana genome

Using the gene editing technique - CRISPR/Cas9 - researchers at the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute, Mohali have edited the banana genome . This is the first such work in any fruit crop in India. Banana is a the fourth most important food crop after wheat, rice and corn in terms of gross value of production. Gene editing could be deployed for improving nutritional quality, agronomical important traits as well as pathogen resistance in banana.

Discoveries to tackle Zika, dengue, JE and chikungunya

The National Brain Research Centre (NBRC) at Manesar has figured out cellular and molecular mechanisms that show how Zika virus causes microcephaly or small head size in babies. Researchers discovered that envelop protein of zika virus affects proliferation rates of human neural stem cells and promotes premature but faulty neuron formation. Another study led by scientist at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad has identified a key protein which helps dengue as well as Japanese Encephalitis viruses replication inside human body by inhibiting anti-viral cytokines. This finding could pave way for development of targeted drugs for dengue and JE. For detecting Chikungunya, a group of researchers from Amity University, Noida, Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi and Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, have developed a biosensor using molybdenum disulphide nanosheets .

Faster diagnostic tests for tuberculosis

Scientists at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi have jointly developed highly sensitive and rapid tests for detection of tuberculosis infection in lungs and surrounding membranes. Unlike current tests that use antibodies for detection of bacterial proteins in sputum samples, new tests use Aptamer Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA) and Electrochemical Sensor (ECS) for detection of a bacterial protein in the sputum.

Arsenic found in Punjab groundwater

Till now arsenic was a major problem in West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Chhattisgarh. It was also known that there is arsenic contamination in groundwater in Punjab. Now a new study done by New Delhi-based TERI School of Advanced Studies has found that that Punjab's floodplains are severely affected by arsenic contamination . In some wells, arsenic levels were found to be 20 to 50 times higher than WHO prescribed limit.

Space weather warning model rules out 'mini ice age'

A team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata have dismissed the speculation that the upcoming sunspot cycle is going to be stronger, based on calculations using a model developed by them. The near-Earth and inter-planetary space environmental conditions and solar radiative forcing of climate over the upcoming sunspot cycle 25 will likely be similar or marginally more extreme relative to what has been observed during the past decade over the current solar cycle. The method makes it possible to make predictions almost a decade before the next sunspot cycle activity peaks in strength.

New tool developed for autism screening

In many cases, autism is misdiagnosed as mental retardation and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Early identification and interventions may help children with autistic disorders. To help this process, scientists at the Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, have developed an Indian tool for screening children for autism. The Chandigarh Autism Screening Instrument (CASI) is designed to help community health workers to carry out initial screening for autism.

Hope for Alzheimer's, Huntington's

Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have figured out the way memory deficit develops in early stages, resulting in Alzheimer's disease . They have found that early breaking down of a protein, fibrillar actin or F-actin, in the brain leads to disruption in communication among nerve cells and consequently memory deficits. This knowledge can be used to develop early diagnosis test in future. In another study done in fruit flies, researchers at Department of Genetics at Delhi University South Campus found that it was possible to restrict the progression of Huntington's disease by increasing insulin signaling in the brain neuronal cells.

Green technique can address Plaster of Paris pollution

A team of scientists at Pune-based National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) has developed a technique that helps recycle Plaster of Paris waste from hospitals in an eco-friendly and economical way. The new technique disinfects waste and converts it into useful products like ammonium sulphate and calcium bicarbonate. The technique can also be used to disintegrate PoP waste from idols immersed in water bodies.

Stone Age tools, genetic studies throw new light on peopling of India

The Stone Age tools discovered in a village near Chennai suggest that a Middle Palaeolithic culture was present in India around 385,000 years ago -- roughly the same time that it is known to have developed in Africa and in Europe. The discovery pushes back the period when populations with a Middle Palaeolithic culture may have inhabited India, and challenges popular theory that the Middle Palaeolithic was brought to India by modern humans dispersing from Africa only around 125,000 years ago or later. In the North, population genetic study has revealed that the Rors who inhabit modern Haryana came to the Indus Valley when it was flourishing during the Bronze Age and inducted West Eurasian genetic ancestry

Sikkim gets real-time landslide warning system

A real-time landslide warning system has been set up in the Sikkim-Darjeeling belt of north-eastern Himalayas which is highly vulnerable to landslides. The warning system consists of over 200 sensors that can measure geophysical and hydrological parameters like rainfall, pore pressure and seismic activities. The system is capable of warning about 24 hours in advance. It has been deployed by researchers of Kerala-based Amrita University and Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority.

Computing capacity for weather forecasting gets a boost

During the year, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) upgraded its computing capacity for weather forecasting and climate monitoring, taking its total high performance computing (HPC) power to as high as 6.8 Petaflop. With this, India rose to the fourth position, next only to United Kingdom, Japan and USA in terms of dedicated capacity for HPC resources for weather and climate proposes.

Scientists use silk polymer to develop artificial vertebral disc

Scientists at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati developed a silk-based bioartificial disc that may find use in disc replacement therapy in future. The group has developed a fabrication procedure for a silk-based bioartificial disc adopting a ""directional freezing technique"". The disc mimics internal intricacy of human disc and its mechanical properties too are similar to those of the native ones. The use of a silk biopolymer to fabricate a biocompatible disc can reduce the cost of artificial discs in future.

Transgenic rice with reduced arsenic accumulation, flowering mustard

To address the problem of arsenic accumulation in rice grains, researchers at Lucknow- based CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute developed transgenic rice by inserting a novel fungal gene, which results in reduced arsenic accumulation in rice grain.They cloned Arsenic methyltransferase (WaarsM) gene from a soil fungus and inserted it into rice genome. In another study, TERI School of Advanced Studies has developed an early flowering transgenic variety of mustard.

His is a household name in Karnataka and his magnum opus was the first Kannada work to bring home a Jnanpith. This day, 29 December, marks the 114th birth anniversary celebrations of Kuppalli Venkatappa Puttappa or Kuvempu (his pen name), and tributes are galore.

The National School of Drama is presenting an adaptation of his epic novel, Malegalalli Madumagalu, with a nine-hour-long play, as the novel also enjoys a golden jubilee this year, alongside his Jnanpith-winning magnum opus Ramayana Darshanam. The Department of Posts also released a special cancellation postal cover to mark the golden jubilee of Kuvempu receiving the prestigious national award.

The virtual world too is rejoicing the life and works of the literary giant, with Google Doodle paying a tribute wherein the poet is seen seated in the lap of nature, putting pen to paper. The doodle, created by illustrators Upamanyu Bhattacharyya and Swati Shelar, has the word 'google' in Kannada letters and Kuvempu seated against the scenic backdrop of hills and lush green surroundings, aptly depicting him and his works in a single frame.

Novelist, playwright, critic, and thinker Kuvempu's contribution to Kannada is exemplary. Regarded as the greatest Kannada poet of the twentieth century, he played a great role in the mother-tongue education movement, spearheading it to make Kannada the medium of education, founded the Kannada Adhyayana Samsthe at the Mysore University to facilitate research in Kannada, which is now named after him as the Kuvempu Institute of Kannada studies. He is the one who penned the state anthem, 'Jai Bharata Jananiya Tanujate', and was honoured with the title of 'Rashtrakavi' in 1958 and Karnataka Ratna in 1992.

Kuvempu's House in Kuppalli (Vivek Urs/Wiki Commons)

While the poet's birth is being celebrated even a century or more after, his death is apparently the reason why the shelves of his home-turned-museum, which hold all the other awards, will never see his Padma Vibhushan medal that was stolen two years ago. The second-highest civilian award was conferred on him by the Government of India in 1988 and the medal was stolen in November 2015. The prime suspect on being arrested had said he may have lost it in the forests as he fled after stealing it, which led to a search operation in and around Kuppalli - all in vain.

As if the theft wasn't appalling enough, topped with the fact that even after two years, there seems to be no trace of it, the government's denial to issue a copy of it in its place, citing the reason as 'the recipient is not alive' is sad and disheartening, to say the least.

An appeal for a replica by the Rashtrakavi Kuvempu Pratishthana, which maintains the museum, was turned down by the Ministry of Home Affairs on grounds that the recipient was not alive.

Astonishing as it may sound, the ministry had said that it would have possibly considered if Kuvempu himself had asked for it. But, how? His writings may be immortal, but surely he isn't. So expecting him to rise from the dead just to get a 'replica' of something he didn't ask for but was honoured with, is rather strange and uncalled for."

Although the Uttar Pradesh basic education department has been talking about higher school enrolments, what takes away from their claims is the huge dropout rate witnessed in the state, especially at the elementary level.

Now, a primary school has decided to combat this issue in its own unique way. The school's 'Bal Sansad' is doubling up as the 'Santa squad' this festive season, conducting a door-to-door drive to get back dropouts and classmates who have been irregular.

Students of the primary school in village Lakhesar of Jaunpur district have used this Christmas to make guardians of their former classmates and other irregular students understand the importance of education. In this direction, they have also created a small informative pamphlet that urges parents to send their children to school.

Headmaster Ramesh Chandra Yadav said that one of the reasons why the dropout rate at the school was high was its location. ""The school is situated in a remote part and the terrain is tough. As a result, attendance and retention figures have been suffering.""

However, members of the 'Santa squad' are now out to change this.

Harshit of Class 5, president of the Bal Sansad, Saumya of Class 5, vice president, Vanshi of Class 4, health and hygiene minister, Anshika of Class 4, education minister, Chandni of Class 5, cultural minister and Sohani of Class 4, environment minister, have taken up the responsibility to get students back to school.

""On Christmas Day and since then, we have been going out in the afternoon, with our teachers Shivam Singh and Mukesh Dubey, to convince villagers to send their children to school,"" said Harshit and Saumya.

Chandni and Sohani added that it had been a learning experience for them as well -- convincing elders and classmates on how important it was to attend classes daily.

""In the process, the squad succeeded in bringing back12 students -- 10who had been irregular and two dropouts,"" informed Shivam Singh, teacher.

Appreciating the idea of forming a 'Santa squad', village head Nisha Tiwari has promised to help the school improve its infrastructure, including construction of better toilets and getting a projector to facilitate lectures. ""With her help, the school will soon have new and better facilities,"" said a teacher.

The headmaster said that the goal of the 'Santa squad' wasto build confidence among students and guardians, strengthen teacher-student relationship, create a positive atmosphere for promoting education, and improve student retention and attendance.

According to available data, the Net Enrolment Rate (NER) in UP at the elementary level is 79.86% -- 9 percentage points lower than the all India average of 88.94%. The state has an annual dropout rate of 8.58% at the primary level -- the 6th highest in the country and more than double the all India average of 4.13%.

""Our school is not something that is slipped on the educational process - our school of the 232 schools of Kharkiv is located on the 220-th place! There is no education, children of ZNO can not deliver - they have no proper knowledge"" - outraged one of the moms Olga Sichenko.

(HT File)

With some school headmasters (HMs) dragging their feet over paying penalties for allegedly inflating attendance of students, the Bihar government has finally decided to recover fines by deducting the amount from their salary.

The HMs allegedly spiked attendance of students to claim more funds under the mid-day meal(MDM) programme.

Though the government received reports of irregularities long ago and imposed financial penalty on HMs, the fines could not be fully recovered. Many of the HMs moved court for relief citing their unwanted involvement in non-academic work, while others were just indifferent.

The government has ordered the recovery of a Rs8.68-crore penalty from HMs. Of which, Rs 4.21-crore (48%) has been recovered. More than 1,000 HMs have allegedly fudged the data since 2013, when the idea of penalty was first mooted by the state education department.

RK Mahajan, principal secretary of the department of education, recently directed all district programme officers (DPOs) to deduct the penalty amount from headmasters' salary in five instalments over as many months.

""The DPOs must ensure a monthly deduction from all those who have not deposited the penalty amount within a month of the receipt of the letter, except those who have got stay from the court,"" stated a letter by Mahajan.

""During inspections, the attendance of that particular day in the school and the average of the previous week is matched. If the deviation is within 10%, there is no issue. However, if the deviation is above 10%, a penalty equivalent to the amount given in the last three months is imposed on the headmaster,"" said Vinod Kumar Singh, director of the mid-day meal programme, .

Another official said that in several cases, the accused HMs with the help of their association approached the Patna high court or the Lokayukta, claiming that they were overburdened with non-academic work like management of MDM. The court has also asked the government to find an alternative to free teachers from MDM responsibilities.

Though the Bihar government tried to hand over MDM to NGOs or self-help groups (SHGs) and also ran pilot projects, a viable alternative has not been found because of the scale of the programme. In Bihar, despite a drop in enrolment numbers, 1.20 crore students from Class 1 to Class 8 are estimated to avail MDM daily.

In a Niti Ayog meeting a few months ago, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar advocated the direct benefit transfer for the centre's flagship MDM programme to plug leakages. ""Cooking in schools has a direct bearing on education. Instead of centres of learning, schools are viewed as centres of food. Poor quality and unhygienic conditions often lead to unpleasant incidents,"" he had said.

However, to achieve this, the Centre would have to change the policy at the national level, which seems unlikely. Bihar, on its part, has been seriously mulling the option of handing over MDM to women SHGs, which are 8 lakh in the state, the highest in the country. A pilot project has been launched in one block each of Jehanabad and Muzaffarpur to assess the feasibility."

Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh have waived farm loans. We asked for 10 days. We did it in 2."" Gandhi's announcement appeared to mark the culmination of a well-planned strategy that helped the party win the three heartland states in stunning fashion after a series of election drubbings at the hands of the BJP.

Loan waivers, especially for farmers, are not new in India. States have done it, the Centre has done it, mainly to help lower-income groups in times of crisis such as drought or floods. Bankers and financial institutions, however, see a real possibility of loan waivers turning into a game of political one-upmanship in the run-up to the high-stakes general elections next year. After all, farm crisis is real. And so is growing anger among the peasantry.

But economists fear that the wave of waivers will put a big strain on the scant resources of the states. For banks, groaning under the heavy burden of bad loans (non-performing assets), waivers are an alarm bell. The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) -- which disburses funds for government schemes through commercial banks, cooperative societies, microfinance institutions (MFIs) and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) -- has urged the state governments to clear their dues so that the cycle of credit is not affected.

The Nabard advisory comes at a time when the Congress is mounting pressure on the central government to press commercial banks also to waive off farm loans, even as economists are advising against such a move. In its mid-term review of government finances, the Reserve Bank of India said farm loan waivers contributed about five basis points to the overshooting of revenue expenditure in 2017-18. ""During this fiscal so far, there has been no announcement of farm loan waivers by states outside their budgets. The recent agitation by the farmer community, however, might induce some states and central government to go for such schemes, resulting in increase in revenue expenditure in the rest of 2018-19,"" it adds.

Officials say the total loan waivers will be huge if the Centre heeds the states' demand for waiving off loans from commercial banks. This is because only around 25-30% of rural loans come under the states' purview, while over 60% falls in the central government domain. Earlier this year, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, waived off up to Rs 2 lakh-crore loans given through cooperatives.

Loan waivers are limited to banks and cooperative societies; don't cover debts to money lenders.

However, there is a catch. In India, a huge amount of rural loans is from private money-lenders, who operate outside the formal banking channels. Naturally, loan waivers do not benefit those who borrow from money-lenders as most write-offs are either limited to commercial banks or cooperative societies. Though T.S. Devaraja, head of Mysore University's commerce department, says that the share of money-lenders in rural credit has diminished to around 5-10 per cent since 2013, Prof Abhijit Sen, a former member of the now-disbanded planning commission, disagrees. ""It depends on how we define money-lenders. If anybody outside the formal banking system is defined as a money-lender than their role has not diminished. It includes friends and family, traders and certain forms of NBFCs."" Roughly 10% of the entire farm credit is believed to be from non-formal banking sources like money-lenders.

But does loan waivers help reduce rural distress? Sen says that in 2008, when the then government had proposed a loan waiver, he had his reservations. ""But in hindsight, it was not a bad idea because it cleared a lot of accounts to which banks were unwilling to extend further loans. These accounts suddenly got more loans and private investments in agriculture actually took off,"" he says. Sen points out that after two consecutive bad years in 2008-2009, the agriculture sector grew substantially in 2010. ""We also didn't see much rise in defaults in repayment post the loan waiver, which is one of the two criticisms against farm loan waivers that it destroys the discipline of loan repayment.""

Yoginder Alagh, chancellor of Central University of Gujarat, is of the opinion that as a short-term measure, the government can go for restructuring farm loan, as the government did during the 1987-88 drought. ""However, in the long term, agriculture itself needs to be restructured to provide better and more sustainable income for the farmers."" To put the issue in context, income of most farmers has gone down by 4 per cent over the last few years though the average Indian's earnings have gone up by 6 per cent over the same period.

Dr T.N. Prakash Kammardi, chairman of Karnataka's agriculture price commission, declines to go into the merits or demerits of loan waiver but argues that the issue at hand is of indebtedness which is different from loan burden. Pointing to plight of farmers in Karnataka after three years of drought, the economist says several factors -- including increasing farm mechanisation, unplanned and unmanaged borrowing, expenses on children's education -- are adding to the loan burden. ""Loan waiver, loan restructuring and farm credit are, at least, giving hope to the inde­bted farmers who are otherwise often forced to migrate, change their work or as a last resort commit suicide.""

Incorporating genetic diversity into a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease resulted in greater overlap with the genetic, molecular and clinical features of this pervasive human disease, according to a study funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), part of the National Institutes of Health. The study also suggests that adding genetic diversity may be key to improving the predictive power of studies using mouse models and increasing their usability for precision medicine research for Alzheimer's. This research comes out of the newly established Resilience-Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (Resilience-AD) and was published online Dec. 27, 2018 in the journal Neuron.

""This is the first study to show that you can replicate many of the molecular features of Alzheimer's disease in a genetically diverse mouse model,"" said NIA Director Richard J. Hodes, M.D. ""It points to a strategy for better use of mouse models for precision medicine research -- both basic and translational -- for Alzheimer's disease.""

Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks. As many as 5.5 million Americans age 65 and older are estimated to be living with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia.

A key tool among the multiple efforts to find a treatment or cure for Alzheimer's, mouse models allow researchers to explore genetic, molecular and even behavioral aspects of disease that can't be done in humans. The researchers, led by Catherine C. Kaczorowski, Ph.D. (link is external), an associate professor and Evnin Family Chair in Alzheimer's Research at the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, and her graduate student, first author Sarah Neuner, noted that mouse models with Alzheimer's mutations are important for defining high-risk as well as protective genes and disease mechanisms, and to efficiently test new potential interventions and therapeutics.

In this study, the researchers tested the idea that including more real-world genetic variation into a mouse model of Alzheimer's would improve the translatability of the model -- meaning that findings would be more likely to parallel the many complex features of the human disease. To do this, they combined a well-established mouse model of familial Alzheimer's (5XFAD) with a genetically diverse set of mice. All members of this family of transgenic mice therefore carry the high-risk human familial Alzheimer's genes but otherwise have very different genetic make-up. The detailed analysis of this new panel of mice (referred collectively as AD-BXD), showed a high degree of overlap with the genetic, molecular, pathologic and cognitive features of Alzheimer's. Moreover, in the presence of identical Alzheimer's risk genes, the differences in genetic background led to profound differences in the onset and severity of the pathologic and cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's.

Through a series of comparative analyses, the research team also discovered that one mouse strain, C57BL/6J, commonly used to generate Alzheimer's transgenic mouse models, harbors resilience factors that lessen the impact of Alzheimer's risk factor genes. This new finding has two important implications. First, it suggests that Alzheimer's mouse models with this genetic background may not be suitable for testing of novel therapeutic agents and may explain the poor predictive power of drug screening studies using the current Alzheimer's transgenic mouse models. Second, by using the AD-BXD panel, the protective genes from the C57BL/6J strain and their mechanisms can be precisely identified leading to new candidate targets for Alzheimer's prevention.

The authors noted that the AD-BXD panel represents a new tool for better understanding the heterogeneous nature of normal aging and Alzheimer's, and for precisely identifying molecular factors that lead to resilience to genetic and environmental disease risk factors.

""The ability to model genetic diversity and its impact on multiple aspects of disease risk and resilience in transgenic mice in a robust and reproducible way will enable the research community to learn a lot more about the complex nature of Alzheimer's a lot faster,"" said Suzana Petanceska, Ph.D., program director in the NIA Division of Neuroscience, who oversees the Resilience-AD program. ""This new resource adds to the series of new NIA/NIH programs generating data, analytical and research tools needed to enable more efficient and predictive drug development for Alzheimer's.""

Kaczorowski's team is one of 10 multidisciplinary and multi-institutional research teams supported through the Resilience-AD program, one of a series of NIA-supported open-science consortia. Resilience-AD, launched in 2017, aims to address why and how some individuals remain dementia-free despite being at high genetic or biomarker risk of Alzheimer's. The program was developed to generate deeper mechanistic understanding of how genetic and environmental factors interact and lead to cognitive resilience in individuals who are at high risk for Alzheimer's disease and to identify novel therapeutic targets for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic prevention strategies.

In the infamous Unnao rape case that involves Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, based on orders of the court, an FIR has been registered against the victim, her mother and her uncle for producing a forged age certificate to prove she was a minor.

The court ordered registration of a case against the three on a complaint by the father of another rape accused Shubham, who is in jail, said SP Harish Kumar Thursday.

He said complainant Harpal Singh had alleged that the victim, her uncle and mother had procured a forged age certificate to implicate his son Shubham in the rape case, said Kumar.

The police said the case was registered at the Makhi police station on court's December 17 order against the family members for various alleged offences of cheating and forgery.

Complainant Singh had moved the court saying the school transfer certificate, purportedly made by Raebareli school and produced as the age certificate, was forged to frame his son, police said.

The victim's uncle is presently in jail in connection with another case.

Harpal Singh's wife Shashi and son Shubham are accused in the rape case and have been in jail since April along with the main accused, BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

Sengar, a four-time MLA, was charged by the CBI with raping the girl at his residence in Makhi village on June 4 last year.

The girl was again abducted and raped by a separate group of accused, allegedly including Harpal Singh's son Shubhan Singh, his driver Naresh Tiwari and one Brijesh Yadav between June 11 and June 20, 2017.

But in his complaint, Harpal Singh alleged that the victim had an affair with a man named Awadesh Tewari, with whom she had eloped in September 2017, only to return sometime later.

After her return, her family had begun persuading his son Shubham to marry her, alleged Harpal Singh in his complaint.

When Shubham refused to marry her, the family filed a case against him and his mother on charges of kidnapping as well as various offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, alleged Haripal Singh.

He also alleged that the victim's kin had forged her age certificate with a fake date of birth, purportedly issued from a school in Raebareli as proof.

The certificate purportedly had the signatures of the Basic Shiksha Adhikari of the district and the school principal.

Singh claimed both the education department official and the school principal have denied signing the certificate.

The victim had alleged that she was raped by BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar at his residence on June 4, 2017, when she had gone there to meet him along with Shashi Singh, Shubham's mother, to seek a job.

In February, the girl's family had moved the court for inclusion of the MLA's name in the case.

The state police registered a case on April 12, 2018, on the day of handing over the probe to the CBI.

Meanwhile, the victim's father was booked by the police under the Arms Act on April 3 and put in jail on April 5 where he died on April 9, 2018.

A video, purportedly showing the victim's father before his death accusing the MLA's brother of assaulting him had then gone viral.

Sengar's brother Atul Singh, was arrested along with four others, by the UP Crime Branch, for allegedly thrashing the victim's father.

Frustrated with the alleged police inaction and coercion from influential people, the minor victim had attempted self-immolation in front of Chief Minister yogi Adityanath's residence on April 8, 2018.

The Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government's ""inaction"" against the party MLA had drawn scathing criticism from the Allahabad High Court.

The state government had subsequently transferred the case to the CBI nearly 10 months after the commission of the alleged crime. Sengar was arrested by the CBI on April 13 and has been in judicial custody since then.

A second arrest in the case was made on April 14 when Shashi Singh, who had taken the victim to Sengar's house, was held."

The committee in its 111th report on the Functioning of New AIIMS (Phase-I) under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) expressed concern at the duplication and concentration of tertiary care services at a particular place.

""In the places that have been selected for setting up of AIIMS-like institutions, the critical gap in the tertiary healthcare is already being filled by private sector,"" the department-related parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare said.

""The committee strongly believes that AIIMS should be located in an area with low human development index that lags behind in tertiary healthcare,"" it said.

According to the panel, site selection for any AIIMS-like institution requires a detailed assessment of the geographical location and the demographic distribution. Easy accessibility and transportation availability is one major concern, it said.

At several places like Guwahati, Patna and now in Madurai, where a new AIIMS was recently announced, the government had already selected government medical colleges for upgradation programme under the PMSSY, it noted.

""The committee strongly recommends that the ministry, while deciding the location of the new AIIMS, must take note of the already existing healthcare infrastructure in the vicinity of the earmarked area so that duplication of healthcare facilities is avoided,"" it said.

The committee suggested that the healthcare system should be such that delivery of medical facility and care is regionally distributed and even the remotest region is well within its outreach to address regional imbalances in provision of healthcare facilities.

Expressing dissatisfaction at the failure of the ministry to monitor the timely completion of the project, mainly the construction activities in all the new AIIMS-like institutions, the panel recommended that the ministry should ensure proper planning and timely execution for its completion.

According to the committee, careless selection of the project consultants did more harm than good and caused unwarranted delays in the construction activity.

The committee also feels that AIIMS-like institutes and hospitals should be excluded from the National Building Code guidelines or some amendments in the guidelines can be made so that AIIMS-like institutions are allowed to carry out vertical expansion.

""This will not only ensure the optimum utilisation of land but also resolve the delays caused due to unavailability of land,"" it said.

The committee in its report stated that it also came across several discrepancies in the procurement exercise and expressed concern over AIIMS-like institutions having purchased the same medical equipment at a higher cost than their counterparts in the health industry.

""Despite similar CMC/training/warranty conditions, a substantial price differential has been observed in the procurement of the same medical equipment by the private corporate hospitals and the new AIIMS,"" it said.

It has recommended that the ministry should carry out a detailed assessment in all such cases where price differential is more than 10 per cent in the procurement of equipment by private/corporate hospitals and AIIMS-like institutions.

The panel also expressed disappointment over the performance of Procurement Support Agency and recommended strong monitoring of its functioning along with quarterly submission of a status report on the procurement of medical devices to the committee under the PMSSY scheme.

It also underlined the need to follow a competitive tendering mechanism for procurement of any equipment rather than a single bid tender procurement.

The panel further recommended that the other AIIMS- like institutions should emulate AIIMS Bhubaneshwar that has procured 130 medical equipment with ISO.BIS certification.

This would not only minimise the cost but also promote the domestic manufacturers, boosting government's flagship Make in India campaign, it said.

Aggrieved at the shortage of faculty and non-faculty staff in all the AIIMS-like institutions, the panel asked the ministry to address this acute shortage as it has a direct impact on the quality of health service and medical education in the institutes.

It has also sought to be apprised of the number of faculty that have been employed from other premier medical institutes and asked new AIIMS-like institutions to submit a status note on the number of applicants and number candidates employed and rejected.

The panel also sought to know the reasons for the rejection of such candidates.

The panel mentioned a CAG report which highlighted that in six new AIIMS -- Bhopal, Bhubaneshwar, Jodhpur, Patna, Raipur and Rishikesh -- shortage of faculty posts ranged from 55 per cent to 83 per cent. Similarly, the shortage of non-faculty posts ranged from 77 to 97 per cent. PLB AAR

As a step towards 'merger', all chief educational officers have been instructed to send the list of such elementary and high schools located within or near higher secondary schools. ""The department is collecting the data now so that action can be initiated next academic year. After merging, the school buildings will be converted into libraries or adult learning centres,"" said an officer, requesting anonymity.

Friday was set as the deadline to submit the list, according to a letter sent to all officers on December 17, days after they met in Chennai.

Sources said a government order had been issued in this connection but the officers were instructed not to act upon it till the next academic year. ""However, we have been instructed to increase the students' strength in the meanwhile,"" said one of the officers who attended the meet.

Tamil Nadu had earlier informed the Centre that it had taken an initiative to merge 1,053 government schools. Also, funds for another 1,950 schools with less than 15 students each were stopped recently.

This move was adopted so that Tamil Nadu adhered to Samagara Shisksha Abhiyan's (SSA) guidelines. SSA was formed recently by merging erstwhile schemes -- Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Class I-VIII) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (Class IX-XII).

Under the new guidelines, government schools with less than 15 students are not eligible to receive the composite school grant, ranging from ?25,000 to ?1,00,000 depending on student strength.

Composite grants were used by schools to improve infrastructure, maintain toilets, buy material to develop students' reading skills and carry out other development activities.

Of the 31,200 government schools, nearly 3,000 institutions that come under various municipalities or are run by departments such as Adi Dravidar, Kallar Reclamation, forest and social welfare have a strength of less than 25 students, shows official data.

So, only ?89.6 crore was released as composite grants for schools in TN this year despite ?97.18 crore being earmarked. Condemning this, educationist Prince Gajendra Babu said the governments were systematically destroying state-funded schools by denying funds and it was unfair to expect parents to admit their children in these schools without adequate teaching staff or facilities."

The steel city's hopes for air connectivity have soared with the East Singhbhum district administration sending a fresh proposal to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for developing the Dalbhumgarh airstrip in Ghatshila.

The district has promised to provide 240 acres for the project even though the AAI had sought 150 acres, deputy commissioner Amit Kumar revealed on Friday.

Kumar was addressing a news conference to list the achievements of the Raghubar Das government on its fourth anniversary. He said every department, especially health, education, infrastructure, energy, women empowerment and social security, had made significant progress during this period.

""Today, every house, however remote, boasts power supply. We have made this possible by implementing the Union government-sponsored Saubhagya Yojana, also known as Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, which was launched in October 2017,"" the deputy commissioner said.

Kumar listed 14 new bridges, including the Domuhani bridge in Sonari and Luabasa bridge in Govindpur, both over Subernarekha river, among other infrastructure achievements of the government.

Following the mode of campaigns run by privately-managed educational institutions, government schools across the state have started a massive advertising campaign ahead of commencement of the new academic session on January 1, featuring achievements and facilities of the schools.

Sources in the education department said the state government's recent decision to provide annual administrative grants to schools on the basis of enrolled positions has added an impetus to this campaign.

Banners portraying facilities and accomplishments at entrances of schools has become a common sight. Some school authorities have also launched a social media campaign, named Utsav Vidyarambha, an annual enrolment drive conducted every year with the help of local community and students, to enhance enrolment in schools.

""From this year, the publicity campaign for Utsav Vidyarambha has been launched on a massive scale. The prime thrust is to change the prevailing notion of most guardians that the quality of education in the state-government schools are not at par with private schools. Let's spread the message that trained and qualified teachers are imparting education in government-run schools and the admissions as well as other facilities are totally free for the newly enrolled kids at the primary level,"" a senior official of the education department told TOI on Friday.

Checking the decrease in enrolment, something which was detected as a major worry in Gunotsav, is the primary agenda behind launching such a publicity campaign, he added.

As per the new guidelines, schools with enrolment of 60 or below will not get any financial support, schools having enrolment of 61 to 400 will get financial support of Rs 20,000, schools having enrolment of 401 to 600 will get financial support of Rs 25,000 and schools having enrolment of more than 600 will get financial support of Rs 35,000."

Taking charge of the department on Friday, education minister Govind Singh Dotasara said, ""The Vasundhara Raje government minimized the contribution of father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi and Pt Jawaharlal Nehru, who played vital roles in the struggle for Independence. Same treatment was meted out to other national icons like ex-PM Manmohan Singh. I will ensure that these national icons' rightful places are restored in the textbooks.""

He said decisions like providing 'saffron coloured cycles', posting RSS-backed officers on boards and councils and changing curriculum will also be reviewed.

In his first meeting with officials, Dotasara directed them to prepare a status report on the revision of textbooks. ""References and chapters preaching bigotry and falsehood will be removed,"" said the minister.

The revision of textbooks is expected to be an uphill task for the cash-crunch government. It is unlikely to take place for the 2019-20 session, which will begin April 2019.

The Raje government carried out revision of textbooks in 2015-16, downsizing the contribution of Congress leaders of the Independence era. The RSS-backed revision carried out by State Institute of Educational Research and Training (SIERT) also omitted the works of John Keats, Thomas Hardy, William Blake, T S Eliot and Edward Lear in the revised Class VIII English textbooks.

Chapters by Muslim writers axed

Jaipur: Chapters authored by Muslim writers like Ismat Chugtai were also axed. They have been replaced by mostly lesser-known authors whose works have a regional flavour. As the controversy picked up, a few of them were restored in the Class IX and XI textbooks.

With the new academic year set to commence in the next few months, there are various key decisions that are now lying in the backburner as the CM is yet to allot ministries to the newly-elected members of the assembly.

Take for instance the schedule for common entrance tests and school admissions. Last year, the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) had declared the schedule for all common entrance tests on December 28 and released the admission schedule for schools on December 30. However, this year, the government is yet to commence the process for the same. ""The release of the schedule will take another 2-3 weeks.

""First, a committee is constituted that will issue a notification calling applications from private colleges to fix the fee structure for the next three years.

Other aspects such as affiliation process for intermediate colleges and finalization of admission process for degree courses are also pending.

Making matters worse, several key positions such as principal secretary, commissioner of school education and chairman of the TAFRC also have to be finalised by the new education minister.

The delay by the chief minister has not only irked the opposition parties but also the parents community. ""The fee hike issue has been pending for the last four years.

The woman, who gave birth to a boy on September 15, told reporters that she tested positive after she was administered two units of blood at the hospital in April. Hospital dean Dr Vasanthamani P rejected the claim.

As per medical records, the woman visited a primary health centre in Mangadu on March 6 when doctors confirmed her pregnancy. In April, doctors referred her to KMCH for blood transfusion after they found her haemoglobin level was low. The report of a blood test she did at a private hospital on February 12 shows HIV negative.

At KMCH she was given two units of blood on April 5 and April 6, and she got discharged 10 days later. She was referred back to the hospital in August after scans showed the fetus was in ""breech position"" (legs down). That's when the hospital ordered the HIV test. ""Usually we assign a number along with every HIV test done. Her records did not have the number. So we repeated the test and she tested positive. We started her on medication and help her deliver a healthy baby in September,"" said hospital dean Dr Vasanthamani P.

The woman said she was forced to remain silent as she feared that she would be ostracized by her family and friends. But she petitioned health minister C Vijaya Baskar, health secretary J Radhakrishnan and other senior administrators. ""I did not receive any call from the government. When I read about how another pregnant woman acquired the infection, I decided to talk about my condition,"" she said. ""My husband has no infection. This hospital is the only possible source of infection,"" she said.

Director of medical education Dr A Edwin Joe said the government ordered for an inquiry in December. ""Today, the inquires revealed said the blood provided by the hospital was tested safe,"" he said.

The two units of blood (1962 and 2129) administered to the woman were labelled safe after they were screened on high-end equipment. While one of the blood samples were sourced from a college student, the other was a regular voluntary blood donor. ""We have a machine printed copy that says the samples were safe,"" said Dr Vasanthamani. ""It is difficult for us to point out the infection source now,"" she said.

Health activists and NGOs say the state health department should do a more detailed inquiry to clear its name. ""It is important for the hospitals to recall the donors for a HIV test. If they test negative, it is evident that the disease was not transfused through blood. What if the test was false negative because they were in their window period,"" said Karunanidhi, who works for a positive network NGO.

Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society project director K Senthil Raj said the state has not dropped its guard on blood screening. ""We have a robost screening programme. At least 60% of deliveries happen in GH. There is no need for women to panic,"" he said."

He was a teacher par excellence and was instrumental in organising the first-ever continuing surgical education programme, on the lines of those organised by the Royal College of surgeons, UK, in India in the early sixties. He was a close associate of late professor M P Pai and had helped him in starting the first ever PG course in surgery in the erstwhile Mysore state. He had rendered service in District Wenlock Hospital as a surgical mentor and surgeon. Along with another professor M Srinivasan, the trio shaped the department in imparting surgical training. In 1967, he moved to the UK and became an orthopaedic consultant. He helped several Indian students get trained in the UK.

Dr Pai was regarded as the friend of the poor in Wenlock and the best operative instructors under whose tutelage many doctors in this region blossomed into fine surgeons.

A meeting of the state cabinet late Thursday evening gave its nod to the proposal to change the curriculum.

The BJP-Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) government shortly after coming to power in March after ending the 25 year-rule of the Left Front had set up an expert committee for reviewing the school syllabus.

Education Minister Ratan Lal Nath told reporters that the change would enable the students of the state to be as ""competitive"" as students of the other states. He said the change in curriculum will also take the state's education system to the national level.

The minister had earlier alleged that the Left regime indulged in ""communalisation of school curriculum by teaching wrong lessons to students"".

He said his department had already procured over 2 lakh new books of National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and 64,000 books will soon be reaching the state.

The expert committee set up by the BJP-IPFT government had recommended NCERT curriculum for schools in the state.

The committee had also suggested the implementation of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus across all government and government-aided schools in the state.

The state cabinet had also asked the education department to examine whether the school timings could be changed. Currently, all government and government-aided schools have two shifts -- morning and afternoon. (PTI)"

A larger space for children to play and learn -- that's the big change workers at Delhi's new anganwadi 'hub-centres' are most excited about.

With 101 such hub-centres inaugurated earlier this week, the idea is to combine resources, workers and helpers from three-four anganwadi centres to create a larger 'mohalla playschool', where economically disadvantaged children between ages three and six can be prepared for formal education.

An official from the Women and Child Development department said a severe space constraint at anganwadi centres led to the need for such hubs.

""Our centres were not in a good condition at all because of the rent restrictions. Children sat on a mat under a staircase or outside the building. What could they learn in a situation like that? The centres were known only as 'khichdi-banane wale' centres instead of spaces of early childhood learning. By pooling together resources, workers have been able to find larger spaces without additional expenses,"" the official said.

At the hub-centre in Khizrabad village, formed in April by combining four centres, walls are covered with colourful charts created by anganwadi workers and children. ""In each individual centre, we used to have 13-14 children coming every day, that too after visiting their homes and pleading with them to join. Now we have around 20 children from each centre coming in daily. Parents themselves come to send them here. The main reason is the larger, more colourful space. It looks like a playschool and parents can see that there are many of us teaching. It looks like a positive environment,"" said Vijaywati, a worker at the hub-centre.

At the hub-centre in Batla House, formed in May, the day begins at 9.30 am with prayer songs and exercise. This is followed by a session in which workers teach poems and songs, and a meal at 10.30 am. Following this is a session of games, and the last activity of the day is a writing and drawing session with slates and chalks provided by the government.

""We teach them through play. We have been provided a curriculum by the department, which we use as a reference point, but we innovate and add to it. The children learn the English and Hindi alphabet and counting. Since this is a Muslim majority locality, we also teach the Urdu alphabet to children whose parents request it,"" said Zaheen Begum, a worker at the hub-centre.

However, lack of certain resources is still a challenge. The worker at a centre pointed out that toys provided as study material by the government -- like colourful beads and puzzles -- were last given in 2013. The government provides them with material like chart paper, pencils, crayons and sketch-pens; but workers at different centres have pooled in considerable resources of their own to procure additional material like a blackboard, illustrated learning charts, colourful marble paper and glitter for a more vibrant learning environment.

According to Begum, one of the most telling signs of a greater enthusiasm to learn is that some parents send their children to the hub-centres with notebooks that they have purchased themselves, and ask for homework to be assigned, even though that is not a part of the curriculum."

""The government should come out with a legislation for the setting up and functioning of tuition and coaching centres for children. It should be ensured that such institutions are child-friendly,"" the commission said.

The commission said its recommendations were based on a slew of complaints it received against the incidents of fleecing and gross violation of child rights at coaching and tuition centres. Though there were laws and rules for ensuring protection of child rights in schools, the absence of the same for coaching and tuition centres was proving to be a matter of grave concern, the commission said. The commission recommended that the general education department should come out with a set of rules restricting the functioning of tuition and coaching centres.

However, general education secretary A Shajahan said the government has set up a mechanism for school education and it doesn't recommend students or their parents to seek additional coaching or tuition outside the school. ""Private coaching and tuition centres thrive because parents think it is appropriate to engage their wards in such centres for additional coaching. In such case, the discretion purely lies with the students and their parents. The general education department doesn't endorse any such additional tuition or coaching. Since they are not of our scheme of things, general education department is not supposed to take any actions in this regard,"" he said. TNN"

These days, it is not unusual to see children, still sleepy, leave home before sunrise to sweat it out at tuition centres before racing off to school. School hours are, in many instances, sandwiched between expensive, back-breaking coaching sessions after which the children limp home -- bleary-eyed and exhausted -- by 8 p.m. or 9 p.m., or even later.

Acting on a set of complaints, the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Friday issued orders to the State government to frame a law for regulating tuition/coaching centres and to ensure that children's rights are protected. The commission asked the Secretary, General Education, and the Director of Public Instruction (DPI), to ensure that such institutions are allowed to operate only in a child-friendly atmosphere.

Commission member Sreela Menon N., in her order, noted that while rules and regulations protected the rights of children in the school environment, no such framework protected them in tuition centres that have mushroomed in every nook and cranny of the State.

The commission's order came on two petitions filed by Sebi Joseph of Ancheri, Thrissur, and a group of parents. The petitioners, urging the commission's intervention, alleged that gross violation of children's rights was occurring at such institutions. They also wanted the commission to slap a ban on summer coaching classes that also have become a common feature.

Although the commission issued notices on the matter to the Secretary, General Education, and the DPI, it received the reply that the Education Department was helpless.

The Kerala Education Rules did not contain any provision to regulate tuition/coaching centres. In fact, Friday's order has come at a time when even veterans in the coaching classes sector have started to complain about excesses. P.C. Thomas of Thrissur, a pioneer in the field, welcomed the order, saying it was high time steps were taken to protect children. According to him, tuition/coaching centres have transformed into a 'mafia' in recent years.

""This has become a big business where the children are at the receiving end. There is no doubt that the rights of the children have to be protected. The government should introduce regulations and form inspection teams,"" Mr. Thomas said.

The commission has ordered the Secretary, General Education, and the DPI to file action-taken reports within 30 days of receiving copies of the order."

Keeping the demographic dividend in view, the State government has plans to encourage population growth and announce a suitable policy in this regard. As a step in that direction, the government is contemplating doing away with the two-child norm which is currently applicable to local body elections, said Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu.

Releasing a White Paper on 'Human Resources and Social Development' on Friday, the Chief Minister said that 50% population in the country would be below 25 years age by 2029, while countries such as China and Japan would be with a population with age more than 38 years.

Andhra Pradesh should not lag behind in that demographic advantage. So, the government was contemplating announcing a policy to encourage population growth, he said.

""Two decades ago, I was the first person to take the initiative in population control. I realised that at a certain time there will be no younger generation due to population control. We should not face similar experience which Japan and China are facing,"" he said.

Underscoring the importance of human capital, the State government spent ₹1.31 lakh crore on Human Resource Development in the State in the last four and half years.

The budget allocation for school education increased from ₹12,595 crore in 2014-15 to ₹21,612 crore in 2018-19. The budget for higher education has increased from ₹3,087 crore in 2014-15 to ₹3,349 crore in 2018-19.

The decrease in MMR from 83 (2014-15) to 65.81(2018-19) and IMR from 37(2014) to 10.51 (2018-19), decrease in per capita out of pocket expenditure on healthcare, increase in outpatient percentage in public health facilities, increase in institutional deliveries were some of the achievements, he said.

Days after a 23-year-old pregnant woman tested positive for HIV following a blood transfusion at a government hospital in Sattur, a 30-year-old woman, who received two units of blood for treating severe anaemia during her second pregnancy at the Government Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) Hospital in Chennai in April, has made a similar complaint.

The woman, a resident of Mangadu, received two units of blood at KMC when she was five months pregnant. Four months later, her blood sample tested positive for HIV. Subsequently, her family lodged a complaint with the Health Department in October.

The woman alleged that prior to the blood transfusion, her health card had an entry stating that she was 'HIV negative'. Having previously lodged a complaint with the Health Department, she said she chose to speak to the media after the Sattur incident came to light.

However, KMC Dean P. Vasanthamani denied the claim that HIV-positive blood was transfused to her. ""We received a complaint from the woman's family through the Directorate of Medical Education on December 5, and I personally conducted an inquiry, considering the seriousness of the issue. We have documentary evidence to prove that the transfused blood was screened and was free of HIV infection,"" she said.

The Dean said that the woman was referred to KMC from the Primary Health Centre (PHC) at Mangadu in suburban Chennai as an emergency case on April 5.

""She was five months pregnant and had severe anaemia. Her haemoglobin was 5.5 grams per decilitre and we immediately transfused one unit of blood. Another unit of blood was transfused the next day. She was discharged after 11 days,"" she said.

Dr. Vasanthamani said that at the time of admission, the woman produced a card from the PHC that contained a ""handwritten note"" that she was HIV negative. The woman returned for a check-up on August 16, when doctors at the out-patient department asked for her blood test reports.

""She had the card from her previous medical check-up at the PHC. As she did not have any documents or reports for the blood tests that had been done, the doctors did a blood test, as is the routine. She was found to be HIV-positive on August 18,"" she added.

Dr. Vasanthamani said that an inquiry at the Mangadu PHC found that the woman had produced a document of a blood investigation done at a private laboratory, which notified that she was HIV-negative. It was on this basis that the PHC staff made an entry on the card.

The woman, when contacted, insisted that she had a report from the private clinic to prove that she was HIV-negative before undergoing blood transfusion at KMC. She said that when her HIV-positive status came to light, the staff at KMC immediately tested her husband, and he was found to be HIV-negative.

She was put on Anti Retroviral Therapy and delivered a boy through caesarean section on September 15. The hospital took measures to prevent HIV transmission to the baby soon after delivery, and the child was HIV-negative.

Her husband said they had sent a petition to the Health Minister in October, but were yet to receive a response. They remained silent, fearing the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, he said.

""My health condition has started to deteriorate. I used to sell vegetables for a living, but am now unable to work or even walk for a short distance. I face discrimination from my own sibling. It is the State government that is responsible for my condition,"" the woman said."

No issues between Congress and JD-S, says Kumaraswamy

Karnataka Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy on Friday ruled out any issues between the ruling coalition partners, the Congress and Janata Dal-Secular even as voices of displeasure have emerged from his own party, the JD-S.

""There is no displeasure at all...do I look like one (who is displeased)?"" he asked when reporters questioned him if JD-S workers and leaders were unhappy with the Congress on a host of issues, including appointment of heads to boards and corporations that is yet to be finalised.

""Some people are discussing some issues, I cant take responsibility for it,"" he said.

JD-S workers and local leaders have asked the leadership to contest all 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state in the coming parliamentary polls, unhappy over the Congress' 'big brother attitude' in the ruling coalition in Karnataka.

Also, senior party leader Basavaraj Horatti had on Thursday alleged that the the Congress was violating coalition dharma and not allowing Kumaraswamy to function in peace.

Stating that there were no issues, the chief minister said that all decisions, including appointments to boards and corporations, would take place smoothly. Kumaraswamy was speaking to reporters after announcing that the 11th Bengaluru International Film Festival would be held from February 7 to 14.

The chief minister said the festival would henceforth be held from the first on Thursday of February of every year.

Officials said that 200 films from 50 countries would be screened at 11 theatres in the city during the festival and added that they had tried to bring down the cost by about 50 per cent compared to last year, without affecting the quality.

They said they were trying to bring down the cost this year to about Rs 3.5 crore from Rs 7 crore in 2017."

Parameshwara also holds charge of the much sought-after Bengaluru Development ministry.

MB Patil, who led the movement for separate religion status for Lingayats, has been handed the home portfolio. Along with him, another close aide of former chief minister Siddaramaiah, Satish Jarkiholi, included in the Cabinet as a replacement for his brother Ramesh, has been given charge of the Forest, Ecology and Environment portfolio.

Among the other new inductees, CS Shivalli has been given charge of municipalities and local bodies, MTB Nagaraj has been allocated housing, E Tukaram has been handed Medical Education, which was taken away from senior leader DK Shivakumar, PT Parameshwar Naik has been given charge of Muzrai and Skill development, Rahim Khan has been allocated Youth Empowerment and Sports, and RB Thimmapur has been given Ports and Inland Transport and the Sugar department.

The allocation of ministries was firmed up after robust lobbying from leaders amid rumours of a tussle between Siddaramaiah and Parameshwara. Indeed, Congress leaders had complained after the first expansion that the deputy chief minister had cornered many of the coveted departments.

A senior Congress leader, who asked not to be identified, said it was natural for some differences to appear in the wake of the reshuffle. ""Many leaders knew that they would have to divest some ministries when the expansion happens. But they get attached to the ministries, so it is natural that there is some heartburn in the process,"" the leader said.

In the expansion, the Congress had sought to address the perceived imbalance in the Cabinet, which was made up primarily of leaders from the southern districts of the state. However, in addressing this problem, another senior Congress leader said, the party had selected only loyalists of Siddaramaiah, whose influence over the party appears to have increased again.

This, the leader quoted above said, was a natural fallout of the fact that the former chief minister is the only leader in the state who can rally all the legislators. ""He is the leader of the Congress legislature party, which means that if the party had a majority he would be the chief minister. So, it is no surprise that he enjoys tremendous support,"" the Congress leader said.

Indeed, after the Congress was reduced to 82 seats in the May assembly elections, down from 122 in the 2013 elections, Congress leaders had blamed Siddaramaiah for failing to ensure the party's victory. Around 20 of his cabinet colleagues lost the polls, including most famously, his own defeat in the Chamundeshwari seat in Mysuru by a margin of around 35,000 votes.

However, after a brief sabbatical after the state elections, the recent dissidence in the Congress has shown that it is Siddaramaiah who is the de-facto leader of the party in the state, with leaders rallying around the former chief minister in times of crisis.

To be sure, Siddaramaiah is also the chairman of the coordination committee of the coalition government. Additionally, he was also elevated to the Congress Working Committee in July, indicating that the party's high command still favours him despite the loss in the elections.

Political analyst Narendar Pani, a faculty member at the National Institute of Advanced Studies, said there were two primary reasons for Siddaramaiah's current position within the Congress. ""While Siddaramaiah already enjoyed significant clout within the state unit, the party high command's backing clearly reinforced his position,"" he said.

Added to this, Pani said, was the fact that the potential challengers within the party had embroiled themselves in factional feuds that had eroded their standing among others in the Congress. Pani was referring to the feud between irrigation minister DK Shivakumar and the Jarkiholi brothers of Belagavi that threatened to destabilise the party.

""By getting involved in these factional feuds, Siddaramaiah's challengers seem to have eroded their own influence and in the process strengthened his position further. As a result, he has emerged as someone who is above these petty quarrels,"" Pani said.

The Cabinet rejig was also criticised by public works minister HD Revanna, who said the Congress might face a backlash for divesting Parameshwara, who hails from a Scheduled Caste community, of the home portfolio. ""Poor Parameshwara is a senior leader and is respected,"" he said. ""He belongs to the SC community, was it necessary to divest him of the home portfolio? He has worked hard in his department, he should have been continued as home minister,"" he said. Later he said, he could not help it if the Congress could not tolerate a Dalit being a deputy chief minister."

Kumaraswamy, allocated portfolios to eight newly inducted Ministers of the Congress on Friday, with M.B. Patil bagging the coveted Home portfolio.

Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara has had to part with the portfolio and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has succeeded in having it assigned to his loyalist Mr. Patil, who was Water Resources Minister in his government.

Even during the process of Cabinet expansion, Mr. Siddaramaiah is said to have had a big say, with many of his loyalists from north Karnataka making their way into the Cabinet. Seven of the eight new Ministers are from that region.

However, speaking in Hubballi, Mr. Siddaramaiah said he had nothing to do with Dr. Parameshwara losing the Home portfolio.

Out of the 22 Congress Ministers, only Dr. Parameshwara and D.K. Shivakumar hold more than one major portfolio. While the former is holding four, Mr. Shivakumar is holding two.

It is learnt that Dr. Parameshwara was unwilling to give up Home Department and did so only after some ""gentle advice"" from Congress president Rahul Gandhi. He will continue to hold the coveted Bengaluru Development ministry alongside three more portfolios -- IT, BT, and Science and Technology; Law, Justice and Human Rights; and Parliamentary Affairs and Legislation.

The Youth Empowerment and Sports portfolio has been taken out of the Deputy Chief Minister's kitty and given to first-time Minister Rahim Khan from Bidar.

Mr. Shivakumar has had to give up the Medical Education portfolio for E. Tukaram, another first-time Minister, from Ballari. Mr. Shivakumar will now hold the Kannada and Culture portfolio, besides Water Resources.

The list of portfolios was cleared by Mr. Gandhi and sent to the Chief Minister by K.C. Venugopal, All-India Congress Committee general secretary in charge of Karnataka. The portfolios of a few Congress Ministers have also been reshuffled to accommodate the eight new Ministers.

Satish Jarkiholi has been given the Forest, Ecology and Environment portfolio, which was earlier held by R. Shankar, now dropped from the Cabinet. N. Nagaraju (MTB) has been given Housing, which was earlier with U.T. Khader. Mr. Khader will continue to hold the Urban Development portfolio. Ramesh Jarkiholi's Municipal Administration portfolio is now with C.S. Shivalli, another first-time Minster.

P.T. Parameshwar Naik, four-time MLA from Hoovina Hadagali of Ballari, has been given the slightly low-profile portfolios of Muzrai and Skill Development, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood, while R.B. Thimmapur has been allocated Sugar and Port and Inland Transport."

The committee in its 111th report on the Functioning of New AIIMS (Phase-I) under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) expressed concern at the duplication and concentration of tertiary care services at a particular place.

""In the places that have been selected for setting up of AIIMS-like institutions, the critical gap in the tertiary healthcare is already being filled by private sector,"" the department-related parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare said.

""The committee strongly believes that AIIMS should be located in an area with low human development index that lags behind in tertiary healthcare,"" it said.

According to the panel, site selection for any AIIMS-like institution requires a detailed assessment of the geographical location and the demographic distribution. Easy accessibility and transportation availability is one major concern, it said.

At several places like Guwahati, Patna and now in Madurai, where a new AIIMS was recently announced, the government had already selected government medical colleges for upgradation programme under the PMSSY, it noted.

""The committee strongly recommends that the ministry, while deciding the location of the new AIIMS, must take note of the already existing healthcare infrastructure in the vicinity of the earmarked area so that duplication of healthcare facilities is avoided,"" it said.

The committee suggested that the healthcare system should be such that delivery of medical facility and care is regionally distributed and even the remotest region is well within its outreach to address regional imbalances in provision of healthcare facilities.

Expressing dissatisfaction at the failure of the ministry to monitor the timely completion of the project, mainly the construction activities in all the new AIIMS-like institutions, the panel recommended that the ministry should ensure proper planning and timely execution for its completion.

According to the committee, careless selection of the project consultants did more harm than good and caused unwarranted delays in the construction activity.

The committee also feels that AIIMS-like institutes and hospitals should be excluded from the National Building Code guidelines or some amendments in the guidelines can be made so that AIIMS-like institutions are allowed to carry out vertical expansion.

""This will not only ensure the optimum utilisation of land but also resolve the delays caused due to unavailability of land,"" it said.

The committee in its report stated that it also came across several discrepancies in the procurement exercise and expressed concern over AIIMS-like institutions having purchased the same medical equipment at a higher cost than their counterparts in the health industry.

""Despite similar CMC/training/warranty conditions, a substantial price differential has been observed in the procurement of the same medical equipment by the private corporate hospitals and the new AIIMS,"" it said.

It has recommended that the ministry should carry out a detailed assessment in all such cases where price differential is more than 10 per cent in the procurement of equipment by private/corporate hospitals and AIIMS-like institutions.

The panel also expressed disappointment over the performance of Procurement Support Agency and recommended strong monitoring of its functioning along with quarterly submission of a status report on the procurement of medical devices to the committee under the PMSSY scheme.

It also underlined the need to follow a competitive tendering mechanism for procurement of any equipment rather than a single bid tender procurement.

The panel further recommended that the other AIIMS- like institutions should emulate AIIMS Bhubaneshwar that has procured 130 medical equipment with ISO.BIS certification.

This would not only minimise the cost but also promote the domestic manufacturers, boosting government's flagship Make in India campaign, it said.

Aggrieved at the shortage of faculty and non-faculty staff in all the AIIMS-like institutions, the panel asked the ministry to address this acute shortage as it has a direct impact on the quality of health service and medical education in the institutes.

It has also sought to be apprised of the number of faculty that have been employed from other premier medical institutes and asked new AIIMS-like institutions to submit a status note on the number of applicants and number candidates employed and rejected.

The panel also sought to know the reasons for the rejection of such candidates.

The panel mentioned a CAG report which highlighted that in six new AIIMS -- Bhopal, Bhubaneshwar, Jodhpur, Patna, Raipur and Rishikesh -- shortage of faculty posts ranged from 55 per cent to 83 per cent. Similarly, the shortage of non-faculty posts ranged from 77 to 97 per cent."
"295","1028398163","2018-12-28","https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/ayushman-bharat-scheme-a-modification-of-rsby-parl-panel-562909.html","Ayushman Bharat Scheme a Modification of RSBY: Parl Panel | LatestLY","Latestly",FALSE,"New Delhi, Dec 28 (PTI) A parliamentary panel has termed the Ayushman Bharat scheme a modification of the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), and said that over half of its proposed beneficiaries already stand covered by existing government supported programmes.

The committee stated this in its 112th report on the action taken by the government on the recommendations/ observations contained in the 106th report on Demands for Grants 2018-19 of the Department of Health.

It said the National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS), also known as the Ayushman Bharat scheme, was announced in the 2018-19 budget and it was the world's largest government- funded healthcare programme with 50 crore prospective beneficiaries.

""The new scheme is just a modification of the earlier scheme, RSBY. Over half the target beneficiaries proposed to be covered under the NHPS already stand covered today by existing government supported schemes,"" it said.

""What would indeed have been a step forward is if it covered out-patient treatment as well, but that is lacking. Many states have in fact opted out of the RSBY in favour of the state-run schemes and some states are trying out the trust-based model,"" it added.

The parliamentary committee said a recent comprehensive review on various studies related to the RSBY revealed that in the majority of studies there was an increase in out-of-pocket expenditure related to the scheme, while only two of 14 studies showed a reduction in expenditure.

The NSS data on the RSBY showed that enrolment was quite low, only 57 per cent of those eligible were enrolled and less than 12 per cent of the eligible people got their hospitalisation covered through the programme, it said.

The committee, thus, recommended that the government form a panel to analyse the failures of the RSBY and ensure that inadequacies plaguing its operation and implementation were not repeated.

It also recommended that the NHPS must have first claim on the proceeds collected from health and education cess and fund constraint should not be allowed to come in the way of its implementation.

The committee observed that the impressive economic progress made during the last two decades had not resulted in commensurate investment in the health sector as a result of which India continued to lag behind many developing countries on health indicators on the global comparison matrix.

The lack of financial commitment for translating healthcare goals into action was evident from the fact that though the government expenditure on health sector had marginally increased as a per cent of the GDP over the years, it has stagnated at around 1.2 per cent of GDP, it said.

The panel said the current pace of the year-on-year budgetary allocation for health was unlikely to reach the targeted level of 2.5 per cent of the GDP by 2025.

""Due to the low government expenditure on health, most spending on healthcare is paid out of pocket. Due to which out-of-pocket expenditures have emerged as a major cause of poverty for low and middle income families,"" it said.

Recognising this, the committee, while making its recommendation in the report, highlighted that the allocated funds would not only fall short of meeting the current requirements for certain proposed/ongoing health schemes, but also impinge upon achieving the target of 2.5 per cent of the GDP as public health expenditure by 2025."

In July, the appointment of academic staff in HEIs was put on hold by the University Grants Commission (UGC) till the Supreme Court issued its verdict on the special leave petition filed by the HRD Ministry against a court order curtailing reservation for SC/ST and OBCs.

The UGC had announced in March that an individual department should be considered as the base unit to calculate the number of teaching posts to be reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates following an order by the Allahabad High Court in April last year.

Higher education has not seen such crisis in India as before, Sitaram Yechury, leader of CPI(M), said at a press conference organised by the Delhi University Teachers' Association (DUTA).

""Assault on higher education is connected to the ideological project that is being pursued by this government under the direction of the RSS.

""The whole effort is to convert the study of Indian history into the study of Hindu mythology. If you want to assert Hindu mythology as the only history of India then the inherent would be caste biased,"" Yechury added.

When the roster issue had come up, we all protested in Parliament, he said, adding five of the central universities where the advertisements were issued, there were not even a single position for SC, ST and OBCs.

""We raised the issue and the minister concerned assured that there will be an ordinance to overcome the Supreme Court direction. They have issued a notification suspending any recruitment till the issue is resolved. Now they have withdrawn the suspension and if recruitments begin now, a large number of deserving SC/ST will not fight,"" Yechury said.

Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha said he has asked for a short duration discussion in Parliament on the roster issue.

""The education policies implemented under the Modi government are geared towards pushing the marginalised section outside the ambit of higher education.

""Commercialisation of public funded higher education is yet another way to deny education and jobs to Dalit-Bahujan samaj. We have asked for a short duration discussion on the roster,"" he said.

Congress leader Rajeev Gowda accused the central government of destroying the democratic and constitutional values in the country and dividing the country for ""petty political gains"".

""We urge the government to bring in an ordinance (roster issue) immediately after the session finishes or bring a bill within the next eight days,"" he said.

The BJP government has failed the people of India on the issue of reservation in teaching positions, Binoy Viswam, member of Rajya Sabha, said.

Udit Raj, Lok Sabha MP, expressed support to the DUTA and raised the issue of discontinuation of the Rajiv Gandhi fellowship to SC/ST by the government and demanded reservation in judiciary.

There should be a nationwide movement on this issue as the government's inaction on the matter was intentional, alleged Sharad Yadav of Loktantrik Janata Dal."

The BJP-Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) government shortly after coming to power in March after ending the 25 year-rule of the Left Front had set up an expert committee for reviewing the school syllabus.

Education Minister Ratan Lal Nath told reporters that the change would enable the students of the state to be as ""competitive"" as students of the other states. He said the change in curriculum will also take the state's education system to the national level.

The minister had earlier alleged that the Left regime indulged in ""communalisation of school curriculum by teaching wrong lessons to students"".

He said his department had already procured over 2 lakh new books of National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and 64,000 books will soon be reaching the state.

The expert committee set up by the BJP-IPFT government had recommended NCERT curriculum for schools in the state. It had also suggested the implementation of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus across all government and government-aided schools in the state.

The state cabinet had also asked the education department to examine whether the school timings could be changed.

Currently, all government and government-aided schools have two shifts -- morning and afternoon.

Nath said the government had decided to bring an ordinance to constitute a state-level higher education board in accordance with the directives of the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD).

""If the board is not put in place, the MHRD may curtail the outlay under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA),"" he added.

Officials from the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, academics, environmental activists and students from India, US and Bangladesh exchanged inputs at the seven-day workshop, which ended on Thursday in the city campus of IIT Kharagpur here, the institute said in a statement Friday.

The participants deliberated on how best these corridors can be rejuvenated and reconnect the dots between the canals and livelihood matters, considering the fact that any revival of the canal involved innovative, realistic urban planning with temples, markets and squatter settlements located alongside the banks.

The old canal, backbone of the citys drainage system, has almost been wrecked by unchecked construction, related land-fill, the lack of proper waste management and periodic maintenance in past years, the participants observed.

""Multi-faceted, trans-disciplinary approach and planning is required to address the complex issues...Another aspect which surfaced in our exchange was the need to go beyond merely installing sewage treatment plants and find ways to revive the heritage river from Hastings to the Bay of Bengal,"" Prof Jenia Mukherjee of the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences of IIT KGP said.

Urban architects from Sustainable Education and Action in Architecture (SEARCH), Suptendu P. Biswas and Subhadip Biswas at the workshop emphasised on the need to consider the people of the city, especially those residing by the side of the canal, as inseparable part of the urban infrastructure since infrastructure did not merely involve the physical aspect of the city but also its cultural aspect, it said.

Parameshwara maintained a stoic silence, except when reporters asked him about giving up the home ministry. ""That (giving up ministry) has to apply to everyone. Not just me,"" he said.

Then he threatened them with expulsion, a criminal probe and being blacklisted from all Russian universities.

Their crime? Setting up an independent student union.

But Shaidurov and Dautov, children of the social media era, did not take the threats lying down. Instead, they went public about their altercation with the principal last month. The student union's ranks swelled and education authorities in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, came out in support of the teenagers, not the principal.

Many other young Russians have had their first taste of political activism in street protests against corruption and the banning of rap music, protesting the authoritarian status quo that their parents have unhappily gotten used to.

Russian teenagers putting up a social media fight against the rigid, Soviet-like attitudes of some teachers was one of Russia's political highlights of the year.

Shaidurov and Dautov came up with the idea after reading about Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx and the U.S. trade union movement. They realised that their own problems strict and unnecessary testing, dress code restrictions had resonated elsewhere and would make a rallying cause for a student union.

""At first, everyone was laughing at Leonid and me, because it was just the two of us,"" says Dautov, who wears multiple rings and a ""Revolutionary Workers Party"" badge on his scarf.

Two separate groups of the new student union held their first meetings in mid-November at a soccer field near the sprawling concrete school.

Shaidurov, who led both meetings, was summoned to the principal and told he had organized an ""unsanctioned rally"" that would be investigated by prosecutors. His and Dautov's parents were later hauled over the coals.

Later on, police officers visited the school to conduct ""a preventive discussion"" to warn the students about the dangers of staging unsanctioned rallies and extremism, a widely defined term that Russian authorities have used to go after dissenters of all stripes.

At the next parent-teacher meeting, parents were told that their children had joined an ""extremist organization"" and would be blacklisted from entering college, according to Shaidurov's mother, Yelena, who teaches history at the school.

She mounted a social media campaign. Prosecutors went to check the school and found that the girl's rights were violated.

Later, the Perm education department banned schools from strict dress code rules.

In Komsomolsk-on-Amur in Russia's Far East, a teacher has been suspended after a video of her pushing a teenager onto the ground and spanking him was posted online. Investigators have opened a criminal case.

Alexander Kondrashev, a teacher from St. Petersburg who belongs to an independent teachers' union, says the power dynamics between Putin-era teenagers and predominantly Soviet-educated teachers is starkly different from a generation earlier.

""It's much harder for a teacher to control the situation with children these days,"" he said. ""First, children have a clearer idea of their rights and they are ready to stand up for them. And second, audio and video recordings have given them a significant information clout.""

""It's weird, because you can be sent to prison and contract TB at 14, but you can drink and smoke and express yourself fully only when you're 18,"" Dautov says.

The system that Shaidurov and Dautov have been fighting against replicates the Russian government power structure in miniature.

The principal is answerable only to superiors in the education ministry while the students do not have much say in decision-making at school. Shaidurov and Dautov's school has its own student body but it works hand in hand with the administration and lacks any powers.

""We even have a newspaper and a YouTube channel allegedly for students which is dead and no one watches it,"" Dautov says, scoffing at the fact that instead of discussing real issues that students face, from high workloads to image pressures, the existing body debates ""what kind of Christmas tree to put up.

The U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) recently dismissed a protest by a state licensing agency (SLA) challenging the elimination of its proposal from the competitive range under a solicitation issued pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act. In Georgia Business Enterprise Program-Vocational Rehabilitation Agency, GAO held that Randolph-Sheppard Act complaints about the evaluation of its price proposal that made no reference to the Randolph-Sheppard Act or implementing regulations were nevertheless subject to the U.S. Department of Education's (DOE) binding arbitration provisions and therefore could not appropriately be considered by GAO. Following this decision, contractors should be aware that GAO will not hear protests by SLAs seeking to benefit from the Randolph-Sheppard Act priority in food service procurements. SLAs can consider other procedures for raising and litigating their concerns, such as an agency-level protest and/or a DOE arbitration.

The Randolph-Sheppard Act is a federal law that mandates a federal priority for blind persons to operate ""vending facilities"" on federal government property. Vending facilities governed by Randolph-Sheppard Act regulations include cafeterias, cart service, snack bars and automatic vending machines. The Randolph-Sheppard Act directs the DOE to designate SLAs, which are state agencies responsible for recruiting, training and licensing blind individuals or persons with a vision impairment to manage vending facilities.

In practice, SLAs act as prime contractors and train and license blind individuals to act as managers of dining facilities. The blind vendor often works with a government contractor specializing in food services as a teaming partner. The government contractor assists the blind vendor in operations, provides expertise and helps with start-up costs.

The solicitation at issue in Georgia Business Enterprise Program stated that it would be conducted pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act and that the procurement would be set aside for service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. The solicitation was issued by the U.S. Army for food services at various dining facilities located on Fort Benning in Georgia. The designated SLA accordingly submitted a proposal in response to the solicitation.

As explained above, the Randolph-Sheppard Act mandates a federal priority for blind vendors to operate vending facilities on federal government property. However, the Army excluded the SLA's proposal from the competitive range because it ""was not one of the most highly rated proposals and does not have a realistic chance of receiving contract award."" Following its exclusion, the SLA timely filed a protest, arguing that its proposal was improperly excluded from the competitive range.

GAO declined to hear the case on the merits and dismissed the protest because it interpreted the Randolph-Sheppard Act and its implementing regulations as vesting authority with the Secretary of Education regarding SLA complaints concerning an agency's compliance with the act. Notably, the SLA did not reference the Randolph-Sheppard Act once in its protest and instead argued its proposal was improperly excluded from the competitive range. However, despite the noticeable absence of references to the Randolph-Sheppard Act in the protest itself, GAO still found that the SLA's protest implicated a potential violation of the act. Based on this interpretation, GAO concluded that it did not have bid protest jurisdiction to hear complaints subject to the Randolph-Sheppard Act's binding arbitration provisions -- despite the protester not referencing the Randolph-Sheppard Act once in its protest.

The obvious takeaway from the Georgia Business Enterprise Program decision is that it is likely futile for a SLA to file a protest with GAO related to evaluation of proposals under solicitations for which the SLA is seeking to invoke the Randolph-Sheppard priority. However, the Georgia Business Enterprise Program decision does not go so far as to say that contractors cannot utilize the GAO protest forum as a means filing a pre-award protest of improprieties in solicitations for food services unrelated to compliance with the Randolph-Sheppard Act.

Further, while GAO correctly notes that disappointed SLAs may initiate the binding arbitration process of the DOE, SLAs, their licensed vendors and support contractors should be aware that complaints filed to the Secretary of the DOE through this process are lengthy, take over a year or more, and do not result in an automatic stay. Another option available to disappointed SLAs is to raise concerns directly with the agency via an agency-level protest. While no guarantee exists the agency will respond to an agency protest, agencies have the flexibility to consider such concerns and take voluntary corrective action under the FAR 33.103 agency-level protest process as a matter of business discretion, notwithstanding the Randolph-Sheppard arbitration process. Filing an agency-level protest offers a much more expedited process than the DOE arbitration process.

Holland & Knight's Government Contracts team is ready to assist SLAs and their licensed vendors and contractor teaming partners in protests and complaints related to solicitations involving the Randolph-Sheppard Act's priority.

It seems that former chief minister Siddaramaiah succeeded in his effort to give important portfolios to his loyalists.

Deputy chief minister G Parameshwara has had to part with the much coveted Home portfolio and it has gone to Siddaramaiah loyalist MB Patil. According to sources, Parameshwara was very reluctant to give up the Home department and only did so after a nudge from Congress chief Rahul Gandhi.

In return, he will continue being in charge of the cash rich Bengaluru development authority and will add IT-BT and law and parliamentary affairs to his kitty.

The list of portfolios was cleared by Gandhi and sent to Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy by KC Venugopal, AICC general secretary and Karnataka-in charge. Eight Congress ministers were inducted into the Kumaraswamy cabinet last week.

Venugopal, who was in Bengaluru this week to discuss and finalise portfolios, is said to have faced resistance from G Parameshwara for being asked to part with Home and siding with Siddaramaiah.

The deputy CM had reportedly left the meeting midway and asked CLP leader Siddaramaiah and others to ""take a call"", after expressing reluctance to give up any of his portfolios. He contended he had worked to get the deputy CM's post and the portfolios to suit the stature.

Even during the cabinet expansion, Siddaramaiah is said to have had his way as several of his loyalists made their way into the cabinet this time.

Both Parameshwara and Siddaramaiah have denied any disagreement. ""I had no problem in letting go of the portfolios for the newly inducted cabinet ministers. This formula will apply to all senior ministers. I will abide by the decision of AICC president Rahul Gandhi,"" Parameshwara said.

Other senior ministers have also had to give up some ministries to accommodate the new members of the cabinet. Medical education, which was under DK Shivakumar, has been given to E Tukaram, and Shivakumar will take charge of Kannada and Culture from Jayamala. He will also add Information and Public Relations to his portfolio.

Satish Jarakiholi, a newly inducted minister, has been given forest, which was with independent MLA R Shankar before he was dropped from the cabinet last week.

A ninety-nine year old educationist P. Chitran Namboodirippad is not only passionate about studies but climbing the hills as well. Namboodirippad who turned 99 on December 19 trekked in the Himalayas for the 29th time this month, reported The Hindu.

The former Additional Director of Kerala Education department wants to make his 30th trek next year when he completes a century. He has always aspired to do 30 trips, he informed the publication. The 29th trek was taken as part of a 118-member group from Thiruvananthapuram which made its way to the holy shrines of Badrinath and Kedarnath in the first week of December.

While many of us might give up even when we are young and full of vigour, Namboodirippad continued with his venture despite recalling his first trek to be a complete flop. An upset stomach is one of the most common problems that a trekker experiences. Namboodirippad was no different.

""I went with one of my friends. But we couldn't go beyond Rudraprayag as both of us were hit by food poisoning."" he recalls when he first started trekking in 1952.

However, his second attempt to the snow-capped mountains was successful even when the roads weren't as developed as they are now. He said that they had to walk through forests for more than 90 km from Rudraprayag to reach Badrinath.

The educationist informed that he fancied the Himalayas since his childhood. One of his neighbours would share his adventure stories with him and this sparked an interest in trekking. ""Its peace will attract anyone."" he told The Hindu.

It is neither easy nor advisable for people who are unfit to undertake such excursions. A healthy body is thus, essential to go on a trek and to be in one's nineties and go on a hike 29 times requires serious grit and determination."

If there was a fight for the home ministry portfolio between Parameshwara and Siddaramaiah, it would appear that the latter had the last laugh. Parameshwara had to give up his portfolio in favour of newly inducted minister MB Patil.

According to sources, Parameshwara was reluctant to give up the coveted profile, as he claimed that he has worked a lot to be in the position he is today. However, apart from the important task of governing Bengaluru as the city's development minister, Parameshwara was also given additional charges of IT-BT, law and parliamentary affairs.

Another new minister CS Shivalli will now take care of Ramesh Jarkiholi's municipal administration portfolio.

Ramesh Jarkiholi has been fueling rumours of defecting or quitting the party by expressing his disappointment at being dropped to mediapersons. This came after senior Congress MLA Lakshmi Hebbalkar spoke about her 'sorrow' at Ramesh Jarkiholi being dropped from the Cabinet.

He also ordered a shakeup of the kingdom's supreme council that oversees matters related to security. The council is headed by the king's son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose powers including roles as deputy prime minister and defence minister, were untouched in the overhaul.

The changes appear to further consolidate the crown prince's grip on power by appointing to key posts advisers and members of the royal family seen as close to him.

It may also signal further efforts to show that changes are being made after the US Senate passed a resolution saying it believes the crown prince is to blame for Khashoggi's grisly murder inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

As the crown prince struggles to convince many in Washington and other Western capitals that he had nothing to do with Khashoggi's killing, the soft-spoken Adel al-Jubeir was replaced as foreign minister by Ibrahim al-Assaf, a longtime former finance minister. Al-Jubeir was appointed as minister of state for foreign affairs at the Foreign Ministry.

Tightening the Grip

Al-Assaf is well known to international investors, having led several Saudi delegations to the World Economic Forum in Davos. He served as finance minister under King Fahd and King Abdullah.

Al-Assaf sits on the boards of oil-giant Saudi Aramco and the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund. The crown prince oversees both entities. He holds a PhD in Economics from Colorado State University and a master's degree from the University of Denver, according to his biography on Aramco's website.

Al-Assaf had been serving as a minister of state last year when he was reportedly detained at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh along with dozens of high-ranking officials and princes in an anti-corruption sweep led by the crown prince. Shortly after, al-Assaf appeared back at a Cabinet meeting to the surprise of many.

The government did not name those detained nor disclose what crimes they were suspected of committing. The Associated Press could not independently confirm reports of al-Assaf's arrest.

The opaque anti-corruption sweep helped Prince Mohammed consolidate power and net the government more than $13 billion in settlements.

The changes announced on Thursday include aides to the crown prince, including Musaed al-Aiban as national security adviser - in addition to other positions he holds - and former media minister Awwad al-Awwad as adviser to the royal court. Khalid al-Harbi was named as head of general security.

Turki al-Sheikh, a confidant of the crown prince, was removed as head of the Sports Authority and replaced by Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal.

Khashoggi Fallout

This means al-Sheikh no longer oversees a cybersecurity and programming body that was led by Saud al-Qahtani, a close aide to the crown prince who was fired from his post and sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for helping to mastermind the plot that led to Khashoggi's killing.

Khashoggi wrote critically of the crown prince in columns for The Washington Post before he was killed. After denying any knowledge of Khashoggi's death for weeks, Saudi authorities eventually settled on the explanation that he was killed in an operation masterminded by former advisers to Prince Mohammed. The kingdom denies the crown prince had any involvement.

Al-Sheikh will now lead the General Entertainment Authority, a body created in recent years to help organise and promote concerts and other events that had long been banned in the conservative country.

Turki Shabbaneh, who has held positions in privately owned Saudi TV channels, was named minister of media. Hamad al-Sheikh, a royal court adviser and former college dean who studied in the US, was appointed minister of education.

The king's eldest son, Prince Sultan bin Salman, was removed as head of the tourism authority. He will lead a new national space agency. In 1985, he became the first Arab and Muslim astronaut to fly in space.

Prince Abdullah bin Bandar was named head of the National Guard. The force is tasked primarily with the protection of the Al Saud ruling family. Prince Abdullah had been deputy governor of Mecca.

The Department of Education has initiated the process to introduce the NCERT curriculum to replace the existing one prescribed by the State Council of Educational Research and Training, Education Minister Ratan Lal Nath told reporters after the Cabinet meeting on Thursday. The meeting ended late in the evening.

The minister said the department has already procured over 2 lakh new books and 64,000 books will soon be reaching the state. The change in curriculum will take the state's education system to the national level, he added.

Shortly after coming to power in March this year, the BJP-Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) government set up an expert committee for reviewing school syllabus.

The panel had recommended the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) curriculum for schools in the state.

The panel had also suggested the implementation of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus across all government and government-aided schools in the state.

The state Cabinet has also asked the education department to examine whether school timings could be changed.

Currently all government and government-aided schools have two shifts -- the morning shift and the afternoon shift.

Nath said the government has decided to bring an ordinance to constitute a state-level higher education board in accordance with the directives of the Ministry of Human Resource Development.

""If the board is not put in place, the MHRD may curtail outlay under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA),"" he said.

The first information report, filed on court orders, also names her mother and an uncle. The case was registered against the three on a complaint by the father of another rape accused, who is in jail, said senior police officer Harish Kumar on Thursday.

He said complainant had alleged that the survivor, her uncle and mother had procured a forged age certificate to implicate his son Shubham in the rape case, said Kumar.

The police said the case was registered against the family members under sections related to cheating and forgery.

The complainant had moved the court saying the school transfer certificate, purportedly made by Raebareli school and produced as the age certificate, was forged to frame his son, police said.

The survivor's uncle is presently in jail in connection with another case. The complainant's wife and son are accused in the rape case and have been in jail since April along with the main accused, BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

Sengar, a four-time lawmaker from Unnao, was charged by the CBI with raping the girl at his residence in Makhi village on June 4 last year.

The girl was again abducted and raped by a separate group of accused, allegedly including complainant's son Shubhan Singh, his driver Naresh Tiwari and one Brijesh Yadav between June 11 and June 20, 2017.

The complainant, Harpal Singh alleged that the rape survivor had an affair with a man named Awadesh Tewari, with whom she had eloped in September 2017, and returned sometime later.

After she returned, her family had begun persuading his son Shubham to marry her, the complaint said.

When Shubham refused to marry her, the family filed a case against him and his mother on charges of kidnapping as well as various offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, alleged Haripal Singh.

He also alleged that the rape survivor's family had forged her age certificate with a fake date of birth, purportedly issued from a school in Raebareli as proof.

Both the education department official and the school principal have denied signing the certificate, Haripal Singh claimed.

The Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government's ""inaction"" against the party lawmaker in the case had drawn scathing criticism from the Allahabad High Court.

The state government had subsequently transferred the case to the CBI nearly 10 months after the alleged crime took place."

Female central government employees are entitled to child care leave in three spells in a year.

The order issued by the Department of Personnel and Training defines 'single' male government employees as ""an unmarried or widower or divorcee government servant"". While the order grants child care leave to male staffers, it also introduced a cut in salary drawn for the latter half of the 730-day period.

The 7th Pay Commission had recommended extending the benefit of child care leave to single male parents.

""The commission notes that in the event a male employee is single, the onus of rearing and nurturing the children falls squarely on his shoulders. Hence, extension of CCL to single male parents is recommended,"" the 7th Pay Commission had said in its report.

Ever since the coalition government of the Congress-JD(S) was formed in Karnataka, there has been outspoken dissidence within the party leaders. In the latest turn of events, about eight ministers were newly inducted into the Cabinet a few days ago without being allotted any ministries.

As per reports, after consulting Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Karnataka in-charge K C Venugopal announced the ministries that have been allotted to the ministers. In the last two days, there had reportedly been heated arguments between DyCM Dr Parameshwara and former chief minister Siddaramaiah, as the former denied any intentions of giving up Bengaluru Development and Home portfolios.

Here's the entire list of ministers and their portfolios as shared by Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president Dinesh Gundurao.

M B Patil, known to be a close-aide of Siddaramaiah has now been given charge of the Home Department. Congress strongman D K Shivakumar who had been adamant on holding onto the Medical Education portfolio has now lost it to E Tukaram.

In Belagavi, Ramesh Jarkiholi has been upset with the party for stripping him off the Cabinet. On the other hand, his brother Satish Jarkiholi has been given the Forest, Ecology and Environment departments. There are also reports of Jarkiholi meeting Amit Shah in Delhi."

From darkness to light. Or so I thought when I heard about my shifting from the dark dungeons of coal mines, as coal secretary, to the bright lights of school education, as secretary for school education and literacy.

However, I discovered soon that in the coal sector, mining was underground and mafias operated above it, but in the minefield of school education, it was the other way round. All the education mafias existed underground, and they were all masked, masquerading as so-called noble giants. Having taken on some of the mafias of the coal sector and partly succeeded in bringing the sector to order, the task was now to handle these 'noble giants'. It was made more difficult as there was no public outrage against invisible scams in education as was in the case of coal.

Everything seemed to be apparently in order.

To make matters worse, I was the fifth person to hold the charge of secretary in the education department in just two and a half years. Most of my predecessors with impeccable credentials in the education sector did not continue or were not allowed to continue. The government apparently found in me to be the most 'educated' person (I had never worked in this sector except for a brief tenure of three months in 1997 in adult education in Uttar Pradesh) to handle this sector.

It would be an understatement to state that the education sector was in bad shape - both in terms of budgetary allocation and human resource management.

The budgetary allocation for school education was Rs 55,115 crores during 2014-15. This amount got reduced in subsequent years. For instance, the allocation for 2016-17 was Rs 43,554 crore.

On the human resource front too, the situation was alarming. The department had five secretaries between 2014 and 2016. A number of joint secretaries were also changed during this period. It was like musical chairs reminiscent of my days in UP where it was rumoured that the only industry flourishing was the transfer industry.

In the two biggest states of the country, the positioning of top management followed a peculiar pattern. Whereas in UP, there were two additional chief secretary-level officers manning school education and secondary education separately (creating huge coordination problems), in the state of Bihar, one officer looked after both the education and health departments. Consequently, the health of education continues to suffer.

In addition to this, the mafias were having a field day, eating into the system, like termites. Fortunately, like all mafias, those in the education sector too were not a majority, but played a dominant role in decision-making. They were extremely well connected and deeply entrenched. There were a host of mafias, but the prominent ones were operating in these areas:

There are around 16,000 B.Ed and D.El.Ed colleges in the country. A large number of these exist only in name. If you pay them well, you can get a degree without an effort. It was rumoured that if you pay them more, they could even arrange for a 'naukri' (a government job). Action was initiated by then chairman of National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) Santosh Mathews, an upright officer, by issuing notices to all the colleges to furnish the details of their existence on affidavits. The idea was to ensure that only those that actually existed got recognition and in case of wrong information they could be prosecuted. It worked initially, but the colleges realised that quite a few of them could be in trouble. Despite the support he got from most of the states, he was put under enormous pressure by the mafias who took the 'judicial' route to pin down the chairman. He had to quit.

In a few northern states of the country, a number of examination centres are given on 'theka' (contract) for copying. These centres are highly 'priced' as they facilitate mass copying or cheating during examinations. The current chief minister of UP, Yogi Adityanath, came down heavily on this mafia. This was last done by Kalyan Singh in 1991, but thereafter no chief minister could dare to do that. Consequent to the steps taken in UP in this year's exams, more than one million students chose not to give exams. It is a reflection of the 'addiction' to mass copying.

The publishing industry thrives on the education sector. People with vested interests want to maintain status quo as this benefits them. It happens at two levels. As respective state governments provide free books to students, there are various ways in which money is made. The 'mandatory cuts' in getting the books printed centrally constitutes a substantial portion. The initiative taken by the UP government in 2018 and the consequent savings thereunder lends credence to this allegation. The Bihar government is toying with the idea of direct benefit transfers recognising the 'dealings' inherent in central printing and distribution.

The other level of money making is done by a handful of private publishers who enter into an 'arrangement' with the private schools in the name of quality, and compel the students to buy almost four to five times more expensive books as compared to the NCERT ones. If all the students of around 20,000 CBSE-affiliated schools were to source NCERT books, there would be an estimated annual expenditure of around Rs 650 crores. Compared to this, if they source books from private publishers, it would cost around Rs 3,000 crores per annum. The difference is too great to justify the quality argument.

The NCERT did a wonderful job in the current academic year to ensure that books were available on time so that the students were not compelled to buy expensive books, but this effort will need to continue. The NCERT will always be under pressure from people with vested interests to be 'inefficient'.

Most of the private schools in India contribute enormously to imparting quality education. However, some of them are bringing a bad name to this segment. There are some extremely powerful individuals who are able to get away with the most immoral things in education. They violate various norms, legal and ethical, with impunity because having been part of the official machinery at some point in time they know the tricks of the trade.

Irrational hiking of fee, charging huge sums of money to 'lend' their brand, harassing the brand assignees are some of the many tricks they practice. The chairperson of the CBSE Rajesh Chatur who chose to take them on was shown the door in 2017. His successor, Anita Karwal, one of the finest civil servants, was also set to be 'sacrificed'. But she held her ground despite pressure.

The good news in all of this is yet again from UP where the state has enacted a law on the fee regulation after consulting all the stakeholders. Hence, the legislation has been welcomed by all. Hopefully, other states will follow suit.

Deputy chief minister G Parameshwara has had to part with the much coveted Home portfolio and it has gone to Siddaramaiah loyalist MB Patil. According to sources, Parameshwara was very reluctant to give up the Home department and only did so after a nudge from Congress chief Rahul Gandhi.

In return, he will continue being in charge of the cash rich Bengaluru development authority and will add IT-BT and law and parliamentary affairs to his kitty.

The list of portfolios was cleared by Gandhi and sent to Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy by KC Venugopal, AICC general secretary and Karnataka-in charge. Eight Congress ministers were inducted into the Kumaraswamy cabinet last week.

Venugopal, who was in Bengaluru this week to discuss and finalise portfolios, is said to have faced resistance from G Parameshwara for being asked to part with Home and siding with Siddaramaiah.

The deputy CM had reportedly left the meeting midway and asked CLP leader Siddaramaiah and others to ""take a call"", after expressing reluctance to give up any of his portfolios. He contended he had worked to get the deputy CM's post and the portfolios to suit the stature.

Even during the cabinet expansion, Siddaramaiah is said to have had his way as several of his loyalists made their way into the cabinet this time.

Both Parameshwara and Siddaramaiah have denied any disagreement. ""I had no problem in letting go of the portfolios for the newly inducted cabinet ministers. This formula will apply to all senior ministers. I will abide by the decision of AICC president Rahul Gandhi,"" Parameshwara said.

Other senior ministers have also had to give up some ministries to accommodate the new members of the cabinet. Medical education, which was under DK Shivakumar, has been given to E Tukaram, and Shivakumar will take charge of Kannada and Culture from Jayamala. He will also add Information and Public Relations to his portfolio.

In a circular issued by the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) on Wednesday, the principals or heads of schools (HOSs) were asked to ""strictly"" comply with the norms. ""This is to bring to the notice of principals/HoSs of all the private recognised unaided schools functioning within the territory of Delhi that a large number of school vans are operating illegally for ferrying students between their homes and schools without taking adequate safeguards towards safety of school children. It is also known that these vans are primarily hired by the parents. The Delhi traffic police and transport department have tried to impress upon the concerned school principals to brief parents not to use these school vehicles, which are not following norms,"" said DoE director Sanjay Goel in the circular.

It, however, added that the school principals were responsible for the safety of children. ""The concerned school administration shall be held responsible for non-compliance of directions by the school vans/cabs being used to ferry students of their schools, especially in cases where such vehicles (owned by schools or hired by parents) meet with accidents resulting in injury or death of the school children. The necessary action shall also be taken against the defaulting schools in case such an unfortunate accident happens,"" Goel said in the circular.

The move comes a month after an eight-year-old student of a private school was killed and nine other children were injured when a speeding goods carrier hit an overloaded private school van in north Delhi's Dheerpur. The incident had prompted the Delhi government to ask the transport department to formulate a fresh school cab policy by January 2019.

As per the Supreme Court guidelines, school vehicles should follow several norms -- such as having 'on school duty' written prominently on the back and the front, horizontal grilles on windows, first-aid boxes, fire extinguishers, reliable locks, experienced drivers and at least one conductor. The speed of the vehicle should not exceed 50km/h.

Meanwhile, the committee of private recognised and unaided schools in Delhi termed the government's order as 'impractical'.

""How is it even possible for the schools to monitor thousands of private vehicles ferrying students across the city. We take complete responsibility of children at the school campuses. But how can we keep a tab on all the modes of transport parents are choosing over school vans.

Following a directive issued by the state government, the District Education Officer (DEO) conducted checks in 35 schools and found that the weight of the bags was heavier by 2 kgs for almost all students studying in Class I and II.

The DEO not only examined the bags, but he also weighed them. According to officials students are carrying bags heavier that what the government has prescribed. The education department has asked the DEO to conduct inspections in three schools each week.

On 30 January 2019, or by the first week of February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to lay the foundation stone at the Rs 1,000 crore Umiya Dham, developed by the powerful Kadva Patidar community in Ahmedabad.

This will be the PM's second visit to Gujarat after making a trip to the state for the Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2019. For the state BJP, the event will be significant to regain its strong Patidar vote bank for the 2019 General elections after the Patidar reservation movement dented the BJP's image.

The Vishwa Umiya Foundation has said that the Umiya Dham will be spread across an area of 2 lakh square meters.

The circular has come as a relief for students who were upset with the Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board (KSEEB)'s plan to ban all watches.

""The reports of ban on all kinds of watches created lots of confusion and we're worried about time management,"" said Tanu Kamath, a student from Jayanagar.

Another student, Kanika V from JP Nagar, said: ""I'm happy with this decision. I had actually started practising writing examination without using a watch. How could they even think of banning all watches when students do not have enough time to look at the wall clock while writing exam?""

On November 28, 2018, TOI had reported about the students' demand to ban only smart watches. KSEEB had earlier suggested keeping only wall clocks in exam halls in the wake of malpractices committed by students with the help of digital watches.

""People deployed for frisking at exam centres will be alerted about the ban on smart watches or cheating watches,"" said KSEEB director V Sumangala.

Though students wear smart watches inside SSLC exam halls, no such cheating case has been reported so far. Instances of digital watches being used to commit malpractices in exams conducted by other boards and universities prompted the proposal, said KSEEB officials.

About 8.4 lakh students will write the exams, beginning from March 21.

Restriction needed

During exams, students are reminded every now and then about the time left to finish writing paper. Restriction on use of only smart watches is a safer option, as banning all sorts of watches might make students anxious

Rupa D Kini, principal, Shantiniketan English Medium School, Udupi

Wrist watches are not necessary for students as they will be updated about the time. The decision to restrict students from wearing digital watches will certainly curb malpractices. Students often employ various tactics during board examinations, and now, they will be controlled

R Srilakshmi, teacher

I'm happy with the decision to ban digital watches. Students cleverly use them for other purposes rather than checking time during exams. It's a distraction for others too

YALAMBOJOCH, Guatemala (Reuters) - Between heavy sobs, Catarina Alonzo explained that when her husband left Guatemala to try to reach the United States, they hoped taking their 8-year-old son would make it easier for the pair to get in. Instead, the boy fell ill and died.

Detained on the U.S. border, Felipe Gomez Alonzo died late on Christmas Eve in a New Mexico hospital a few weeks after setting off with his father, becoming the second Guatemalan child to die this month while in U.S. custody.

The two deaths have led to increased criticism of the Trump administration's hardline stance on illegal immigration, as well as fresh scrutiny of why some migrants from Central America travel with children on the long, dangerous road north.

Speaking at her home in a mountainous region of western Guatemala, Catarina Alonzo said neighbours had told the family that taking a child would provide her husband with a way in.

""Lots of them have gone with children and managed to cross, even if they're held for a month or two. But they always manage to get across easily,"" she told Reuters in an interview.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has yet to give an official cause of death for the boy, prompting Democratic lawmakers to intensify calls for an investigation.

The Department of Homeland Security, which says that Felipe Gomez Alonzo and 7-year-old Jakelin Caal, who died on Dec. 8, were the first children to die in CBP custody in a decade, this week said it would step up medical checks of migrant children to try to prevent any more deaths.

Alonzo, an indigenous Maya and native speaker of Chuj, has little Spanish and communicated through a translator. Wearing a sweatshirt and a purple dress, she spoke outside her hut in Yalambojoch, a village of about 1,000 people near the Mexican border.

She related how her son and his father, Agustin, an agricultural worker, had left in early December to find work in the United States to pay off debts. The two also hoped the boy would get a better education in the United States, she said.

Still, Alonzo said her husband had doubts and at one point decided he did not want to take the boy. But that upset the boy, so they resolved he should go.

Alonzo's sobs could be heard for minutes outside the house before she came out to be interviewed. Afterwards she went back inside to a tiny altar she had adorned with three photos of the boy that a local school teacher had printed out for her.

The altar stood to one side of a room with cement walls that serves as a bedroom and living area for Alonzo and her three surviving children. Adjoining it was a kitchen with a dirt floor and wooden walls.

Her husband remains in U.S. custody.

""NOW OR NEVER""

Marta Larra, a spokeswoman for Guatemala's Foreign Ministry, said smugglers known as ""coyotes"" often encourage migrants to take children as a form of ""visa."" Many coyotes, she noted, are trusted by migrant families, so their word carries weight.

But Lucas Perez, the mayor of Yalambojoch, said some coyotes are only interested in ripping off people. Still, for many migrants trying to cross the U.S. border, taking a child along was the ""only option,"" he told Reuters.

Describing migration from the area as ""constant,"" Perez estimated about 200 people from the tiny village live in the United States.

Agustin Gomez, the boy's father, has two brothers in the United States he hoped to meet, his wife said.

Next to her hut, labourers worked on a two-story concrete house with a twin-gabled, tiled roof - evidence of the money coming back from the United States, the mayor said.

Under U.S. law, families from countries that do not border the United States cannot be immediately deported, and because of a longstanding legal settlement, there are restrictions on how long U.S. authorities can detain migrant children.

As a result, families with children are often released to await an immigration court hearing, which can be scheduled well into the future due to ballooning backlogs.

U.S. President Donald Trump has tried to reverse the policy, which he calls ""catch and release,"" but has been blocked by lawsuits in federal court.

His Democratic opponents have seized on the deaths of the two Guatemalan children to attack his policies. On Thursday, Senator Dianne Feinstein urged the Senate to hold a hearing in the new year on how children are treated in U.S. custody.

In the meantime, Trump's insistence on building a southern border wall has given coyotes a fresh argument to promote migration, Larra said.

""According to interviews (with migrants), the coyotes are saying 'it's now or never' because the wall is going to be built, and it won't be possible to cross,"" she said.

The DEO after examining the bag physically, even weighed them.

The officials said that in majority of the cases, the students were found to be carrying bags heavier than what the government has prescribed. In some of the schools, the management had followed the government resolution and made changes in the time-table.

The state government had earlier issued a directive to all district education officers and district primary education officers to conduct surprise raids in schools and check the weight of schoolbags carried by children.

The education department has asked all DEOs to carry out checks in at least three schools every week irrespective of the board to which a school belongs. DEOs have been asked to check schools affiliated to Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board according to Gujarat government rules, while those affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education will be checked according to CBSE standards.

In the last week of November, after the government of India's decision, the Gujarat government had also announced that it will act against schools not following the schoolbag weight criteria and that are forcing children to carry bulky bags.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said, ""We have issued a directive to all education officers to check and prepare a list of schools flouting schoolbag norms. We will first issue notices and if the schools fail to reduce the bag weights we will penalize them. The government is working outthe penalty for such schools.""

Chudasama said no homework is to be assigned to students of classes I and II. Only half an hour of homework can be given classes III to V students and the same for Classes VII and VIII students can be one hour per day.

A district education officer said, ""It will be difficult for us to check the exact weight of the bags as we will not be carrying weighing machines. Inspectors who will be going to the schools will be using their own judgment by looking at the bags and holding it in their hands.""

He said, ""We have asked the schools to schedule their periods in such a way that the student is not required to carry all text books. According to government direction classes for only three to four subjects are to be held in a day. The notebooks for homework and classwork should not be separate. There shall be no separate notebook for essay writing."""

On the occasion, Sharma said that he will work towards 'zero tolerance on corruption' in the health department. He also said that his ""top priority"" would be to ensure easy access and affordability to healthcare services for each and every citizen in the state.

Later, both the ministers held a meeting of officials from medical and health, medical education and Ayurveda departments.

Answering question from media at the health directorate soon after taking charge Dr Sharma said that the government has mentioned its priorities about health sector in state in its election manifesto and he, along with the department officials will work to implement all 24 points mentioned in that.

""We will hold meetings with officials after which priorities will be set according to the needs and suggestions. The framework will be decided after the Cabinet meeting,"" said Dr Sharma.

""We will work with zero tolerance on corruption and I appeal everyone to inform us about any single information of corruption or irregularities in the department so that it can be fixed at the same time,"" said Dr Sharma.

Subhash Garg, MoS, health said that the department will not follow any VIP culture as the previous government did, but he emphasized on the need of a control room at every hospital where every person coming to there can get assistance and necessary information about the treatment.

Sources said that V Balakrishnan IPS, joint commissioner of police (Chennai Central Crime Branch) was asked to leave the premises three months ago. He is yet to move out. When contacted, Balakrishnan said, ""I've sought a short extension and will soon be vacating the quarters.""

Authorities have not been able to explain how IPS and IAS officers, who have nothing to do with the university, managed to get quarters here. Earlier, five others including retired teaching staffs and a secretary, who was working in the state higher education department, left the quarters after receiving similar instructions. The move is aimed at allocating the quarters to deserving teachers who have been on the waiting list for more than four years, said a source. According to official data, Anna University, Chennai has 626 permanent teachers. But only about 200 of them are living in the quarters; 400 others are on the wait list.

Through some of these measures, the university was able to bring down the cost involved in organising a convocation ceremony from Rs 60 lakh in the previous years to Rs 20 lakh now. Some of the arrangements like providing lunch for parents of medal winners and toppers, however, continue. From this year, Anna University toppers will also get medals with real gold in place of the plated ones in the previous years.

It also serves to give a message to various regions and communities, as it places senior legislators with prior experience in positions where swift action is needed before elections.

While chief minister Gehlot gets to keep nine departments, including home, finance and planning, his deputy, Sachin Pilot, gets two vital departments that ensure grassroots connect for the PCC president. Once again through portfolio allocation Congress shows it is laying out battle lines for the general elections of 2019.

Congress had been in agitation mode over the last three years. It successfully cashed in on the ire of Brahmin and Rajput communities, who were committed voters of BJP.

The Congress governments have announced loan waiver for farmers, but its implementation needs to be carried out on priority. This places a huge responsibility on Gehlot and agriculture minister Lal Chand Kataria. Congress's plan of restarting Gehlot's free medicine scheme rests with Raghu Sharma who has medical and health, while two most important portfolios of the desert state, water and electricity, are with BD Kalla.

Equally important to loan waiver is ensuring water to farmers for the rabi crops. With important portfolios between them, these two also serve as poster boys of Gehlot government and spread the message of inclusiveness by according importance to the Brahmin community.

Similarly Pratap Singh Khachariyawas and Bhanwar Singh Bhati the two Rajput ministers have important portfolios. Khachariyavas has transport and Sainik Kalyan, which is important in Rajasthan, the state where the number of martyrs is high. Bhati has independent charge of higher education.

Pilot's portfolios ensure enhanced grassroots connect. His charge as PCC president along with minister of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj places him in direct connect with the public representatives.

Land regularisation and registration of lands is an important issue in the urban areas and senior man on the post for UDH is Shanti Dhariwal, who has the requisite experience of having done the same in his first tenure. Two departments that were cause of much trouble for BJP, the mines department and cow ministry, go to senior legislator Pramod Bhaya who has the task of keeping it away from controversy.

The ministers who took charge of office on Thursday have approximately 100 days of work before general elections are announced. This places before them the challenge of performing before general elections next year."

Gehlot council carries a distinction in several fields. It has 18 MLAs who became first-time ministers. Also, a balance between the young and the old ministers is amplfied in the free hand given to the ministers of state.

There are 13 state ministers, 10 cabinet ministers apart from Gehlot and Pilot taking the strength of the council of ministers in Rajasthan to 25. Each minister of state has been allotted four to five portfolios. In a departure from the norm, each minister has received at least one or two departments of which they have independent charge. This essentially means they do not have to report to a cabinet minister and can work on, and decide independently within their respective departments.

Govind Singh Dotasara, who has become a minister for the first time, has been allotted three departments- Education, Tourism and Devasthan. His education portfolio comes with independent charge, while he will have to work under Cabinet minister Vishvendra Singh for tourism and Devasthan affairs.

Similarly, Bhanwar Singh Bhati has independent charge of higher education, in addition to revenue colonization and Command Area Development, for which his Cabinet superior is Harish Choudhary.

Mamta Bhupesh (women and child development), Arjun Bamnia (Tribal Area Development), Sukhram Vishnoi (Forest, Environment), Ashok Chandna (Youth Affairs, Skill Development), Tikaram Juli (Labour, Factories and Boilers inspection), Bhajan Lal Jatav (Home guards, Government Press), Rajendra Singh Yadav (Planning (Manpower), State Motor Garage) and Dr Subhash Garg (Technical Education, Sanskrit Education) will be working as independent ministers.

Among the Cabinet ministers, apart from Pilot, BD Kalla, Shanti Dhariwal and Raghu Sharma have emerged strong ministers in terms of portfolios they have been given. Kalla has been entrusted by two important departments, Energy and PHED, for which two cabinet ministers are usually appointed.

Experts TNM spoke to say that the child is likely to be born without the infection, but the doctors will have to take extreme care and several precautions to ensure that happens.

""The transmission of HIV from a positive mother to an unborn child depends on the 'viral load',"" explains Dr Amrose Pradeep, Chief Medical Officer (CMO) at YR Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRGCare Hospital) in Chennai. ""The highest risk of transmission occurs early on in the acute phase of exposure, because that is when there is a high viral load present.""

Viral load is a unit of measurement used by medical professionals to determine the number of viral matter (in this case the concentration of the HIV virus) in an individual's bloodstream. During the initial period following exposure to the virus - which it is now for the mother, a person is said to have a high viral load. Thus, it would seem that the chance of transmission of the virus to the baby much larger. However, the presence of a healthy placenta shields the child against the virus.

""The virus cannot cross a normal, healthy placenta, and as a result the child will not be affected by the virus at this point,"" he says, but warns, ""A loss of structural integrity of the placenta can result in the virus being transmitted to the baby.""

Placental complications are common during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is at this juncture, if a mother is known to be HIV positive, that extra caution must be taken to ensure that the child is safe. The mother must be started on antiretroviral (ART) medications which will help decrease the viral load and will prevent the onset of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

""As far as I know, the mother has been started on the ART therapy and that is the first step. This will ensure that there is less chance of it being passed on to the child at the time of birth,"" adds Dr Pradeep.

The second instance when the infection can be passed on from the mother to the child is during delivery. Since the child passes through the birth canal and is exposed to the mother's blood and secretions, all of which contain the virus, there is a very high chance the child will be infected. To avoid this, doctors recommend that a C-section delivery is done, to reduce contact with the same fluids.

""After delivery, the child has to be given preventive care as well. For 6 weeks, that is 42 days, a combination of medications must be given,"" said the doctor.

Speaking to media on Wednesday, Dr Radhakrishnan, Tamil Nadu Health Secretary, said that the mother and child would be given the necessary treatment and care to ensure that they are healthy. He added that the child would be started on prophylactic (preventive) medicines once born. ""Nevirapine syrup will be given for about 6 to 12 weeks along with other medications to ensure that the child is not affected,"" he said. Doctors at YRGCare, recommend that nevirapine be given along with another ART medication known as zidovidine.

The case pertains to a 23-year-old pregnant woman who was given a blood transfusion at a government hospital in Sattur of Tamil Nadu's Virudhunagar district. In an effort to improve her anaemic state, doctors recommended that she be transfused with a unit of blood. Days later, it came to light that the blood which she had been transfused with was HIV positive, and in an extreme lapse of processes and possible criminal negligence, it had not been detected by technicians responsible for screening of the blood. The three technicians responsible for the negligence have since been terminated.

Officials from the health department have stated that the cost for treatment would be borne entirely by the government. The mother is currently undergoing treatment and is being monitored by a team of doctors at Madurai's Rajaji Government Hospital."

Nagpur's RC Plasto Tanks and Pipes Private Limited was among the first three players to enter the segment, but Plasto as a brand was nowhere close to the leader.

For Vishal Agrawal, a second generation entrepreneur, it was like a runner trailing far behind in the race trying to fly to the front with all his might in the final minutes. Agrawal took over the family business in 1999. The business, started by his father in 1982, was in the red at that time, among the top three brands but trailing far behind others.

Today, a Rs100 crore company, RC Plasto boasts of the largest production facility at a single place for this product. In terms of market share, the company is third in the country, but with the competitors only ahead by a small margin. By the standards of state's industries department, it is classified as a mega project, employing a 1,000 persons. There are plans to engage another 2,000 as expansion takes place. The company had begun with five employees.

Agrawal says his education as an industrial engineer helped upgrade the product's quality. However, unlike other players, there was no scope for a massive marketing spend to gain market share. The company began with a low profile attempt at direct marketing, and it worked.

""We preferred to directly sell the product in the market. We had our own fleet of trucks, which made logistics easier. Those days major business came from government agencies and other bulk buyers. We exploited the retail segment and soon gained ground,"" said Agrawal.

The strategy was to deliver where the rivals failed. Plasto's focus was on honouring guarantees, which slowly created a space for the brand.

Agrawal says only selling had been the focus in the industry at that time. Guarantees were given, but none bothered to honour the commitment. Plasto ensured that the guarantees were honoured promptly, apart from giving other post sales services.

Soon, the company, which had been struggling to carry on, had a presence in all states. The turnaround began in 2005. The company that could not afford to spend on advertisements, soon had movie star Hrithik Roshan as its brand ambassador. The company is planning an expansion of Rs300 crore at Hingna, where the company has its existing unit. The expansion will happen over the next five years, making it a Rs400 crore company in terms of capital investment.

""The company has changed its strategy with time. With decline in trend of individual homes, where the tanks were needed, the use has also changed,"" he said.

""With droughts in large part of the state, a new sector has emerged where the tanks are sold. Plastic tanks are needed in villages to store water. Instead of rooftop installation, the tanks are simply placed in front of homes in villages to store water in times of scarcity. Even this year, there has been a major demand from Marathwada region of the state. The orders from dealers in this area have doubled,"" he said.

""Given the crisis we are ensuring that the demand from drought-hit areas is met on a priority basis. Apart from business, it also our social responsibility,"" he said."

The resident doctors of KEM Hospital in Parel sold fruits outside the campus on Thursday to protest against the irregular payment of stipend to resident doctors from five government medical colleges in the State for the past seven months. Over 1,000 resident doctors in Nagpur, Akola, Aurangabad, Ambejogai, and Latur have not received their stipend since October.

The protesters have vowed to intensify their stir if authorities fail to keep their promise of paying stipends before the year-end. Dr. Lokeshkumar Chirwatkar, president of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors, said, ""Despite several meetings with State authorities, the issue has not been resolved. We had no choice but to protest.""

Dr. Chirwatkar said they had started protesting when attacks on them increased owing to lack of basic medicines in hospitals. He said, ""Some hospitals did not even have medicines like paracetamol or vitamins. After our protest, the medicine supply became better, but stipends became irregular.""

The Personal Ledger Account Fund in government medical colleges is used to purchase medicines and equipment for hospitals, provide stipend to resident doctors and pay the salaries of security guards. Dr. Pravin Shingare, director of Directorate of Medical Education and Research, said the five colleges fell short of money to pay the stipend as the deans had used the fund to purchase medicines.

Dr. Shingare said, ""We are trying to get the Finance Department to sanction the funds so that we can pay the stipend of the resident doctors in the next two days."""

The Federation of Resident Doctors' Association (FORDA), an umbrella body of resident doctors, is working on a mentorship program for hospitals across the city for doctors struggling to deal with mental and physical issues.

A proposal of the program has been submitted to the mental excellence and health centre at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital.

""Doctors who are from other states are mostly vulnerable as they don't have families and friends here. It is important for them to have somebody they can talk to. This mentorship program will help all doctors who are facing these issues,"" said Dr Sumedh Sandanshiv, president, FORDA. The federation plans to start the program from RML Hospital and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) before extending it to other hospitals.

The program, which is expected to start in each department, will be implemented by the new academic session.

""A few doctors from each department will be identified and an inter-departmental meeting will take place every month. The heads will then report to the governing body, headed by the medical superintendent of the respective hospitals.

ExplainedAt 10%, suicide ideation higher in medical students

A study on depression and suicide ideation in medical students, published in the journal European Psychiatry, said that 10% of medical students experience depression and suicidal ideation -- higher than that for the general population of a similar age (5-8%). A 2012 study by Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) also stated that suicidal ideation among its students was 53.6%. It was the highest in first professional year medical students (64.4%) and lowest among third professional year students (40.4%). Academic stress, taxing hours and the nature of work, doctors say, makes medical students more susceptible to depression. Yet, only a fraction of students have reached out for professional help at AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital. Senior doctors said a renewed discussion on mental health in colleges has to be made part of the formal discourse.

AIIMS constituted a Student Wellness Centre this year, with a dedicated staff of three psychologists. In addition, there is also a 24-hour helpline that connects with a psychiatrist. ""On an average, three people visit the centre for counselling or a follow-up in a day. Though the number is increasing gradually, if we compare it to the total number of students on campus, the figure is less than 10%. Most of them are under-graduate students,"" said Dr Pratap Sharan, professor at the psychiatry department, who also heads student welfare centre.

Phil Murphy, center, visited Princeton Innovation Center BioLabs on July 25 to announce two statewide programs aimed at supporting new and established innovative businesses in New Jersey. Pictured from left to right are Tim Sullivan, chief executive officer of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, Anne-Marie Maman, president of the New Jersey Business Incubation Network and executive director of the Princeton Entrepreneurship Council; Debbie Hart, president and chief executive officer of BioNJ; Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber; and State Treasurer Elizabeth Maher Muoio.

The year 2018 represented a pivotal point in the development of an innovation ecosystem in the heart of New Jersey as Princeton University established significant new collaborations with pioneering members of industry -- all with the aim of bolstering the resources available to researchers and scientists in their quest to make new discoveries in the service of society.

As President Christopher L. Eisgruber noted in July, standing alongside New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy at Princeton Innovation Center BioLabs, ""We believe that these cross-sector partnerships will foster a vibrant innovation ecosystem with the potential to generate transformative ideas, benefit the regional economy and attract top talent -- outcomes that will make central New Jersey an increasingly attractive place for all who live, learn and work here.""

The year kicked off with the opening of the Biolabs facility in Plainsboro at the Princeton Forrestal Center, and closed with Google and the University announcing that a new artificial intelligence laboratory would open in the town of Princeton in January. In between were other developments such as an agreement between the Princeton Catalysis Initiative (PCI) and Celgene Corp., and a Princeton-Microsoft agreement to research biofilms.

Murphy came to the Biolabs site to announce two initiatives to jumpstart the state's innovation ecosystem.

""It's right here in places like this across our state where the innovation economy will be reborn and once again dominate in New Jersey,"" Murphy said. ""These are the spaces where the next great leaps in technology and the life sciences will be made by new companies doing leading-edge research and development.""

These new relationships are described below, drawing from University announcements and related stories.

BioLabs opened in May, taking a major leap in connecting the talent and resources at Princeton to the larger New Jersey entrepreneurial network.

The 31,000-square-foot-facility includes wet labs, dry labs and co-working spaces for Princeton-related tech and life science startups and for companies throughout the region.

""Princeton Innovation Center BioLabs is one of several initiatives designed to strengthen the innovation ecosystem in central New Jersey and thereby expand the impact of Princeton's teaching and research,"" President Eisgruber said at the ceremonial ribbon-cutting.

The facility is designed to encourage collaboration, with shared work areas and many types of meeting spaces where scientists and entrepreneurs can share techniques and spark new ideas.

Eleven companies are tenants of the incubator space, spanning biotechnology, medical devices, battery technology and clean technology. Two of the companies have been spun out of the University by faculty, based on work in their labs: HIT Nano, which focuses on low-cost and high-performance lithium-ion batteries and led by Yiguang Ju, the Robert Porter Patterson Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and director of the Program in Sustainable Energy; and Optimeos, which focuses on building nanoparticles for pharmaceutical use and co-founded by Robert Prud'homme, professor of chemical and biological engineering, and Shahram Hejazi, venture capitalist and professional specialist in electrical engineering and the Keller Center for Innovations in Engineering Education.

Princeton Innovation Center BioLabs won Innovator of the Year from the Regional Chamber of Commerce during their gala awards ceremony in late November.

At the start of 2018, the Princeton Catalysis Initiative launched with the goal of accelerating interdisciplinary collaboration on catalysis across the University and with industry. On Nov. 1, PCI established its first industrial collaboration, a 10-year, $6 million commitment from Celgene Corp.

Catalysis is a key technological driver for solutions to many outstanding problems of increasing social concern, including the development of alternative energy technologies, environmental remediation strategies, access to novel pharmaceuticals and antibiotics, sustainable agriculture, and renewable soft materials.

""PCI will be an academic incubator for new fields of research that will have significant benefit for society,"" said David MacMillan, the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry and director of PCI. ""Princeton is uniquely positioned to be the leader in this movement, and in collaboration with Celgene we expect to make discoveries that will significantly impact human health over the next 10 years and beyond. Celgene brings much more than funding -- collaborators, ideas, and new opportunities for innovation and cross-pollination.""

""We are incredibly excited to enter into this collaboration with the Princeton Catalysis Initiative, said Lawrence Hamann, vice president for chemistry at Celgene. ""The opportunity to engage with absolutely world-class investigators in such a diverse range of scientific fields aligned with Celgene's broad research interests represents a unique and powerful means to advance some cutting-edge basic science.""

Princeton chemistry professors Abigail Doyle and David MacMillan explain catalysis in this video.

As a global research university and leader in innovation, Princeton cultivates mutually beneficial relationships with companies to support the University's educational, scientific and scholarly mission. The University is guided by the principle that initiatives to fortify and connect with the innovation ecosystem will advance Princeton's role as an internationally renowned institution of higher education and accelerate its ability to have greater impact in the world.

The University's relationship with Microsoft is one of its most extensive with industry, spanning collaborations in computer science, cybersecurity and biomedical research.

On Nov. 29, Princeton and Microsoft announced they are teaming up on the leading edge of microbiology and computational research modeling research.

Microsoft is helping Princeton to better understand the mechanisms of biofilm formation by providing advanced technology that will greatly extend the type of research analysis capable today. Biofilms -- surface-associated communities of bacteria -- are the leading cause of microbial infection worldwide and kill as many people as cancer does. They are also a leading cause of antibiotic resistance, a problem highlighted by the World Health Organization as ""a global crisis that we cannot ignore."" Understanding how biofilms form could enable new strategies to disrupt them.

To support Princeton, a Microsoft team led by Dr. Andrew Phillips, head of the Biological Computation group at Microsoft Research, will be working closely with Bonnie Bassler, a global pioneer in microbiology who is the Squibb Professor in Molecular Biology and chair of the Department of Molecular Biologyat Princeton and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, and with Ned Wingreen, the Howard A. Prior Professor in the Life Sciences and professor of molecular biology and the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics.

Using the power of Microsoft's cloud and advanced machine learning, Princeton will be able to study different strains of biofilms in new ways to better understand how they work. Microsoft is contributing a cloud-based prototype that can be used for biological modeling and experimentation that will be deployed at Princeton.

""This collaboration enables us to bring together advances in computing and microbiology in powerful new ways,"" said Brad Smith, president of Microsoft. ""This partnership can help us unlock answers that we hope someday may help save millions of people around the world.""

""By combining our distinctive strengths, Princeton and Microsoft will increase our ability to make the discoveries needed to improve lives and serve society,"" said Christopher L. Eisgruber, president of Princeton University. ""Technology is creating new possibilities for collaboration, and we hope this venture will inspire other innovative partnerships in the years ahead.""

During a visit to campus earlier in the year, Smith, a Princeton alumnus, gave a talk about the growing role of artificial intelligence and its implications for society. He called for people with varied backgrounds and expertise in humanities and public policy to join in discussions to ensure the fair and ethical use of the new technologies.

Google and the University announced Dec . 18 that the company will open an artificial intelligence lab in the town of Princeton in January. Computer science professors Elad Hazan and Yoram Singer will lead the effort, splitting their time working for Google and Princeton.

The lab at 1 Palmer Square will begin with a small number of faculty members, graduate and undergraduate student researchers, recent graduates and software engineers.

Work in the lab will focus on a discipline within artificial intelligence known as machine learning, in which computers learn from existing information and develop the ability to draw conclusions and make decisions in new situations that were not in the original data.

In congratulating the University and Google on the new venture, Gov. Murphy said it's another great step in the innovation economy here in New Jersey."" The governor said he looks forward to ""a great collaboration in artificial intelligence for years to come.""

Citing Princeton's long and groundbreaking involvement in computing, Emily Carter, the dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, said, ""This collaboration is another excellent example of how fundamental insights in mathematics and theoretical computer science drive new technologies with benefits far beyond the original domain of the work.""

Jennifer Rexford, chair of the Department of Computer Science, said the new venture comes at a time of significant growth in computer science and related areas of data science at the University. ""It's an exciting opportunity to work with a leading company while also maintaining the strong academic independence and freedom that is essential to Princeton,"" she said."

About a month after the Department of Primary and Secondary Education stopped the distribution of bicycles to class 8 students in the current academic year, a departmental inquiry has found the quality of cycles to be ""largely satisfactory"".

The Department of Public Instruction, on Wednesday, submitted a report to the State government stating that a majority of the reports that they have collected have found the quality of cycles to be largely satisfactory. The department is now awaiting directions from the State government to decide whether the process of distribution of cycles should recommence.

The department had halted their distribution last month following directions from the Chief Minister, who had received complaints regarding the quality of the cycles. This year, around 4.11 lakh of the total 5.04 lakh cycles have been distributed to class eight students in rural areas under a scheme that was started in 2006-07, when B.S. Yeddyurappa was the Chief Minister. However, around 93,000 students are still to get their cycles after the distribution was stopped.

Following this, the department had initiated an internal inquiry and asked officials to submit a report after carrying out visual tests and random checks at the school level. ""We have received reports from 23 districts and all of them state that the quality of cycles is satisfactory. We have, however, received some complaints regarding the fitting and assembling of the bicycles,"" an official in the department said.

The R&D Centre For Bicycle and Sewing Machine in Ludhiana has already assessed the quality of the cycles and had stated that according to preliminary reports, the bicycles tested were found as per standards.

The department had ordered that officials should carefully examine if around 20 parts mentioned in the checklist had any problems.

""We have received complaints in some places that the side stand, bell, or chain were not fixed properly, or the reflector was missing,"" the official said.

The cost of a cycle for boys is ₹3,457 and for girls it is ₹3,674.

The total cost of the scheme for this academic year is ₹180 crore. This is a 5% escalation from the previous academic year. As many as four companies were given the work order for supply of the cycles."

In his place, Ibrahim Al-Assaf, who previously served in the finance ministry, has been appointed.

King Salman also ordered a shakeup of the kingdom's two supreme councils that oversee matters related to the economy and security, respectively. Both councils are headed by the king's son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose powers, including roles as deputy prime minister and defence minister, were untouched in the overhaul. Jamal Khashoggi's Murder: Turkey Won't 'Give Up' on Probe, Says Minister.

The changes appear to further consolidate the crown prince's grip on power by appointing advisers and members of the royal family seen as close to him.

Adel al-Jubeir, the soft-spoken foreign minister who took over the post in 2015 from the late Prince Saud al-Faisal, was replaced by Ibrahim al-Assaf, formerly a longtime finance minister.

Al-Jubeir was appointed to the rank of minister of state for foreign affairs.

Al-Assaf had been serving as a minister of state prior to being named foreign minister.

He holds a seat on the boards of state-owned oil-giant Saudi Aramco and the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund.

The crown prince oversees both entities.

Al-Assaf's biography on Aramco's website says he holds a Ph.D. in economics from Colorado State University, a master's degree in economics from the University of Denver and a bachelor's degree from King Saud University.

The changes, which impact several key ministries, come as the king and his son, the crown prince, were looking to announce a major reshuffle following Khashoggi's killing by Saudi agents in Istanbul.

The king issued a number of other royal decrees, which were read on state TV, that replaced the ministers of media and education. Turki Shabaneh, a Saudi TV presenter, was named minister of media.

Hamad al-Sheikh was appointed minister of education. Meanwhile, Prince Abdullah bin Bandar -- the son of Prince Bandar Al Saud who once served as Saudi ambassador to Washington -- was named head of the National Guard.

The force is tasked primarily with the protection of the Al Saud ruling family. Prince Abdullah had been deputy governor of Mecca.

One significant change impacts a close aide of the crown prince, Turki al-Sheikh, who was named as head of the kingdom's General Entertainment Authority, a body created in recent years to help organise and promote concerts and other events that had long been banned in the conservative country.

Al-Sheikh, who is known to be close to the crown prince, was replaced as head of the Sports Authority by Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal.

Al-Sheikh's appointment as head of entertainment means he no longer oversees a cybersecurity and programming body that was led by Saud al-Qahtani, a close aid to the crown prince who was fired from his post and sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for helping to mastermind the plot in Istanbul that led to Khashoggi's killing.

Khashoggi, a critic of the crown prince, was killed and dismembered by a team of Saudi agents in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. Saudi Arabia denies the crown prince knew of the plot. He's been supported by President Donald Trump who has touted US-Saudi ties.

The US Senate, however, passed a unanimous resolution saying it believes the crown prince is to blame for the murder.

His critics point to US intelligence reports and say an operation like this could not have happened without his knowledge. The killing badly damaged Prince Mohammed's international image as a transformational leader committed to changes Saudi Arabia's allies in the West long hoped for."

On Thursday, scores of the people associated with Kashmiri Language Union (KLU) including students of Kashmiri language department asked government to save the dying mother tongue.

""Kashmiri language is dying and we are losing our identity day by day,"" shouted protestors at Press Enclave, Srinagar. Besides raising slogans like ""Kashrin Henz Pehchan, Kashir Zaban Kashir Zaban (Identity of every Kashmiri is Kashmiri langue), the protestors asked governor administration to make this language compulsory at higher secondary level in all educational institutions.

They appealed the administration including Director of School Education Ghulam Nabi Itoo to implement the order Via 333 Edu of 2017 which states that mother tongue of Jammu and Kashmir (Kashmiri, Dogri and Bhudhi) should be made compulsory till higher secondary level throughout the state including Chenab valley.

""This is not the matter of just Kashmir students, but every Kashmiri should be worried,"" said Kifayat Ahmad, who is pursing M.A in Kashmiri from Kashmir University.

He said out of more than 200 higher secondary in the Valley, Kashmiri is taught only in 25 to 30 schools, and only nine colleges out of more than 20. ""Every year 100s of students come out from university with Post graduation in Kashmiri language. Many scholars who have qualified NET, JRF in this subject are sitting idle, because we don't have enough schools and colleges where we can teach,"" said another protestor.

One of the protestors said that government should close down ""Kashmiri department"" if they don't want to preserve this language and introduce subjects in all the educational institutions.

The protestors lashed out at government for not creating jobs for Kashmiri teachers in Primary and Higher Secondary Schools and Colleges.

Pertinent to mention, Kashmiri language is being taught in all government schools of Kashmir division up to 9th standard and it is one of the optional subject for class 11th and 12th.

Besides, Kashmir University has a full-fledged Kashmiri department to teach students at postgraduate, doctorate and post doctorate level besides Certificate and PG Diploma.

Majrooh Rashid, HoD Kashmiri department at Kashmir University said that every year, around 70 students are registered for MA in Kashmiri language. ""We have around 30 scholars in our department. Kashmiri subject has been introduced in many colleges but there is a need to introduce it in other colleges as well,"" he said. Rashid said there are hundreds of students who are doing Post-graduation from private institutes.

Meanwhile, General Secretary, Kashmiri Language Union (KLU), Sufi Hilal said that they met all the higher ups and asked them to make this subject compulsory in all the higher secondaries of the valley, but to no avail. ""If our demands are not fulfilled we will go for the hunger strike,"" he said.

Khurshid A Ganai, Advisor to Governor, School Education said that he will look into the matter. ""I have seen the Video in which students were protesting, I will look into the matter,"" he said."

In Kashmir, the most possible chances of any occurrence which can happen to you is that either you will be exploited or you will exploit others for their own needs. The time when the government announced to regularize the services of various daily wagers, causal labour's, hired and need based labourers of various departments of Jammu and Kashmir functioning, across the state, the joy and happiness among these labour classes were reflective and can be seen very easily from their expressions on the announcement date.

Any such announcement from the government without any checks and balances whether it brings any change or not but it had definitely paved a way to corruption and exploitation of these labourers in various government departments of Jammu and Kashmir.

When the government started the process and issued the directions to various departments to send the detailed list of such workers, initially the number of such workers were nearly about 60 thousand, keeping these facts under considerations the government tries to formulate the definite and effective proposal for these labour class workers just to provide them some relief for the services which they have rendered in various departments on nominal wages in some cases no wages at all for years.

In spite of all these the labourers of various departments worked with the hope that someday they will get the reward of their dedication and hard work by recognizing their services by the government.

The data forward by various departments to Government shocked everyone where from 60 thousands the number of workers were doubled a new data of nearly 1.20 Lakh were submitted mostly by snatching the rights of various genuine causal labour workers who had been working in various departments from years.

Who were these extra 60 thousand who had added salt to the wounds of those poor and destitute labours who had served these departments from years but the department fails to recognize their services now and exploit them for years due to the acute shortage of permanent employees.

How can you throughout a labourer who had given his 10 years of precious services to the department with many hopes of getting absorbed in the department just on the pretext of not falling under the ambit of SRO 520.

How a less experienced can fit under the ambit of SRO 520 by your magical tricks and not the poor one without any special references from any class although much experienced and senior as compared to your loved ones.

Most of the officials of the respective departments happened to be the mama, papa, abu, abba, uncle, dadyetcetcor somehow related to the causal labour classes working in various departments, most unfortunately the MLAs and MLCs

And, higher officials of respective departments and even the Sarpanchs in some cases have created the mess in every department by adjusting political workers and their nears and dears as causal labourers in various departments which are dead on fields from years but on papers they have been in service of various departments even in their teens to regulate their pocket money.

After the release of the lists by various departments we have seen such glaring examples with unbelievable miracles where we have witnessed papa working as medical assistant and her wife including two sons and two daughters working as causal labourers under hospital development funds.

It was just an idea of mini hospital at home infact a new innovation. The examples of dynastic rules can be witnessed in various departments of Jammu and Kashmir apart from in politics. We have witnessed also the dead ones in such lists and persons ranging from 12 years to 95 years in such lists as well.

We have also witnessed a single person registered in more than two departments from years that too shown present on both the departments doing his job with dedication.

While performing all these miracles we have left thousands on the mercy of God by snatching their genuine rights who had been in all such departments from years but find nowhere their names in all such lists and even didn't know the persons who have been shown working in their place of postings where they have been working for such long years.

There are thousands of such cases where the sons of officials have been shown working in various departments from years and at the same time they were enrolled in various educational institutions of the state as well as outside the state pursuing their higher education.

How come a person be present at two places at a same time while be present in the department where he is working and had attended the exams on the same day outside the statesuch miracles are happening only and only in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

Recommendation of very poor and deserving one to any department as causal labour so that he may be able to minimize his sufferings and can feed his family to some extent can be understood and is appreciable but how come a son of a gazetted officer or an official whose is taking more than 50 thousand as salary can be inducted in the list of need based labourer or causal labour. Have such officials not in such positions to feed their lonely sons.

I have seen a large number of very poor especially from Gujar communities and from other socially, economically and educationally deprived communities who are serving in various departments from years on very marginal wages in some cases no wages at allmostly due to the acute shortage of permanent employees in various government departments it is only these causal labourers who are serving in various departments.

In some cases the permanent employee's has been assigned various areas to look after and they hardly visit to such areas. It's only because of the services of these causal labourers the glory of many departments are still standing.

Have heard the stories of various destitute causal labours how much happy they were when they were asked to register themselves online, bringing affidavit from courts along with their Aadhar cards. They were asked to register in their respective departments.

In some cases hundreds of causal labourers have paid 1000 to 1500 each just to register themselves online in their concerned departments and officials concerned knowing that it's equalent to the wages which their departments are providing them after so many months.

""Without looking here and there we did all what we were asked to do in order to get regularized and to be registered online so that we will be covered under the ambit of SRO 520,"" said one with tearful eyes.

Initially we were just 20 to 30 but the department have forwarded list of 70 and we are not even in the list of 70's as well now. This is how the poor and destitute once are dropped deliberately to pay way to the special ones.

How will a poor, illiterate, socially, economically and educationally backward person the only bread owner to their families will now move from office to office with his cries in order to get them heard in higher offices where there is no value and no respect for the emotions of poor and destitute ones.

""How can I visit now to all these offices with my cries when they are responsible for all this mess from Regional Director's to Director's office while left my family to die of starvation,"" heard from one while his eyes were flooded with tears, everlasting hopes and aspirations.

Here the principle of ""might is right"" is the only visible principle. In this unfortunate land of Kashmir you can be exploited or you can exploit others, when poverty is your long lasting friend you are born to be exploited only we are surrounded by turn costs, opportunists, who can claim big but at the end all promises proved to be hoax and hallow which holds nothing for poor and common masses.

There are many deserving causal labours who had given their whole life while serving such departments with the only hopes from years someday they will be regularized, give them their legitimate rights before they will die along with their everlasting dreams and aspirations.

The genuine and deserving ones had become the victims of the mess of corruption and favouritism which had casted shadows of darkness even on their genuine cause.

If the rules are unjust a man is not only right to disobey it, he is obligated to do so."

Dr Andrabi said Animal Husbandry Department, Kashmir has 'Daily Entrepreneurship Dairy' (DED) Scheme for the dairy farmers to generate self employment and dairy infrastructure.

The scheme includes small dairy farm, rearing of heifer calves, vermi compost unit, purchase of milking machines, purchase of dairy processing equipments, dairy product transformation, cold storage facilities, private veterinary clinics and dairy marketing outlets.

Any farmer, individual entrepreneurs, organised and unorganised group can avail the scheme.

For a small dairy farm of upto 10 animals, the unit cost is Rs 7 lakh for which there is back end subsidy of 25% project cost for general category promoters and 33.33% for SC/ST borrowers.

Under tribal sub plan, the department provides two cow units to tribal people.

The dairy farmers face challenges as the State is 60% deficit in green fodder and almost 40% in dry fodder.

""The farmers are not supported for fodder production which becomes a major challenges faced by the farmer due to which they get discouraged,"" said Andrabi.

Andrabi said a survey was done couple of years back in which we got 52,000 units registered with the department.

He said registration was given to those units which have cows from small holdings to large holdings (i.e, 2 - 25 cows).

Through J&K Entrepreneur Development Institute, Rs 5 lakhs to 10 lakhs are given to the entrepreneur for setting up a dairy farm.

Image: Mexy Xavier

For Manoj Kumar, co-founder and CEO, Social Alpha, the idea of creating a startup ecosystem that would deliver social goals was always at the back of his mind. In 2013, while doing the Advanced Management Programme at Harvard Business School, he met R Venkataramanan, now the managing trustee of Tata Trusts. Somewhere, Venkataramanan's interests in philanthropy and Kumar's interest in entrepreneurship crossed paths. ""I asked myself what can be done to ensure that startups in the social sector remain sustainable?"" says Kumar.

In 2015, Tata Trusts set up the Foundation for Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship, branded as Social Alpha, to promote socially-relevant innovations and entrepreneurship. One of the first NGOs Social Alpha incubated was Hasiru Dala: It transformed the Bengaluru-based non-profit, which improves the lives of ragpickers through its waste management services, into a for-profit venture.

Social Alpha works with the idea that innovation, incubation and investment together can solve problems. Says Kumar, also head-innovation and entrepreneurship with Tata Trusts, ""Once you have innovated, one needs to check if it is validating the hypothesis and the best model to implement this innovation is entrepreneurship.""

In the commercial space, the lab-to-market ecosystem is well developed. But it is not the case in the social sector. Social Alpha handholds a startup through its entire lifecycle, from innovation to market-readiness. ""We look for innovators and entrepreneurs who are on a mission to create an impact, help them with incubation, lab access, market access, real estate solutions (they can work in our office) and most importantly we help them with seed capital,"" says Kumar.

As a technology business incubator, approved by the central government's department of science and technology, Social Alpha incubates in two ways: One, if the company is set up already, it is incubated as a startup; and for innovators or entrepreneurs with an idea, a programme called 'Entrepreneur in Residence'. ""While we handhold them through the innovation stage, we also help them understand how to set up a sustainable business,"" adds Kumar.

While venture capitalists do fund startups in the social sector, Social Alpha's focus is more philanthropic. ""Our priority is social impact, followed by financial sustainability and then scale. We co-create a milestone-based social impact plan with the founders and a business plan to support that impact plan,"" says Kumar. As of now it has 34 incubatees (of which they have invested in 26), with a mix of both for-profit and not-for-profit.

Says Manas Nanda, founder, Bubblenut Wash, ""There was a sense of empathy from Social Alpha [unlike other investors] for the cause and for the entrepreneur. As compared to a traditional VC or angel investor, Social Alpha was looking at 10-12 years when it came to getting money back. Apart from networking within the ecosystem, they helped us with grants from the government of India.""

Social Alpha has been working in sectors like waste management, education, sanitation, water, health care and energy access. Going forward, Kumar hopes to explore sectors such as medicine, vaccines and drugs. Some of the incubatees include Kitablet, Kamal Kisan, Bubblenut Wash, Innaumation, Farmveda and Aarna Biomedical Products.

What are the factors Kumar and his team look at before taking a startup on board? ""The first is the problem being addressed and what makes the idea stand out. This is followed by a technical evaluation and analysis of the company's business plan,"" says Kumar. The funding provided to each startup ranges from ₹10 lakh to ₹1 crore.

Till date, Social Alpha has invested $5 million. Besides, it helps the startups to raise funds. The initiative will continue to remain a not-for-profit but encourages incubatees to become for-profit so they can be self-sustainable. Philanthropy, says Kumar, is now redefining itself. ""We believe philanthropy is all about creating an ecosystem so that entrepreneurs and innovators can grow."""

In a fresh twist to a rape case allegedly involving BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an FIR has been lodged on court orders against the victim, her mother and an uncle for producing a forged age certificate to prove she was a minor.

The court ordered registration of a case against the three on a complaint by the father of another rape accused Shubham, who is in jail, said SP Harish Kumar on Thursday.

He said complainant Harpal Singh had alleged that the victim, her uncle and mother had procured a forged age certificate to implicate his son Shubham in the rape case, said Mr. Kumar.

The police said the case was registered at the Makhi police station on court's December 17 order against the family members for various alleged offences of cheating and forgery.

Complainant Harpal Singh had moved the court saying the school transfer certificate, purportedly made by a Raebareli school and produced as the age certificate, was forged to frame his son, police said.

The victim's uncle is presently in jail in connection with another case.

Harpal Singh's wife Shashi and son Shubham are accused in the rape case and have been in jail since April along with the main accused, BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

Sengar, a four-time MLA, was charged by the CBI with raping the girl at his residence in Makhi village on June 4 last year.

The girl was again abducted and raped by a separate group of accused, allegedly including Harpal Singh's son Shubhan Singh, his driver Naresh Tiwari and one Brijesh Yadav between June 11 and June 20, 2017.

But in his complaint, Harpal Singh alleged that the victim had an affair with a man named Awadesh Tewari, with whom she had eloped in September 2017, only to return sometime later.

After her return, her family had begun persuading his son Shubham to marry her, alleged Harpal Singh in his complaint.

When Shubham refused to marry her, the family filed a case against him and his mother on charges of kidnapping as well as various offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, alleged Haripal Singh.

He also alleged that the victim's kin had forged her age certificate with a fake date of birth, purportedly issued from a school in Raebareli as proof.

The certificate purportedly had the signatures of the Basic Shiksha Adhikari of the district and the school principal.

Harpal Singh claimed both the education department official and the school principal have denied signing the certificate."

Context: Noted sitar player Manju Mehta has been conferred with the 'Tansen Samman' for 2018 by the Madhya Pradesh government for her contribution in the field of music.

The Tansen Music Festival is organised every year by Madhya Pradesh culture department in the memory of Tansen, one of the greatest artists in Indian history. It is held annually in Gwalior.

The expert panel on RBI's economic capital framework has been formed to address the issue of RBI reserves -- one of the sticking points between the central bank and the government.

The government has been insisting that the central bank hand over its surplus reserves amid a shortfall in revenue collections. Access to the funds will allow the government to meet deficit targets, infuse capital into weak banks to boost lending and fund welfare programmes.

Economic capital framework refers to the risk capital required by the central bank while taking into account different risks. The economic capital framework reflects the capital that an institution requires or needs to hold as a counter against unforeseen risks or events or losses in the future.

Existing economic capital framework which governs the RBI's capital requirements and terms for the transfer of its surplus to the government is based on a conservative assessment of risk by the central bank and that a review of the framework would result in excess capital being freed, which the RBI can then share with the government.

The government believes that RBI is sitting on much higher reserves than it actually needs to tide over financial emergencies that India may face. Some central banks around the world (like US and UK) keep 13% to 14% of their assets as a reserve compared to RBI's 27% and some (like Russia) more than that.

Economists in the past have argued for RBI releasing 'extra' capital that can be put to productive use by the government. The Malegam Committee estimated the excess (in 2013) at Rs 1.49 lakh crore.

What is the nature of the arrangement between the government and RBI on the transfer of surplus or profits?

Although RBI was promoted as a private shareholders' bank in 1935 with a paid up capital of Rs 5 crore, the government nationalised it in January 1949, making the sovereign its ""owner"". What the central bank does, therefore, is transfer the ""surplus"" -- that is, the excess of income over expenditure -- to the government, in accordance with Section 47 (Allocation of Surplus Profits) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.

No. Its statute provides exemption from paying income-tax or any other tax, including wealth tax.

Mains Question: What do you understand by RBI's economic capital framework? Discuss whether RBI's economic capital framework requires a fix?

Niti Aayog releases second Delta Ranking of Aspirational districts

Context: Niti Aayog has released the Second Delta Ranking of the Aspirational Districts Programme. The ranking details the incremental progress achieved by the districts during June to October this year across six key development sectors.

The districts have been ranked in a transparent basis on parameters across various performance indicators like Health and Nutrition, Education, Skill Development and Basic Infrastructure among others.

The rankings are based on the data that is publicly available through the Champions of Change Dashboard, which includes data entered on a real-time basis at the district level.

Top performers: Virudhunagar district in Tamil Nadu has shown the most improvement overall, followed by Nuapada district in Odisha, Siddarthnagar in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar's Aurangabad and Koraput in Odisha. These districts have championed the development narrative in fundamental parameters of social progress.

Least performers: Meanwhile, Nagaland's Kiphire district, Jharkhand's Giridih, Chatra in Jharkhand, Hailakandi in Assam, and Pakur in Jharkhand have shown least improvement.

To enable optimum utilization of their potential, this program focuses closely on improving people's ability to participate fully in the burgeoning economy. Health & Nutrition, Education, Agriculture & Water Resources, Financial Inclusion & Skill Development, and Basic Infrastructure are this programme's core areas of focus.

If these districts are transformed, there would be tremendous improvement in the internal security environment of the country. If Prabhari officers can bring convergence in the development efforts of different Ministries and state Governments and the schemes specially launched by Home Ministry in these districts, it would serve as a great opportunity to ensure rapid development in the country.

Mains Question: Aspirational District Programme (ADP) is a marked shift in India's governance model that embodies cooperative as well as competitive federalism and efficiency in resource utilization, as its key determinants. Critically analyse.

Assistant Superintendent of Police, Kerala Police Cyber Cell, M. Iqbal told The Hindu that a team of officers from Kerala had raided a private residence in Isthanpur this week and arrested Babul Hussain, 26, amid stiff resistance from a gang of local people.

The officers produced the accused in front of a local magistrate on Thursday and procured a transfer warrant to shift him to Kerala for further investigation. The police have booked Hussain on the charges of conspiracy, impersonation, cheating and other relevant provisions of the IT Act.

In June, the Higher Education Department found that anonymous persons had hacked into its official website hosted by the National Informatics Centre (NIC).

It petitioned State Police Chief Loknath Behera for a detailed probe. Mr. Behera constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) under Mr. Iqbal to investigate the case.

Mr. Iqbal and his team sifted through NIC logs for digital clues, if any, left behind by the hackers. They traced the pivot of the digital invasions to an IP address in Isthanpur in West Bengal. The police found that the hackers had sought to slyly supplant the bank account details of at least 400 students eligible for the minority scholarship with those they had generated under false identities.

In some cases, they inserted fictitious names and addresses of non-existent students into the list of eligible candidates on the website.

However, the police said the attempt to steal student scholarship had not out panned out as planned by the conspirators.

The cyber sleuths had also broken through the rather amateurish efforts on the part of the hackers to conceal and spook their IP addresses to hide the provenance of the hacking attempts.

Officers said Hussain, the prime accused, worked in a temporary clerical post in a higher secondary school in West Bengal.

He was knowledgeable about various government benefits for students and could have exploited more such schemes for his financial gain. The detected fraud was just the tip of the iceberg, and more arrests were in the offing. Inspector General of Police, S. Sreejith, supervised the probe."

In a fresh twist to a rape case allegedly involving BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an FIR has been lodged on court orders against the victim, her mother and an uncle for producing a forged age certificate to prove she was a minor.

The court ordered registration of a case against the three on a complaint by the father of another rape accused Shubham, who is in jail, said SP Harish Kumar Thursday.

He said complainant Harpal Singh had alleged that the victim, her uncle and mother had procured a forged age certificate to implicate his son Shubham in the rape case, said Kumar.

The police said the case was registered at the Makhi police station on court's December 17 order against the family members for various alleged offences of cheatring and forgery.

Complainant Singh had moved the court saying the school transfer certificate, purportedly made by Raebareli school and produced as the age certificate, was forged to frame his son, police said.

The victim's uncle is presently in jail in connection with another case.

Harpal Singh's wife Shashi and son Shubham are accused in the rape case and have been in jail since April along with the main accused, BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

Sengar, a four-time MLA, was charged by the CBI with raping the girl at his residence in Makhi village on June 4 last year.

The girl was again abducted and raped by a separate group of accused, allegedly including Harpal Singh's son Shubhan Singh, his driver Naresh Tiwari and one Brijesh Yadav between June 11 and June 20, 2017.

But in his complaint, Harpal Singh alleged that the victim had an affair with a man named Awadesh Tewari, with whom she had eloped in September 2017, only to return sometime later.

After her return, her family had begun persuading his son Shubham to marry her, alleged Harpal Singh in his complaint.

When Shubham refused to marry her, the family filed a case against him and his mother on charges of kidnapping as well as various offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, alleged Haripal Singh.

He also alleged that the victim's kin had forged her age certificate with a fake date of birth, purportedly issued from a school in Raebareli as proof.

The certificate purportedly had the signatures of the Basic Shiksha Adhikari of the district and the school principal.

Singh claimed both the education department official and the school principal have denied signing the certificate.

The victim had alleged that she was raped by BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar at his residence on June 4, 2017, when she had gone there to meet him along with Shashi Singh, Shubham's mother, to seek a job.

In February, the girl's family had moved the court for inclusion of the MLA's name in the case.

The state police registered a case on April 12, 2018, on the day of handing over the probe to the CBI.

Meanwhile, the victim's father was booked by the police under the Arms Act on April 3 and put in jail on April 5 where he died on April 9, 2018.

A video, purportedly showing the victim's father before his death accusing the MLA's brother of assaulting him had then gone viral.

Sengar's brother Atul Singh, was arrested along with four others, by the UP Crime Branch, for allegedly thrashing the victim's father.

Frustrated with the alleged police inaction and coercion from influential people, the minor victim had attempted self-immolation in front of Chief Minister yogi Adityanath's residence on April 8, 2018.

The Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government's ""inaction"" against the party MLA had drawn scathing criticism from the Allahabad High Court.

The state government had subsequently transferred the case to the CBI nearly 10 months after the commission of the alleged crime. Sengar was arrested by the CBI on April 13 and has been in judicial custody since then.

A second arrest in the case was made on April 14 when Shashi Singh, who had taken the victim to Sengar's house, was held.

While many were hospitalised, others were treated on the DPI campus itself.

The teachers met with officials from the School Education Department on Wednesday. However, they said that the strike would continue as the meeting did not yield any favourable outcome.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday ordered filing of FIRs against the personal secretaries of three senior ministers following a sting operation conducted by a TV news channel purportedly showing the trio seeking bribes against favours, including transfers and contracts.

Taking cognisance of the news report based on the sting, Adityanath has ordered for immediate suspension of the three government staff and institution of a special investigation team (SIT) under additional director general of police (ADG) Lucknow zone, Rajeev Krishna, to probe the matter. Inspector general of police (IGP) of special task force (STF) and senior vigilance bureau department would also be part of the SIT.

The SIT would complete the probe and submit a report within 10 days to the government for further action after recording statements of all the concerned parties. Besides, the state secretariat administration would review similar cases as well so as to pre-empt such incidents in future.

The CM had on earlier occasions issued directives for ensuring transparency and fair play in government procedures. He has stressed zero tolerance by the government towards corruption cases and that prompt action would be taken if there is any complaint from any quarters. However, the sting operation has nonetheless caused massive embarrassment to the government.

The sting showed the personal secretaries of UP backward welfare minister Om Prakash Rajbhar, mnister of state for mining Archana Pandey and minister of state for basic education Sandeep Singh seeking monetary favours for facilitating contracts or transfers.

According to sources, the government would take sternest action in these matter if the accused are found guilty of graft charges so as to deter other government employees from indulging in corrupt practices, especially with the crucial 2019 Lok Sabha poll months away.

In the sting, the personal secretary of Rajbhar is shown allegedly seeking Rs 4 million for a transfer. Besides, there are recordings of the secretariat staff allegedly assuring the sting reporter, posing as a contractor, that a contract for school bag and uniform, would be manipulated by networking with the kin of other state minister. However, Rajbhar has washed his hands of the controversy saying he had nothing to do with the alleged deal and in fact asked his departmental head to probe the matter.

In another news report, the secretary of minister Archana Pandey is shown striking a deal with the sting reporter for getting mining contracts in several districts. Meanwhile, she has also recommended strict action against her staff if found guilty after the probe.

The personal secretary of Sandeep Singh, who is the grandson of Rajasthan governor Kalyan Singh, is purportedly shown tying to fix a deal pertaining to a hypothetical contract of supplying books and seeking his share."

While the former does not want to let go of his three ministries, the latter is adamant on giving Home Ministry to Lingayat strongman M B Patil. With Wednesday's meeting ending inconclusively, AICC General Secretary and Karnataka in-charge

K C Venugopal had to take the recommendation list back to New Delhi. With two senior state leaders not in agreement with each other, it is now left to party boss Rahul Gandhi to chart the next course of action.

Sources in the party say that

M B Patil -- one of the most senior leaders and newly inducted minister -- is refusing to settle for anything less than the Home Ministry.

""The question is whether seniors like Parameshwara, D K Shivakumar should part with portfolios they are currently holding. New portfolios can be created for the new ministers.

The Bill is pending for the governor's assent.

The counsel for the university argued that the benefit of the Bill will be in effect from the date of the governor's assent. He also pointed out that similar petitions have been rejected by the HC.The petitioner prayed the court to quash the order dated November 22, 2017, passed by UoM, asking him to retire with effect from December 31, 2018, on his attaining the age of superannuation. He has also requested the court to quash the notification dated July 19, 2016, issued by the university notifying that library staff working in varisities are not teachers, and hence, their service cannot be permitted beyond 60 years.

In support of his arguments, the petitioner pointed out that the UGC notified the Career Advancement Scheme in 2006, directing that the posts of assistant librarian/college librarian and assistant director of physical education would retire at 62 instead of 60, on par with teachers. ""The state government issued an order dated June 27, 1998, accepting the resolution of the varsity that librarians working in universities and their constituent colleges (government colleges and other aided colleges) are to be treated as non-vocational staff.

After a story on the unscientific road work taken up by the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) Department at Idu gram panchayat in Karkala taluk was published on December 22, RDPR engineers instructed the contractors concerned to dig the trench and make a channel to ensure resumption of water supply to fields. The story, 'Farms left parched as road project buries water channel,' highlighted how the 1.44km road, under 'Namma Grama Namma Rasthe' scheme, from Idu Palke to Batteni, had buried a traditional water channel that used to irrigate 70 acres of paddy fields. Ajith Kumar Jain, a farmer, told TNIE that farmers are happy now since the refurbishing of the channel began on December 24.

Reuniting a child with her foster mother

For seven years, Jayashree Guttedar had brought up an abandoned girl as her own, only to be told that she was raising the girl ""illegally"". The wailing baby that Jayashree had rescued from a bush near a private maternity hospital in Gubbi Colony in Kalaburagi years ago, was taken away by Women and Child Development department officials to an orphanage. Jayashree -- a mother of three who had accepted the girl as her own -- had to run from pillar to post, fighting to claim the child with proper documentation. Jayashree then reached out to district in-charge minister Priyank Kharge. On October 3, 2018, TNIE carried the story, highlighting the torment of the mother. Minister Kharge intervened, and the child was returned to Jayashree with coordination from the district commissioner."

This has been the occurrence until the #Me Too movement which brought to light series of sexual harassment cases in the workplace, tumbling notable persons in various fields in the process.

The EEOC defined sexual harassment in its guidelines as;

The underlying ingredient of sexual harassment from the foregoing is that the sexual behavior in question is ""unwelcome"" and lacks consent. Contrary to popular belief, victims of sexual harassment are not limited to women. We have been made to believe the fallacy that since women are basically less threatening, they can't perpetrate sexual harassment. So, being sexually harassed by a woman is not only laughable but also enjoyable. The truth remains that what makes sexual harassment a crime is not the gender of the perpetrator, nor the physical appearance of the victim but lack of consent.

The Nigerian Labour Act has no provisions criminalizing sexual harassment in the workplace. This has left some victims confused as to what legal measures to take to address the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace. The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended which is the grundnorm in Nigerian Law on the other hand, guarantees the right to dignity of human persons and right to personal liberty which workplace sexual harassment violates. Also, international conventions and instruments universally recognize a person's right to work with dignity and be protected from all forms of sexual harassment.

The Criminal Law of Lagos State 2011 has provisions criminalizing sexual harassment making Lagos state the first state in Nigeria to make laws against sexual harassment.

Section 262(1) of the Criminal Law of Lagos States 2011 provides that:

""Any person who sexually harasses another is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for three years.""

Section 254(C) (1) (g) of the Nigerian Constitution 1999 (as amended in 2010) makes specific provisions granting the National Industrial Court of Nigeria exclusive jurisdiction over causes and matters ""relating to or connected with any dispute arising from discrimination or sexual harassment at the workplace.""

Following this constitutional provision, the National Industrial Court of Nigeria (NICN) has awarded damages in deserving cases against perpetrators of workplace sexual harassment. In Pastor (Mrs.) Abimbola Patricia Yakubu V Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria& Anor (Suit No NICN/LA/673/2013; judgement delivered on the 24th November, 2016), the claimant's case was that she was at various times subjected to continuous sexual and seductive gestures and compliments, promiscuous and obscene talks, demand for sexual favours and indecent marriage proposal from the 2nd defendant while she was in the employment of the 1st defendant. The NICN held that the claimant's right to human dignity and self-worth was violated by the 2nd defendant and awarded the sum of N5,000,000(Five Million Naira) as damages in favour of the claimant.

Recently, the National Industrial Court (NIC) amended its civil procedure rules to include provisions on workplace sexual harassment. Order 14(1) of the National Industrial Court of Nigeria Civil Procedure Rules 2017 provides that where a claimant alleges sexual harassment in the workplace, it should be indicated if the sexual harassment is;

""a. Physical conduct of a sexual nature: such as unwanted physical contact, ranging from touching to sexual assault and rape, strip search by or in the presence of the opposite sex, gesture that constitutes the alleged sexual harassment ; and/or

From the foregoing, sexual harassment is not only made an actionable claim, we are also clear on how to prove it in court and what amounts to workplace sexual harassment. Any worker who is a victim of any of the above actions can institute an action at the National Industrial Court and get remedies including damages, compensation and an injunction.

It is the duty of every employer to ensure that sexual harassment doesn't thrive in the work environment. Employers need to know that they can be held vicariously liable for acts of sexual harassment by their employees and agents especially if such incidences were reported and nothing was done to address the sexual harassment issue or punish the perpetrator. Asides from legal costs, employers that ignore cases of sexual harassment pay the price in low morale, decreased productivity, increased absenteeism and health care costs.

One major step employers can take to prevent sexual harassment in the work place is for them to include a sexual harassment policy in their employee handbook. The sexual harassment policy should;

Employers should be ready to organize trainings on the signs, control and effects of sexual harassment during induction of new employees and other forms of continuous education to ensure that the employees are constantly aware that sexual harassment is a crime that will not be tolerated in the workplace.

It is also important that employers set up a mechanism to monitor the work environment for signs of sexual harassment so that any slight trace of sexual harassment can be nipped in the bud before it aggravates to sexual molestation.

As expected, the #MeToo movement has started influencing the decisions of companies. CEOs and HRs are now being careful and have taken it upon themselves to not only examine their current sexual harassment policies to see if they fit into the new reality but also to reexamine settlement agreements and confidentiality agreements arising from harassment claims that have been deemed settled to ensure that such claims will not rear up their ugly heads later despite the confidentiality clauses. Summarily, internal sexual harassment audit and investigations are now being taken seriously.

The question on the minds of many CEOs however is who to be saddled with the responsibility of conducting these investigations in a way that will ensure fairness to both parties. It could be left in the hands of the Human Resources department but are these people not employees of the company who are obliged to protect the reputation of the company? How un-biased can their findings be?

Certainly, an investigation that will ensure fairness to both parties is more likely achieved when the investigator has no personal connection with either party to the investigation. It is also likely that the parties will see an external investigator as neutral and will be more open with information since they believe that they will be treated fairly. Employers as well will be more inclined to take recommendations from an independent investigator and make necessary changes in their company as opposed to taking recommendations from the employee of the company who might just be telling the employer what he wants to hear.

As a result of this, companies have identified the need to bring in external investigators who have the requisite training, experience and resources to conduct an impartial investigation while maintaining privilege and avoiding the consequences of a flawed investigation. They now bring in Law firms to carry out these investigations.

In the past, any complaint of improper behavior in the workplace would most likely be first lodged at the human resources department. Times have changed. As it is now, as a result of the awareness raised by the #MeToo movement, the public might even be made aware of a harassment issue before the company. In fact, a CEO might just get to know of a sexual harassment claim in the company from the morning news and by then, a lot of havoc could have been done to the company's reputation and credibility. Companies who intend to survive the #MeToo movement and its aftermath have to be proactive by ensuring that their sexual harassment policies are in tune with today's reality, they create a work environment that stifles sexual harassment and they carry out proper investigations that are fair and professionally conducted. The time is up!"

The video of the incident in Punganur Mandal of Chittoor district on Wednesday went viral within hours, following which people demanded stringent action against the school authorities. Child Rights activists from Hyderabad have reached out to the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights to initiate immediate action.

""This heinous, corporal punishment is unacceptable. You cannot punish children in such a way for being late to school. Parents send their children to schools entrusting the authorities and keeping a lot of confidence in them. If they (schools) resort to such ugly acts, what will the parents do?"" child rights activist Achyuth Rao told News18.

Following a complaint by the area's education officer, a case was registered under Juvenile Justice Act and IPC Section 323. The police are yet to take the school authorities, who are on the run, into custody.

The education department has, meanwhile, decided to withdraw the schools recognition for the next year. ""The parents, children and the school staff have been investigated. A detailed report will be out by the end of the day. The punishment is unacceptable and violates child rights. We are going to withdraw the school's recognition for 2019-2020,"" Dr K Panduranga Swamy, Chittoor District Education Officer, told News18.

Families of the students, along with activists, staged protests outside the mandal education department, demanding suspension of the school principal and the teacher responsible for the punishment.

The affected students will now be provided counselling by local child rights activists.

Schools authorities did not respond to News18's questions."

As discussed in the GST Council Meeting concluded last Saturday i.e. 22nd December 2018, the current billing system does not bifurcate taxable and non-taxable goods and services. The proposal suggests generating separate bills for components that are exempted from Goods and Services Tax in the healthcare sector, where the revenue department suspects evasion of GST by hospitals.

If the recommendation is approved, consumers may see separate bills for medicines, hospital charges and consumables, clearly demarking where GST was charged and which items were exempted.

At present, it is a common practice at hospitals, whether large or small, to sell medicines at MRP (Maximum Retail Price); however, the same is procured at discounted prices and the benefits are not passed on the end-user. Similarly, there are a surfeit of medicines and medical services that are exempted from GST, however, due to mixed supply billing the end user may not benefit from such exemption.

Although the proposal was for the healthcare sector only, the GST Council wanted to adopt it for education sector too, where basic education is exempted from Goods and Services Tax, but goods and services not incidental to education are not.

The unbundled billing for exempted components will make the understanding and impact of Goods and Services clearer to consumers and will help lessen the hue and cry around Goods and Services Tax, while ensuring that the GST charged on taxable components reaches the Revenue department with much ease.

Experts are of the view that before implementing the recommendation for Unbundled Bills and making it mandatory, the GST council must review its stand on composite supply and mixed supply in order to avoid any fallout later."

Their services are not being regularised by the administration by way of framing a secure policy in light of Uma Devi's judgement rendered in 2006 which mandates all states/UTs are bound to consider the claim of regularisation of its contractual employees as one-time measure who are working since long without any break and that too on the posts which are of perennial nature.

The bench was apprised that till date the UT administration of Chandigarh has not framed any such policy despite repeated representations by the contractual teachers/employees who would become overage for any future employment with the passage of time."

arises is as regards the power of the Disciplinary Authority in the instant case

being the Hon'ble the Chief Justice, the Hon'ble Judges of this Court to

institute the disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner. There can be no

dispute about the fact that the Maharashtra Civil Services Rules are applicable.

A useful reference could be made to Rule 8(1) and (2) of the said Rules which

are relevant for the purpose of the present Petition:

8. Procedure for imposing major penalties:(

1)

No order imposing any of the major penalties

shall be made except after an inquiry held, as far

as may be, in the manner provided in this rule

and Rule 9, or where such inquiry is held under

the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850 (37 of

1850) in the manner provided in that Act.

(2) Whenever the disciplinary authority is of the

opinion that there are grounds for inquiring into

the truth of any imputation of misconduct or

misbehaviour against a Government servant, it

may itself inquire into, or appoint under this rule

or under the provisions of the Public Servants

(Inquiries) Act, 1850, as the case may be, an

authority to inquire into the truth thereof.

Provided that, where there is a complaint of

sexual harassment within the meaning of Rule 22A

of Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules

1979, the Complaints Committee established in

each Department or Office for inquiring into such

complaints, shall be deemed to be the inquiring

authority appointed by the disciplinary authority

for the purpose of these rules and the Complaints

Committee shall hold, if separate procedure has

not been prescribed for the Complaints

Committee for holding the inquiry into the

complaints for sexual harassments, the inquiry as

for as practicable in accordance with the

procedure laid down in these rules.

ExplanationWhere

a disciplinary authority

itself holds an inquiry under this rule, any

reference to an inquiring authority in this rule

shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be

construed as reference to the disciplinary

authority.

A reading of the said Rule 8(2) therefore discloses that the

discretion is of the Disciplinary Authority if it is of the opinion that there are

grounds for inquiring into the truth of any imputation of misconduct or

misbehaviour against a Government servant. Hence the said Rule (2) can be

said to confer a wide discretion in the Disciplinary Authority in the matter of

inquiring into the truth of any misconduct or misbehaviour against the

Government servant.

12 Now coming to the guide lines which have been formulated by the

Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India which are comprised in the letter dated 3102014

they read thus:A.

The complaint making allegations against

members of the Subordinate Judiciary in the

States should not be entertained and no action

should be taken thereon, unless it is accompanies

by a duly sworn Affidavit and verifiable material

to substantiate the allegations made therein.

B. If action on such complaint meeting the

above requirement is deemed necessary,

authenticity of complaint should be duly

ascertained and further steps thereon should be

taken only after satisfaction of the competent

authority designated by the Chief Justice of the

High Court.

C. If the above requirements are not complied

with, the complaint should be filed/lodged

without taking any steps thereon.

The said guidelines were modified and communicated vide letter

dated 1632017

issued by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice Of India. The

modification carried out which is relevant for the purposes of the present

Petition is in clause (A). The modified clause (A) reads thus:

A. The complaint making allegations against

members of the Subordinate Judiciary in the

States should not be entertained and no action

should be taken thereon, unless it is accompanied

by a duly sworn Affidavit and/or verifiable

material to substantiate the allegations made

therein.

(emphasis supplied)

13 Hence by modification the requirement is that a complaint should

be accompanied by duly sworn affidavit and/or verifiable material to

substantiate the allegations made therein. Hence a complaint can be

entertained in two contingencies one is when a complaint is accompanied by a

duly sworn affidavit and second is when the complaint contains verifiable

material. It is in the light of the said modification that the instant case would

have to be considered. The said modification being in the matter of the

procedure which is required to be followed prior to holding a Departmental

Enquiry, the same would obviously relate back to the date of issuance of the

show cause notice, even if the notice is prior to the issuance of the

modification.

ORDINARY ORIGINAL CIVIL JURISDICTION

WRIT PETITION NO.643 OF 2017

Asif Badremunir Tahasildar Vs. State of Maharashtra

CORAM :R. M. SAVANT, &

SARANG V KOTWAL, JJ

PRONOUNCED ON : 4th MAY, 2018

Citation: 2018(6) MHLJ 850

JUDGMENT (PER R.M.SAVANT J.)

1 By the above Writ Petition No.643 of 2017 the Petitioner is

challenging the order dated 1572016,

(Exhibit N) by which order the

Learned Registrar General of this Court has informed the Petitioner that the

Disciplinary Authority in exercise of the powers conferred by Subrule

5(c) of

Rule 8 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules 1979,

has decided to hold a Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. By the

orders passed on the same date, the Enquiry Officer was also appointed to

enquire into the charges.

In so far as the Writ Petition No.692 of 2017 is concerned, the said

Writ Petition also challenges the order dated 1572016,

(Exhibit D) which

order is to the same effect as the order impugned in the above Writ Petition

No.643 of 2017. By a separate order passed on the said date an Enquiry

Officer has also been appointed to looked into the charges which are the

subject matter of the second Departmental Enquiry.

2 Since the Petitions involve a common question as to whether the

Departmental Enquiry could be commenced against the Petitioner in the

absence of a written complaint supported by an affidavit, both the Petitions are

heard together and are being disposed of together.

3 The facts giving rise to the above Petitions can in brief be stated

thus:

WRIT PETITION NO.643 OF 2017

The Petitioner was appointed as a Civil Judge Junior Division.

The Petitioner at the relevant time in the context of the Departmental Enquiry

was working as a Civil Judge Junior Division in Bhokardan District Jalna. A

complaint was received from one Mr. Teple against the Petitioner concerning

his tenure as Civil Judge Junior Division, Bhokardan District Jalna. By the said

complaint disciplinary action was sought against the Petitioner. The then

Learned Principal District Judge, Jalna forwarded the said complaint to the

Registrar General of this Court. The complaint was placed before the

Disciplinary Committee. The Disciplinary Committee comprising of the

Hon'ble Judges of this Court directed the Learned Principal District Judge

Jalna to conduct a fact finding enquiry. The report of the fact finding enquiry

was thereafter placed before the Disciplinary Committee who decided to

initiate a Disciplinary Enquiry against the Petitioner. The Petitioner was

accordingly issued a show cause notice along with the memo of charges and

statement of imputations. The Petitioner submitted his reply to the said show

cause notice. The matter was placed before the Disciplinary Committee who

considered the entire material including the reply submitted by the Petitioner,

as the said reply was found not satisfactory, the Disciplinary Committee

decided to hold a regular Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. It is by

the impugned communication dated 1572016

that the Petitioner was

communicated the said decision which as indicated above is the subject matter

of the above Writ Petition.

WRIT PETITION NO.692 OF 2017

4 Information was received by the Learned Principal District Judge,

Kolhapur as regards the incident which had taken place on 1672015

involving the Petitioner. In the said incident the Petitioner had allegedly

assaulted the bus driver of the school bus of his daughter and thereafter

threatened the driver and the owner of the bus that he would involve them in

a case under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and put them behind

bars for a period of 4 days. Pursuant to the said information which the

Learned Principal District Judge Kolhapur had received, he directed the

Learned District Judge3,

Kolhapur to conduct a discreet enquiry in respect of

the said incident. The Learned District Judge3

proceeded to Ajara, District

Kolhapur which was the place of posting of the Petitioner and conducted a

discreet enquiry in respect of the said incident which had allegedly taken place

on 1672015.

In the course of the said discreet enquiry, the Learned District

Judge3

recorded the statements of the driver, owner of the school bus and

some other persons and accordingly submitted his report to the Learned

Principal District Judge. The Learned Principal District Judge upon receipt of

the said report in turn submitted his report to the Learned Registrar General of

this Court. The matter was thereafter placed before the Disciplinary

Committee of this Court. Thereafter on 512016

the Disciplinary Committee

considered the said report and decided to initiate disciplinary action against

the Petitioner. The Petitioner was served with a show cause notice with the

articles of charges and statement of imputations. The Petitioner has filed his

reply to the said show cause notice on 1752016.

The matter was placed

before the Disciplinary Committee along with the Petitioner's reply and the

report of the Learned Principal District Judge. As the Petitioner's reply was not

found to be satisfactory, the Disciplinary Committee decided to initiate regular

Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner which decision was

communicated to the Petitioner by the impugned order dated 1572016.

As

indicated above by an order passed on the same day the Enquiry Officer was

also appointed to looked into the charges alleged against the Petitioner.

5 At this stage it would be relevant to refer to the charges which are

alleged against the Petitioner. The said charges are reproduced hereinunder:

WRIT PETITION NO.643 O F 2017

(First Departmental Enquiry)

Charge1

That during your tenure at Bhokardhan you were

staying in rented house owned by Shri Bismilla

Khan Mahetab Khan r/o Bhokardhan. In your

letter dated 08.04.2010 addressed to Executive

Engineer, P. W. D., Jalna you had informed the

Executive Engineer that as no Government

accommodation was available for you at

Bhokardhan, the Principal District Judge, Jalna

had granted permission to you to stay in private

accommodation on rental basis. Accordingly you

had acquired house of Shri Bismilla Khan

Mahetab Khan at Bhokardhan on rent of

Rs.6,000/and

requested him to issue Certificate

in that regard. The copy of said letter was also

addressed to the SubDivisional

Officer, P. W. D.,

Jalna. After the dispatch of the said letter

addressed to the Executive Engineer, P.W.D. Jalna,

you had carried out correction in your own

handwriting by rewriting

the figure Rs.5,000/as

Rs.6,000/and

in words Rupees Five thousand

as Rupees Six thousand. As per your oral

direction the SubDivisional

Officer, P. W. D., Jalna

also made correction in copy of your letter

addressed to him. However, in the office copy

maintained by the office, no such corrections

have been carried out and the amount of rent is

written as Rs.5000/per

month in figures as well

as in words. Thus by misusing your official

position you had made corrections in forwarding

letter later on for your personal benefit.

Charge2

That you had submitted medical bill of

Rs.20,513/regarding

treatment of your wife,

Smt. Najnin Tahasildar for reimbursement. In

order to get medical reimbursement bill you

produced false documents i.e. ""Mata Balak

Saurakshan Card (ANC Card) purporting to be

signed by the Medical Officer, Rural Health

Centre, Bhokhardhan, and that by producing such

false documents you obtained the amount of

Rs.20,513/on

22.11.2010, you thus not only

produced false document but used the said false

document (ANC Card) for encashing medical bill

knowing that it was a false document and thereby

caused wrongful gain to yourself and wrongful

loss to the state exchequer and thereby

committed gross misconduct.

Charge3

That from 08.02.02010 till 03042010

you

were stationed at Jalna for training, as per the

letter dated 17.10.2012 of the District Court,

Jalna (tk-dz-@vkLFkk 6266@2012) you had sought

permission to leave headquarters for going to

Bhokardhan only on 14.03.2010 and 24.03.2010.

That during the crossexamination

in the

departmental enquiry NO.03/2011 initiated

against Shri K. E. Teple, Junior Clerk, Civil Court,

Bhokardhan you deposed ""gs Eg.kus [kjs ukgh dh] eh

ekb&;k iRuhyk xzkeh.k #X.kky; Hkksdjnu ;sFks fn-09-02-2010 o

06-03-2010 jksth ?ksmu xsyks ukgh"" Thus you either made

false statement in the crossexamination

in the

abovesaid departmental enquiry or on

09.02.2010 and 06.03.2010 you went to P. H.C.,

Bhokardhan, without seeking permission from

the principal District Judge, Jalna to leave the

headquarter on the abovesaid dates. You, thereby

failed to maintain absolute integrity and devotion

to duty by indulging in most inappropriate

behaviour.

WRIT PETITION NO.692 OF 2017

(Second Departmental Enquiry)

Charge1

That on 16.07.2015 at 8.15 a.m. one Shri

Ashok Laxman Lohar, Driver of school van

reached your bungalow to pickup your daughter

Ms. Layba for school. After waiting there for five

minutes, the driver Shri Ashok started the van.

Thereafter you immediately came out of your

house and started abusing and beating the said

driver. When he tried to run away, your servant

caught him and presented him before you then

you again beat him by kick and fist blows. Your

abovesaid misbehaviour shows that you failed to

maintain judicial discipline or propriety and you

conducted yourself in a manner unbecoming of a

Judicial Officer and brought great disrepute to

the institution as a whole.

Charge2

After the said incident you called Shri Vijay

Jyotiba Kesarkar and Shri Stephen, owners of the

vehicle and Shri Ashok Lohar, Driver, during

office hours i.e. 11.00 a.m. in the court, talked

rudely with them and threatened them that you

will detain them for four days. When they

apologized, you threatened them that you would

file complaint against them by calling the officer

of Education Department. You further threatened

them that you will file complaint against them

under section 307 of I.P.C. to the effect that they

were in the van and they purposely tried to run

over him. Your abovesaid misbehaviour shows

that you failed to maintain judicial discipline or

propriety and you conducted yourself in a

manner unbecoming of a Judicial Officer and

brought great disrepute to the institution as a

whole.

Charge3

That you misused your position to make

Shri Vijay J. Kesarkar and Ashok Lohar to take

back the statements given by them during the

preliminary enquiry and accordingly both of them

filed application to withdraw their statements

recorded during the enquiry. You thus failed to

maintain absolute integrity by indulging in most

inappropriate behaviour.

Hence the allegations against the Petitioner in the Second

Departmental Enquiry are two fold, one is the alleged assault of the driver of

the school bus by the Petitioner and the second is the threat given by the

Petitioner.

6 In so far as the processing of complaint received against the

members of subordinate

judiciary is concerned, the Hon'ble The Chief Justice

of India had issued guide lines which are comprised in his letter dated 3102014

addressed to the Hon'ble Chief Justices of the High Courts. The said

guidelines were issued so that a uniform procedure is followed by all the High

Courts dealing with such complaints. The background to the issuance of the

said guidelines is contained in the said letter dated 3102014.

The said guide

lines came to be modified by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India, which

modification was communicated by letter dated 1632017.

The modification

carried out was in respect of clause (A) of the said guidelines. A reference

would be made to the text of the said guidelines a bit later in this judgment.

7 As indicated above, the order dated 1562017

passed by the

Learned Registrar of this Court informing the Petitioner of holding of the

disciplinary proceedings against him in respect of two sets of charges which

are subject matter of the two disciplinary proceedings, is the subject matter of

the above Petitions.

8 Heard, the Learned Counsel for the parties.

9 The principal contention of the Learned Counsel appearing for the

Petitioner Mr. Shaikh was that the commencement of the Departmental

Enquiry against the Petitioner was in breach of the guidelines issued by the

Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India as the Departmental Enquiry sought to be

commenced against the Petitioner without there being a written complaint and

an affidavit in support thereof as mandated by the said guidelines. The

Learned Counsel would contend that in cases of the absence of a written

complaint and an affidavit in support thereof the Departmental Enquiry

commenced against the judicial officers have been quashed and set aside. The

Learned Counsel sought to place reliance on the unreported judgment of the

Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court in the matter of Girishkumar

Rameshchandra Soni Vs. State of Gujarat & Ors. dated 1592017

and the

judgment of the Apex Court in the matter of R. C. Sood Vs. High Court of

Judicature at Rajasthan & Ors.1 The Learned Counsel would contend that

though in respect of the second Departmental Enquiry the Petitioner had

pursuant to the show cause notice issued to him represented against the said

show cause notice and pointed out as to how it was unnecessary to hold a

Departmental Enquiry against him. The reply of the Petitioner has not been

taken into consideration and neither has the Petitioner been afforded a

personal hearing though the Petitioner had requested for the same. It was

next contended by the Learned Counsel that in so far as the first Departmental

1 (1998)5 Supreme Court Cases 493

Enquiry is concerned i.e. the incidents which have taken place whilst the

Petitioner was posted at Bhokardan District Jalna. The complaint made by one

Mr. Teple was motivated in view of the fact that the Petitioner was an Enquiry

Officer in the preliminary inquiry which was held against the said Mr. Teple.

The Learned Counsel would next contend that in so far as the second

Departmental Enquiry is concerned, which is in respect of the alleged incident

which took place at Ajara, District Kolhapur, whilst the Petitioner was posted

there. There is a reference to Advocate Mr. Shailesh Deshpande in the report

of the Learned District Judge who carried out discreet enquiry, the said

Advocate was not recommended by the Petitioner for appointment to the post

of AGP. It was sought to be contended by the Learned Counsel that why the

reference to the Advocate Mr. Shailesh Deshpande appears in the report of the

Learned District Judge 3

who carried out the discreet enquiry, is unknown.

10 Per contra the Learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent

No.2, Mr. Nerlekar would submit that power to hold the Departmental Enquiry

against the judicial officer belonging to the subordinate

judiciary is conferred

by Rule 8(2) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules

1979. The said Rule confers a wide power on the Disciplinary Authority in so

far as holding of the Departmental Enquiry is concerned and the said Rule

leaves it to the subjective satisfaction of the Disciplinary Authority whether

such an enquiry is required to be held. The Learned Counsel would contend

that in so far as the guide lines are concerned, they have been modified by the

subsequent communication dated 1632017

and the words ""and/or verifiable

material"" has been included in the guide lines meaning thereby that a

Departmental Enquiry can be commenced either when there is a complaint

accompanied by an Affidavit and/or there is verifiable material. In the instant

case, the report of the discreet enquiry which report has been forwarded to

this Court by the Learned Principal District Judge, comprised the verifiable

material on the basis of which the Departmental Enquiry has been commenced

against the Petitioner. The Learned Counsel would next contend that in the

instant case the Learned Principal District Judge of Kolhapur has submitted a

report to this Court for taking appropriate action in the matter of holding of a

Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. The Learned Counsel would

contend that the contention of the Petitioner that at the stage of considering

his explanation to the show cause notice the Petitioner is required to be heard,

is misconceived . The Disciplinary Authority on the basis of the material which

has come on record till that stage which includes the reply, has to only come to

a prima facie conclusion that there is material to proceed against the

delinquent. The Learned Counsel would next contend that reliance placed on

the judgments of the Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court as well as the

judgment of the Apex Curt in R. S. Sood, is misplaced as the said judgments

were rendered in the fact situation as prevailing in the said cases. The

Learned Counsel would contend that the Petitioner would obviously have

adequate opportunity to controvert the charges which are levied against him in

the Departmental Enquiry that would be held against him. However, on one

ground or the other the said Departmental Enquiries have been unduly

delayed by the Petitioner. The Learned Counsel would lastly contend that

since the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked against the communication

informing the Petitioner of holding of a Departmental Enquiry against him, this

court would not exercise its extra ordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the

Constitution of India. In support of which contention reliance was placed on

the following judgments of the Apex Court.

1. Union of India & Anr. Vs. Kunisetty Satyanarayana (2006) 12 SCC 28

2. Special Director & Anr. Vs Mohd. Ghulam Ghouse & Anr (2004) 3 SCC 440

3. Executive Engineer, Bihar State Housing Board. Vs. Ramesh Kumar Singh &

Ors. (1996) 1 SCC 327

4. State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Brahm Datt Sharma & Anr (1987) 2 SCC 179.

11 Having heard the Learned Counsel for the parties we have

bestowed our anxious consideration to the rival contentions.

In the context of the challenge raised in the above Petitions, the issue that

arises is as regards the power of the Disciplinary Authority in the instant case

being the Hon'ble the Chief Justice, the Hon'ble Judges of this Court to

institute the disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner. There can be no

dispute about the fact that the Maharashtra Civil Services Rules are applicable.

A useful reference could be made to Rule 8(1) and (2) of the said Rules which

are relevant for the purpose of the present Petition:

8. Procedure for imposing major penalties:(

1)

No order imposing any of the major penalties

shall be made except after an inquiry held, as far

as may be, in the manner provided in this rule

and Rule 9, or where such inquiry is held under

the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850 (37 of

1850) in the manner provided in that Act.

(2) Whenever the disciplinary authority is of the

opinion that there are grounds for inquiring into

the truth of any imputation of misconduct or

misbehaviour against a Government servant, it

may itself inquire into, or appoint under this rule

or under the provisions of the Public Servants

(Inquiries) Act, 1850, as the case may be, an

authority to inquire into the truth thereof.

Provided that, where there is a complaint of

sexual harassment within the meaning of Rule 22A

of Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules

1979, the Complaints Committee established in

each Department or Office for inquiring into such

complaints, shall be deemed to be the inquiring

authority appointed by the disciplinary authority

for the purpose of these rules and the Complaints

Committee shall hold, if separate procedure has

not been prescribed for the Complaints

Committee for holding the inquiry into the

complaints for sexual harassments, the inquiry as

for as practicable in accordance with the

procedure laid down in these rules.

ExplanationWhere

a disciplinary authority

itself holds an inquiry under this rule, any

reference to an inquiring authority in this rule

shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be

construed as reference to the disciplinary

authority.

A reading of the said Rule 8(2) therefore discloses that the

discretion is of the Disciplinary Authority if it is of the opinion that there are

grounds for inquiring into the truth of any imputation of misconduct or

misbehaviour against a Government servant. Hence the said Rule (2) can be

said to confer a wide discretion in the Disciplinary Authority in the matter of

inquiring into the truth of any misconduct or misbehaviour against the

Government servant.

12 Now coming to the guide lines which have been formulated by the

Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India which are comprised in the letter dated 3102014

they read thus:A.

The complaint making allegations against

members of the Subordinate Judiciary in the

States should not be entertained and no action

should be taken thereon, unless it is accompanies

by a duly sworn Affidavit and verifiable material

to substantiate the allegations made therein.

B. If action on such complaint meeting the

above requirement is deemed necessary,

authenticity of complaint should be duly

ascertained and further steps thereon should be

taken only after satisfaction of the competent

authority designated by the Chief Justice of the

High Court.

C. If the above requirements are not complied

with, the complaint should be filed/lodged

without taking any steps thereon.

The said guidelines were modified and communicated vide letter

dated 1632017

issued by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice Of India. The

modification carried out which is relevant for the purposes of the present

Petition is in clause (A). The modified clause (A) reads thus:

A. The complaint making allegations against

members of the Subordinate Judiciary in the

States should not be entertained and no action

should be taken thereon, unless it is accompanied

by a duly sworn Affidavit and/or verifiable

material to substantiate the allegations made

therein.

(emphasis supplied)

13 Hence by modification the requirement is that a complaint should

be accompanied by duly sworn affidavit and/or verifiable material to

substantiate the allegations made therein. Hence a complaint can be

entertained in two contingencies one is when a complaint is accompanied by a

duly sworn affidavit and second is when the complaint contains verifiable

material. It is in the light of the said modification that the instant case would

have to be considered. The said modification being in the matter of the

procedure which is required to be followed prior to holding a Departmental

Enquiry, the same would obviously relate back to the date of issuance of the

show cause notice, even if the notice is prior to the issuance of the

modification.

14 Now coming to the facts of the instant case in so far as the first

enquiry is concerned, the same is on the basis of the complaint made by Shri

Teple, which was processed by the Learned Principal District Judge Jalna and

then a report was submitted to the Learned Registrar General of this Court

which was thereafter placed before the Disciplinary Committee which directed

the issuance of the show cause notice to the Petitioner pursuant to which the

Petitioner replied to the said show cause notice and the reply having been

found not to be satisfactory, the Disciplinary Committee of this Court decided

to hold the Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. In so far as the

second Departmental Enquiry is concerned, the Learned Principal District

Judge having received information of the incident which took place on 1672015

had directed the Learned District Judge3

to conduct a discreet enquiry

in respect of the said incident which the Learned Judge conducted and

reported to the Learned Principal District Judge. The Learned Principal

District Judge on receipt of the said report forwarded the same to the Learned

Registrar General of this Court with his recommendation. The Petitioner was

thereafter issued a show cause notice as to why a Departmental Enquiry

should not be held against him. The Petitioner submitted his reply. Having

found the reply of the Petitioner to be unsatisfatory, the Disciplinary Authority

decided to hold a Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. Hence in

respect of both the Departmental Enquiries there is a report of the Learned

Principal District Judge which was forwarded along with the verifiable

material which was in the form of the report of the discreet enquiry conducted

by the Learned Principal District Judge3.

In respect of the second

Departmental Enquiry and the complaint made by Mr. Teple who is an

employee of the Court, the same was also forwarded by the Learned Principal

District Judge along with his report. Hence in so far as the Departmental

Enquiries against the Petitioner are concerned, they would be covered by the

second part of clause (A) namely that they are based on verifiable material to

substantiate the allegations made. It is therefore not possible to accept the

contention of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner that in the absence of

there being written complaint accompanied by a duly sworn affidavit, no

Departmental Enquiry can be initiated against the Petitioner. It is also not

possible to accept the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner that

the complaint and the duly sworn affidavit have to be read together with the

verifiable material so as to mean that the material cannot be independently

brought forward but has to be by way of a complaint which is accompanied by

a sworn affidavit. It is probably on account of the difficulties faced in

proceeding and initiating the disciplinary proceedings wherein information is

received by the Learned Principal District Judge or any other authority of the

Court that the amendment in the guide lines was made vide letter dated 1632017

by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India. Construing the guidelines in

the manner sought by the the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner would fetter

the powers of the Disciplinary Authority in initiating departmental proceedings

against the erring judicial officers and thereby negating the power vested in

the Disciplinary Authority for enquiring into the truth of the allegations

against a judicial officer.

15 In so far as the submission of the Learned Counsel for the

Petitioner that the reply of the Petitioner has not been considered and that the

Petitioner has also not been given a hearing in so far as the second

Departmental Enquiry is concerned, in our view the said submission is

misconceived. The Disciplinary Authority is under no obligation at the stage of

the show cause notice to afford any opportunity of hearing to a delinquent.

The Disciplinary Authority has only to consider whether there are grounds for

proceeding with so as to enquire into the truth of any allegations against the

judicial officer. In our view therefore, the said submission cannot be accepted

and there is no violation of the principles of natural justice merely because no

hearing was afforded prior to the Disciplinary Authority coming to a conclusion

to proceed departmentally against the Petitioner.

16 Now coming to the judgments on which reliance was placed by the

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner is concerned, the cause for allowing the

Special Civil Application filed by the Petitioner therein are two fold namely that

since the allegation made against the Petitioner was as regards sexual

harassment in respect of which a complaint was required to be in writing in

terms of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention,

Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 and prior thereto under the Rules which

were framed pursuant to the judgment in Vishakha's case and since in the said

case there was no written complaint but action was sought to be taken on the

basis of the oral complaint made by three Advocates. The Division Bench was

of the view that the disciplinary proceedings could not be initiated on the said

basis. The second ground was that though the incident was of the year 2012

the decision to hold a Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner therein

culminated in the charge sheet dated 2112017

issued to the Petitioner and

therefore there being a time lag of 5 years between the date of the incident

and the date of the order, the Division Bench was of the view that a

Departmental Enquiry could not be initiated against the Petitioner. The

Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court has also referred to the circular

issued by that Court on 2542017

which can be said to be paramateria to the

first circular issued by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India. The Division Bench

thereafter referred to the Judgment of the Apex Court in R. C. Sood's case

(Supra), in which case the Apex Court had set aside the Disciplinary

proceedings which were initiated against the Petitioner R. C. Sood as the

complaint was not supported by an affidavit. The Division Bench therefore

opined that in the absence of any written complaint, initiating the

departmental proceedings pursuant to the oral representation, will run counter

to the ratio laid down in the judgment of the Apex Court in R. C. Sood

and Ishwarchand Jain Vs. State of Punjab.

17 Now coming to the judgment of the Apex Court in R. C. Sood, the

said judgment was rendered by the Apex Court when neither of the circulars

i.e. circular dated 3102014

and 1632017

were in the field. The said

judgment was also rendered in the peculiar facts of the said case. In the said

case the Petitioner R. C. Sood whilst acting as a Registrar of the Rajashtan High

Court was proceeded departmentally on account of the wrong mentioning of

the cut of date for determining the age in the advertisement issued for filling

up the vacancies in the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service by way of direct

recruitment. A committee of two Judges was appointed to go into the matter

as regards the mentioning of the cut of date in the advertisement issued calling

for applications. The committee of two Judges suggested that fresh

applications be called for and the matter should be placed before the Hon'ble

Chief Justice for taking suitable action against the officer who was responsible

for issuing the incorrect notification. The matter was placed before the Full

Court of the High Court. The Full Court constituted a committee of two other

Judges to look into the record leading to the issuance of the notification. The

said committee observed that it was their tentative view that the Petitioner was

responsible for the ""forgery committed in the record"" and it recommended a

regular enquiry to be made in accordance with rules. The report of the two

Judges committee was placed before the Full Court and the Full Court resolved

that the Departmental Enquiry be initiated against the Petitioner and he should

be placed under suspension. The Petitioner challenged the said action by way

of a Writ Petition in the Apex Court. By judgment dated 22111994

the Apex

Court quashed the proposed disciplinary proceedings as well as the order

placing the Petitioner under suspension. The Apex Court observed that it was

difficult to appreciate how the two Judges committee could come to the

conclusion that there was a forgery in the record and/or any person had

benefited from the said error or that the Petitioner was responsible for the

same.

18 The Hon'ble Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court had issued

a office note dated 1251994

providing that if a complainant does not file the

requisite affidavit, no action should be taken on that complaint. Though

initially the first disciplinary proceeding was quashed by the Apex Court, the

problem of the Petitioner R. C. Sood did not end there. As observed by the

Apex Court by letter dated 27101994

one of the Judges of the Rajasthan High

Court forwarded a PIL Petition received by him to the Hon'ble Chief Justice by

his letter addressed to the Hon'ble Chief Justice mentioning therein that as

allegations are serious they deserved to be investigated thoroughly. The said

letter was the same letter which had been dealt with by the earlier Hon'ble

Chief Justice vide letter dated 3111994

and the issue was closed. However,

the matter was placed before the Full Court and the Full Court resolved that

the order passed by the Hon'ble Chief Justice on the report of the preliminary

enquiry against R. C. Sood conducted by the Additional Registrar be hereby

revoked. The Full Court thereafter resolved to constitute a committee of three

Hon'ble Judges of the Rajasthan High Court to enquire into the various

complaints forwarded to them by the Hon'ble Judge against the Petitioner R.C.

Sood. The Apex Court in the facts of the said case observed that there was no

valid reason in law for the Full Court to revoke the decision of the then Chief

Justice which was taken on 3111994.

The Apex Court also adversely

commented upon the manner in which the enquiry was sought to be conducted

by the three Judges of the Rajashtan High Court. The Apex Court observed

that the witnesses were also of the choice of one of the members of the

committee and were persons who were inimical to the Petitioner R.C.Sood.

The Apex Court observed that the complainant Vijay Singh was a imposter and

who was that person who was examined by the committee, remained

unexplained. The Apex Court therefore in the facts of the said case held that

the complaint could not have been entertained without there being an

affidavit. Paragraphs 23 and 25 of the said judgment are eloquent and reflect

the reasons why the Apex Court interfered in the said matter. The same is

therefore reproduced hereinunder for the sake for convenience:

23. Apart from the nonjudicious

manner in

which the Three Judge Committee conducted the

enquiry the sequence of events, which bears

repetition, shows that being piqued with this

Court's judgment quashing the first departmental

enquiry the High Court, with a few functionaries

playing an active role, left no stone unturned

with a view to victimise the petitioner. On 21st

October, 1994 the High Court suspended the

petitioner and decided to hold the first

departmental enquiry. On 24th October, 1994 this

suspension was challenged by way of a writ

petition in this Court in which this Court on 7th

November, 1994 issued show cause notice to the

High Court. Suddenly we find on the High Court

record Justice Kokje's letter dated 27th October,

1994 forwarding to the then Chief Justice the old

complaint of Vijay Singh. The Chief Justice makes

an endorsement on this letter on the same date thereby

showing the sense of urgency. First office

note is written only on 9th November, 1994, after

issuance of notice by this Court in the writ

petition filed by the petitioner. The fact that it is

only on 30th November, 1994, after the decision

of this Court on 22nd November, 1994, that the

Full Court fixed up the matter lends credence to

the petitioner's submission that the dates which

appear on record may not be real. This is more so

when we find that none of the documents in the

form of complaints allegedly received by the

Judges bear any endorsement as to the date of

receipt of the same. To crown it all the second

round started on a complaint of Vijay Singh

stated to have been received by Justice Kokje on

or before 27th October, 1994. This complaint had

been circulated in September, 1993 amongst all

the then Judges of the High Court and in respect

of which order was passed by the then Chief

Justice and the matter was closed on 31st

January, 1994. Respondents' counsel could give

no explanation as to how Justice Kokje got this

complaint against the petitioner some time before

27th October 1994 when he was transferred to

the Rajasthan High Court only on 28th April,

1994. At that time the petitioner had ceased to be

the Registrar of the High Court with effect from

1st February, 1994. It is obvious that a copy of

this complaint was handed over to Justice Kokje

by some one who was interested in harming the

petitioner and thereupon the second round of

action against the petitioner commenced with

Justice Kokje being made one of the members of

the Three Judge Committee.

25. Normally enquiry committees are set up in

order to ascertain correct facts. Here, however,

we have a situation where a committee consisting

of a local judge and two transferred judges was

set up with the local judge sitting alone and

collecting a menagerie of witnesses who had a

grudge against the petitioner and were thus sure

to depose against him. Some of these witnesses

were those who had not sent any complaint

against the petitioner prior to 30th November,

1994 and it is only the local judge who, wanting

to gather statements against the petitioner, could

have known whom to approach and call for

evidence. Of the two transferred judges who were

members of the committee, one never took part

in any proceeding when evidence was recorded

between 20th February (Sic 20111994)

and 2nd

January, 1995. Yet he signs the report dated 4th

January, 1995. The other transferee judge is the

person who set the ball rolling with his conjuring

up Vijay Singh's complaint which had originally

been circulated long before the judge's transfer to

Rajasthan. The respondent's counsel was unable

to explain as to how this complaint was

conveniently placed in this judge's hand. It is

evident that there was a deliberate design to

bring to a premature end the judicial career of

the petitioner, whose name, at that time, was

being actively considered for elevation as High

Court Judge. This is apparent from the fact that

in the resolutions dated 30th November, 1994

and 5th January, 1995 it was resolved by the Full

Court that the President of India and the Chief

Justice of India should be informed about the

holding of the departmental enquiry against the

petitioner. Acting on the basis of the Committee's

biased report the Full Court, we are sad to note,

continued in similar vein and proceeded to nail

the petitioner by taking a decision which lacked

objectivity. Apparently stung by the judgment

dated 22nd November, 1994 of this Court it

retaliated by launching a fresh set of charges

against the petitioner clearly with a view to ruin

his judicial career. We have no doubt that the

action taken by the court was not bona fide and

amounts to victimisation. This is certainly not

expected from a judicial forum, least of all the

High Court, which is expected to discharge its

administrative duties as fairly and objectively as

it is required to discharge its judicial functions.

19 In our view, the judgments of the Gujarat High Court in

Girishkumar Soni's case and the Apex Court in R. C. Sood's case having been

rendered in the peculiar facts and circumstances as were prevailing in the said

cases would not aid the Petitioner in so far as the instant case is concerned. In

the instant case the factual basis has changed in as much as the original

circular issued by the Chief Justice of India has been amended by the

subsequent circular providing for a written complaint accompanied by an

affidavit and/or verifiable material. In our view, in respect of both the

Departmental Enquiries there being verifiable material on record, the same

would be covered by the amended circular dated 1632017.

20 The question that also arises is whether in the facts of the present

case we should exercise our writ jurisdiction. As indicated above the Petitioner

has invoked the Writ Jurisdiction of this court against the order dated 1572016

informing him that a Departmental Enquiry is to be commenced against

him. The Petitioner can obviously participate in the enquiry and refute or

dispel the charges which are leveled against him. In our view, the

commencement of the said two disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner

cannot be said to be without jurisdiction as is sought to be contended by the

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner as being in violation of the circulars issued

by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India. In our view the reliance placed by

the Learned Counsel for the Respondent No.2 on the judgments (Supra) of the

Apex Court, seems to be apposite. The Apex Court has in terms observed that

exercise of writ jurisdiction at the initial stage of commencement of the

disciplinary proceedings would only be in exceptional cases more especially in

cases where the disciplinary proceedings are commenced without jurisdiction.

Such is not the case in the instant matter. We therefore do not deem it

appropriate to exercise our Writ Jurisdiction.

21 We however, leave the contentions of the Petitioner in respect of

the charges levelled against him in the Departmental Enquiries open. Subject

to the aforesaid, the above Writ Petitions are dismissed. Rule to stand

discharged in both the Petitions with no order as to costs.

(HT File)

After four rounds of admissions, less than a quarter of the 1,400 reserved seats on offer in the city's private schools for differently abled students were filled this year. This has prompted the government to carry forward the vacant seats to the next academic year.

Hindustan Times had reported last week that the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) had invited fresh online applications for 1,268 entry-level reserved seats for a fourth round of admissions to the current academic year which has just three months left.

On Wednesday, the draw of lots were held for these seats but only 123 were filled. The DoE cited ""lack of applications"" for the large number of seats going vacant.

""Of the 125 applications we received during the fresh round of admission, 123 candidates were absorbed. The selected candidates have to approach the allotted school on or before December 31,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said.

According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016, three per cent of the total number of seats meant for the economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) category are reserved for children with disabilities.

Goel said that the department will carry forward the remaining reserved seats to next academic session (2019-20). ""The seats will be counted in the category during next year's admission,"" he said. The notification of admission in the entry level classes under the 25% reserved seats for the EWS/DG category is likely to be announced in the first week of January, next year.

Officials in the DoE said that they are planning to organise awareness campaigns among parents to motivate them to apply.

""There is lack of awareness among parents about the reserved seats because this was the first time the quota was introduced within the 25% EWS/DG seats. We are planning to organise campaigns to aware parents from the coming admission session,"" an official said.

Experts, however, said that the ""lack of inclusiveness"" in schools make parents reluctant from applying. ""Though the situation in private schools is better than the government schools, parents of children with disabilities are still reluctant from applying there. They think their kids will only be able to adjust in special schools. More efforts need to be put in to make campuses more inclusive by appointing trained special educators and providing better infrastructure facilities,"" said Dr Satender Singh, disability rights activist."

The district inspector of school (DIOS) PK Upadhyay said two schools, Cambridge School in Sector 27 and Bal Bharti School in Sector 21, have agreed to return hiked fees. While Cambridge School management agreed to return hiked amount per semester (₹17,000), Bal Bharti School has decided to return ₹7,000 as hiked amount in one semester.

""We had served notices to the two schools regarding hiked fees in the past and they have now agreed to roll it back. Till now, we have got confirmation from two schools only. We are probing other schools which have also hiked fees,"" Upadhyay said.

The move comes after continued agitation by the All Noida Schools' Parents' Association (ANSPA) against ""arbitrary fee hike"" which is not in accordance with the Uttar Pradesh Self Finance Independent Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act. The ordinance was first brought into motion on April 9, 2018 and the Act was enforced in August this year.

According to K Arunachalam, general secretary of the ANSPA, they had sent a complaint to the DIOS regarding six private schools, namely Apeejay School, Somervillle School, Amity International School, Delhi Public School, Noida, Cambridge School and Bal Bharti School, for increasing fees in an alleged arbitrary manner.

""Although we have received information regarding two schools agreeing to roll back hiked fees, they have not done it yet. If schools really intend to adjust the hiked amount with the future fees, they have to do it in the next quarter. It has been four months since the Act has been enforced, however, no private school has followed it yet,"" Arunachalam said.

On November 3, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar had held a meet with principals of all private schools in the district and asked them to decided their fee structure as per the newly regulated Act and upload it on their school's website within a week's time.

Reacting to allegations of inaction by the district fee regulatory committee, Upadhyay said, ""We will decide in the next committee meeting on schools which do not follow the fees Act.""

However, Asha Prabhakar, principal of Bal Bharti School, denied claims made by the DIOS.

""We had already returned the hiked fees to parents in July this year. The ordinance came in April and we were told to roll back hiked fees. There was a rise of ₹7,000 in the first quarter and we returned the amount in the second quarter fees. The claims of DIOS that Bal Bharti School has agreed to roll back fees now only is untrue,"" Prabhakar said.

The management of the Cambridge School could not be contacted at the time of this report going to publication."

Students enrolled in government-run English medium primary schools say they do not want to switch over to Hindi as a medium when they begin lessons in upper primary school after finishing Class 5. Their demand to convert some of the upper primary schools from Hindi to English medium is growing louder with every passing day.

Kajal Kumari, a student of English medium primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar said, ""Switching back to Hindi will not be easy. I request the authorities to please do something so that we may continue to study in English after passing Class 5. It is through a lot of hard work that we developed a comfort level in studying in English. Now, if we go back to learning lessons in Hindi, it will undo whatever we learnt over the past few years.""

In 2015, the basic education department had converted a few primary schools of Uttar Pradesh into English medium institutions. The primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar was also made English medium at this time. It has 434 students enrolled in it and most of them do not wish to switch over to a Hindi medium school.

Officials said that after seeing the craze for English-medium schools growing in the state, the BJP government decided to convert 5,000 primary schools to English-medium ones from the April 2018 session. At present, 4,97,108 students are studying in these government-run primary schools.

""In Lucknow alone, there are 44 such schools where more than 6,200 students are enrolled,"" said Amar Kant Singh, Basic Shiksha Adhikari, Lucknow.

Hariyali Srivastava, assistant teacher at primary school Gejha, said the problem was that most students coming to government-run primary schools hailed from humble backgrounds. ""Their parents can't afford to send them to private English medium schools in Class 6, as the fee is very high,"" she said.

Corroborating what the teacher said, Kajal added, ""I want to study only in a government-run English medium school because my father (an e-rickshaw driver) can't afford to pay the fees charged by private English medium schools.""

Zainab Khatoon, another Class 5 girl of the same school, said that she wanted the state government to intervene in the matter.

Making an appeal to senior officials in the basic education department, Srivastava said, ""The students have learnt all terminology in English. Now, they will have to study in Hindi medium upper primary schools, which will be very difficult for them. Our students are asking for help. They want schools to be made English medium till Class 10.""

Chhavi Agarwal, assistant teacher of another primary school, said she teaches 280 students. ""Similar requests are pouring in from my students too.""

Lucknow BSA Amar Kant Singh agreed with the teachers and said that the demand for English medium schools after Class 5 was ""quite natural"". ""After studying in English medium institutions, students will not like to go back to Hindi medium schools,"" he said.

A senior basic education department official added that they were aware of the growing demand for government-run English medium schools and were looking into the matter."

Eight of these colleges do not even have land allocated for building. Most of these 55 colleges function out of few rooms in government schools.

Of the 81 government colleges opened in five years, 73 were new colleges, while eight were bifurcated. The bifurcation process includes opening separate colleges for science, commerce and art streams out of existing colleges.

Admissions to these colleges have taken place and classes are going on but the buildings of 47 colleges are under construction.

Several of colleges opened in the past five years run out of classrooms borrowed from nearby government schools, including the government colleges in Sri Dungargarh and Kolayat, Bikaner district. ""Two rooms have been allocated to us in the nearby school. Since the space is less, the classes are conducted in different batches,"" said Mahendra Rajput, a first year student of Government College, Sri Dungargarh.

""We haven't had any practical classes till now but the exams are starting on January 15. We don't even know where the exams would be held. They may make some temporary arrangement on the playground,"" he added.

Nearly 200 students have been admitted to Government College Sri Dungargarh that has six teachers, said GP Singh who was appointed the officer on duty when the college was opened.

Dr Digvijay Shekhawat, assistant director, college education (Bikaner Zone), said: ""Fifteen bighas of land was allotted for the college in Sri Dungargarhbut the funds for construction of the building have not been received. We received Rs 1.5 lakh for furniture and we will procure furniture worth Rs 10 lakh soon. Several faculties have joined the college recently. The classes are running smoothly,"" said Shekhawat.

Space for several bifurcated colleges is also uncertain. While three new colleges were opened in Kota division, two of the existing colleges were bifurcated. New government colleges were opened in Antah, Itawa and Kanwas which are still running out of nearby government schools.

""The arts college bifurcated out of JDB Girls' College, Kota, is yet to get clearance from the public works department (PWD) as several trees have to be cut down and demolitions have to be carried out for the same.

Land for the commerce college which is bifurcated out of the same college was allocated near the highway, where several 100-year-old trees have to be cut for the same. Moreover, a building that dates back to the British era exists on the land. Hence, construction of a college building there may be difficult,"" said Dr. Dinesh Tiwari, assistant director, college education, (Kota Zone).

Reacting to the present condition of the colleges opened under the BJP regime, party spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said: ""The BJP government opened new colleges heeding public demand. At some places the colleges are running out of different buildings but in most of the places, the colleges have enough space. For example, Poddar school in Jaipur had huge space and a college was opened in the same campus. The BJP government did better work in the education sector in five years than the previous Congress regime.""

Satyendra Singh Raghav, spokesperson of the Congress, said: ""The BJP government kept making new announcements and schemes but did not work on the ground. They did not check the condition of the schools and colleges or the schemes on ground."""

During his monthly Jan Samvad programme at Suchana Bhawan in Meurs' Road, Das took cognizance of a woman's complaint against Dumri CO Jagdish Kumar Pandey. Sunita Devi, the complainant, had accused Pandey of asking extra money for issuing correction slips.

Das asked state land reforms, registration and revenue secretary Kamal Kishore Soan to suspend the officer and order a probe to evaluate his ill-gotten assets. ""These are the officers who tarnish the image of the government. There assets must be seized and used to open schools and hospitals,"" Das said before ordering the department to transfer the CO and block development officers (BDO) every three years.

The claims stood in contrast to the Das government's recent hectic parleys to the Union government to declare 129 blocks drought hit due to insufficient rains this year and seek grant of Rs 819 crore for carrying relief measures. Hearing this, Das ordered the deputy commissioner to camp in the area on December 30 and ensure their compensations are disbursed.

The rule would establish an electronic pre-registration system and run the annual lottery based on the pre-registrations rather than requiring employers to file entire H-1B applications. The DHS is also considering changing the way it conducts the lottery to improve the odds of those with graduate degrees from U.S. universities. While U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is providing 30 days for public comment, the agency is attempting to fast-track the process to have the system in place for the upcoming H-1B application period, which is set to begin in April 2019.

While these proposed rule changes have the potential to save employers considerable time and money, there are major concerns about whether loopholes could exist to manipulate the proposed system. In addition, there are questions as to whether the DHS would exceed its administrative authority in adopting such changes. These issues, along with typical administrative red tape, could mean that the revised registration system may not be in place in time for the April 2019 filing season. However, employers should make themselves aware of these potential changes in the event they are adopted in the near future.

The proposed rule changes, announced on November 30, would impose a new requirement for H-1B petitioners to initially electronically register with USCIS during a designated registration period. USCIS would conduct the annual H-1B lottery from the pool of timely filed pre-registrants instead of requiring would-be petitioners to submit complete petitions.

Under the current system, 65,000 H-1Bs are available each year under the annual quota (not including petitioners exempt from the cap under various categories). An additional 20,000 are available to graduates of U.S. graduate degree programs. Petitioners submit completed applications during the first week in April since petitions can be accepted up to 180 days in advance and the annual allotment of visas becomes available on October 1 each year (the first day of the federal fiscal year). Those petitions that are selected are then adjudicated and those not accepted are returned to the petitioner (along with the filing fees).

USCIS is also proposing to change the way it conducts the lottery. There are currently two pools of applicants: regular H-1B applicants who are eligible for 65,000 H-1B visas allocated annually, and graduates of U.S. master degree programs who are additionally eligible for a separate pool of 20,000 H-1Bs. Currently, USCIS puts the masters cap applicants through a lottery for the 20,000 and then conducts the general lottery which would include individuals not selected in the masters cap lottery. USCIS seeks to flip this order and require the general lottery first, putting all masters cap-eligible individuals through that system, and then process unselected eligible people through the master cap. The idea is that this system will increase the overall number of people with U.S. masters degrees and higher receiving H-1Bs.

It is important to note that the DHS has not revealed the inner-workings of the registration system so we cannot see the actual mechanics. As for what will be required to register, the DHS says only basic information regarding the petitioner and the beneficiary would be required, including, but not limited to: the employer's name, employer ID number, and mailing address; the employer's authorized representative's name, job title, and contact information; the beneficiary's full name, date of birth, country of birth, country of citizenship, gender, and passport number; whether the beneficiary has obtained a master's or higher degree from a U.S. institution of higher education; the employer's attorney or accredited representative, if applicable (and possibly submitting an electronic G-28); and any additional basic information requested by the registration system or USCIS. Petitioners would not have to submit a Labor Condition Application (LCA) in advance. They would need to check an attestation regarding the truthfulness and accuracy of the information and whether the petitioner intends to employ the beneficiary consistent with the registration.

During the registration period, if more registrations are received than available slots, USCIS would conduct a computer-selected random lottery of registrations received. The number selected will be determined in the same manner as is currently implemented. The main difference will be that the order for the two lotteries will be reversed from the current system, with the regular lottery happening first and the masters cap lottery second. Those not selected would be kept in reserve.

If the rule changes are adopted, petitioners selected in the pre-registration lottery would receive a notice of eligibility to file an H-1B petition with information on the place to file and time period required for filing. No substitution of beneficiaries would be permitted. USCIS may also require petitioners submit copies of the registration information with the Form I-129 in order to verify the registration.

Once selected, DHS proposes that petitioners would have at least 60 days to properly file an H-1B petition for the named beneficiary. USCIS may choose to stagger the filing periods (for example, between April 1 and May 31, between May 1 and June 30, etc.) in the selection notice and provide periods of longer than 60 days if necessary to accommodate processing backlogs or other operational needs. Failure to file within the prescribed filing period would result in a rejection or denial, and the petitioner would forego eligibility to file based on that selection notice. By defining the filing windows and offering a 60 day window, applicants would also be able to obtain an LCA with sufficient time. DHS is proposing to amend the rule allowing filing up to 180 days in advance to accommodate this new system.

It is important to note that implementation of these new rules would not increase the total number of visas eligible under the quota. If the masters cap and the general cap selection order is reversed, however, this change could favor technology companies because of the general larger hiring of individuals attending masters programs in the U.S.

We will soon know whether the new rules will be adopted and put into place for 2019. Because of the technical complications of the program implementation and the potential litigation, however, you must prepare for two potential scenarios: one where the changes are adopted in advance of the April 2019 filing date, and one where the status quo will be in effect for at least another year. We generally recommend that you plan on initiating matters right at the turn of the New Year as if the current system will remain in place to address all the filings before the April 2019 filing requirement.

However, even if the new system is put into place, this preparation would be valuable to all your applicants as they have a high likelihood of being selected either this year or in future years. If your cases are not initiated in a timely manner, it could cause major concerns for the individuals who will be very interested in the progress of their cases. This is especially true of cases where the H-1B qualifications are not clear.

At this point, there is no reason to expect a change to issues associated with travel after filing or other elements of processing after filing. Based upon the past two years, it is very possible that Premium Processing will be suspended again for H-1B cap cases. Also, we can expect USCIS to come up with new basis for Requests for Evidence (RFE).

If the proposed rules are held up due to litigation or administrative concerns, the government will suspend the program for this coming year and proposed using the system at a later date. If this happens, USCIS will make an announcement on its website and inform readers of the time-frame for filing a regular H-1B petition. However, the agency would still run the lotteries for filed petitions in the way described in this proposed rule (regular first, then masters). The DHS may finalize the reversal of the lottery order as a final rule on a separate timetable from the pre-registration portion of the rule and is seeking comments on this idea.

The takeaway for now is that nothing has changed for employers in terms of process and expectation. News is sure to come in the upcoming months, however, which could change this analysis. For now, we recommend that employers consult with their immigration counsel and provide some limited guidance to managers and individuals who will have H-1B cap cases."

The guide was developed by a multi-agency team that included experts in the field and members of the California Department of Education's (CDE) Social and Emotional Learning State Team, a group that has been meeting since 2016 with the goal of advancing social and emotional learning.

""This new guide offers a toolkit of resources that will assist California educators in serving the social and emotional needs of the whole child,"" said Torlakson. ""Science confirms that learning is not only cognitive, but also social and emotional. These resources help students develop the skills they need to function well in the classroom, the community, in college and their careers.""

Social-emotional skills include the ability to: set and achieve positive goals; feel and show empathy for others; establish and maintain positive relationships; make responsible decisions; and understand and manage emotions. The CDE is committed to helping educators learn more about social and emotional learning and how to make this a part of every child's school experience. To support this work, CDE joined the Collaborating States Initiative, a group of eight states that share information, best practices, promising tools, and ideas in the interest of building strong programs in schools across their states. The Collaborating States Initiative is hosted by the Collaborative for Academic Social and Emotional Learning.

In 2017, the CDE and its partners created California's Social and Emotional Learning Guiding Principles, a set of statements intended to provide guidance to education leaders at counties, districts, schools, and expanded learning programs. Then it began gathering a comprehensive list of resources aligned with these principles.

This new guide was compiled in collaboration with officials from Massachusetts, Minnesota, Washington, and Tennessee. Also included are resources created with the help of staff in California districts leading the way on systemic social and emotional learning: Los Angeles Unified School District, Oakland Unified School District, Palo Alto Unified School District, Sacramento City Unified School District, and San Francisco Unified School District.

India's top intellectuals nominate the next generation. Here is their list of some of the brightest minds on the horizon.

Intellectuals are an essential component of an open society -- they bring their unique analytical insights to not only scrutinise the society in its immediate form but also help shape the ideas and ideologies of the future. They conduct research, deploy critical thinking, reason, teach, author books, challenge dogma and equip us with cognitive tools to engage with the world we inhabit -- just for the love of knowledge, or for the greater human good.

India has a rich and ancient tradition of producing such thinkers, teachers and philosophers who have contributed to the creation of new schools of thought that have travelled and established themselves far beyond Indian shores too. They have also passed on their learnings and discoveries to successive generations to preserve, innovate upon and further.

But who are the next generation of Indian intellectuals in the modern times we inhabit? The next Ramachandra Guha, the next Arvind Panagariya, the next Ashok Gulati, the next Raghuram Rajan, the next Makarand Paranjape, or the next Shashi Tharoor?

Over the last few months, ThePrint spoke to some of the biggest names in Indian intelligentsia and asked them who, in their opinion, are the brightest minds on the horizon -- in history, economics, sociology, political studies, law, strategic affairs, philosophy, public affairs, and inter-disciplinary studies, among others.

What follows is a long and impressive list of next-gen intellectuals who have begun to make a mark and given notice of their coming brilliance. Some of the nominees were directly mentored by the veterans who named them while the others are those whose work they track closely. This is by no means an exhaustive list and will be updated when more intellectuals respond to our requests.

Here's the list, in alphabetical order of the names of the nominators:

A trained sociologist and clinical psychologist, Nandy's area of expertise is the psychology of violence, the psychology of genocide and the future of ideas.

On his choices, Nandy said: ""All three have special relevance in the 150th year of Gandhi's birth.""

But he adds: Two warnings first. I am in my 80s now; I have seen four generations pass by. Those who look young to me do not look that young to others. Also, those in their 20s and 30s have not often got the chance to find themselves and to display their talent or promise. My own first book was published when I was in my 40s.""

His picks are:

Devji is professor of Indian history at St Antony's College, Oxford. He is an expert on modern Islamic studies and ethics, and violence in a globalised world.

Mishra is an author and columnist, who was nominated as fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2009. He is the author of bestselling books From the Ruins of Empire: The Revolt Against the West and the Remaking of Asia and Age of Anger: A History of the Present.

""Both Faisal and Pankaj have opened up much-explored areas like liberation struggles in Asia, Gandhian studies and populism for the next generation of scholars and activist-scholars,"" Nandy said of his choices.

Jadhav is a senior lecturer in cross-cultural psychiatry at University College, London. He is the founding editor of the international journal, Anthropology and Medicine, published by Taylor & Francis.

Nandy calls him ""a brilliant psychiatrist, whose sharp clinical insights are bound to enrich the struggle for human dignity and studies of humiliation"".

An agricultural economist, Gulati is former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. His picks are:

Saini is an expert in Indian agricultural trade policy and food security, and is a senior consultant at Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.

""She has reasonably good work in the field. She is equipped to advise policymakers on agriculture and related issues,"" Gulati said of her.

A Sol Goldman Professor of political science and international and public affairs, Brown University, Varshney is considered an expert voice on ethnicity and nationalism, political economy of development and South Asian politics and political economy. His picks are:

Additional Chief Secretary (Secretariat Administration) Mahesh Gupta has ordered the probe and in all likelihood they would be suspended anytime now, the source said.

In the sting operation, Om Prakash Kashyap, personal secretary of backward welfare minister Om Prakash Rajbhar is shown allegedly seeking Rs 40 lakh for a transfer.

There are also alleged recordings of the secretariat staff assuring the reporter posing as a contractor that a school bag and uniform contract would be swung in his favour and for the deal, talks will be held with the husband of minister of state for basic education Anupama Jaiswal.

The secretary of the minister is shown seeking commission in the tender of socks and shoes. The minister who is from the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) has clarified that he has nothing to do with the whole incident and has asked principal secretary of his department to order a probe into the whole issue.

In the same sting operation, secretary of MoS (Mining) Archana Pandey, is shown striking a deal with the reporter for getting him mining contracts in about half-a-dozen districts.

The secretary SP Tripathi will be investigated by a special investigation team (SIT), the minister said adding that stringent action will be taken against her PS.

Santosh Awasthi, personal secretary to the MoS Basic Education, Sandeep Singh, is also seen in the sting operation ""working out a deal"" on a books contract and seeking his own cut in the deal. Sandeep Singh is the grand son of former UP chief minister and currently the Rajasthan governor Kalyan Singh.

The sting operation has come has a rude shock to the Yogi Adityanath-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in UP which has often spoken of probity and good governance.

On many public platforms, chief minister Adityanath has claimed that graft has been eradicated from the system under his watch.

The sting operation however has exposed his claims and could add to the ever growing woes of the BJP government.

Trump makes surprise visit to Iraq; meets US soldiers

US president Donald Trump and First Lady Melania on Wednesday night made a surprise visit to Iraq to greet American soldiers stationed in the country. This is his first visit to Iraq as the US President. ""I want to come and pay my respects most importantly to the great soldiers, great troopers we have here,"" Trump told a pool of reporters travelling with him. He stayed in the country for a few hours.

While in Iraq, Trump met with US military leaders and spoke to troops at the Al-Asad Air Base, a joint US-Iraqi military base west of Baghdad. A scheduled in-person meeting with Iraq's Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi was cancelled. Trump's travel to Iraq was made public after he finished giving remarks to a group of about 100 mostly US special operations troops engaged in combat operations in Iraq and Syria.

When asked why he wanted to come to Iraq, Trump told reporters before a meeting with military leaders on base: ""It's a place I have been talking about for many many years. I was talking about it as a civilian"".

The UT education department has written to the engineering department in this regard and the budget too has been received for the same. The ministry of human resource and development (MHRD) has allotted Rs 4.5 lakh to every school for setting up of the plants.

As per officials, the plants would be set up at rooftops from where water will be added to water coolers and dispensers.

MHRD had approved water purifier plants for government model senior secondary schools and government high schools in June this year. The purification capacity of the plants would be 1,000 litre per hour. Education department came up with the list of schools.

Sharing details, director school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, ""I had a meeting with the officials from public health department. I have asked them to plan a proper design so that maintenance is not a problem for at least three to four years. We don't want the schools to be struggling for the maintenance of the water purifying plant once it is installed.""

He added, ""We have also asked them to make sure that a separate connection is provided for the water purifier such that the purified water is not wasted in washrooms. A separate tank should solve the problem.""

Besides this, UT education department has released funds for science and knowledge parks to come up in 20 schools this year. A budget of Rs 3 lakh per school is being proposed for development of the same by the education department. Through these parks department further looks forward to popularizing science, general knowledge/awareness and to give practical experience of the theoretical concept."

New CSR guidelines for companies have came into effect from April 1, 2013 and are a revised version of the previous comprehensive guidelines of April 2010.

Range of budgetary allocation for CSR and sustainability activities (as % of profits in previous year) has been revised with companies profits less than Rs 100 crore the budgetary allocation is 3-5%. For profits between Rs 100 crore to Rs 500 crore, it is 2-3%, and those with profits Rs 500 crore and above, it stands at 1-2%. Further, the revised guidelines by the Department of Public Enterprises also take internal stakeholders, particularly employees, into account, unlike earlier.

However, it is the statutory obligation that is forcing the corporate role and not a desire to make a sustainable impact in the communities a corporate is working in.

And hence there is the need of CSR Version 3.0 going beyond statutory obligations.

On being asked how CSR can move to the next level, the Minister of State for Corporate Affairs, PP Chaudhary, responded, ""CSR cannot be an ad hoc work, but should be part of a long-term strategy of the corporate, a core business function not a peripheral activity, ideally bridging the rural and urban divide, and corporate houses need to work towards that ahead.""

Sukanti Ghosh, the Chicago based global partner of APCO Worldwide Consulting notes, ""Look beyond community relations (which is only the first level and good in case of hygiene and education), and start strategic CSR in areas around policy advocacy and business continuity. Specially in cases where there can be a civil society unrest affecting your business. Create a coalition with other organisations, NGOs and media to take on a larger issue"".

This can be a cause related to environment, vocational education, education or health of the girl child. In fact, Bharat Kharbanda, COO, Pearl Academy, Delhi, advocates linking girl child education as a part of CSR in all cases of CSR initiatives as far as possible.

Neelam Thakkar, senior manager in government healthcare, London and Jayanta Sur, a vertical head of the global chemical major Solvay, simultaneously draw attention towards ethical conduction of business and decision-making itself, and shouldering responsibility and mentoring towards your employees as a part of CSR. EY Report on CSR also calls for a CSR framework which is a way of doing business resulting in a significant impact on community and long term sustainability.

In fact, many rightly believe that sustainability is to be factored in how the business itself is done (with people and planet focus), and not just what is done with a part of the profits, as mandated by the low today. New policy framework about CSR must factor this."

University officials said the decision was taken due to security reasons as Allama Iqbal Library in the campus is yet to install CCTVs and sensor gates. However, the issue snowballed into a major controversy prompting the University to withdraw the decision and allow pheran-clad people inside the library after a thorough check.

""How silly can it get? Have we solved all other problems that we create new ones? Kindly take note J&K governor,"" tweeted Naeem Akhtar, former J&K Education minister and senior Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader, tagging the J&K governor.

Chief Librarian of University of Kashmir, GM Peerzada, said Alama Iqbal Library is a repository of so many rare books and handwritten manuscripts as old as 300 years.

""There are no CCTVs and sensor gates. Due to security reasons, we told children that this library belongs to you and if you can come without pheran, it would be better. For example, I was walking near the library at around 8.30 pm and I saw some people. They were not students. When I asked them where they are going, they said they want to go to the toilet. I told them the library is not to go to toilet but for reading. I asked them to show their ID card but they ran away,"" said Peerzada.

The ban evoked a sharp response with people questioning authorities over the decision. ""Since so many people have asked me about this, I have given the relaxation and allowed people with pheran. People can come wearing pheran but they should take their hands out so that we can check them properly,"" he said.

The decision of the University comes days after a major row erupted in Kashmir after Zonal Education Officer of Langate banned the cultural dress in its offices.

The ban evoked sharp reactions with people creating hashtags on Twitter to support the pheran and calling for the department to revoke the ban. Drawing flak, the education department later withdrew the order in a bid to calm tempers.

Pheran is a traditional dress of Kashmir and both, men and women take pride in donning it. Older Kashmiri women wear pheran in all seasons while men prefer to wear it during winters to keep warm.

People also use kangri (a traditional fire pot) under the pheran to keep themselves warm during winters. In 2014, the Army had to withdraw its advisory urging journalists not to wear pheran while visiting its Corps Headquarters."

GST refund glitches, refusal of the state to refund 42 per cent share of the Central incentives pertaining to the pre-GST period, stalemate in the land acquisition for major infrastructure development projects like four-laning of the Baddi-Nalagarh highway and rail connectivity has left the investors disappointed.

The only silver-lining is that the state gets top ranking nationally in the ease of doing business initiative in the fast-moving category. Its overall ranking has improved to 16th as against 17th attained last year. No new industrial unit has been set up due to the locational disadvantage and little has been done to break the monopoly of transport unions whose freight is among the highest in the country.

The 5-year Central Capital Investment Incentive for access to credit at 30 per cent for plant and machinery announced for the micro, small and medium enterprises is the lone new Central scheme which brought some cheer to the existing units.

Students without uniform, scholarship

It was a challenging year for the government in the education sector as it grappled with downtrend in enrollment and filling of vacancies while facing stiff resistance from teacher unions in its bid to bring qualitative improvement in education.

The scholarship scam of Rs 250 crore was unearthed in the Education Department and preliminary investigations revealed that the tentacles of the scam spread to other states also. The government has now handed over the investigations to the CBI. The department remained under the scanner of the High Court which monitored the measures taken by government to fill vacant posts.

The regularisation of teacher has not been done since 2008 and resentment was brewing among teachers as a large number of teachers retired without getting promotion. The government closed 100 elementary schools with less than 10 students and proposed the merger or closure of more than 400 elementary schools.

Efforts were made to get the best from teachers as annual increment of 38 PGTs were stopped for less than 25 per cent results in Class XII board examinations. To arrest the flight of students to private schools, the government introduced pre-primary (Nursery) classes in 3,391 schools on a pilot basis from the coming session and so far, 30,000 students have been registered. The enrollment in government schools has dropped by 23.7 per cent in past 10 years.

Under pressure from student unions, the government took a retrograde step to revert to annual system from semester system under RUSA while the cluster university, which was set up at Mandi, is yet to be functional.

The government failed to provide free uniforms to students of government schools from Class I to Class XII under the Atal Vardi Yojana.

The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti.

Even as there was marginal increase in revenue from power to Rs 1,100 crore as compared to Rs 950 crore last year, yet the state failed to add even a single megawatt to its existing capacity. The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti. There was complete lack of interest in the 1000 MW solar energy projects in Spiti as the HP State Transmission Corporation failed to lay the transmission line to evacuate power from the region.

The Directorate of Energy allotted just two projects - the jinxed 780 MW Jangi Thopan to the SJVNL and the 447 MW Dugar in 2018.

No effort was made to store over rain water in the monsoon on the Giri, Dharampur khud, both tributaries of the Yamuna, that goes waste every year as Shimla and Solan continue to face water shortage.

Private power producers cited high cost of power generation and lack of infrastructure like roads and transmission lines as the main reasons for not showing interest in the projects.The existing power companies had to resort to shutdown of powerhouses owing to the high level of silt. As a result, power companies and state suffered losses due to the frequent shutdown, while the consumers faced power cuts and water problems for hours during the shutdown.

Caught in debt trap

With the debt mounting to almost Rs 50,000 crore, the poor financial health of the state remained the biggest challenge before the BJP regime in its first year in office.

The absence of major revenue generation and limited Central funding under various schemes prevented the Jai Ram government from undertaking any major schemes. Most big projects and schemes are being implemented through Central funding.

Even as the Congress cried hoarse about the poor fiscal management, the BJP regime raised loans to the tune of Rs 2,500 crore against a limit of Rs 7,600 crore. The salary component of almost 2 lakh government employees is Rs 11,000 crore while the pensionary burden is to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore annually. A sum of Rs 4,300 crore will have to be paid as interest on loans during the financial year 2018-19.

The biggest area of concern is the extra spending on recruitment, besides upgrade and opening of new health and educational institutions. The only silver-lining is the hike in revenue from the power sector from Rs 750 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 10,500 crore.

The biggest challenge before the CM, who holds the Finance Department, is generating resources for which the government is eying power, tourism, industry and mining."

FINRA found that Morgan Stanley's AML program failed to meet the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act because of three shortcomings:

FINRA also found that Morgan Stanley failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system reasonably designed to comply with Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, which generally prohibits the offer or sale of unregistered securities. In particular, Morgan Stanley divided responsibility for vetting its customers' deposits and sales of penny stock among its branch management and two home office departments without reasonable coordination among them. Instead, the firm primarily relied on its customers' representations that the penny stock they sought to deposit was not restricted from sale, and the representations of issuers' counsel that the customers' sales complied with an exemption from the registration requirements. As a result, Morgan Stanley failed to reasonably evaluate the customers' penny stock transactions for ""red flags"" indicative of potential Section 5 violations.

Moreover, FINRA found that Morgan Stanley failed to implement its policies, procedures, and controls to ensure that it conducted risk-based reviews on a periodic basis of the correspondent accounts it maintained for certain foreign financial institutions.

""As we stated in our Report on FINRA Examination Findings released earlier this month, FINRA continues to find problems with the adequacy of some firms' overall AML programs, including allocation of AML monitoring responsibilities, data integrity in AML automated surveillance systems, and firm resources for AML programs,"" said Susan Schroeder, FINRA Executive Vice President, Department of Enforcement. ""Firms must ensure that their AML programs are reasonably designed to detect and cause the reporting of potentially suspicious activity.""

This matter arose out of firm examinations and cause examinations referred to FINRA's Department of Enforcement by FINRA's AML Investigations Unit.

In determining the appropriate monetary sanction, FINRA considered extraordinary corrective measures Morgan Stanley took to expand and enhance its AML-related programs, including that it devoted substantial resources to increase its staffing, improve its automated transaction monitoring system, and revise its policies and procedures.

In settling this matter, Morgan Stanley neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA's findings.

Sixteen Libraries in Eight States Each Received $5,000 to Expand Personal Finance Collections and Educate Consumers About Financial Fraud

WASHINGTON - This holiday season, the FINRA Foundation is giving back to local libraries to help them provide resources to communities impacted by some of the nation's most devastating and deadly natural disasters this year.

In an effort to help residents in afflicted communities rebuild their financial lives, and recognizing the critical resources and support that public libraries offer in many of these communities, the FINRA Investor Education Foundation (FINRA Foundation) rolled out a new grant program this year to ensure that libraries can offer residents even greater assistance when disasters strike.

Under the program, eligible libraries receive $5,000 for collection development related to personal finance, plus communications support and staff training to give library patrons the information and resources they need to make critical money decisions when faced with lost income, displacement or costly repairs following a disaster.

""We created this initiative to address the needs of underserved communities where household income falls below the state median,"" said Gerri Walsh, President of the FINRA Foundation. ""Too often, a natural disaster can turn into a financial calamity, especially for economically vulnerable families. Our own research underscores the importance of strategies to equip consumers with the tools and information needed to manage their financial lives, especially during times of crisis.""

This year, residents in a number of states experienced a series of devastating natural disasters with major impact on their financial lives.

In March, for example, severe storms and tornadoes cut across parts of northern Alabama. In September, Hurricane Florence devastated a large swath of coastal and inland North Carolina and South Carolina. Hurricane Michael surged into large portions of Florida and Georgia during October. In November, the deadliest wildfire in California history raged across Butte County.

Following disaster declarations by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the FINRA Foundation reached out to public libraries in afflicted communities to offer aid. The grant recipients included:

In addition to grant funds, participating libraries also received guidance and multimedia materials on helping consumers avoid financial fraud.

""It's an unfortunate fact that scammers often follow close behind major disasters -- even before the waters recede and the dust settles,"" said Walsh. ""We want to help residents to be prepared to counter the persuasion tactics that fraudsters use.""

It is estimated that consumer fraud costs Americans more than $50 billion a year, according to FINRA Foundation research. The National Center for Disaster Fraud, which is part of the U.S. Department of Justice, has logged more than 92,000 disaster-related complaints from all 50 states since it was established in 2005.

""The path to recovery can be difficult, and financial fraud can become one of the biggest barriers to a family's return to normalcy. A community's public library offers people easy and free access to information and tools that can help them avoid financial pitfalls as they begin to rebuild their lives,"" Walsh said.

The FINRA Foundation's disaster response initiative for public libraries is an ongoing service. To minimize administrative burden on libraries, grants are provided according to eligibility and need-based criteria, rather than through an application process. Following a FEMA disaster declaration involving the agency's Individual Assistance Program, the FINRA Foundation contacts eligible public libraries directly to offer assistance.

FINRA Investor Education Foundation

For more than a dozen years, the FINRA Foundation has provided funding, staff training and programs to build the capacity of public libraries to address the financial education needs of communities nationwide.

The FINRA Foundation supports innovative research and educational projects that give underserved Americans the knowledge, skills and tools to make sound financial decisions throughout life. For more information about FINRA Foundation initiatives, visit www.finrafoundation.org.

Shahmiri elaborated on the partnership that the organization has with the State as one that is working towards the empowerment of vulnerable children and marginalized youth.

The organization in a statement today clarified that ""Our joint endeavour is the improvement of quality education and the State Govt has facilitated the adoption of 25 government schools by Chinar International. These schools have over 3500 children and the goal is to make them model schools."""

Terming nursing care as a ""backbone"" of healthcare system, Directorate of Health Services Kashmir (DHSK) in its first health policy outline proposed an increase in nursing schools across Kashmir region.

The high-rung officials at the department have observed that the quality of education wasn't not up to the mark and meeting the requirement.

""To improve nursing services it is proposed to increase the number of nursing schools. In addition, the quality of education is not as per requirement in field,"" it has noted.

""The need for further education and training at Kashmir Skill and Simulation lab is must where nurses can learn basic nursing, newborn and delivery care.""

The policy outline, which is first of its kind, has noted much indifference by the successive regimes over the years in nursing care pushing the hobbled health care to the wall.

""Since teaching of student nurses and paramedical staff on live patients is obsolete, it is important to train nurses repeatedly on simulators,"" reads the draft policy.

A senior official in the health department said that in view of changed health scenario and at a time when non-communicable diseases are more prevalent, nursing care needs to be sensitive to needs of chronic disease and geriatric patients.

""The health system has to align itself to the needs of elderly people, therefore, nurses training will be oriented towards the needs of elderly population,"" he said.

The policy draft which has been sent to the government for approval also notes that the district level AMT Schools shall be upgraded to College of Nursing and associated with newly established Government Medical Colleges (GMCs) for practical training.

""The College of Nursing at Jammu and Srinagar shall be upgraded to Centre of Excellence to start doctoral courses and super-speciality nursing courses in tune with the requirement for super-speciality hospitals and shall be associated with super-speciality hospitals of GMC Jammu and Srinagar,"" the proposal notes.

State's first health policy outline has exposed government failures over the years and if it gets government nod the healthcare will go through a major overhaul in infrastructure and human resource management.

Meanwhile, the hospitals in the valley especially those which operate at peripheries of Srinagar city are in a crisis of sorts as only 500 nurses tend to patients at about 2000 health centres.

According to figures of the health department, there are 2102 hospitals across the valley and the sanctioned strength of nurses is 600 only, which is poor given the number of patients visiting the hospitals. The acute shortage of nurses has affected patient care.

Almost all the associated hospitals of GMC Srinagar are running short of nurses and the strength is not up to the norms set by Medical Council of India (MCI) and Nursing Council of India (NCI)."

Knowledge and skills play an important role in the growth and development of the world. And it has been time and again emphasized by our state political leaders also that our children must receive education and must be able to engage with the world.

They say that we are caught in a big situation and its complexities are nowhere near a solution and education is one sector that can enable us to navigate the storm. Nothing else will.

The Honorable Governor Satya Pal Malik recently stated that the youth of the state hold key to Kashmir solution as they are ""very positive, talented and performing well in every field"". Sir, what about the field of education, where a big number is in stagnation with the infamous tag of contractual?

In October 2016, in an open letter by the then Education Minister Naeem Akhtar Saheb to Syed Ali Shah Geelani Saheb, states that the education should be kept out of any discord, not just given the reason from the common sense and the cumulative wisdom of human race but also from the fact of Prophet's (SAW) organizing teaching classes of his Muslim companions in the immediate aftermath of the battle of Badr.

Here, I am also repeating for the readers (especially those who referred to this to support their stand on education, that is, the state administration-past as well as present) that the non-believing Meccan prisoners who could read and write were released just for teaching the Muslims, who would obviously not be teaching them Islam.

Naeem Akhtar Saheb emphasized that education is the one thing that we need for political, economic and social empowerment. Further stating that mankind is yet to invent an alternative to this.

In the context of that letter, my question (to the state administration and the management) is what is the plight of the people who impart the knowledge in the educational institutions of our state?

As we emphasize implementing our Prophet's (SAW) command that seeking knowledge is the duty of every Muslim man and woman. Can we with our continued discrimination and exploitation against this vital human resource face Prophet (SAW) on the day of reckoning? These empowerment institutions also practice the system of injustice, discrimination, and exploitation that too with the torch bearers of the knowledge.

Experts explain that the competitive advantage of the higher education doesn't necessarily lie in the product and services that are offered by the institution, but in the employees of the institution who are managed through the human resource department.

Experts understand Human Resource Management to be the performance of all managerial functions in planning for, recruiting, selecting, developing, utilizing, rewarding as well as maximizing the potential of the human resources in an organization.

This is a specialized management task, which includes two main areas, namely human resource provision that is, acquiring employees and human resource retention that is, keeping employees.

According to the experts, the human resource function of an organization such as higher educational institutions requires constant and proper planning, because the number of personnel cannot be increased and decreased at random.

Further, stating that provisions can be made for changing circumstances by careful planning and consideration. So it must be the proactive management of people. It requires thinking ahead, and planning ways for an institution to better meet the needs of its employees, and for the employees to better meet the needs of the institution.

Higher Educational Institutions needs to recruit quality, competent staff in order to achieve the set goals.

Experts argue that staff recruitment must be seen as a form of business competition that is fiercely competitive, as organizations must compete to identify, attract and employ the most qualified and suitable persons, as this will allow the organization to deliver the best service, just as organizations compete and to develop and manufacture the best product.

The Business Dictionary defines recruitment as the process of identifying and recruiting the best-qualified candidate (from within or outside of an organization) for a job vacancy, in a most timely and cost effective manner.

The effectiveness of the Higher Educational Institutions depends on the effectiveness of the employees. An organization without high-power employees is destined to perform with mediocrity. In the case of Higher Educational Institutions it is very important to take the amount of practical experience (either in terms of research or teaching) that a lecturer needs into consideration, as an experienced person can add a lot of expertise to the mostly theoretical academic environment.

The organization's recruitment policy must reflect the diversity issues. There must be opportunities for the new comers but not at the cost of the old.

In our context, given the rising unemployment, the lack of alternatives and the rampant corruption among other factors, most of the highly qualified and competent candidates end up as contractual lecturers. The employment of fixed-term contract lecturers is a numerically significant part of the labour market in Higher Education.

According to the UK Higher Education Academy (2010), fixed-term contract lecturers (here infamously known as contractual lecturers) add value to the student learning experience as they have added practice-related experience, which is necessary in combining the theoretical with the practical side of the curriculum, and that the fixed-term lecturers are indispensible in the successful running of a complex educational and practice relevant operation.

Fixed-term contract lecturers are often more willing to learn new concepts as they hope that the additional knowledge and skills may give them an advantage when there is any opportunity for a permanent position.

According to an international study conducted by Tuckman during 1970's, many different individuals from various backgrounds are found to be interested in this staffing option at higher educational institutions, because lecturing adds to their professional as well as personal lives.

However, in our context these lecturers often express negative experiences that they are going through at the higher educational institutions, imparting knowledge but lacking in prestige.

Researchers explain that the ongoing trend in higher education institutions is the increasing dependence on fixed-term contract lecturers to lecture.

These lecturers frequently have the same amount of work but without benefits of additional training, encouragement or the sense to develop him-self or her-self. In our context these lecturers are not even considered as employees and at some institutions they are not even provided with suitable work space.

Fixed-term contract lecturers often experience a lack of support from the higher educational institutions that employ them. The management is unable to assist these staff members adequately.

Whereas, the state administration and the institutional management should not overlook the negative effects of their approach and practices because it has a negative influence on the stability of the higher educational institutions and the society at large.

Researchers are of the opinion that, although fixed-term lecturers can be a major asset to the higher educational institutions, this has gone unnoticed by these institutions.

Subsequently, these employees often feel like second-class citizens in the eyes of the administrators and the permanent contract academics.

These lower-paid employees are frequently denied regularity and predictability of employment. This, in turn, impacts negatively on employees with family responsibilities. These employees are often frustrated by the uncollegial and unprofessional treatment displayed towards them by fellow colleagues. The salaries received by these lecturers are much less than those received by their permanent counterparts.

Fixed-term contract staff is faced with limited, time-specific contracts that do not provide the benefit of a long term commitment from the administration and the higher educational institutions. All of these employees would prefer a permanent position, but, as these positions are very limited and they are faced with financial obligations, so these employees are forced to take fixed-term employment contacts.

The higher educational institutions expect a lower research and teaching output from their fixed-term lecturers.

Furthermore, fixed-term academics occupy lowest positions (infact lower than the IV-grade permanent non-teaching employee) regardless of their qualifications, experience and teaching in these institutions.

These lecturers are often vulnerable to exploitation, as they have no guarantees of continued employment, have no benefits, don't have developmental opportunities like permanent contract employees, and most important they possess no voice in the decision-making process that involve them, neither at the administrative level nor at the management level.

At the management level the condition is so worse that the management can't even afford the library facilities to these lecturers as provided to the permanent contract employees.

In some institutions the working hours are different, rigid for fixed-term contract employees whereas flexible for permanent contract employees upto the extent that the biometric attendance at departure is compulsory and specific for fixed-term contract employees only.

Fixed-term contract lecturers are concerned with the job insecurity, level of autonomy that they have, as well as the lack of freedom to make decisions regarding content of the courses, their salaries, lack of benefits, as well as how they are perceived by the students and their peers. Poor communication with the state authorities, authoritarian management structures and an overall indifferent and inefficient management structure has demoralized them.

In this context, fixed-term contract teaching jobs can be portrayed as work characterized by demoralization and demonization of the vital human resource that too even at the highest seat of learning."

Question papers were despatched online on pilot basis to one centre for the II PU supplementary exam held between June 29 and July 10 this year. The question papers were sent via email to the chief superintendent of the examination centre. The authorities were asked to make arrangements to get the papers printed and sealed in packets.

Although the experiment was successful, the department will be unable to replicate it for the exams next March, according to officials.

A DPUE official said, ""Since August this year, the department has not had a fulltime director. As the present directors have additional charge in other departments, they are unable to focus on reforms in the DPUE."" .

There are other factors in play too. A principal at a government PU college said many exam centres in rural areas still do not have access to Internet. ""It will be very risky to send question papers online in such a situation,"" he said.

Following the II PU question paper leaks in March 2016, a committee, headed by the then Additional Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar, was appointed to look into various reforms in pre-university education, including those for exams. Among the long-term recommendations of the committee was despatching question papers online.

Many universities, such as Visvesvaraya Technological University and Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, have been able to plug question paper leaks this way.

The Criminal Investigation Department had pointed out that question papers were leaked in 2016 from the Hanagal treasury in Haveri district.

Age is just a number for P. Chitran Namboodirippad, who turned 99 on December 19. The former Additional Director of the Kerala Education Department made his 29th trip to the Himalayas earlier this month. He wants to make his 30th pilgrimage to the mountains in 2019, the year he completes a century.

""My ambition is to do 30 trips,"" says the National Award-winning educationist. He completed his 29th trip to the holy shrines in the Himalayan ranges, including Badrinath and Kedarnath, in the first week of December as part of a 118-member group from Thiruvananthapuram.

Mr. Namboodirippad's relationship with the Himalayas started in 1952, when he was in his thirties. ""I was still in service then. However, my first trip was a flop,"" he recalls.

""I went with one of my friends. But we couldn't go beyond Rudraprayag as both of us were hit by food poisoning.""

His next trip in 1956 was successful, and the snow-capped peaks called to him again and again. ""Travelling to the Himalayas back then was really tough. Roads and other infrastructure were not developed like they are now. We had to walk through forests for more than 90 km from Rudraprayag to reach Badrinath.""

Mr. Namboodirippad is a former Communist baptised by none other than K. Damodaran, one of the founders of the Kerala unit of the Communist Party.

So what draws him to the Himalayas? ""They were an attraction for me right from my childhood days,"" he says. ""An old man named 'Kashi' Nambeeshan used to live near my Pakaravur Mana [home] in Mookkuthala village in Malappuram district. He had gone to Kashi 10 times. On one of his trips, he went to the Himalayas too. He used to tell us stories about his Himalayan adventure. This sparked my interest in making the pilgrimage to the Himalayas. Its peace will attract anyone.""

What is the secret of his fitness and sharp memory? ""Moderation in food, words and lifestyle,"" he says. He is a strict vegetarian, goes for a walk every day, and does yoga.

Mr. Namboodirippad established a high school at Mookkuthala in 1947, soon after his post graduation from Pachaiyappa's College, Chennai.

After running it for 10 years, he handed over the school to the Kerala government for a token amount of ₹1. ""I consider that moment as the proudest one in my life,"" says the mountain man."

""Do you not remember the serial blasts on the trains in Bombay?""

""Have you forgotten the serial blasts in Gujarat? Have you forgotten the destruction in Delhi and in Jaipur?

""We will deliver unto you a reckoning far more terrible than these... and will wage war upon you until polytheism is destroyed in India, and Allah's rule is established,"" he warned.

Like most of the 70-odd Indians who went to fight among the ranks of the Islamic State, Abu Rashid is almost certainly interred under the ruins of Raqqa or Mosul. But their dystopia didn't.

Wednesday's arrests by the National Investigations Agency in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, preempting what officials say were plans to stage bombings in New Delhi over the New Year, demonstrate the Islamic State's jihadist call is seducing some young Muslims in a time of deepening communal fractures.

Several weapons and a cache of ammunition were recovered by NIA during its raids at 17 locations across Meerut, Lucknow, Hapur, Amroha and Seelampur in connection with its probe into a new Islamic State-inspired module. PTI

Ever since 2009, over 91 jihadist cells have been dismantled by the NIA, which deals mainly with cases having pan-India significance; 63 of those have come since 2015. The Islamic State has been the biggest single contributor to this basket with 24 cases. Twenty-three of these cells were from Kashmir while 43 included other jihadist groups put together.

Wednesday's arrests have provided some important insights into the nature of the threat. Incensed by what he perceived to be growing state-abetted violence against Muslims, NIA sources say, Delhi-born cleric Mufti Muhammad Suhail -- code-named Hazrat or Prophet -- mobilised young men and recruited them through his mosque in Amroha.

The cell, the NIA believes, was mentored by an Islamic State supporter overseas, likely in Pakistan -- though they have so far been unable to dig out evidence of his identity through the mass of encrypted messaging the group used to communicate.

Earlier Islamic State cells in India have had little operational success. Barring a 17 March, 2017, bombing on board a Bhopal-Ujjain bus, there has been no operation of significant scale.

But this time, the cell meant business. Helped by nothing but internet research, NIA investigators believed, the men had gathered 25 kilogrammes of potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, sugar and sulphur -- easily turned into low-grade explosives -- meant to be packed inside metal lunch-boxes, and detonated using simple remote-controlled devices. The cell had gathered 12 pistols, 150 rounds of ammunition, and even assembled a simple rocket-launcher.

Put simply, this the first Islamic State group that had acquired the necessary elements for true lethality. Had the Telangana Police's counter-terrorism unit, regarded as the most sophisticated operational unit of its kind in India, not broken into their digital conversations, this New Year would have looked very different.

NIA takes away a suspect arrested during its raids at a house in Seelampur in connection with its probe into a new Islamic State-inspired module, 'Harkat ul Harb e Islam', in New Delhi. PTI

Muhammad Suhail may have been a cleric, as was his aide and alleged weapons-procurer Saqib Iftekar, but the men the two recruited weren't. Delhi resident Anas Yunus, alleged to have purchased the electrical components for the bombs, studies civil engineering at a university in Noida; Zubair Malik, who allegedly bought SIM cards for the plot is in the final year of a Bachelor's programme in a New Delhi university. His brother, Zaid Malik, also accused of purchasing SIM cards and components, also has a university education.

The brothers Saeed Ahmed and Raees Ahmed, accused of purchasing the explosive material and fabricating the rocket-launcher, run a welding workshop in Islam Nagar.

Also accused are: garments business owner Rashid Zafar Raq, auto-rickshaw driver Muhammad Irshad, and medical-store owner Mohammad Azam. According to investigators, the group even included a middle-aged woman, who was given the charge of safely keeping the ₹7.5 lakh in cash that the group raised among themselves and from their supporters. However, it is unclear if she knew what it was intended for.

From the government's data, it's clear that those drawn to the Islamic State's ideology aren't the stereotypical madrasa-educated fanatics. Instead, they are members of the Muslim middle class, who the government says are deeply attached to the Indian democracy.

Estimates based on government data show that almost three in four Islamic State suspects arrested on terrorism charges -- 68 percent -- came from middle-class backgrounds while a similar percentage had a university or post-graduate degree. Eleven percent, a small sub-set, had some kind of religious education.

In interrogations by the NIA, half the suspects said communalism -- ranging from riots to compulsory yoga practice -- led them to join the Islamic State. Barely half of them cited the global Islamist project that underpins the Islamic State.

This, counter-terrorism experts around the world have learned, doesn't take much more than an internet connection and some common sense to turn into dead bodies.

NIA and Delhi Police officials during a search operation in connection with a probe into a new ISIS module at Jaffrabad, North East district in Delhi. PTI

His face masked with a white handkerchief, an assault rifle cradled in his lap, and wearing the combat fatigues in which he would be buried, Muhammad Taufiq delivered his only testament in the rolling accent of the Deccan:

""Twenty-five years ago, our enemies destroyed a mosque, but their eyes were not only on the Babri Masjid. These perfidious Hindus will keep changing their tactics until their mission is accomplished -- and that mission is the elimination of every last Muslim.""

Three months later, Taufiq was dead, killed in a shootout with an al-Qaeda cell in Jammu and Kashmir. He'd been twice caught trawling Islamic State websites, and counselled by the police in Hyderabad. Failing to make it to Syria, he chose to die in Kashmir.

Like so many other young jihadists, Taufiq wasn't even born when the Babri Masjid was demolished -- and could have chosen a different kind of future. His father works at the Department of Atomic Energy's heavy water plant in Manuguru, a key part of India's nuclear programme. Like his two other sons, Taufiq's father has no connection to Islamist politics or jihadism.

Back in 2016, the Indian jihadists who appeared in the Islamic State video made much the same point. Aman Tandel, one of four Thane men who joined the jihad in Iraq, vowed to return home ""with a sword in hand, to avenge the Babri Masjid, and the killings of Muslims in Kashmir, in Gujarat, and in Muzaffarnagar"".

The language is designed to provoke rage among Indians -- but it should also be a reason for reflection, on why these young men ended up where they did.

Ever since December 1993, there have been successive waves of jihadist recruitment. That tragedy saw the rise of jihadists lead by Abdul Karim Tunda heading into the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Following 2002, another generation formed the Indian Mujahideen. And following the Indian Mujahideen's collapse, many of its members -- among them, Mumbai eye-hospital worker Ahmed -- fled for the Afghanistan-Pakistan borderlands, and then Syria.

The small numbers involved in these violent groups, given India's giant Muslim population, demonstrate their cause has no wide appeal. Yet, communal violence enables and legitimises the operations of successive waves of jihadist groups, drawing in young recruits who believe democracy has betrayed them. That, in turn, feeds and empowers the Hindu-nationalist range.

Each successive cycle of hatred makes the process more powerful, increasing the risk of large-scale violence that could tear the country apart. India's police and intelligence services can take a bow -- but the country needs to find a way to dismantle this perpetual motion machine of hatred if their efforts are to have meaning.

Organised over the last few months by the DEO, the inspections conclude that a lack of supervision by the authorities is a major cause of depreciating the quality of food. Starting with the agencies responsible for providing the food to the headmasters and school staff, a lack of sincerity in ensuring quality has been identified. Agencies or principals found guilty are being discontinued or suspended, respectively.

To improve their profit margins, the agencies allegedly procure poorer quality of raw materials. Parents of students studying in the schools say that the menu prescribed by the government authorities is also not followed by the agencies. Watery sambar with little or no vegetables has become a norm in the schools. Meanwhile, the school principals, responsible for keeping the agency in check, are also not delivering their duties honestly.

Horticulture Therapy (HT) has put down roots in Kerala over the last 10 years, thanks to the College of Agriculture in Thiruvananthapuram, under the Kerala Agricultural University (KAU). Leading the initiative is Beela GK, associate professor, the Department of Community Science, who has been using the therapy for people living with disabilities. In September this year, the Department started a skill-development programme in HT for those with special needs, a first-of-its-kind by any Indian university. Beela talks about the programme and how HT is breaking new ground in Kerala.

HT focusses on the people-plant connection. It uses plants and plant-related activities for physical, mental and social well-being. In the case of the differently-abled, among other benefits, tending to the plants increases their fine motor skills, improves coordination and balance, gives them a sense of independence and provides an environment to interact with others.

Our motto is 'Towards ability from disability, through horticulture therapy'. This skill-development programme, supported by the Kerala Social Security Mission, aims at equipping the disabled to earn a living and impart training to people like them. There is nothing more encouraging and inspiring than learning from a person who is in the same boat. The six-month programme covers various aspects of horticulture and horticulture therapy and related activities. There are 14 students in the batch, who are either mentally and physically challenged or visually impaired. They were selected on the basis of an interview that assessed their grasping power and passion for gardening/farming. Our team has two agriculture experts, two psychologists, one child development expert and a social worker. Once they finish the training in March, we will teach them to market the produce.

I always wanted to do something for children with disabilities because I had a brother who became disabled following a surgical error. I lost him when I was 10. My doctoral thesis was in child development and after I joined the college, I wanted to focus on an area that integrated agriculture and child development. I was introduced to HT when I was staying in Bahrain, where I had an opportunity to volunteer at the community centre in Isa Town.

In 2008, I introduced this in Kerala with the support of the State Horticulture Mission. The guidance to introduce the training programme was given by Dr Paul de la Motte, president of Australian Horticultural Therapy Association (Victoria), when he visited Kerala in 2012.

Based on the modules he provided, we introduced a diploma course at the Centre for Disability Studies (CeDS) in Thiruvananthapuram. The technical support was given by BR Reghunath, our former dean. We now have a registered Horticultural Therapy Association.

KAU has already made a model horticulture therapy public garden in Thiruvananthapuram, and now with the support of the Department of Agriculture, Government of Kerala, we are setting up horticulture therapy gardens in 10 schools across the State.

While the College of Agriculture, Kansas University, USA, a pioneer in the field, offers graduate, masters and PhD programmes in HT, and K-State Division of Continuing Education of the University, has an online Graduate Certificate in Horticultural Therapy, there aren't any institutions from India on the list. Canada, Australia, the UK, Germany and Japan too offer courses in HT.

""Farming makes me happy...,"" says Sruthy MA with a smile and goes on to list the vegetables she is growing at her home in Pachalloor. A home science graduate, the 24-year-old is mentally challenged and is among the 14 differently-abled students who have joined the skill-development programme in horticulture therapy (HT).

Her classmate 27-year-old Anujith A adds: ""I like the sessions here. Even though I have a job at a driving school I go there only after this class...."" Samad from Karakkamandapam, likes to paint, and so looks forward to the painting session, which is part of the syllabus. In addition to learning about potting mixtures, growing vegetables and flowering plants, using garden equipment and the like, the students learn to work with clay and dry flowers, flower arrangement and vegetable painting too. For visually-challenged 26-year-old Jithin AR, farming comes naturally to him as he hails from a family of agriculturists at Varkala.

Shyamkumar N., a psychologist in the team, says, ""The course has enhanced their confidence, especially in travelling by bus to the class."" Himamol Thankappan, specialist in child development, adds, ""They help each other in the class. We assess their performances regularly through informal sessions.""

The course ends by March, but they will be on the campus till August during which they will be trained to make a living out of farming. They will work at the sales counter on the college campus and will also be equipped to do door-to-door sale. ""We are concentrating on vegetables like long beans, bittergourd, cucumber, and amaranthus, which can be easily grown and harvested and earn good returns. We also give them the potting mixture so that they can grow some of these vegetables at home,"" says Sujil S., a technical assistant.

A horticulture therapy garden is being set up on the premises of the department. While one section will have flowering plants, the other will be dedicated to vegetables.

According to Anil Kumar A, dean, it is high time HT is implemented in other districts. ""HT blends behavioural science and agricultural science. This is relevant in the current scenario and we have to explore the potential,"" he says."

New and promising scientific technologies in fields ranging from nanotechnology to space weather made headlines this year.

The year 2018 is ending with spectacular success of Indian scientists and technologists in space and defence sectors, with a series of high impact missions. But that's not all Indian scientists achieved in 2018. Several scientific developments, new techniques and promising technologies - in fields ranging from nanotechnology to space weather - made headlines during the year. Here is a collection of 15 such stories that gives a glimpse of important developments reported by Indian scientists during the year.

Most farmers do not wear any protective gear while spraying chemicals in fields, which often leads to pesticide exposure and toxicity. Scientists at the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Bengaluru have developed a protective gel -- poly-Oxime -- that can be applied on skin and can break down toxic chemicals into safe substances, preventing them from going deep into the skin and organs like the brain and the lungs. The research group plans to develop a mask that can deactivate pesticides.

Pushing the envelope in nanotechnology, researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar have developed a material that is 100,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. They synthesized a two-dimensional material of just one-nanometer thickness (a human hair is about 80,000 nanometer wide) using Magnesium diboride -- a compound of boron. This is said to be the world's thinnest material. It can find a range of applications -- from next-generation batteries to ultraviolet absorbing films.

Using the gene editing technique -- CRISPR/Cas9 -- researchers at the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute, Mohali have edited the banana genome. This is the first such work in any fruit crop in India. Banana is the fourth most important food crop after wheat, rice and corn in terms of gross value of production. Gene editing could be deployed for improving nutritional quality, agronomical important traits as well as pathogen resistance in banana.

The National Brain Research Centre (NBRC) at Manesar has figured out cellular and molecular mechanisms that show how Zika virus causes microcephaly or small head size in babies. Researchers discovered that envelop protein of zika virus affects proliferation rates of human neural stem cells and promotes premature but faulty neuron formation. Another study led by scientists at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad, has identified a key protein which helps dengue as well as Japanese Encephalitis viruses replication inside human body by inhibiting anti-viral cytokines. This finding could pave way for development of targeted drugs for dengue and JE. For detecting Chikungunya, a group of researchers from Amity University, Noida, Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi and Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, have developed a biosensor using molybdenum disulphide nanosheets.

Scientists at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi have jointly developed highly sensitive and rapid tests for detection of tuberculosis infection in lungs and surrounding membranes. Unlike current tests that use antibodies for detection of bacterial proteins in sputum samples, new tests use Aptamer Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA) and Electrochemical Sensor (ECS) for detection of a bacterial protein in the sputum.

Till now arsenic was a major problem in West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Chhattisgarh. It was also known that there is arsenic contamination in groundwater in Punjab. Now a new study done by New Delhi-based TERI School of Advanced Studies has found that that Punjab's floodplains are severely affected by arsenic contamination. In some wells, arsenic levels were found to be 20 to 50 times higher than WHO prescribed limit.

A team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata have dismissed the speculation that the upcoming sunspot cycle is going to be stronger, based on calculations using a model developed by them. The near-Earth and inter-planetary space environmental conditions and solar radiative forcing of climate over the upcoming sunspot cycle 25 will likely be similar or marginally more extreme relative to what has been observed during the past decade over the current solar cycle. The method makes it possible to make predictions almost a decade before the next sunspot cycle activity peaks in strength.

In many cases, autism is misdiagnosed as mental retardation and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Early identification and interventions may help children with autistic disorders. To help this process, scientists at the Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, have developed an Indian tool for screening children for autism. The Chandigarh Autism Screening Instrument (CASI) is designed to help community health workers to carry out initial screening for autism.

Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have figured out the way memory deficit develops in early stages, resulting in Alzheimer's disease. They have found that early breaking down of a protein, fibrillar actin or F-actin, in the brain leads to disruption in communication among nerve cells and consequently memory deficits. This knowledge can be used to develop early diagnosis test in future. In another study done in fruit flies, researchers at Department of Genetics at Delhi University South Campus found that it was possible to restrict the progression of Huntington's disease by increasing insulin signaling in the brain neuronal cells.

A team of scientists at Pune-based National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) has developed a technique that helps recycle Plaster of Paris waste from hospitals in an eco-friendly and economical way. The new technique disinfects waste and converts it into useful products like ammonium sulphate and calcium bicarbonate. The technique can also be used to disintegrate PoP waste from idols immersed in water bodies.

The Stone Age tools discovered in a village near Chennai suggest that a Middle Palaeolithic culture was present in India around 385,000 years ago -- roughly the same time that it is known to have developed in Africa and in Europe. The discovery pushes back the period when populations with a Middle Palaeolithic culture may have inhabited India, and challenges popular theory that the Middle Palaeolithic was brought to India by modern humans dispersing from Africa only around 125,000 years ago or later. In the North, population genetic study has revealed that the Rors who inhabit modern Haryana came to the Indus Valley when it was flourishing during the Bronze Age and inducted West Eurasian genetic ancestry.

A real-time landslide warning system has been set up in the Sikkim-Darjeeling belt of north-eastern Himalayas which is highly vulnerable to landslides. The warning system consists of over 200 sensors that can measure geophysical and hydrological parameters like rainfall, pore pressure and seismic activities. The system is capable of warning about 24 hours in advance. It has been deployed by researchers of Kerala-based Amrita University and Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority.

During the year, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) upgraded its computing capacity for weather forecasting and climate monitoring, taking its total high performance computing (HPC) power to as high as 6.8 Petaflop. With this, India rose to the fourth position, next only to United Kingdom, Japan and US in terms of dedicated capacity for HPC resources for weather and climate proposes.

Scientists at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, developed a silk-based bioartificial disc that may find use in disc replacement therapy in future. The group has developed a fabrication procedure for a silk-based bioartificial disc adopting a ""directional freezing technique"". The disc mimics internal intricacy of human disc and its mechanical properties too are similar to those of the native ones. The use of a silk biopolymer to fabricate a biocompatible disc can reduce the cost of artificial discs in future.

To address the problem of arsenic accumulation in rice grains, researchers at Lucknow- based CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute developed transgenic rice by inserting a novel fungal gene, which results in reduced arsenic accumulation in rice grain. They cloned Arsenic methyltransferase (WaarsM) gene from a soil fungus and inserted it into rice genome. In another study, TERI School of Advanced Studies has developed an early flowering transgenic variety of mustard.

In other significant developments, the Department of Science and Technology launched a national mission on Cyber-Physical Systems with an outlay of Rs 3,660 crore for five years. The Indian Institute of Astrophysics in Bengaluru commissioned India's first robotic telescope to keep an eye on the dynamic cosmos, while the ambitious India Neutrino Observatory (INO) project got a go ahead from the National Green Tribunal.

Arul was recently honoured with the Florence Nightingale Award for disaster management, both in the Carlton Towers tragedy and one at Malathi Manipal Hospital last year where patients were evacuated because of smoke.

The Florence Nightingale Medal is the highest international distinction that can be awarded to a nurse. It recognises exceptional courage and devotion towards caring for victims of a natural disaster, exemplary services, creative and pioneering spirit in the areas of public health or nursing education. Currently, a nursing superintendent at Malathi Manipal Hospital with 107 nurses reporting to her, the 38-year-old says last year her 80-bedded hospital was filled with smoke due to a short circuit in the first floor and that is when she had to take the initiative to evacuate patients.

""On 13 June last year, I was on rounds in the morning and I was informed that there is a smoke. I got the nurses to evacuate babies and there was a deaf and dumb mother in the corridor who was waiting for delivery. She wasn't aware of what was happening.

Teachers headed for battle with 'undemocratic' VC

The administrative regime is simply following the government's policy of rampant privatisation of public resources. Such a process is anti-democratic in its imagination and punitive in approach.

Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is now in a new phase of life. Known as 'comply or perish' to us insiders, not a day passes without the administration issuing some circular demanding ""compliance"" from the faculty or students of the university.

Since most of these demands range from the absurd to the counterproductive, like enforcing students and faculty attendance or arbitrarily rescheduling the academic calendar, most do not comply. Often the faculty, after protracted discussions in the general body meetings of the teachers association, resorts to different modes of protesting this compliance enforcement raj. These protests are then promptly followed by threats and punitive action meant to ""discipline"" the 'non-compliant' - much in the fashion of bullies and thugs. These range from petty and vindictive methods - like docking leave and not processing medical papers - to issuing legal instruments like show-cause notices.

Legal threats are usually issued to just a few, perhaps with the aim of frightening the many. More importantly, issuing more than 150 notices at any given time also exposes the well-known fact that most in the university are opposed to the administration and find laughable the constant threat of disciplinary action against those who refuse to cow down. Those not in JNU or any other university in the country do not immediately understand what is being undertaken here.

Some even wonder why the JNU faculty and students seem to continuously be in protest mode. There are two ways of responding to this. Let's begin with the counterfactual.

Why did the university not witness this kind of anti-administration protest prior to February 2016? The answer is simple: because such anti-academic and anti-university measures had never been attempted by the administration prior to 2016. The present VC and his administrative coterie are not simply undoing every functioning structure of JNU, they are vandalising the idea of the university.

Here, the second reason to understand JNU's protests becomes important. The faculty has consistently stated that the changes being made to the university's structure are not only unnecessary, but also in repeated violation of ordinances and the very Act of parliament that created it. The ongoing protests demonstrate the present administration's consummate disregard for democratic procedures and well-established conventions, which is deeply injurious to every aspect of the university.

Why are the demands - be it marking of daily attendance (soon to be biometric) or online entrance examinations, followed by threats and punishments exemplifying the worst kinds of managerial practices?

The answer, once again, is obvious. Privatising a public university requires that its very character be changed completely. JNU was created as a research university in 1970, and has always maintained a very special character. It has provided a very high standard of higher education to students from different regions of India, belonging to any social or economic strata, at minimal cost.

The decades following its creation saw at least two kinds of developments in the university. One was a very high quality of research output, both of the faculty and of young researchers. This also helped in creating many generations of teachers who are presently employed in colleges and universities in India and abroad.

The other was an organic emergence of an extraordinary university culture that synthesised the intellectual and the political - enabling students not only to find their feet as scholars, but also articulate their selfhood as citizens. Students in JNU have historically debated everything from American imperialism, the many failures of the Indian state, to what the university itself ought to be.

The ability to knit this criticality into the very fibre of the university, by creating a space for student engagement in institutional processes (through department level student-faculty committees, or students union representation in boards of study or the Academic Council meetings), is what made JNU a truly democratic university.

The new tightly-managed and privatised university will not have space for any of this. We can already get glimpses of this in numerous such universities that have mushroomed all over the country. At the outset, they have a prohibitive fee structure that will keep out hundreds of brilliant, though poor and marginalised students, for whom higher education will become unaffordable.

Even ordinary middle class families will not be able to afford such an education. Besides, many new private universities have a biometric attendance system in place; they also do not permit any of its members - faculty, students or the non-teaching staff - to form unions. Contract structures are also beginning to reflect how the private is different from the public - at its most worrying, differential pay scales are being put in place - which will eventually create salary-driven divisions between colleagues appointed at the same level. This will also occur between Indians and non-Indian faculty.

The carrot usually dangled in front of the faculty is that they will have the space to create their own courses. For those of us quite used to doing so for decades in a public university like JNU, the stick that accompanies this privilege seems more like a police baton.

Inherent violence in government-led privatisation of public resources

The present administrative regime is simply following the current government's policy of rampant privatisation of public resources. Such a process is perforce managerial and anti-democratic in its imagination. The JNU instance makes clear that compliance enforcement and punitive measures are knitted into its very approach.

The only unexpected element in this is how JNU's university community - its students and faculty - have resisted all attempts at this wanton destruction of a nationally important public institution. They have not succumbed to the management's speak of becoming ""stakeholders""; they know what the stakes are, and continue to fight back as a community of scholars.

The battle for JNU's survival matters not only to those who work or study there - it has grave implications for the intellectual and political future of the country. Public higher education is a democratic right of all Indians. It is precisely for this reason that all who care about India's future, and wish to make it safe from ugly corporatisation or bigoted cultural agendas, must fight for the survival of the public university."

The first mock test, which took place between November 26 and December 3, was downloaded 44,88,679 times after which the education department decided to release three more sets. Like the previous test, answers for all the papers will be released one-by-one. The website will also have links to tutorial videos for each subject for students."

As many as 13 schools have recorded zero enrolment, while another 171 schools have fewer than 20 students. A total of 1,140 schools have fewer than 40 students.

These were the details furnished by the state in 2017-18 to the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database about schools in India, developed at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA). According to officials, the reason for the low enrolment is parents' preference to private schools due to lack of infrastructure, teacher absenteeism, and poor quality education in government schools, among others.

This is in addition to 1,773 schools without buildings, which the government plans to merge with nearby schools with infrastructure. The merger plan comes after the state failed to land for the 1,773 schools. Most of these schools have been merged. Of them, 190 schools in Patna district alone.

The enrolment in government schools dropped to 1.8 crore in 2017-18 from 1.99 crore in 2016-17. The number is expected to drop further when fresh data is examined, diluting the government claim of more than 99% enrolment.

The most alarming trend reflected through U-DISE is that the dropout rate from Class 9 to Class 10- almost 25% of the total enrollment in 2014-15, which jumped to 39.73% in 2016-17, the period when there was unprecedented increase in the number of students failing in Bihar class 10 and 12 board exams.

One of the reasons for the drop, authorities admitted, is parents' preference for private schools for better education and infrastructure.

""If the incentives (such as scholarships, bicycles) attached with government schools are removed, the number will drop further. Many students get admitted to government schools to avail incentives but study in private schools. In 2011, when reports on inflated enrolments surfaced, it created a flutter,"" an education department official added.

Three years ago, the then principal secretary, department of education, Amarjeet Sinha, had said the duplication of enrolment in government schools could be up to 20%.

Bihar Education Project Council (BSEPC) director Sanjay Singh, however, said that the drop in students' number was due to government's drive to do away with duplication in enrolment. ""The number children availing mid-day meal has come down to 1.20 crore compare to previous years,"" he added.

Singh said that the sanctity of data was being maintained. ""Earlier, there was no data on private schools. Now, that is also being prepared. Around 12 lakh more students have joined private schools, not necessarily because they have suddenly opened, but because they are being documented,"" he added.

Singh said under the Right to Education Act, there should be a school within a kilometre for Class 1-5 students provided there are a minimum of 40 students. ""If that is not the case, teachers can be used elsewhere more effectively. Having 3-4 teachers for fewer than 40 children is not relevant,"" he said, adding he would do another appraisal in January after studying the reasons and reports of physical verification."

A group of boatmen making their living ferrying people and goods across the Brahmaputra see Bogibeel, India's longest railroad bridge, as a loss of livelihood.

Over 40 boats operate from the north and south banks of the Brahmaputra river, ferrying not just people but also two-wheelers and cars. Of these, two are operated by the state government, while the rest are privately owned.

Each boat requires three people to operate.

On December 25, the rail-cum-road bridge was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, facilitating quicker movement of vehicles and easy access for the people of Dhemaji to major hospitals, education institutes and the Dibrugarh airport.

The boatmen, those running food stalls and the vehicle operators carrying people to and from the ferry ghats fear that from then on they will have to look for an alternative source of livelihood.

""In a joint family of 12 members, I and my brother operate one boat from Bogibeel ghat. After paying Rs 75,000 rent for the boat per annum and spending on the salaries of the boatmen, we earn around Rs 30,000 per month,"" a private ferry operator at Bogibeel ghat said.

It takes 45 minutes to two hours to cross the river on the boats. But once the bridge is open, it will take just 10 minutes, saving not just time, but also money.

While the government-operated boats charge Rs 18 per person, Rs 800 for small cars and Rs 1,000 for SUVs, the privately-operated boats charge way more for ferrying people and vehicles between Bogibeel ghat and Kareng Ghat in Dhemaji district, an official of the state Inland Water Transport Department said.

According to the official, some of the boats will be shifted to other ghats. But the private boat operators fear that they won't be able to get a similar opportunity and even if they do, it won't be financially viable.

Asked if some proposals have been made for the affected people, he said, ""I haven't heard of announcement regarding any compensation yet, but the affected people have taken up the issue with political leaders.""

""After this bridge becomes operational, the ferry service from this ghat will stop and we have to look for an alternative mode of earning. Luckily, we have some agricultural land. But everyone is not so lucky,"" said another boat operator.

The bridge, with two-line railway track on the lower deck and a three-lane road on the top deck, will provide the much-needed connectivity between Dibrugarh in Assam to Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh. It will also reduce Delhi to Dibrugarh train travel time by about three hours to 34 hours as against 37 hours presently.

It is part of infrastructure projects planned by India to improve logistics along the border in Arunachal Pradesh. This includes the construction of a trans-Arunachal highway on the north bank of the Brahmaputra, and new road and rail links over the mighty river and its major tributaries such as the Dibang, Lohit, Subansiri and Kameng."

At a recent interaction with BJP party workers from Puducherry via video conferencing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi faced a tough question on the tax burden plaguing the middle-class. Neither did Modi like the question, nor did he expect it. The video, therefore, went viral. The only explanation for this is can be that the man who sold Modi the question paper the previous night had promised that a question on taxes would not appear.

Now, instead of answering questions in a better manner, Modi has decided to ban unscripted questions from these party interactions altogether. BJP members have been asked to shoot a video of their question and send it 48 hours ahead of a scheduled interaction with the PM. These questions will be screened by party workers and then picked for Modi to answer. This is borderline shameful considering that Modi is no ordinary PM. Most of us forget that he is the author of the #1 bestseller Exam Warriors.

Friends, this man has written a book that revolves around the concept of answering tough questions to get ahead in life. And now, he has a problem taking questions. What would the students think of you, Modiji?

Also read: In Madhya Pradesh, Narendra Modi ko gussa kyon aata hai

All this was set off by the embarrassment at the Puducherry meeting where the question went something like, ""Honourable Prime Minister... I am grateful for this opportunity to speak to you. My question is the work that you are doing to change the country is undoubtedly a good step but the middle sections of people are of the opinion that your government is only busy collecting tax in all manner and in all ways. They did not get the relaxation they were hoping fBor in the IT sector, loan processing procedure and bank transaction fees and penalty. It is my request that you take care of the middle class, which is the root of your party, like the way you take care while collecting tax from them. Thank you sir.""

Modi was so dumbfounded by the question that, for a second, he looked like a sad Vinod Kambli contemplating life choices and trying to figure out where it all went wrong.

All Modi could do was to come to a profound conclusion that since the guy was a trader, he wanted to talk business. Like what? And then he froze, hoping the earth would split into two and just gobble him up. When that didn't happen, he passed another random statement about how he will take care of the people. Then, he took a longer pause and just uttered the words, ""Chaliye, Puducherry ko wanakkam"". You know someone has really run out of ideas when cultural appropriation becomes their go-to punchline. Imagine what would happen, Modiji, when the IT department sends notices to all South Indians for not filing their income tax, and the only reply they get is ""Kem chho"" written in font size 84 across an A4 paper.

Modi hasn't held a single press conference or taken open questions in the last four and a half years. But that ship has sailed, it's not a big deal anymore. However, this episode further reaffirms my feelings in the popular belief that our PM doesn't have a college degree. Because if you went to an Indian college, the least you would learn is how to fudge your way through questions which you skipped preparing for. If my education has taught me one thing, it is to confidently repeat 75 per cent of the question that is posed to you as is, until you can use the word ""because"". ""The government is only busy collecting tax in all manner and in all ways from the middle-class, and they do not get the relaxation they were hoping for in IT sector, loan processing procedure and bank transaction fees and penalty because...""

This method succeeds in boring the person who posed the question enough to make them automatically lose interest in the answer, post ""because"". You can literally get away with saying anything. Trust me, because I have a degree in industrial engineering by just writing zoological names of monkeys in a thermodynamics paper.

Modi could have at least done what contestants at the Miss India pageant do during the Q&A round. To buy time to think of something that could pass off as an answer, they start appreciating the question first. And then, talk about India's population. ""First, I want to thank the member for posing such a thought-provoking question. As you know, India is a vast country of over a billion people, with over a thousand dialects and thousands of taxes. And I'm proud of our rich culture and taxes... I would like to thank my tax-paying parents, tax-paying teachers and you, the tax-paying audience.""

This at least shows intent, and in my book, you would have gotten marks for trying. Or like they say in school, ""marks for steps"".

Also read: Modi's Exam Warriors: It's all about politics, stupid!

What if students across India took a leaf out of their beloved PM's latest diktat, and started demanding that teachers shoot a video of the questions for the exam and submit it 48 hours in advance.

Imagine Priya ma'am submitting her questions: ""Train A leaves the station five hours before Train B. If Train A is travelling at 50 km/hr, how long will it take for Train A to meet Train B?"" The BJP's first response to the question would be to change the name of Train A to Hanuman Express and Train B to Ram Janmabhoomi Express. And then, they would ban the question because guess what, both trains wouldn't have made it out of the station anyway, since the whole problem is set in 2002. Do we want 2002?

I'm not saying Modi should hold open press conferences. That's just too much to ask for. Let's take baby steps instead. I just want him to put some effort while taking the whole country for a ride on Train B, while claiming that the 'B' in the train stands for bullet.

According to the earlier norms, only government schools were allowed to become part of the board. Through the Maharashtra International Education Board (MIEB), the state education department aims to bring in a curriculum similar to that of international schools in state-run institutions. A total of 455 schools, including government, aided and self-financed schools from across the state, have applied to become a part of the board. In the first phase, the schools will follow the curriculum of the new board from pre-primary to Class 3, with Marathi as the medium of instruction for the first year. Currently, the governing body of the board is in the process of scanning the applications from schools to select the final 100.

Tawde said the government would pick 25 private schools and 25 aided schools, along with 50 government schools, as the first 100 schools under the board. ""We have got around 40-45 applications from private schools this year, so we decided to allow a few good private schools to join,"" he said.

Heramb Kulkarni, an educationist from the state, said the government needs to be careful before allowing private schools to become a part of the initiative. ""While some private schools are doing good work, they need to set criteria for selection. The move should not benefit schools run by politicians and big corporates,"" he said.

Government schools that would become a part of the selected 100 will be named 'Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari International School' in the memory of the late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Currently, 13 schools in the state are being run as per the MIEB curriculum on a pilot basis. ""We want to ensure people pick state's international schools over international boards. Experts who are a part of the initiative have come up with a great curriculum,"" said Tawde."

Earlier, the state had decided to extend the programme only to government and government aided schools. ""We are now looking to give affiliation to 50 government schools, 25 government-aided schools and 25 self- financed schools,"" he said.

Of the 455 applications the new board has received, approximately 45 are from private unaided schools. ""We have received a lot of requests from schools to be affiliated to the board. We also thought it would be a good way to build the board's brand and give the schools a chance to look beyond the other international or national boards,"" said Tawde.

Currently, there are 13 zilla parishad schools in the state where the MIEB curriculum is being developed and delivered. For the next academic year, the state has called for applications to hand out 100 more affiliations. Even as the board plans an expansion, the curriculum is still a work in progress.

While already rolled out, the MIEB was officially launched on Tuesday by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar.

""Vajpayee gave the country a direction in progress across sectors but education was very dear to him. Hence, launching the board on his birth anniversary is an apt tribute to him.

However, it seems corporate India doesn't really have one in this sector. In fact, a meticulous search into many sectors led to a series of disappointing revelations around the industries and roles that display a deep-rooted bias against women.

According to our online survey among millennial women, close to 60% believe that organizations prefer hiring women in human resources department but when it comes to sales or operations, women find it tough to find takers. About 40% felt that sales departments are biased in favour of men while 44% believe that employers would much rather have men in operations roles. Our sample also pointed out that 90% of the secretarial roles in organizations are occupied by women.

Stereotypes continue to wreak havoc as the professional world perpetuates the belief that women possess certain 'natural' strengths that make them more suitable for certain roles, departments or industries. In fact, even as one fights the blue-pink bias for young children, there is the new concept of 'pink-collar' or 'female-oriented' jobs like that of a baby sitter, florist, day-care worker or a nurse. Typically, these require far less professional training than white-collar professions.

As pervasive as the notion of natural strengths, is that of 'weaknesses' that women display. Women aren't good negotiators, they struggle with numbers, they don't think 'big' enough - are common refrains. These loosely-formed biases have serious implications for women at work. For instance, one of our respondents said that whenever she prepared a quantitative report at her previous workplace, she was asked to get it checked by her male peer before submitting it to her boss.

Women are often overlooked for roles in certain sectors and get cajoled into 'naturally' good fits like hospitality, personal banking, travel, education, media and public relations.

Even as we have been building an all -- women's management practice programme, we have received endless suggestions about the courses we 'must' include in our curriculum -- including communications, public relations, HR and personal banking. While we have steered away from these stereotypes as much as possible, we have also had to fight unconscious biases among some of our faculty who believed case studies on the automobile industry would not be 'relevant' for an all-women's cohort. Pushing them to smash these stereotypes in the classroom is a small step towards removing these deep-rooted, often unfounded biases that seep through into workplaces.

Recent studies in the field of gender and identity theories conceptualize masculinity and femininity as dualist constructs, and explain that people possess both masculine and feminine traits but to varying degrees -- as opposed to earlier theories of gender as a single, bipolar construct. Conversations with gender studies experts suggest that the spectrum of attributes required at work are largely the same for women and men -- but the differences at the extreme ends of masculinity and feminity are what get highlighted, compared and eventually exaggerated to gender stereotyping. As an example, isn't it interesting that all the cooks at a dhaba along the highway are men, but when they get back home, they expect a meal cooked by their wife.

On a positive note, despite the fact that women feel discriminated against with respect to departments and industries, 55% of our respondents -- urban, educated, millennial women -- feel they are at par with their male colleagues at work, a happy divergence in thought from the previous generation. Given a new understanding of gender, and newly founded confidence in our millennial girls, isn't it time for workplaces, too, to shed their conscious and not-so-conscious biases?

The Millennial Girl is a column based on an online survey conducted with over 100 urban, working millennial women to uncover their attitudes and opinions about the workplace."

As professionals, with in-depth knowledge of drug compositions and formulations, pharmacists are a critical cog in the healthcare wheel of any country. In the developed world, the Pharmacy profession is expanding in new directions, with pharmacy professionals getting involved not just in dispensing medicines and conducting drug research but also in educating and counseling patients. Indian pharmaceutical sector currently accounts for about 3.1-3.6% of the global pharma industry in value terms, and is witnessing a market growth of 12.8% due to an increase in consumer spending and healthcare insurance. As the rapidly growing Indian pharmaceutical sector strives to become a global hub of original drug research and manufacturing, pharmacy graduates with the right training and knowledge have significant potential to power the industry's growth.

As the pharma sector works to propel itself towards the next level of growth, among the major challenges that confront the industry today are significant talent gaps and shortage of highly skilled workforce.

Upgrade the curriculum

The current pharmacy education system in India is plagued by various problems including an obsolete curriculum that has not been upgraded for years,unspecialized coursework, lack of integration with other sciences, and lack of priority over increasing research output from institutions, among others. A transition to knowledge economy has resulted in the emergence of newer technological areas in the field of Life Sciences. Be it bioinformatics or nanotechnology, these emerging new knowledge areas have overlapped intrinsically with traditional subjects. A student of pharmacy or pharmacology must therefore possess a wider knowledge which stretches beyond the traditional understanding of drug quality maintenance and marketing. Pharmacological studies must incorporate various disciplines from associated Life Sciences to impart in students a deeper understanding of human biology right up to the molecular levels to physiology and pathology of diseases. We also need to incorporate areas of biotechnology, pharmacokinetics studies and drug metabolism in the curriculum.

At the same time, instilling in students a drive for innovation and research is also important to enable them become differentiators and innovators. In the Indian context, it is very important to develop a crop of educated researchers and innovators in medicine who would be working with the objective of devising innovative solutions to India's healthcare woes. Developing low cost diagnostic solutions,medical devices as well drugs is essential for India to be able to make healthcare accessible to all. A number of startups which are working towards devising such innovative indigenous solutions have already emerged in recent years in India. Skilling pharmaceutical students and providing them start up training can also help us produce talent that would feed into this demand.

Develop close industry academia ties

Another important need is to develop closer and active links between the industry and academic institutions. Regular interaction between the two is crucial to ensure that students are abreast of the developments taking place in the field are able to skill themselves accordingly. A sustainable give and take of ideas allows academia and students to understand first-hand the developments taking place in the industry and become aware of its changing needs. This would help upskill and update students which in turn will create a future workforce that is more ready to be assimilated into the industry with which it has already been engaging for some time.

Creating long term training programs for students to impart practical learning opportunities, bringing industry leaders on board for lectures and establishing forums that help fresh graduates meaningful employment opportunities are important elements that must be focused upon.

Impart patient-centric education

With vital knowledge of drug composition, interactions and toxicology, pharmacists have the ability to guide patients towards the correct usage of medicines and curtail the negative outcomes or adverse reactions from incorrect drug consumption. This advice is particularly important for people who consume multiple drugs for different conditions. Similarly, simple pieces of advices of how and when to consume which type of drug can also allow better medical care for patients. Across the world, pharmacists play a very important role of ensuring safe, effective and rational use of medicines. In India, however, we rarely see pharmacists interact with patients effectively. Their role is limited to storage and dispensing of medication in clinical settings and formulation and compounding in industrial settings. We must also train pharmacists towards handling their clinical and patient-centric responsibilities as well.

Counselling of patients on diet, lifestyle and disease prevention is another crucial role pharmacists can play, especially in rural areas and primary health centres where shortage of doctors and medical staff is a major concern.

Thus, there is an urgent need to revamp the pharmacy education in India and improve its quality through a series of measures such as upgrading curriculum with present day's needs and industrial participation. A workforce skilled and trained in high quality research, drug development and having multi-dimensional knowledge is very important to meet the changing needs of the industry.

Kaur, who also won a gold medal in the first National Masters Games, 2017, said her husband had earlier underwent an operation in Jalandhar, but it proved unsuccessful. ""At that time too, I had to collect money from villagers for the treatment of my husband. For the last one-and-a-half years, the condition of my husband has been deteriorating.

However, a closer look at the new conditions in fine print reveals that the part-time teachers may not be able to earn the assured sum even in entire year.

As per the GR issued by department of higher and technical education on November 14, the colleges and universities compulsorily need to follow a lengthy procedure to decide number of part-timers they require before appointing them. The new system has held up appointments for this year and is likely to disrupt teaching activity next year too.

Going by the GR, colleges and universities won't be able to assign work to part-time teachers before February. The university exam would start from February 15, thus leaving 15 lectures in 2018-19 session, experts say.

Earlier, the universities and colleges had the liberty to appoint CHB teachers in July itself and get approval by December from the department. Henceforth, the appointments can't be finalized until the government and universities okay the workload, which is decided only at September end when admissions close.

This year, colleges under Nagpur University (NU) as well as other parts of the state have been unable to recruit part-time teachers even though the second term of academic year has begun because of the draconian rules.

Surprisingly, several principals and aspirants have been unable to decipher the details of the GR which would entail months of unemployment and classes without teachers.

""People are so happy about the hike in remuneration that they didn't realize its drawbacks. The government is working against the interest of the students and teachers,' said Rajendra Bhoyar, president of Maharashtra Principals' Forum.

The biggest setback for teachers is restriction on working part-time in more than one college besides possessing higher qualification not less the PhD, NET/SET.

""This is injustice to teachers in the name of increasing the pay,"" said Anil Dhage, former secretary of NUTA.

He added that the GR restricts the number of lectures for a part-time teacher to 9. Earlier it was 7 but teachers were allowed to work in any number of colleges.

Bhoyar said imposing such norms not only increases unemployment among youth but also leaves students without teachers. ""At several colleges, no classes have been held so far. We have demanded that instead the government allows us to recruit contractual teachers just like the Nagpur University has done. We are ready to pay Rs25,000 a month to contract teachers,"" he said."

","Hindustan Times",FALSE,"Anuradha Mandlik's memories of learning maths don't include textbooks or class tests. Instead, she remembers going to a playground and her father using that space to explain how land is measured. In 2002, Mandlik's father Ajit decided to take her out of school and homeschool her. Fifteen years later, Mandlik made history when she became possibly the first student in Maharashtra to have passed board exams without attending school.

Homeschooling means teaching a child at home instead of enrolling them in school. The option is gaining popularity with parents in Maharashtra after the success of homeschooled students like Mandlik and Malvika Joshi, who in 2016 was awarded a scholarship from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) despite not having taken any board exams.

As per current regulations, students must pass at least Class V to appear for board exams as a private candidate. In 2017, Maharashtra's education department announced an open schooling system, which is expected to be in place by June 2019.

This would allow students appear for Class V, VIII, X and XII exams even if they have not attended school.

""Once the state starts open schooling, more parents are likely to opt for homeschooling as it would allow students to appear for periodic exams without going to school,"" said Jayant Jain, president of Forum for Fairness in Education, a city-based organisation that has identified parents with homeschooling experience who can mentor others interested in educating their children at home.

""When I took the step, most people were not convinced about the concept as they thought that not sending their children to school would mean missing out on a lot of things, from academic growth to socialisation. But if you see my daughter now, she is way smarter than most students her age,"" said Ajit Mandlik.

While there are teaching kits available online, support groups like Swashikshan, a pan-Indian community of homeschoolers, are also becoming important resources. In high demand are those who have successfully homeschooled their children.

Joshi's mother Supriya said, ""I used to get 15-20 calls a day from parents across the country. They were all interested in knowing my story and wanted to know if they too can take the step. While I do answer all such queries even now, I often caution parents that homeschooling does not have a set formula. What worked for me might not work for everyone.""

Psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada said it's important to plan this transition.

""Right now, parents who are successfully doing it, are really spending a lot of time in planning it well. But if this becomes a mass trend, not all parents can ensure that the child gets exposed to all round development. One needs to understand that a school teaches a child a lot more than academics,"" he said.

""Many parents often follow the syllabus of a particular board, which turns out to be a big mistake. The whole idea behind homeschooling is to eliminate the structures of knowledge,"" said Hemali Gada, a Malad-based entrepreneur who took her daughter Dhwani out of school at Class VI and has been homeschooling her ever since. Dhwani said in school the teachers only taught what was there in the textbook but homeschooling offers more flexibility.

One concern with homeschooling is that a child may become isolated from their age group. Experienced homeschoolers encourage parents to get their children to participate in activities like sports and music to help them develop a circle of friends. ""My daughter used to go to a music class since she was very young. We would often take her to various sporting events across the city and she had friends in the neighbourhood. Hence, she never really felt that she was alone,"" said Ajit.

Another worry is that homeschooled students may struggle to transition to a formal education system later.

For Mandlik, who now studies in Class XII at SNDT College in Churchgate, this didn't pose a problem.

""Even though I didn't go to school, through my friends I knew what the school atmosphere is. That helped me cope with the changes that happened as I entered college.""

She said that she was only nervous about exams. ""As a homeschooled student, I was not used to facing exams. But after the first exam went well, my anxiety went away.""

Dhwani thinks homeschooling is giving her a more well-rounded education.

""When I used to go to school, students would only talk about studies or related things and lacked a worldview. A few months into homeschooling, I met a lot of children my age who might not be 'academically brilliant' but who could talk about books, art, culture etc,"" Dhwani said."

Gaps in infrastructure and lack of awareness are among the primary reasons why the Directorate of Education (DoE) has failed to draw applicants to seats reserved for differently abled children in the city's private schools.

For the first time this year, a three per cent quota for children with special needs was introduced within the 25 per cent EWS/DG category. Despite inviting applications thrice for about 1,300 seats in the category, 1,268 seats are still lying vacant with no applicants. The fourth draw of lots for these seats, to allot schools to applicants, will be conducted on Wednesday.

The Indian Express looked at reports of inspections carried out by the DoE across popular private schools in the city in 2015, to find that most lack the adequate number of special educators, disabled-friendly washrooms and even signage.

The DoE had inspected schools which were identified as having infrastructure to cater to differently abled children.

Of the 162 schools that were inspected to check for facilities for visually impaired students, 156 did not have Braille books, 132 did not have large print books and 143 did not have embossed maps and globes. Only five had Braille signage and 158 lacked tactile pathways. Special educators were missing in 114 schools and 110 did not have disabled-friendly washrooms.

Advertising ExplainedNot enough special educators in MCD, govt schools

Schools in Delhi -- government and private -- are unequipped to cater to students with special needs. In South and North Municipal Corporation schools, there are only 63 special educators against 1,084 sanctioned posts. Even in the city's government schools, the number of special educators is much lower than the requirement. Despite court orders and studies that make a case for integration of children in the same classroom, those with special needs are mostly sent to specialised schools. While specialised attention for differently abled children is required in many cases, there is barely any regulatory mechanism to monitor the functioning of these schools.

Of 169 schools inspected for facilities for those with hearing impairment, 160 did not have a speech therapist and 112 did not have visual and digital signage. Most schools out of 145 schools inspected for facilities for children with autism did not have tools of educational functional, language and communication, social behaviour and motor skills assessment.

According to disability rights activist Dr Satender Singh, one of the main reasons that such few applications come to schools is the lack of inclusive and accessible infrastructure and tools in schools. ""How many schools in Delhi are even accessible for persons with disabilities and how many have qualified special educators to help these students? There are also a number of learning disorders such as dyslexia, which require special teaching and learning tools. Given the gap, parents will prefer to send their children to specialised schools,"" he said.

The government also sees the lack of awareness as a challenge. Director of Education Sanjay Goel said that the department aims to step up publicity for these seats in the coming academic year. ""We will try to increase awareness about these seats.

By Abha Goradia

To provide international standard education to students in Marathi, their native language, a first-of-its-kind Maharashtra International Education Board came into being on Tuesday. Launched to commemorate the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, all schools affiliated to the board will be known as Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee International School.

As the first step, 13 schools from 13 districts were given affiliation from the board. The affiliated schools are from Buldhana, Washim, Osmanabad, Parbhani, Thane, Sindhudurg, Chandrapur, Gondia, Nandurbar, Nashik, Kolhapur, Pune and Satara. By next year, the board plans to increase the number of schools to 100.

Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar said that the initiative is an extension of Vajpayee's Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, and will focus on inclusive education. ""It is not an imported board but a board that can be exported,"" he said.

The international syllabus will include knowledge of surrounding areas and the world outside. Education in these schools will be provided in Marathi medium, though there will be an emphasis on improving English language.

Maintaining that the department is working towards ""operation digital board"", Javadekar said that in 15 lakh institutions, students would be taught in digital mode from Class IX to third-year in college in the next three years. The department also plans to introduce exams in Class V and VIII to promote continuous evaluation, he said.

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said: ""With the formation of the board, we are entering into a new era. It is a true tribute to Vajpayee. The schools' names will remain the same but the education pattern shall be named after Vajpayee.""

Maharashtra has two crore students from classes I to XII, said School Education Minister Vinod Tawde. ""We need to nurture students to not just prepare for international courses but to also sustain and be successful,"" he added.

""Through the new system, students will learn not just for marks but also develop qualities and life-skills... We have evolved from a Gurukul system, and the new board has included aspects of Sanskrit in its course,"" said state Minister for Rural Development Pankaja Munde.

According to a government resolution dated October 14, 2016, 100 schools run by tribal development, social justice and school education departments would be affiliated to the new board. The criteria for providing affiliation included joint initiative by all stakeholders; number of students; infrastructure facilities, including a well-constructed building; facility to increase intake capacity; separate washrooms for girls and boys; Internet facilities; clean surroundings as well as facilities to use academic technology and ferrying students, among others.

Scientists Dr Raghunath Mashelkar, Dr Vijay Bhatkar and Dr Anil Kakodkar, education experts Sonam Wangchuk and Dr Swarup Sampat and calligrapher Achyut Palav, among others, are part of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee International School's regulatory board."

He warned the KU authorities of stopping harassing students or be prepared for massive student protests.

KU's Chief Librarian, G M Peerzada said, ""The order of not allowing student to enter the library was in place for security reason.""

He said the authorities would install CCTV in the library in the coming months and when the cameras would be in place, students wearing any kind of dress would be allowed to sit inside the library.

""Many times, some mischievous students were found stealing books from the library while hiding them inside their pherans,"" Peerzada said.

Earlier, DSEK had banned 'Pheran' in its zonal offices in the Valley while a similar ban on the Pheran was in place in the civil secretariat at Srinagar.

The ban on pheran comes close on the heels of Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) removing Kashmiri from the online portal 'Basha Sangam' following a complaint by some Kashmiri Pandits.

Over 40 boats operate from the north and south banks of the Brahmaputra river, ferrying not just people but also two-wheelers and cars. Of these, two are operated by the state government, while the rest are privately owned.

Each boat requires three people to operate.

On 25 December, the rail-cum-road bridge has been inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, facilitating quicker movement of vehicles and easy access for the people of Dhemaji to major hospitals, education institutes and the Dibrugarh airport.

The boatmen, those running food stalls and the vehicle operators carrying people to and from the ferry ghats fear that they will have to look for an alternative source of livelihood.

""In a joint family of 12 members, my brother and I operate one boat from Bogibeel ghat. After paying Rs 75,000 rent for the boat per annum and spending on the salaries of the boatmen, we earn around Rs 30,000 per month."" A private ferry operator at Bogibeel ghat

It takes 45 minutes to two hours to cross the river on the boats. But once the bridge is open, it will take just 10 minutes, saving not just time, but also money.

While the government-operated boats charge Rs 18 per person, Rs 800 for small cars and Rs 1,000 for SUVs, the privately-operated boats charge way more for ferrying people and vehicles between Bogibeel ghat and Kareng Ghat in Dhemaji district, an official of the state Inland Water Transport Department said.

According to the official, some of the boats will be shifted to other ghats. But the private boat operators fear that they won't be able to get a similar opportunity and even if they do, it won't be financially viable.

Asked if some proposals have been made for the affected people, he said, ""I haven't heard of announcement regarding any compensation yet, but the affected people have taken up the issue with political leaders.""

""After this bridge becomes operational, the ferry service from this ghat will stop and we have to look for an alternative mode of earning. Luckily, we have some agricultural land. But everyone is not so lucky.""A private ferry operator

The bridge, with two-line railway track on the lower deck and a three-lane road on the top deck, will provide the much-needed connectivity between Dibrugarh in Assam to Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh. It will also reduce Delhi to Dibrugarh train travel time by about three hours, making it 34 hours as against 37 hours presently.

It is a part of the infrastructure projects planned by India to improve logistics along the border in Arunachal Pradesh.

So it is now official: the state can snoop, via 10 agencies, any and all computers for what it may choose to define as essential information in defence of the nation. What is worrying is the function-creep implicit in all the data being gathered.

Surveillance is not new. All monarchs and governments have kept an eye, through informers and spies, on potential 'trouble-makers'. In contemporary culture, online and offline retailers regularly collect customer information in the guise of offering them appropriate products, services and discounts (what Joseph Turow brilliantly terms 'the aisles have eyes', a riff on the cannibal-thriller, The Hills Have Eyes) -- this being information that we willingly share on membership cards, feedback on purchases, etc.

On social media privacy is supposedly determined by the individual user, although recent revelations by FB indicate that information leaks without the individual authorising it. On the obverse, the anonymity of digital technology allowed the users to say things that they could not have said because their identities as employees, citizens, victims would have placed them at the receiving end of oppressive regimes.

Those experiencing social stigma, likewise, found it a space of freedom. Till they discovered that nothing is truly anonymous in the digital.

The state is at the centre of the surveillance-privacy question. Worrying about data protection and privacy rights, organisations and some governments in Europe, have put together advice material. The UK government's Department of Education published Privacy Notices: An Explanation of Privacy Notices in 2018. The Publications Office of the European Union, also in 2018, published Surveillance by Intelligence Services: Fundamental Rights, Safeguards and Remedies in the European Union. These documents are key elements in spreading the awareness of ""what should governments and private corporations know about you"", as the subtitle of a recent book on the subject puts it.

Under the new rules, information can be gathered but the procedure of information-gathering has not been specified nor what purposes it will be put to. Surveillance studies scholars speak of 'function creep', where data obtained for one purpose can be used elsewhere, for entirely different purposes.

So the question is: if an academic has been examining the role of, say, jingoistic nationalism or corporate corruption in her/his academic writings, can the agencies tracking this writing appropriate it for other purposes?

It is incumbent upon any state instituting mass surveillance systems to explicitly detail procedure, security levels (of data gleaned), access to data and use/purpose, in addition of course to seeking informed consent. Without clear guidelines on process and product, any 'dataveillance state' is on the verge of totalitarianism. Further, if the state chooses to share data with corporate organisations, then the government-business nexus will produce a gargantuan structure in which all lives are, effectively, documented lives.

In a horrific recent study in the Wake Forest Law Review (53.3, 2018), Lori Andrews examining mobile medical apps discovered that, despite all the privacy policies offered by the apps, over 70 per cent of the medical apps they studied shared users' sensitive information with third party data aggregators, including insurers, advertisers and employers, without the app-users' knowledge or consent. This breach of the public/private barrier via technology is precisely what mass surveillance processes institute at the level of the state.

Surveillance marks the end of the individual self when the individual is no longer sure where the data is being collated and interpreted. Identification techniques, as the Routledge Handbook of Surveillance Studies puts it, ""make at least some aspects of an unknown entity known by mapping it to a knowable attribute"". When this ""knowable attribute"" (suspicious behaviour, terrorist behaviour, paedophile behaviour, resister?) is left undefined it enables the state to label any individual.

Many, it is likely, would withdraw from political discussions, for instance. This means, in short, I would hesitate to present my political self to the world. If I cannot choose what information about myself the world needs to know, then I would prefer, perhaps, to disguise my identity by appropriately tailoring a public self. Whether data is being gathered or not, the threat or belief of surveillance will alter the into somebody who fits the normative/acceptable ideal. We will have standardised, assembly-line citizens, not individuals.

If the information collected is identified with an individual, then that individual loses her/his identity and privacy. Anonymised information is a weapon against such surveillance, but is a premium in our networked lives. Even if the information is anonymised (erase that cookie!), it can be re-identified the next time you log in. The store Wi-fi tracks your progress, via your smartphone and via ShopTrak through the aisles for future use.

The rise of ""differential privacy"" that introduces randomness into the samples of data collected is a partial response to the fears of surveillance. As a consequence, any reader of the data finds an ambiguity when trying to reconstruct what the confidential data must have been originally, so that it produced the current results (see the essay by Alexandra Wood et al in Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment & Technology Law, 21.1, 2018).

Privacy is about the individual's relationship with the world. It is true that individuals become a community through the sharing of information (communication and community are etymologically linked), but this again is founded on the respect for an individual's right to safeguard some privacy. Privacy is the seat of individual well-being, which includes the right to make choices for one's individual self (decisional privacy), and not determined, limited or influenced, as far as possible, by the world. It marks the sense of the self, its boundary with the world.

What erodes my sense of self, its borders, is not that I am being watched, but that I may be watched. This belief in being surveilled alters the nature of my interactions with the world. The odd thing is: all surveillance in the name of security for the self causes me to worry that I am no longer myself, by myself.

In the media age, it becomes important to define what we understand as the personal and the private. These are culture-specific as well. Definitions of privacy will also depend on how we define the process of information-sharing, Raymond Wacks puts it this way: ""(personal information) should refer both to the quality of the information and to the reasonable expectations of the individual concerning its use"".

But Wacks also notes that a piece of information that is innocuous in itself, in combination with another piece of data, can be detrimental to the individual's privacy. Using data from, say a crime database in which an individual may figure to influence her/his fate in a civil dispute or employee record or health services would constitute the function-creep that infringes on the individual's right to privacy.

This last is the crux of the matter. Until such time as the state creates a detailed procedural plan on info-gathering, the nature of data gathered and the sharing of data, all mass surveillance modes must be treated with suspicion."

""She regularly writes complaints and everything. There are three mothers, each of them has a personal grudge with the Director. Before the three of them wrote complaints, there was one,"" added Feschenko.

Representatives of the Department of education came to the picket near the school and said that their efforts are meaningless as a statement about the dismissal is already signed.

""He said that all our efforts are empty and the statement is already signed. According to eyewitnesses, spoke roughly and defiantly,"" - said Feschenko noted that parents are not going to give up.

They were taken to the Department of education letter in support of the Director and Wednesday, 26 December at 17:00 the school will hold a conference of parents, together with representatives of the district. If all these measures do not work, then the parents are ready to move on to more decisive action.

A group of boatmen making their living ferrying people and goods across the Brahmaputra here see Bogibeel, India's longest railroad bridge, as a loss of livelihood.

Over 40 boats operate from the north and south banks of the Brahmaputra river, ferrying not just people but also two-wheelers and cars. Of these, two are operated by the state government, while the rest are privately owned.

Each boat requires three people to operate.

Come December 25, the rail-cum-road bridge will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, facilitating quicker movement of vehicles and easy access for the people of Dhemaji to major hospitals, education institutes and the Dibrugarh airport.

The boatmen, those running food stalls and the vehicle operators carrying people to and from the ferry ghats fear that from then on they will have to look for an alternative source of livelihood.

""In a joint family of 12 members, I and my brother operate one boat from Bogibeel ghat. After paying Rs 75,000 rent for the boat per annum and spending on the salaries of the boatmen, we earn around Rs 30,000 per month,"" a private ferry operator at Bogibeel ghat said.

It takes 45 minutes to two hours to cross the river on the boats. But once the bridge is open, it will take just 10 minutes, saving not just time, but also money.

While the government-operated boats charge Rs 18 per person, Rs 800 for small cars and Rs 1,000 for SUVs, the privately-operated boats charge way more for ferrying people and vehicles between Bogibeel ghat and Kareng Ghat in Dhemaji district, an official of the state Inland Water Transport Department said.

According to the official, some of the boats will be shifted to other ghats. But the private boat operators fear that they won't be able to get a similar opportunity and even if they do, it won't be financially viable.

Asked if some proposals have been made for the affected people, he said, ""I haven't heard of announcement regarding any compensation yet, but the affected people have taken up the issue with political leaders.""

""After this bridge becomes operational, the ferry service from this ghat will stop and we have to look for an alternative mode of earning. Luckily, we have some agricultural land. But everyone is not so lucky,"" said another boat operator.

The bridge, with two-line railway track on the lower deck and a three-lane road on the top deck, will provide the much-needed connectivity between Dibrugarh in Assam to Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh. It will also reduce Delhi to Dibrugarh train travel time by about three hours to 34 hours as against 37 hours presently.

It is part of infrastructure projects planned by India to improve logistics along the border in Arunachal Pradesh. This includes the construction of a trans-Arunachal highway on the north bank of the Brahmaputra, and new road and rail links over the mighty river and its major tributaries such as the Dibang, Lohit, Subansiri and Kameng.

English, instead of Hindi, will become the medium of instruction in class 6 of 36 state-run schools in the city from the next academic session.

A circular by the directorate of elementary education, dated December 20, stated that one section in class 6 of 310 government schools across the state would start using English as the medium of instruction from 2019-2020 academic session. So far, in class 6, all subjects other than English are taught in Hindi. Out of a total of 310 schools in the district that have been chosen for the initiative, the highest number of schools are in Gurugram.

District elementary education officer Premlata Yadav said that the initiative was aimed at improving the student's command over the language. ""Till now, students in class 6 were only studying English as a single subject. They will become more familiar with the language if they use it regularly for studying all the subjects. The initiative is aimed at ensuring that our students are on par with pupils in private schools in every sphere,"" Yadav said.

About 40 English books will be made available to each of these schools in the next academic session to facilitate the initiative. All schools have been directed to ensure that the message is communicated to teachers, students and parents at the beginning of the next academic session.

One section of class 9 in these 310 schools is already using English as a medium of instruction for studying mathematics and science.

While the move has been welcomed by parents and children, some teachers have raised concerns about the lack of qualified English post-graduate teachers in schools. ""It is a good move and we welcome it, but, the shortage of teachers should be fulfilled first to make the initiative a success. The department should consult with the selected schools and find out if they have enough teachers to teach their subjects in English,"" said Satyanarayan Yadav, deputy vice-president of Haryana School Teachers Union."

After mohalla clinics, the Delhi government has set up 101 ""mohalla playschools"" or ""modern anganwadi hub centres"" for children from the economically disadvantaged families.

The centres are part of the Delhi government's ongoing reforms in the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme under which the anganwadi centres provide food, preschool education and primary health care to children up to six years of age and their mothers.

Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia, who also looks after the women and child department, inaugurated the centres on Monday.

""We recognised that care for children starts from the time when they are in their mothers' wombs and learning starts from the day they are born. Our 10,000 plus anganwadi centres are the platform to provide this care and learning. In a way, these hubs are 'mohalla play schools' for the children of the common people who can't afford play schools otherwise,"" he said.

The centres, which will cater to children aged between 3 and 6, have been created by clubbing two or three existing angawadis in multiple locations, including Okhla, Kondli and Patparganj.

The centres were inaugurated by legislators of the respective areas. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is also planning to come up with a new curriculum to make these children school-ready.

""Poor early learning experience in early years is the beginning of the learning gap that gets further perpetuated as children progress to higher classes. Government school children start formal school in class 1 and are already at a disadvantage compared to those who go to playschools that use various tools for cognitive development during early childhood,"" Sisodia said.

Earlier this month, the government had trained anganwadi workers under its new early childhood education (ECE) curriculum.

She warned that the education department will be forced to take up ""strong measures"" if the para teachers fail to take advantage of this opportunity.

Even as the education minister was appealing for talks, the para teachers refused to back down from the demand for job regularisation and hundreds of them gheraoed the state BJP office. However, it is yet to be known how their leaders will respond to Yadav's appeal.

Inviting them for talks, Yadav said, ""Since we are positive of solving the problems through a dialogue, we are opening our doors to the para teachers and their representatives for discussions till December 26. If they fail to turn up or approach us, we will be forced to take stringent action."" But she refrained from disclosing the exact nature of action planned against them. The para teachers' mass protest in the state will complete 40 days on Tuesday, with around 55,000 of the total 66,000 still continuing the strike and affecting thousands of schools.

In an indication of softening stand, the minister said it is open to strike a deal with the protesters within the norms and regulations. She said, ""We are even open to talks over increase of honorarium of untrained para teachers which wasn't included in the recent hikes announced. Besides, we also have agreed on setting up a 'welfare fund' of Rs 10 crore for the para teachers to meet their exigency expenditures, including medical emergencies.""

Yadav also extended her condolences to families of those para teachers who died during their ongoing protests. ""I have met the protesting para teachers at my home and personally on several occasions asked them to come for a dialogue. The temperatures are dipping and we are losing our teachers, which is very upsetting, given that they are stuck on the demands that are impossible to meet,"" she said, adding, ""Every time the teaching jobs are opened, 50% reservation is given to existing para teachers.

However, school education secretary A P Singh reiterated that it will not be possible to implement a higher scale for honorarium at par with states like Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, saying their operational models have no parallels with that of Jharkhand. ""Even on this date, we have 11,000 para teachers who are not only intermediate but untrained too. All of them will be forced out of their current jobs from April 2019 if they fail to complete teachers' training from the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS).

This is clear from the growing demand to re-open the plant.

For S Rajendran, Diwali this year was a difficult one. He owns 60 tanker lorries in Thoothukudi that were contracted to carry acids from Sterlite copper plant, owned by UK-based Vedanta Group, in the city.

With the Tamil Nadu government ordering the closure of the copper plant on 28 May on alleged grounds of causing pollution, his fortunes were hit badly. ""All my vehicles are 8mm thick tankers that fetch a premium rent. The plant's closure has made it difficult for me to make ends meet,"" rues Rajendran.

The tanker owner had to pay at least Rs 60,000, including insurance, for new vehicles and Rs 35,000 to Rs 40,000 for old vehicles. ""With Sterlite closed, I have been left with no income. So, I have given away 54 of my tankers,"" he regrets.

Sterlite produced copper primarily but it also supplied sulphuric acid, phosphorus acid, gypsum as byproducts. Besides, the plant also supplied copper slag. Many industries in and around Thoothukudi were dependent on these products and they got these at competitive prices.

""Even now, my tankers can get these acids from Andhra Pradesh, particularly Kurnool and Kakinada. But they will have to wait for a week to get the required quantity. That is not economically feasible,"" says Rajendran.

One of the problems that tanker owners like Rajendran could face is getting drivers. ""We employ drivers from nearby Tirunelveli and Sankarankoil. If they were to be deployed to get acid from Andhra Pradesh, they can hardly earn Rs 10,000 a month and that is a far cry from what they earned when the Sterlite plant was functioning,"" he says.

When the plant was functioning, and a when a ship calls at the Tuticorin port, a tanker driver would get Rs 700 per trip for transporting goods to or from the plant. ""A tanker will make three to four trips a day. The problem is that over the last six months, at least 100 of the drivers and cleaners I had employed have become jobless,"" says Rajendran.

The Tamil Nadu government shut the Sterlite plant after protests demanding its closure turned violent on 22 May. In the violence and ensuing police firing, at least 13 people were killed.

Even before that, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) had withdrawn its consent for the operation of the copper plant on charges that Sterlite violated air and water acts.

Vedanta appealed against the closure before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which quashed the state government ad TNPCB orders, the closure was against the principles of natural justice. This was because the copper plant management was never given an opportunity to explain claims that they were causing air or water pollution.

Not just that, the NGT in its August 2013 ruling, cited its earlier injunction when it struck down a TNPCB closure order for an alleged leak. The tribunal said the Tamil Nadu government and TNPCB cannot cause ""civil death"" as sudden closure of an industrial unit will lead to far reaching economic, social and labour consequences.

The NGT's observations seem true, going by the versions of persons like Rajendran. ""You know, about 20 eateries in the parking lot of Sterlite and another 60 within half a km range of the copper plant have been shut since 28 May. For Thoothukudi, this Diwali was one of the worst in over a decade. No one among us could celebrate the festival,"" he adds.

""Sterlite closure has taken us back by 15 years economically. Transporters, drivers and related sectors have been badly affected in the last six months,"" says G Mahendran, who works as a supervisor with a transport operator.

""We, transport supervisors, earn Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 a month. Now, when we look for job outside we are offered only Rs 8,000 a month,"" rues Mahendran.

On an average, a family needs to spend at least Rs 15,000 to make its ends meet including children's education. ""When we get only Rs 8,000 a month, running a family becomes difficult,"" the transport supervisor says, adding that he at least has been able to manage with his savings.

""Some of my colleagues are forced to sell or pledge their jewels to make ends meet,"" Mahendran says, giving a glimpse of the economic problems that Thoothukudi is currently facing due to the plant's closure.

At least 1,000 vehicles are involved in loading or unloading at the Sterlite plant every day. ""About 500 of these vehicles transport acid and over 3,000 drivers and cleaners depend on this for their livelihood,"" Rajendran adds.

Even since the Sterlite plant was shut, no tanker travels to south of Tamil Nadu beyond Madurai because they are not assured of any load. ""At least we had a decent income until May and were able to save for the dry days. But think of the daily workers. Their life is a struggle now,"" regrets the transport supervisor.

The impact on the economy is reverberating across the city and region. ""Suppose I had Rs 500 in my pocket, I would spend at least Rs 200 in nearby shops. Now such spends don't happen and that can reveal the picture to you,"" says another transport worker.

Not surprisingly then, a two-wheeler dealer says that sales were down at least 10 per cent during Diwali this year. A grocery shop owner says they are facing a liquidity crunch.

Local people say that Tuticorin owes its growth to the rapid strides that the Sterlite copper plant had made in the last few years. ""The annual turnover of Sterlite is over Rs 22,000 crore. The plant's closure has affected all sections of the economy,"" says T Velsankar, president of Tuticorin Stevedores Association and joint managing director of logistics firm PSTS.

""At least Rs 500 crore direct business relating to logistics that was generated due to Sterlite has been hit. Besides, business at V O Chidambaranar Port too has been affected,"" adds Velsankar.

During April-September this fiscal, the V O Chidambaranar Port handled 16.78 million tonnes. In comparison, it handled 17.33 million tonnes during the same period last year.

""There has been a drop in the business that the VOC Port handles. One shipping freighter has closed due to poor business,"" says a Thoothukudi industrialist.

Customs Commissioner K V V G Diwakar told a gathering of exporters in October that Sterlite closure has resulted in a loss of Rs 1,000 crore to the Customs Department. Sterlite pays this as duty for importing copper concentrate ore.

Last fiscal, the Customs Department earned Rs 4,400 crore revenue. With Sterlite being shut for a major part of this fiscal, the revenue could drop to Rs 3,400 crore.

Downstream industries, in particular, which depend on Sterlite for their raw materials are among the worst hit. For example, a firm functioning from near Sterlite depends on the copper plant for its sulphuric acid requirements. The value of Sterlite businesses to these associates or partners or industries is over Rs 1,200 crore annually.

The firm was getting it at Rs 4,000 a tonne until May this year. After the plant's closure, the cost of sulphuric acid has nearly doubled. These firms operate on a very thin margin and the doubling of the raw material costs has aggravated their woes.

An industrialist, who doesn't want to be identified, says the SPIC plant in Thoothukudi is forced to shut down now and then due to raw material shortage. The SPIC plant produces singer super phosphate and diammonium phosphate (DAP) by sourcing raw materials from Sterlite.

""Sulphuric acid has even gone as higher as Rs 12,000 a tonne recently, while price of DAP has been raised,"" the industrialist says. What was earlier quoted as a price for a 50-kg bag is now quoted for a 45-kg bag.

As regards the main product copper that Sterlite produces, the situation can be gauged from the fact that it makes up 40 per cent of the total production in the country.

Leaving aside the 800-odd regular employees working in Sterlite or the 3,500 contract employees, there are over 20,000 people who get indirect employment through Sterlite operations. This includes those employed at the V O Chidambaranar Port.

In terms of economic loss, this could be huge, says another industrialist from the city.

A Thoothukudi resident sums up the economic loss for the city thus: ""If we work out an average of Rs 10,000 as salary for over 20,000 people affected by this closure, together their earnings will make up Rs 20 crore every month.

""Say, if they spend half of it to buy provisions, garments and other things, it means at least Rs 10 crore of money has been lost by various business, which deal with these products and depend on these incomes.""

This makes it clear why suddenly there is unrest among the locals particularly from villages near the plant, demanding that the plant be opened. With the Madras High Court staying the reopening following the NGT verdict, the issue has not gone back to the Supreme Court with Vedanta appealing against the stay."

Anchan added that they collected all the money from generous donors, who included locals, parents and others. ""We have not taken a single penny from any government be it the Centre or state. When we proposed the same building plan, the government estimated a cost of Rs 6 crore, but we have completed the work by spending Rs 2.2 crore.""

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

Lack of periodic training on handling weapons, inadequate knowledge of wildlife and its laws and 45% vacancies among forest foot soldiers have exposed gaping holes in the ability of the forest department to effectively guard the 26,281sqkm forest area in the state.

Shortage in manpower translates to improper monitoring that makes the forests vulnerable to poaching and tree felling. It also means delay in rescue activities. A range officer, forester or a guard is estimated to be able to cover 25sqkm of wooded area, but in Tamil Nadu shortage of people forces jurisdiction of each official to be at least 30sqkm. ""Many field staff have health problems due to which they cannot trek even short distances in the wooded areas,"" said a senior state forest official.

Staff scarcity in forest department is a nation-wide issue with shortages ranging between 30% and 40% in states such as Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat. The neighbouring Karnataka, too, faces similar problems. A senior official said the sanctioned strength of rangers in Karnataka is 765, but only 613 rangers are in service. Delay in recruitment process, inadequate number of candidates in posts such as forest watchers and guards, are some of the issues that other states face.

In Tamil Nadu, no recruitment was done for close to three decades till 2014 due to internal politics. The process was stalled on several occasions because associations of rangers, foresters and guards moved the courts to obtain a stay, citing various reasons. Kerala is an exception to this, as the state is prompt in recruiting foot soldiers on a regular basis. Former head of TN forest force and principal chief conservator of forests C K Sreedharan said among the four southern states, Kerala tops the list in filling vacancies. ""They have an efficient recruitment system in place and training is imparted to the newly recruited forest foot soldiers."" In Kerala, recruitment happens through the state public service commission, whereas in TN rangers were directly recruited. ""The process of recruitment had to be standardized,"" said Sreedharan. Stressing on the need for proper qualification of candidates, S R V Murthy, conservator of forests, Rajasthan, said, ""Recruitments here are done based on two categories forestry degree holders and science graduates.""

Training is restricted to new forest foot soldiers. ""Rangers recruited in TN undergo 18 months of training, and the foresters undergo six months of theoretical and practical training,"" said a senior forest official. Topics such as sylviculture, forest management, forest fire control and prevention, wildlife laws and soil science are taught during this period'. But in the absence of refresher courses the rules are forgotten and the updated laws ignored. ""Though everyone undergoes arms training, only rangers are provided with weapons. Periodical training is lacking,"" the official said.

Curriculum in the training module for rangers has to be improved, said the officer. The present curriculum is designed by the director of forest education in the Union ministry. Tamil Nadu officials say the training issue has to be addressed without delay. Since poaching is not rampant in Tamil Nadu, the challenges of foresters is monsoon, dry periods, when forest fires occur, and wild animals. To tackle these issues, proper gear, manpower and weapons for protection are essential.

Since 2014, Tamil Nadu forest department has initiated efforts to recruit more field staff, but they are still far from adequate. Recruiting youngsters, training them in forestry related issues, providing them weapons and other paraphernalia such as raincoats and boots are some of the aspects that need the state's immediate attention."

During the trifurcation of BU, faculty members were asked to choose one of the three universities. Seventeen of them picked BCU, but the proposal to transfer them to the varsity is still pending with the government and higher education department. ""As a result, the staff is still juggling between BU and BCU. We are completing the courses with the help of guest faculty when required,"" said Japhet.

The other suggestions include setting up government-sponsored gender-neutral hostels and transit homes for transgender people forced to move out of abusive homes, omission of gender column from all education forms and certificates and implementation of the Supreme Court's 2014 NALSA judgment in totality, which declared transgender people to be a 'third gender' and gave them the right to self-identification of their gender as male, female or third gender.

To create awareness and include them in the mainstream, the Delhi government also partnered with the Quart project and organised a queer art festival in Dwarka on Sunday. The festival provided a mass platform to showcase the talents of the trans-community whose voices otherwise remain unheard to the mainstream society. The committee has also suggested that the government should focus on healthcare facilities, empowerment, education and employment of the third gender. It has also recommended that the Medical Council of India starts a specialised post-graduate degree programme in 'transgender healthcare'.

The committee was formed by the Aam Aadmi Party government in May this year and included two representatives of the third gender apart from officials from social welfare department and representatives from organisations working at different levels for the welfare of the transgender.

The state has directed universities to collaborate with 'I Access Rights Mission' -- a field action project of TISS -- to successfully offer barrier-free access to disabled students on their campuses, to address their needs in pedagogy and to offer equal opportunities.

TISS will conduct a needs assessment study in public universities and frame guidelines that will be unique to each university. Since the state does not have a machinery to conduct an audit of the facilities universities' boast about, the department of higher and technical education has sought expert help from TISS. The team from the institute which has been successfully running the I Access mission since 2013, will be meeting representatives of disabled students from across universities to understand their requirements.

Vaishali Kolhe, project director of the mission and an associate professor at TISS' Centre for Disability Studies and Action, said they have observed that students with disabilities find it tough to pursue higher education. ""If they do not get the required infrastructure, aid and appliances, it will affect their overall academic development. We wish to assist each of the non-agricultural universities and study students with disabilities in the next two years,"" said Kolhe.

While the university is expected to bear the funding, the team of I Access will provide the expertise for the action-based work. In a government resolution (GR) passed in 2017, the state identified 21 disabilities for the first time to be considered for offering concessions/ facilities in educational institutions.

In another GR passed in August this year, based on Supreme Court's directive, the state made it compulsory to offer barrier-free accessibility on campuses and monitoring of these facilities. The mission's 'call for action' guidelines has already been circulated to all non-agricultural universities in the state.

""While we have been issuing directives, the state does not have the machinery to monitor the progress in colleges and universities.

The university will have to ensure the guidelines are implemented in affiliated colleges as well,"" said joint secretary of higher and technical education department, Siddharth Kharat.

Aconference held recently at TISS highlighted issues on disabilities, accessibility in the light of legislation and policies in the context of higher education. Experts also opined that the many disabled students, who seek admissions under reserved categories tend to drop out after a few months as they are unable to cope up, as there is a lack of awareness about the facilities"

It has also set aside the previous assumptions of both leaders leveraging equal weightage in ministry allocation.

Thirteen out of 23 ministerial berths were filled by Gehlot loyalists. Many of these have been part of his cabinet during last tenure. As the CM, Gehlot successfully had his right-hand, Shanti Dhariwal inducted into the cabinet who held portfolios of home, local self-government, law, justice, art and culture, urban development and housing during his previous government between 2008 and 2013.

Bulaki Das Kalla, who is six-time MLA and held the portfolios of education, health, welfare, urban development and housing department and general administration in the 1998 cabinet of Ashok Gehlot was inducted in this cabinet.

Similarly, another Gehlot loyalist, Parsadi Lal Meena (Lalsot) who has been elected as an MLA for the sixth time was given berth in the cabinet. Meena was minister in the Gehlot cabinet twice in the past too.

Two prominent Jat leaders - Lalchand Kataria and Vishvendra Singh - who are known Gehlot loyalists, were also given cabinet berths. Ex-Jaipur (rural) MP Kataria was rewarded as before the election he stated that Gehlot should be named as CM face to save the Congress from defeat in the coming election. Even Saleh Mohammad, who had played a crucial role in Congress victory in the Pokhran constituency, was inducted into the cabinet during the expansion.

In order to reward the three-time victory, Govind Singh Dotasara and Arjun Bamania were given cabinet seats in the expansion. These two are also considered close to Ashok Gehlot.

By influencing the cabinet expansion, Gehlot has once again proved that his connections with the party's high command and senior leaders are still intact. It is believed his proximity to Gandhi family has helped him retain his strength within the party.

Meanwhile, Sachin Pilot's loyalist Bhanwar Lal Meghwal, Pratap Singh Khachariyawas and Pramod Jain managed to book a berth in the cabinet. Khachariyawas from Pilot's camp had questioned Gehlot's claim to the post of the chief minister."

A talathi is a low-ranking revenue officer in the state government.

The information came to light during the interrogation of the accused arrested in the case till now and the subsequent probe by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the CID.

On 27 February 2017, the home department of the state issued a circular noting the formation of a subcommittee to conduct an ""in-depth study"" of the bullet train project. The subcommittee, said the circular, would be headed by Fadnavis himself.

More than six months later, On 12 September 2017, the home department issued another circular approving the project. However, an RTI query has now revealed that the subcommittee has not held a single meeting to date, let alone conducting an in-depth study.

Along with Fadnavis, three others on the panel of the subcommittee were Chandrakant Patil (Minister for Revenue, Relief and Rehabilitation, and Public Works), Vinod Tawde (Minister for Education) and Diwakar Raote (Minister for Transport).

Patil did not respond to a message or several phone calls. His associates kept asking this reporter to call later. And there was no response from him till the publishing of the piece.

Raote, in a telephonic interview, passed the buck to Fadnavis and said he has no clue about it.

""I am not looking into the bullet train, the chief minister is,"" he said.

Upon pointing out his name is on the panel, Raote said, ""My name may be there, but I have no clue about it. I don't know what this committee is, and I do not recall attending anything pertaining to it.""

The RTI revelation and Raote's admission suggests the chief minister had no intention of examining the project with sincerity.

RTI activist Jeetendra Ghadge, who had filed the RTI request, said, ""The Maharashtra government has clearly rushed into approving the project under the pressure of the Central Government without even looking at its feasibility or the interests of their own state. It's really shocking that they ignored their own orders to approve such a mega project, which has no practical benefit to Maharashtra, and further, it will add more financial stress to the already loan-burdened state.""

Touted as Narendra Modi's plan to upgrade the infrastructure in India, the 508-kilometre high-speed rail project is estimated at 1.08 lakh crore rupees, with Central Railway footing half of the bill, and the rest of the 50 percent of the expenses to be shared equally between Gujarat and Maharashtra.

However, the clarity ends there.

On 3 January 2017, the transport department of the state home department solicited inputs from others on the bullet train project, in which the planning department said the MoU ""should clarify how the revenue would be shared between Centre, Gujarat and Maharashtra after the project is operational"".

The revenue department had even more pertinent objections. It noted the project is ""likely to make losses, which means one would have to infuse capital repeatedly to keep it afloat"".

""In this regard, it is important to know what the responsibility of the state would be,"" it said, adding, ""There is no information or estimate available regarding how much profit or loss this project would make.""

In conclusion, the revenue department asked to examine how many people go to Ahmedabad for work from Maharashtra currently, in order to establish the benefits for the state.

Yet, in its circular dated 12 September 2017, the Maharashtra government gave a go-ahead to the project with the subcommittee that was formed to look into it not meeting even once.

""It is a known fact that the project will benefit only Gujarat state and the Gujarati population living in Mumbai. Unfortunately, Maharashtra has to bear an equal share of the cost, which is unfair on the Maharashtra state's taxpayers,"" said Ghadge.

The RTI query further revealed that the Ministry of Railways has paid more than Rs 18 crores for undertaking a joint feasibility report of the bullet train project.

Both the states involved in executing the project appear to be circumventing the due process and law.

The farmers that are set to lose their land to the project have opposed the acquisition, claiming the Gujarat government has not followed the due process. According to a Hindustan Times report of October 2018, ""A year after the project was kicked off, only 0.9 hectares of land have been acquired out of the 1,400 hectares needed.""

At this rate, the project is set to miss the completion deadline of 2023.

The representatives of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which is providing 81 per cent of the loan to India for the project, had visited Surat earlier in December.

Khedut Samaj Gujarat president Jayesh Patel told The Indian Express on 9 December, ""We showed all the documents to the JICA officials, including the petitions and affidavits filed by the affected farmers in the High Court....

He added: ""The Gujarat government did not listen to their issues and the declared compensation is so less that with that money they cannot purchase another agricultural land in the nearby area for livelihood. We showed them pictures and newspaper cuttings of the arrest of farmers by the police when the land acquisition officials turned to the fields for measuring land. They (JICA officials) were shocked to find that the government did not hold talks with the affected farmers over land acquisition, and teams were sent directly to the fields for marking the land.""

Days after being sworn in, the newly inducted Ministers are trying hard through their leaders to get plum portfolios. This means those holding more than one portfolio may have to give up the additional ones.

Venugopal and Congress Legislative Party leader Siddaramaiah. ""Through their respective leaders, who have earlier lobbied hard for them to be inducted into the Cabinet, the newly sworn in Ministers are now lobbying for plum portfolios,"" sources said.

More than half a dozen Congress Ministers are currently holding more than one portfolio. This includes K.J. George (Major and Medium Industries, IT and BT, Science and Technology); R.V.

The university has put off opening new departments for the 2019-2020 academic year and has also not been able to renovate several departments in the Central College premises. Worse still, many of the classes have been disrupted as faculty members are juggling between the Central College campus under BCU and Jnanabharathi campus, which comes under the parent Bangalore University.

The instructors reached the venue of the home minister's function and raised slogans against the government, seeking hike in their honorarium and regularisation of their services.

They were, however, pacified by the Union minister, who assured them of looking into their problems after the function.

In his brief address, Singh recalled the valour of Avantibai, who like legendary Rani Laxmi Bai of Jhansi, was fiercely opposed to the Lord Dalhousie's 1848 ""doctrine of lapse"" aimed at arbitrary annexation of Indian kingdoms on death of their rulers without a direct heir.

The minister regretted that not much could be done to commemorate the contribution of the brave sons and daughters like her.

Remember the old adage, ""Rome wasn't built in a day"" and not all successful businesses started as big enterprises. In fact, there are many who start small and face innumerable challenges before finally reaching the stage of stability.

You may have all the passion to be a micro-preneur, setting up your own home-based small business but a lack of skills and strategy can actually prevent you from running a successful business. While some are born with entrepreneurial talent for starting and running businesses, others need to learn the same from scratch. And, apart from skills, there are numerous other approaches and tactics that must be followed for your small business endeavours. Here are a few of them:

1. Invest in your venture and yourself

If you've just started with your initial project and are struggling to get work done due to a lack of the right knowledge, equipment or software, make some investments in all of these as they will be worthwhile in the long run. You must also invest in additional training and education to expand your own skill set. Instead of considering this as an expenditure, look at such investments as crucial assets.

2. Delegate work as much as possible

Just because you are known as a small business entrepreneur, you are not expected to take charge of every task to run the business. There must be tasks that you hate doing, or that take your crucial time away from key areas of your business. You must change your mindset of doing everything on your own and save up on hiring external help. Start by recognising the tasks that can be managed without your help. They could be marketing, accounting, or even administrative tasks. Find someone who can do it for you, which does not mean you need to hire a person on a full-time basis. You can hire marketing consultants and freelancers for such tasks and pay for them accordingly. It will be worth the investment, leaving you with extra time to focus on a lot more.

3. Don the hat of a salesperson

If you are the face of your business and know every detail of it, you can be the best salesperson of your own work. You may dislike the many connotations that this word comes with but you must remember that the success of your business will entirely depend on your level of confidence when you sell it. Don't know how to do it? Attend some sales-specific seminars or webinars to get started.

4. Get out of your comfort zone

There is a common notion that being a micro-preneur is like being your own boss. This means you get to enjoy the luxury of working from home. You are probably minimising your chances of gaining success here. There is a reason why many freelancers work from coffee shops and co-working spaces. This gives them an opportunity to mingle with people from different fields of business and backgrounds that can help in giving you an idea about what's going on in the industry, how are your competitors doing etc. By networking and spending hours outside your home, you also get to know about upcoming trends and technologies and much more. Being surrounded by the external world can actually help you in strategising well for your business to remain competitive so get out of that mind-space that you must always be working from the comfort of your home office.

5. Don't refrain from taking breaks

We agree that you are the key person overseeing every department of your business and can't take the risk of ignoring anything by going on vacations or movies or any other leisure activities. Mind it, taking a break every now and then is yet another way to achieve success, and how? When you are going for a small weekend getaway to the hills or taking the Saturday off to simply spend some time with family, read and play some sport, you are actually rejuvenating your mind and body to think afresh and work with a renewed perspective when you're back. Ignoring the idea of taking breaks will eventually harm your ability to perform well in your business.

6. Work harder to keep existing customers coming back

Getting old customers to keep coming back to you is a far better feeling than having a new one on board. It shows that you are serving them right. So make a resolution to work hard in retaining your customers. After all, a loyal customer base that continues to take your services is crucial to getting a stable business and also important referrals. Let your existing customer base be the best ambassadors for your business."

The year 2018 is ending with the spectacular success of Indian scientists and technologists in space and defence sectors, with a series of high impact missions. But that's not all Indian scientists achieved in 2018. Several scientific developments, new techniques and promising technologies -- in fields ranging from nanotechnology to space weather -- made headlines during the year. Here is a collection of 15 such stories that give a glimpse of important developments reported by Indian scientists during the year.

A gel that can protect farmers from toxic pesticides

Most farmers do not wear any protective gear while spraying chemicals in fields, which often leads to pesticide exposure and toxicity. Scientists at the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Bangalore have developed a protective gel -- poly-Oxime -- that can be applied on the skin and can break down toxic chemicals into safe substances, preventing them from going deep into the skin and organs like the brain and the lungs. The research group plans to develop a mask that can deactivate pesticides.

World's thinnest material with novel technique

Pushing the envelope in nanotechnology, researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar have developed a material that is 100,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. They synthesized a two-dimensional material of just one-nanometer thickness (a human hair is about 80,000 nanometers wide) using Magnesium diboride -- a compound of boron. This is said to be the world's thinnest material. It can find a range of applications - from next-generation batteries to ultraviolet absorbing films.

Gene editing applied to banana genome

Using the gene editing technique -- CRISPR/Cas9 -- researchers at the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute, Mohali have edited the banana genome. This is the first such work in any fruit crop in India. Banana is the fourth most important food crop after wheat, rice and corn in terms of gross value of production. Gene editing could be deployed for improving nutritional quality, agronomically important traits as well as pathogen resistance in banana.

Discoveries to tackle Zika, dengue, JE and chikungunya

The National Brain Research Centre (NBRC) at Manesar has figured out cellular and molecular mechanisms that show how the Zika virus causes microcephaly or small head size in babies. Researchers discovered that envelop protein of zika virus affects proliferation rates of human neural stem cells and promotes premature but faulty neuron formation. Another study led by a scientist at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad has identified a key protein which helps dengue as well as Japanese Encephalitis viruses replication inside human body by inhibiting anti-viral cytokines. This finding could pave way for the development of targeted drugs for dengue and JE. For detecting Chikungunya, a group of researchers from Amity University, Noida, Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi and Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, have developed a biosensor using molybdenum disulphide nanosheets.

Faster diagnostic tests for tuberculosis

Scientists at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi have jointly developed highly sensitive and rapid tests for detection of tuberculosis infection in lungs and surrounding membranes. Unlike current tests that use antibodies for detection of bacterial proteins in sputum samples, new tests use Aptamer Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA) and Electrochemical Sensor (ECS) for detection of a bacterial protein in the sputum.

Arsenic found in Punjab groundwater

Till now arsenic was a major problem in West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Chhattisgarh. It was also known that there is arsenic contamination in groundwater in Punjab. Now a new study done by New Delhi-based TERI School of Advanced Studies has found that that Punjab's floodplains are severely affected by arsenic contamination. In some wells, arsenic levels were found to be 20 to 50 times higher than WHO prescribed limit.

Space weather warning model rules out 'mini ice age'

A team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata have dismissed the speculation that the upcoming sunspot cycle is going to be stronger, based on calculations using a model developed by them. The near-Earth and inter-planetary space environmental conditions and solar radiative forcing of climate over the upcoming sunspot cycle 25 will likely be similar or marginally more extreme relative to what has been observed during the past decade over the current solar cycle. The method makes it possible to make predictions almost a decade before the next sunspot cycle activity peaks in strength.

New tool developed for autism screening

In many cases, autism is misdiagnosed as mental retardation and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Early identification and interventions may help children with autistic disorders. To help this process, scientists at the Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, have developed an Indian tool for screening children for autism. The Chandigarh Autism Screening Instrument (CASI) is designed to help community health workers to carry out initial screening for autism.

Hope for Alzheimer's, Huntington's

Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have figured out the way memory deficit develops in early stages, resulting in Alzheimer's disease. They have found that early breaking down of a protein, fibrillar actin or F-actin, in the brain leads to disruption in communication among nerve cells and consequently memory deficits. This knowledge can be used to develop early diagnosis test in future. In another study done in fruit flies, researchers at Department of Genetics at Delhi University South Campus found that it was possible to restrict the progression of Huntington's disease by increasing insulin signalling in the brain neuronal cells.

Green technique can address Plaster of Paris pollution

A team of scientists at Pune-based National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) has developed a technique that helps recycle Plaster of Paris waste from hospitals in an eco-friendly and economical way. The new technique disinfects waste and converts it into useful products like ammonium sulphate and calcium bicarbonate. The technique can also be used to disintegrate PoP waste from idols immersed in water bodies.

Stone Age tools, genetic studies throw new light on peopling of India

The Stone Age tools discovered in a village near Chennai suggest that a Middle Palaeolithic culture was present in India around 385,000 years ago -- roughly the same time that it is known to have developed in Africa and in Europe. The discovery pushes back the period when populations with a Middle Palaeolithic culture may have inhabited India, and challenges popular theory that the Middle Palaeolithic was brought to India by modern humans dispersing from Africa only around 125,000 years ago or later. In the North, a population genetic study has revealed that the Rors who inhabit modern Haryana came to the Indus Valley when it was flourishing during the Bronze Age and inducted West Eurasian genetic ancestry.

Sikkim gets a real-time landslide warning system

A real-time landslide warning system has been set up in the Sikkim-Darjeeling belt of the north-eastern Himalayas which is highly vulnerable to landslides. The warning system consists of over 200 sensors that can measure geophysical and hydrological parameters like rainfall, pore pressure and seismic activities. The system is capable of warning about 24 hours in advance. It has been deployed by researchers of Kerala-based Amrita University and Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority.

Computing capacity for weather forecasting gets a boost

During the year, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) upgraded its computing capacity for weather forecasting and climate monitoring, taking its total high-performance computing (HPC) power to as high as 6.8 Petaflop. With this, India rose to the fourth position, next only to the United Kingdom, Japan and USA in terms of dedicated capacity for HPC resources for weather and climate propose.

Scientists use silk polymer to develop artificial vertebral disc

Scientists at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati developed a silk-based bioartificial disc that may find use in disc replacement therapy in future. The group has developed a fabrication procedure for a silk-based bioartificial disc adopting a ""directional freezing technique"". The disc mimics internal intricacy of a human disc and its mechanical properties too are similar to those of the native ones. The use of a silk biopolymer to fabricate a biocompatible disc can reduce the cost of artificial discs in future.

Transgenic rice with reduced arsenic accumulation, flowering mustard

To address the problem of arsenic accumulation in rice grains, researchers at Lucknow- based CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute developed transgenic rice by inserting a novel fungal gene, which results in reduced arsenic accumulation in rice grain. They cloned Arsenic methyltransferase (WaarsM) gene from a soil fungus and inserted it into rice genome. In another study, TERI School of Advanced Studies has developed an early flowering transgenic variety of mustard.

In other significant developments, the Department of Science and Technology launched a national mission on Cyber-Physical Systems with an outlay of Rs 3660 crore for five years. The Indian Institute of Astrophysics in Bangalore commissioned India's first robotic telescope to keep an eye on the dynamic cosmos, while the ambitious India Neutrino Observatory (INO) project got a go-ahead from the National Green Tribunal.

FULL TEXT OF THE HIGH COURT ORDER / JUDGMENT

The only issue arising in the aforesaid case is whether there could be a deemed registration under Section 12A of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The question of law framed in the memorandum is as follows:

Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Tribunal is right in law and with jurisdiction in deeming the application as being condoned and in directing the CIT to condone delay and to grant registration under Section 12A of the I.T Act?

2. The learned Standing Counsel, Government of India, (Taxes) points out that there was a detailed consideration in Annexure A as to the respondent being not a charitable trust especially with reference to the clause in the trust deed which enabled collection of fee, deposits, contributions etc., from the students and their parents. Though the trust was essentially for setting up of an educational institution, there was no charity involved is the specific finding. The applicant had constituted a trust in the year 2002, the creation of the deed being on 27.05.2002 and filed an application only on 10.10.2006. There was considerable delay in filing such application and there were not sufficient reasons stated for condoning such delay. Challenging the order of the Tribunal, it is also pointed out that though a period of six months is provided under Section 12AA(2), there is no deeming provision as such in the statute and in such circumstance, there could not be a deemed registration under Section 12A.

3. The learned Counsel appearing for the respondent submits that the very same Commissioner, who filed the appeal has given effect to the order of the Tribunal and in such circumstance, the Income Tax Appeal is infructuous. It is also submitted that the Tribunal had relied on the decision of the Special Bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi reported in [2008] 111 ITD 175 (Delhi) (SB) (Bhagwad Swarup Shri Shri Devraha Baba Memorial Shri Hari Parmarth Dham Trust v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Dehradun) which found the limitation as provided under sub-section (2) of Section 12AA to be a mandatory provision; failure to comply with which would result in there being a deeming registration under the Act. The learned Counsel would also refer to the circular of the CBDT which again mandated that the application should be considered and either allowed or rejected within the period of six months, as provided under Section 12AA. Reliance is placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (2017) 11 SCC 480 (Commissioner of Income-Tax v.

4. The learned Standing Counsel, Government of India(Taxes), in counter has referred to the decision of the Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court reported in [2015] 372 ITR 209 (All)(FB) (Commissioner of Income- Tax v. Muzafar Nagar Development Authority), wherein it is specifically held that there could be no deemed registration merely for reason of non-disposal, within six months, of an application for registration filed under Section 12AA. On a reading of the Full Bench decision, which has a persuasive power and also the decision of the Special Bench of the Tribunal, we are inclined to follow the Full Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court. Without a specific deeming provision there can be no grant of deemed registration under Section 12AA (2002) 9 SCC 1 [Appollo Tyres v. CIT, Kochi]. There can be no fiction created by mere inference, in the absence of a specific provision deeming something to be other than what actually it is. Then, the fact assume significance as to what was the view of the Department insofar as the mandatory provision of consideration of application and an order being issued within a period of six months.

5. It cannot but be noticed that Section 12AA(2) specifically provides that on an application, an order granting or refusing registration shall be passed before the expiry of the six months of the date on which the application was received. We also directed the revenue to produce the files, which are before us. We see from the files that the application was filed on 10.10.2006. A report was called for from the Income-Tax officer which was submitted only on 24.07.2007, after almost nine months. The communication of the Commissioner of Income-Tax based on which such report was made also is seen to be dated 12.01.2006 referred to in the report of the Income-Tax Officer. The Income-Tax Officer has recommended the registration under Section 12AA(2). However an adverse report is seen authored by the Joint Commissioner of Income-Tax dated 31.07.2007 addressed to the Commissioner of Income-Tax. There has been some adjournments later and eventually the order impugned before the Tribunal dated 29.11.2007 was passed. We cannot but notice that there was unreasonable delay insofar as complying with the mandatory provision under Section 12AA(2).

6. In this context, we have to notice the directions of the CBDT issued as Instruction No.16/2015(F.No.197/38/2015-ita-1) DATED 06.11.2015 which we extract hereunder:-

""Sub-section (2) of Section 12AA of the Income-Tax Act, 1961 prescribes that every order granting or refusing registration under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of that section shall be passed before the expiry of six months from the end of the month in which the application was received under clause(a) or clause(aa) of the sub-section (1) thereof. Thus while processing the application under Section 12 AA of the Act, the time limit of six months has to be adhered to by the Commissioner of Income Tax(Exemptions). However, it has been brought to the notice of the Board that the said time limit has not been observed in some cases.

2.The undersigned is directed to convey that the aforesaid time limit of six months is to be strictly followed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) while passing order under section 12AA. The CCIT(Exemptions) may monitor the adherence of prescribed time limit and initiate suitable administrative action in case any laxity in adhering to the same is noticed.""

7. The CBDT has thought it fit, obviously from experience of dealing with delayed applications, that the mandatory provision has to be complied with in letter and spirit. The officers of the Department are necessarily bound by the directions so issued by the CBDT; which in the present case is a reiteration of the mandate statutorily prescribed. In the present case, we see failure to comply with the mandatory provision as provided under section 12AA(2); the circular having come later to the impugned order.

8. The instruction by CBDT gives us a clear picture of how the Board expected the Officers to treat the mandatory provision under section 12AA(2) as being scrupulously relevant and significant insofar as a consideration of an application filed under section 12AA within the time stipulated in sub-section (2). We have to look at the present case also in the light of the Supreme Court decision in (2017) 11 SCC 480. The learned Standing Counsel, Government of India, (Taxes) would take serious objection insofar as pointing out that there is no declaration of law as found in the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and a mere concession made by the learned Counsel appearing for the Department. It cannot be taken as a concession on behalf of the Department or being the opinion of the Department is the argument. It is also urged that this Court should be concerned with the interpretation of the provision to advance the course of law and not a mere concession by a Counsel before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a solitary instance.

9. On a reading of the order passed in (2017) 11 SCC 480, we are not convinced that there was any concession made by the learned Additional Solicitor General who appeared in the matter for the Income-Tax Department. As we discern from the order, the Commissioner of Income-Tax, Kanpur had filed an appeal from the deemed registration granted under Section 12A for reason solely of an application under Section 12AA of the Act having not been acted upon for six months. The appeal arose from the judgment dated 03.04.2008 of the High Court of Judicature, Allahabad. When the matter was considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the Full Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court cited, herein above, by the Revenue was passed and we do not see the said decision having been placed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Rather than a concession, the learned Additional Solicitor General specifically informed the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the only apprehension of the Department was regarding the date on which the said deemed registration, would be effected; whether it is on the date of application or on the expiry of six months. The Civil Appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court was disposed of expressing the apprehension to be unfounded, but all the same clarifying that the registration of the application under Section 12AA would only take effect from the date of expiry of six months from the date of application. The effect of disposal of a Civil Appeal as has been laid down in Kunhayammed v. State of Kerala [(2000)245 ITR 360 (SC)] hence assumes significance. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in 2017(11) SCC 480; in a Civil Appeal, approved the judgment of the Allahabad High Court allowing deemed registration under Section 12AA; but applicable only from the date of expiry of the six month period as mandated in sub-section(2) of Section 12AA. The judgment of the High Court merges in the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The opinion as expressed by the Allahabad High Court, regarding deemed registration under Section 12A for reason only of non consideration of an application under Section 12AA within a period of six months from the date of filing, having not been differed from by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the Civil Appeal; the declaration by the High Court assumes the authority of a precedent by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the principles of doctrine of merger. Despite the compelling persuasion of the learned Senior Counsel to interpret the provision as has been interpreted by the Full Bench of the High Court of Allahabad we find ourselves, incapacitated so to do and obliged to respectfully follow (2017) 11 SCC 480.

In such circumstance, respectfully following the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court we answer the question in favour of the assessee and against the revenue and reject the appeal. The registration however is applicable only from the date of expiry of the six months from the date of application. There shall be no order as to costs."

There is also chances of doing away with the existing restriction in the Post Graduation admissions where reservation exists for home university students. For greater mobility the higher education department may throw open the seats for an uniform admission in PG programs. At the moment, in the state run universities there is 60% reservation in PG courses for students bagging graduation from affiliated colleges and home university while the remaining seats are for outside students who are selected through an admission test.

On Friday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee while speaking at the Pre-Christmas celebrations at St Xavier's College (autonomous) Kolkata appreciated the decision of St Xavier's University to start a law school from the next academic session. CM said, ""Many students have told me that we are studying law but where we will go? I congratulate St Xavier's University on their decision to start a law school from next academic session. I have already spoken with education minister Partha Chatterjee and told him that we must cooperate with each other. There should not be any restriction. I feel that if St Xavier's College students want to get an opportunity to study at Presidency University why should the later not allow that? Or why should Calcutta University not allow someone to study by saying that their standard is very high? Students from St Xavier's University and St Xavier's College should be allowed to go for higher studies to CU, JU as well as they can come to St Xavier's.""

Banerjee added, ""What is the problem? I feel there should be an unity among universities which should be done by bringing a law. I have already discussed the matter with higher education department also. This is becoming a problem. A student may be studying with one subject at a particular college affiliated to an university. But if he or she wants to pursue higher education in a different subject, they should be allowed to do so. As per standard, one should allow such transfer.""

A state university VC said that CBCS once implemented by all universities can only allow such free movement.

CM also enquired from Jadavpur University vice-chancellor Suranjan Das when will the university complete construction of their new campus at New Town on a plot given by the government. Taking a dig at the regular student movement in JU, CM advised the university to have a ""bigger and more open heart"" where everyone should be welcome inside the university. ""In JU even if governor makes a visit, a demonstration starts,"" she said.

Banerjee advised St Xavier's College authorities to start a college at Alipurduar where there is presence of a large section of Christian community seeking higher education."

Libraries are storehouses of knowledge, they support literacy and education and help shape the new ideas that are central to a creative and innovative society. Libraries mould the character of individuals. They give joy and can remove boredom and monotony. Libraries can change lives. Libraries can help to find oneself.

But for the government, MCC and MUDA, libraries come last in terms of priority (for reasons the readers can easily guess) and Rs. 17 crore that these institutions owe to Library Department speaks for itself the sorry state of affairs. With this huge amount not transferred to the Department, how can public libraries manage, keep pace with the digital and new developments and provide quality service? In the West, it's different and public libraries are accorded special status.

It was Nelson Mandela who famously said, ""Destroying any nation does not require the use of atomic bombs or the use of long range missiles. It only requires lowering the quality of education and allowing cheating in the examinations by the students...The collapse of education is the collapse of the nation.""

As the Public Libraries play a significant role in education, the authorities should not only release the dues immediately but also work towards opening four new well-equipped, state-of-the-art libraries in four directions of the city."

The state government, in a GO in July 2018, clearly instructed that a class 10 student should not be asked to carry more than a 5kg school bag. For a class 1 student, the cap was at 1.5kg. Recently, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) released an order on the same lines and directed states to implement it.

Parents said that implementation has always been a problem in the state and added that the state rule or the one passed by the MHRD will not make any impact.

""My sons are studying in class 3 and class 5 in a private school in the city and they are still carrying bags which weigh no less than 8kgs. There has been zero impact at the ground level and most of the schools are still make kids carry a heavy load.

Another parent Uma V, whose son is studying in class 8, said, ""my son's school bag is so heavy that we have to drop him at the school daily despite the school being located at a walkable distance. There is no way he can carry the load."" Parents said that students also have to carry extra weight in the form of skates, yoga mats among other things to pursues cocurricular activities.

Education department officials, on the other hand, have clarified their position. They said that they are conducting random checks to make sure that schools are following the guidelines.

But that's not all Indian scientists achieved in 2018. Several scientific developments, new techniques and promising technologies - in fields ranging from nanotechnology to space weather - made headlines during the year. Here is a collection of 15 such stories that gives a glimpse of important developments reported by Indian scientists during the year.

A gel that can protect farmers from toxic pesticides

Most farmers do not wear any protective gear while spraying chemicals in fields, which often leads to pesticide exposure and toxicity. Scientists at the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Bangalore have developed a protective gel - poly-Oxime - that can be applied on skin and can break down toxic chemicals into safe substances, preventing them from going deep into the skin and organs like the brain and the lungs. The research group plans to develop a mask that can deactivate pesticides.

World's thinnest material with novel technique

Pushing the envelope in nanotechnology, researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar have developed a material that is 100,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. They synthesized a two-dimensional material of just one-nanometer thickness (a human hair is about 80,000 nanometer wide) using Magnesium diboride - a compound of boron. This is said to be the world's thinnest material. It can find a range of applications - from next-generation batteries to ultraviolet absorbing films.

Using the gene editing technique - CRISPR/Cas9 - researchers at the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute, Mohali have edited the banana genome. This is the first such work in any fruit crop in India. Banana is a the fourth most important food crop after wheat, rice and corn in terms of gross value of production. Gene editing could be deployed for improving nutritional quality, agronomical important traits as well as pathogen resistance in banana.

Discoveries to tackle Zika, dengue, JE and chikungunya

The National Brain Research Centre (NBRC) at Manesar has figured out cellular and molecular mechanisms that show how Zika virus causes microcephaly or small head size in babies. Researchers discovered that envelop protein of zika virus affects proliferation rates of human neural stem cells and promotes premature but faulty neuron formation. Another study led by scientist at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad has identified a key protein which helps dengue as well as Japanese Encephalitis viruses replication inside human body by inhibiting anti-viral cytokines. This finding could pave way for development of targeted drugs for dengue and JE. For detecting Chikungunya, a group of researchers from Amity University, Noida, Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi and Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, have developed a biosensor using molybdenum disulphide nanosheets.

Faster diagnostic tests for tuberculosis

Scientists at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi have jointly developed highly sensitive and rapid tests for detection of tuberculosis infection in lungs and surrounding membranes. Unlike current tests that use antibodies for detection of bacterial proteins in sputum samples, new tests use Aptamer Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA) and Electrochemical Sensor (ECS) for detection of a bacterial protein in the sputum.

Arsenic found in Punjab groundwater

Till now arsenic was a major problem in West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Chhattisgarh. It was also known that there is arsenic contamination in groundwater in Punjab. Now a new study done by New Delhi-based TERI School of Advanced Studies has found that that Punjab's floodplains are severely affected by arsenic contamination. In some wells, arsenic levels were found to be 20 to 50 times higher than WHO prescribed limit.

Space weather warning model rules out 'mini ice age'

A team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata have dismissed the speculation that the upcoming sunspot cycle is going to be stronger, based on calculations using a model developed by them. The near-Earth and inter-planetary space environmental conditions and solar radiative forcing of climate over the upcoming sunspot cycle 25 will likely be similar or marginally more extreme relative to what has been observed during the past decade over the current solar cycle. The method makes it possible to make predictions almost a decade before the next sunspot cycle activity peaks in strength.

New tool developed for autism screening

In many cases, autism is misdiagnosed as mental retardation and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Early identification and interventions may help children with autistic disorders. To help this process, scientists at the Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, have developed an Indian tool for screening children for autism. The Chandigarh Autism Screening Instrument (CASI is designed to help community health workers to carry out initial screening for autism.

Hope for Alzheimer's, Huntington's

Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have figured out the way memory deficit develops in early stages, resulting in Alzheimer's disease. They have found that early breaking down of a protein, fibrillar actin or F-actin, in the brain leads to disruption in communication among nerve cells and consequently memory deficits. This knowledge can be used to develop early diagnosis test in future. In another study done in fruit flies, researchers at Department of Genetics at Delhi University South Campus found that it was possible to restrict the progression of Huntington's disease by increasing insulin signaling in the brain neuronal cells.

Green technique can address Plaster of Paris pollution

A team of scientists at Pune-based National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) has developed a technique that helps recycle Plaster of Paris waste from hospitals in an eco-friendly and economical way. The new technique disinfects waste and converts it into useful products like ammonium sulphate and calcium bicarbonate. The technique can also be used to disintegrate PoP waste from idols immersed in water bodies.

Stone Age tools, genetic studies throw new light on peopling of India

The Stone Age tools discovered in a village near Chennai suggest that a Middle Palaeolithic culture was present in India around 385,000 years ago -- roughly the same time that it is known to have developed in Africa and in Europe. The discovery pushes back the period when populations with a Middle Palaeolithic culture may have inhabited India, and challenges popular theory that the Middle Palaeolithic was brought to India by modern humans dispersing from Africa only around 125,000 years ago or later. In the North, a population genetic study has revealed that the Rors who inhabit modern Haryana came to the Indus Valley when it was flourishing during the Bronze Age and inducted West Eurasian genetic ancestry.

Sikkim gets real-time landslide warning system

A real-time landslide warning system has been set up in the Sikkim-Darjeeling belt of north-eastern Himalayas which is highly vulnerable to landslides. The warning system consists of over 200 sensors that can measure geophysical and hydrological parameters like rainfall, pore pressure and seismic activities. The system is capable of warning about 24 hours in advance. It has been deployed by researchers of Kerala-based Amrita University and Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority.

Computing capacity for weather forecasting gets a boost

During the year, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) upgraded its computing capacity for weather forecasting and climate monitoring, taking its total high performance computing (HPC) power to as high as 6.8 Petaflop. With this, India rose to the fourth position, next only to United Kingdom, Japan and USA in terms of dedicated capacity for HPC resources for weather and climate proposes.

Scientists use silk polymer to develop artificial vertebral disc

Scientists at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati developed a silk-based bioartificial disc that may find use in disc replacement therapy in future. The group has developed a fabrication procedure for a silk-based bioartificial disc adopting a ""directional freezing technique"". The disc mimics internal intricacy of human disc and its mechanical properties too are similar to those of the native ones. The use of a silk biopolymer to fabricate a biocompatible disc can reduce the cost of artificial discs in future.

Transgenic rice with reduced arsenic accumulation, flowering mustard

To address the problem of arsenic accumulation in rice grains, researchers at Lucknow- based CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute developed transgenic rice by inserting a novel fungal gene, which results in reduced arsenic accumulation in rice grain. They cloned Arsenic methyltransferase (WaarsM) gene from a soil fungus and inserted it into rice genome. In another study, TERI School of Advanced Studies has developed an early flowering transgenic variety of mustard.

In other significant developments, the Department of Science and Technology launched a national mission on Cyber-Physical Systems with an outlay of Rs 3660 crore for five years. The Indian Institute of Astrophysics in Bangalore commissioned India's first robotic telescope to keep an eye on the dynamic cosmos, while the ambitious India Neutrino Observatory (INO) project got a go ahead from the National Green Tribunal."

The forest officials explained the students about the importance of forest and how it is responsible for rainfall. Students were shown different plants and taught about its importance. The forest officials also screened a documentary on Eturnagaram wildlife sanctuary.

""We are organising these visits so that students have a first hand experience and show concern for nature,"" said Bhupalpally district forest officer SV Pradeep Kumar Shetty. The students trekked long distances to see the facilities that forest officials have provided for wild animals. They learnt about tiger trenches and saucer pits.

Even the giant teddy bear at the mall entrance wasn't spared, said Ma Jun, who works at a tutoring company in the building.

""Everything is gone and cleaned,"" she said.

Christmas continues to be a shopping festival across most of China, with huge trees adorning shopping malls in Shanghai and Beijing, but a growing emphasis on traditional culture by the ruling Communist Party and the systematic suppression of religion under President Xi Jinping are imperiling Santa Claus's position.

At least four Chinese cities and one county have ordered restrictions on Christmas celebrations this year, according to official notices and interviews. Students, teachers and parents from 10 schools around China said Christmas celebrations have been curtailed.

""The ongoing local reaction against Christmas is part of the wider sentiment since Xi took power,"" said Zi Yang, a China expert at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

Xi is trying to broaden the appeal of the Communist Party by casting it as a crusader for Chinese tradition in a fast-changing world, he said. ""Therefore, foreign cultural elements such as Christmas are placed on the chopping block.""

The seasonal humbug follows similar outbreaks of anti-Christmas rhetoric in 2014 and 2017. It appears not to be centrally organised, but rather a spreading resistance to foreign festivals by local authorities seeking to align themselves with the growing tide of cultural nationalism.

The squeeze on Christmas is an example of how efforts to ""normalise"" thinking bleed into the everyday lives of many Chinese. That push exploded into view this year through re-education camps for Uighur Muslims and a crackdown on Christian churches that has continued with force in recent weeks.

In Nanyang, about 950 kilometers (600 miles) west of Shanghai, government officials stopped by the office and shopping complex on 16 December to say that Christmas decorations would have to come down, said Ma, the tutoring company employee.

An official from the city's urban management bureau hung up when asked for comment.

Nine hours by car south, Hengyang, a city in Hunan province, said in a 19 December notice posted on an official government social media account that anyone caught holding Christmas sales or celebrations that blocked the streets would be punished. Communist Party members, the notice said, should avoid foreign festivals and instead be ""models of adherence to Chinese traditional culture."" Hengyang police posted a video on their official social media account of locals discussing the importance of Chinese culture and plans to avoid ostentatious Christmas celebrations.

Langfang city, just south of Beijing, banned Christmas stage performances and merchandising promotions, according to a notice circulated on social media.

Shop windows were to be stripped of Christmas stickers and streets kept free of Christmas banners and lights. Law enforcement patrols were to be stepped up 23-25 December to prevent illegal signs of celebration.

The Langfang urban management bureau declined comment. The state-run Global Times newspaper argued that Western media are exaggerating China's crackdown on Christmas and reported that the restrictions in Langfang were aimed not at Christmas but at cleaning up roadside stalls and migrant vendors in hopes of winning a ""National Civilized City"" award from the Communist Party.

Some 270 kilometers (167 miles) west, Fuping county, also in Hebei province, issued a similar clean-up notice. Though the 21 December announcement mentions Christmas eleven times, an official from the Fuping urban management bureau said the rules were aimed at street vendors generally, not Christmas.

Police in the Panlong district of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province in southern China, circulated a notice that hotels, karaoke parlors, internet cafes, bars and other crowded places must prohibit Christmas-related decorations and activities.

""It is forbidden to hang Christmas stockings, wear Christmas hats, place Christmas trees, and so on,"" the notice read.

It wasn't clear if the notice applied to all of Kunming city, though a police officer told the AP that the order to circulate it came from city officials.

Reverend Jonathan Liu, founder of the Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, a California nonprofit, said the pushback against Christmas reflects Xi's efforts to ""Sinicize"" religion.

Preachers are coached on how to convey Communist Party core values in their sermons and national flags and songs have been injected into some church services, he said.

Liu provided the AP with a notice sent to churches in Zhoukou, a city to the east of Nanyang in Henan province.

It tells churches to vet Christmas plans with the government, forbids minors from participating in Christmas events and caps expenses at 2000 yuan ($290). ""I wish you all a happy Christmas! God bless you,"" read the notice, which Liu received from a pastor in China.

An official at the United Front Work Department in Zhoukou referred queries to the religious affairs bureau, which could not be reached for comment.

Before becoming president, Xi went to Finland in 2010 and was photographed with Santa Claus. That kind of chumminess appears to be a thing of Christmas past, experts say.

The central government issued guidelines last year for a cultural revival project that calls for a marked boost in the international influence of Chinese traditional culture by 2025.

""You have a culturally conservative ethos in the country that has definitely been encouraged by the central party-state,"" said Guo Yingjie, a professor of Chinese studies at the University of Sydney. ""It's not hard for university presidents or officials to say, 'OK celebrating Christmas can easily be seen as de-Sinification or promoting Western culture.'""

Students have taken to social media to complain about restrictions on Christmas celebrations at their schools.

At a top Shanghai university, a student union had its Christmas plans cancelled for the first time, an organizer told the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing rebuke.

The students came up with a solution: By replacing ""Christmas"" with ""New Year's"" in their activity proposal and changing the date from 25 December, it sailed past school administrators.

Students in the city of Qingdao were reprimanded for hosting an event about gratitude on Thanksgiving Day and warned not to celebrate Christmas publicly, according to a student, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution.

Liu Kaiming, president of the Institute of Contemporary Observation, a civil society group in the city of Shenzhen, said that despite the drumbeat of official discontent, Christmas cheer continues to spread in China.

""The sound of resistance is more powerful on the surface, but it has no practical effect,"" he said. ""Young people's enthusiasm for the festival is ever-increasing.""

The new regulations, once implemented, will make it mandatory for them to resolve complaints by students within 15 days of receiving them. The latest draft of UGC (Grievance Redressal) Regulations 2018 has now been put online for feedback from the public.

According to the existing system which follows UGC (Grievance Redressal) Regulations 2012, all higher education institutes are required to appoint an ombudsman for redressing grievances of students. But, according to complaints received by UGC, most institutes either do not have an ombudsman or if they have, they are appointed against the eligibility criteria.

""No university has an ombudsman as mandated by UGC. However, most of them have their own grievance redressal cells,"" said Mangat Sharma, principal secretary, Higher Education Department. He said the State government has approached the Vice-Chancellors of reputed universities to formulate feedback, that will be submitted through the State government.

""We have our own grievance redressal unit. There are different committees, each that handle sexual harassment, ragging and other kinds of issues. We also have a dean of students and dean of faculty, in order to channelise grievances,"" said a senior official from Anna University. He, however, refused to comment on the varsity's stance on the draft regulations.

However, much to the relief of higher education institutions, UGC has done away with the most controversial aspect of the regulation that the ombudsman has to be a retired district judge or above in rank. The latest draft policy advocates that this person now can be a retired VC or registrar or a faculty with 10 years of experience as professor. The norms also say there would be four-level grievance redressal panels.

Students can use the regulations to flag a variety of issues, including irregularity in admission process, non-publication of prospectus or furnishing false, misleading information in prospectus, withholding certificates and documents of students, demanding money in excess of what is prescribed in prospectus, non-payment or delayed payment of scholarship, breach of reservation policy, delay in conducting examination or publishing result and unfair evaluation practices.

As many as 65 top US universities, including Harvard and MIT, have challenged the Trump administration in a court against its new stringent visa policy for foreign students, warning that the new 'backdating' rule will have a detrimental effect on America's higher education system.

The new policy announced by the Trump administration in August places restrictions on overstaying a visa.

Under longstanding immigration policies, when an individual is no longer authorised to remain in the US such as when a visa expires a period of ""unlawful presence"" begins. After six months of unlawful presence, an individual can be forced to return to their country of origin and subject to a three year bar from the US.

Prior to the August policy change, individuals only began to accrue unlawful presence the day after the government issued an official determination that the visa holder was ""out of status"".

With the new rules, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can set retroactive start dates for unlawful presence that begin the day after an individual's degree programme is complete or the day after a person's visa expires.

The top institutions, including Harvard, MIT, Cornell, Yale, and Princeton signed onto an amicus brief filed Monday, arguing that the new rule puts visa-holding students in a position to make ""tough choices"".

These institutions argue that the new policy's use of a ""backdated unlawful-presence clock"" will render tens of thousands of F, J and M categories of visa holders subject to three and 10-year re-entry bars without any opportunity to cure.

According to the National Association of Foreign Student Advisors (NAFSA), international students contributed USD 39 billion to the US economy during the 2017-2018 academic year.

The same study found the economic activity of foreign students supported over 455,000 American jobs.

The 65 institutions and one higher education system Board, mostly member institutions of the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, signed the brief which urges the federal court to grant them motion for a preliminary injunction.

The brief explains that the new 'backdating' rule introduces considerable uncertainty into the calculation of unlawful presence and needlessly exposes international students to devastating reentry bans.

""The new rule will harm international students and scholars, as well as institutions which host them,"" it said.

It notes the new backdating rule by US Citizenship and Immigration Services will likely result in fewer international students, scholars and instructors contributing to the communities.

The brief supports Guilford College, et al in its lawsuit against US Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M Nielsen et al. It was filed in the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.

""International students and scholars are vital members of our campus communities and important contributors to our nation,"" said John J DeGioia, Georgetown University President and Presidents' Alliance Steering Committee Member.

""The talents, perspectives, insights and passion to serve our world that they bring our campus communities benefits our nation and contributes to the common good that we all share,"" he said.

The brief argues that a 10 per cent rise in the ratio of foreign graduate students to total graduate students results in a 5.1 per cent increase in patent grants.

International students and scholars also continue to contribute to the US economy beyond their periods of enrolment.

For example, in a study of American startup companies valued at USD 1 billion or more, it was found that nearly one quarter of such businesses had a founder who first came to the United States as an international student, it said.

The backdating rule introduces significant uncertainty and punishes students for reasons that are frequently beyond the students' control.

In some cases, students and exchange visitors can fall out-of-status due to unwitting clerical and technical errors, often of someone else's making, the brief said.

In many cases, the infraction will not be discovered (or determined, as the F, M, and J regulations are not always clear and may be subject to varying interpretations) until the individual reapplies for another immigration benefit, such as an optional practical training allowance or an H-1B visa, it said.

""A ban, in turn, could have devastating immediate consequences for a student's course of study and would outright bar the student from reentering the US for any reason even for business purposes, or to see a child for a period of year,"" the brief said, adding that the new rule will diminish US' ability to compete for international students and scholars.

This decline in international student enrolment and in engagement with international researchers and professors will have a detrimental effect on the system of higher education in the United States.

""As of today international students continue to make this country the global leader in higher education, but the gap is closing. The United States' 'market share has dropped from 23 per cent in 2000 to 16 per cent in 2012' with China, Canada, Britain and Russia all vying for the same pool of talent,"" it said."

The administrative work of the school is managed by a teacher as it doesn't have a principal. The former principal passed away in 2017 and no appointment was made since then.

This is one among several schools in the state that are struggling without basic necessities.

State education minister Arvind Pandey has been pushing for better facilities for students in government schools, but they are still a distant dream for many schools in the state.

According to the education department data for 2017-2018, out of 1,412 schools in Dehradun, 649 schools do not have a playground, 329 schools do not have ramp facilities or boundary walls, and fencing is missing in 117 schools.

Sunita Rawat, the teacher in charge of the primary school in Raipur, said: ""We got ~50,000 from the department this month and we will use it to repair the floors and toilets. We never had furniture in the school and students have been sitting on mats only.""

She also added that even the neighbouring schools don't have such facilities and they ""never asked the department especially for furniture"".

Another teacher said on condition of anonymity: ""We requested the department to release funds for repairing the boundary wall many times as it is a worry if any child sneaks out through the broken part of the wall.""

SB Joshi, chief education officer of Dehradun, said: ""There are over 1,000 schools in the district and we are trying to provide furniture to all. Till then, jute mats and carpets are provided for students to sit on.""

The department of school education sanctioned Rs 10 crore in November to all 13 districts for buying furniture for government schools.

On December 20, DoE had issued the fourth circular to invite applications for such seats from December 22.

In the meanwhile, admissions for entry-level classes for the 2019-20 session for general category seats have already begun and the process for reserved seats is set to start by the first week of January.

Following a Delhi high court order, DoE had in July notified 3% reservation for CWSN within the 25% seats reserved for the economically weaker sections in compliance with provisions of Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016.

When the first online application was invited, DoE received just 46 applications (3%) for the vacant CWSN seats. The draw of lots was subsequently postponed on account of such low applications. In the second round held in September, DoE finally conducted the draw of lots and admitted 17 students. A fourth circular was finally issued on December 20 to call for fresh applications.

""Despite inviting online applications, 1,268 seats are still vacant. Hence, the department has decided to call for fresh applications from aspirants with disabilities as defined in RPWD Act, 2016 against these reserved available seats,"" said the DoE order.

The details of the schools where seats are vacant were notified by DoE on December 22 and the applications can be filled till December 24. The draw of lots is likely to be held on December 26.

The official document accessed by TOI mentions that skewed admissions have taken place because ""schools are hesitant in accepting"" such students. The district deputy education (DDE) officers have been asked to ensure that no children with special needs are turned away.

Disability rights activists said that schools have been denying admissions as they don't have the requisite facilities to make CWSN students inclusive.

Abha Khetarpal, a counsellor and disability rights activist, said, ""The 3% quota is complete eyewash as the authorities don't check on the schools. The CBSE checklist for schools to become inclusive includes facilities like accessible washrooms, smart boards, etc, but schools don't abide by the norms. There is no mechanism to take action on violations. Moreover, the special educators are not qualified. They are not even equipped to handle a child with epilepsy.""

The PIL for reservation of CWSN was filed in 2014 by the father of a child with special needs. In his plea, he had claimed that the guidelines under Right to Education (RTE) Act completely ignore the interests of children with special needs and disabilities."

Javadekar during the inauguration of the Malpani Foundation's Dhruv Global School at Nande village near Pune, said, ""This year, we are reducing the syllabus by 10% and by 20% the following year, so that kids can get the required time for experiential learning, sports and life skills.""

Javadekar said that there is a need for equal focus on experiential learning, sports, physical education and life skills education for the holistic development of the child. ""We are trying to reduce the burden of the classroom syllabus in a phased manner to facilitate this thought,"" said the minister.

Javadekar also stressed that activities that are termed as extracurricular should have equal importance as classroom learning.

The minister said that the public and private sectors both have an equally important role to play when it comes to education. He sought an example of a cleanliness competition that was held last year, which was initially restricted to only state-run schools and thus, saw participation of only 2.5 lakh schools. However, this year when the competition was opened to private schools, the figure of participating schools reached 6.5 lakh. This is the benefit of taking both the sectors together, he said.

In India, about 26 crore children are taking school education, of which 13 crore are taking it from the state or central government schools. This shows us that the number of children in non-governmental schools is equally big, he added."

As many as 65 top US universities, including Harvard and MIT, have challenged the Trump administration in a court against its new stringent visa policy for foreign students, warning that the new 'backdating' rule will have a detrimental effect on America's higher education system.

The new policy announced by the Trump administration in August places restrictions on overstaying a visa.

Under longstanding immigration policies, when an individual is no longer authorised to remain in the US -- such as when a visa expires -- a period of 'unlawful presence' begins. After six months of unlawful presence, an individual can be forced to return to their country of origin and subject to a three year bar from the US.

Prior to the August policy change, individuals only began to accrue unlawful presence the day after the government issued an official determination that the visa holder was ""out of status"".

With the new rules, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can set retroactive start dates for unlawful presence that begin the day after an individual's degree programme is complete or the day after a person's visa expires.

The top institutions, including Harvard, MIT, Cornell, Yale, and Princeton signed onto an amicus brief filed on December 23, arguing that the new rule puts visa-holding students in a position to make ""tough choices"". These institutions argue that the new policy's use of a ""backdated unlawful-presence clock"" will render tens of thousands of F, J and M categories of visa holders subject to three and 10-year re-entry bars without any opportunity to cure.

According to the National Association of Foreign Student Advisors (NAFSA), international students contributed $39 billion to the US economy during the 2017-2018 academic year. The same study found the economic activity of foreign students supported over 455,000 American jobs.

The 65 institutions, one higher education system board, mostly member institutions of the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, signed the brief which urges the federal court to grant them motion for a preliminary injunction.

The brief explains that the new 'backdating' rule introduces considerable uncertainty into the calculation of unlawful presence and needlessly exposes international students to devastating re-entry bans. ""The new rule will harm international students and scholars, as well as institutions which host them,"" it said.

It notes the new backdating rule by US Citizenship and Immigration Services will likely result in fewer international students, scholars and instructors contributing to the communities. The brief supports Guilford College, et al., in its lawsuit against US Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M. Nielsen et al. It was filed in the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.

""International students and scholars are vital members of our campus communities and important contributors to our nation,"" said John J. DeGioia, Georgetown University President and Presidents' Alliance Steering Committee Member. ""The talents, perspectives, insights and passion to serve our world that they bring our campus communities benefits our nation and contributes to the common good that we all share.""

The brief argues that a 10% rise in the ratio of foreign graduate students to total graduate students results in a 5.1% increase in patent grants. International students and scholars also continue to contribute to the US economy beyond their periods of enrolment.

The backdating rule introduces significant uncertainty and punishes students for reasons that are frequently beyond the students' control. In some cases, students and exchange visitors can fall out-of-status due to unwitting clerical and technical errors, often of someone else's making, the brief said.

In many cases, the infraction will not be discovered (or determined, as the F, M, and J regulations are not always clear and may be subject to varying interpretations) until the individual reapplies for another immigration benefit, such as an optional practical training allowance or an H-1B visa, it said.

""A ban, in turn, could have devastating immediate consequences for a student's course of study and would outright bar the student from reentering the US for any reason -- even for business purposes, or to see a child -- for a period of year,"" the brief said, adding that the new rule will diminish US' ability to compete for international students and scholars.

""As of today international students continue to make this country the global leader in higher education, but the gap is closing. The United States' 'market share has dropped from 23 % in 2000 to 16 % in 2012' with China, Canada, Britain and Russia all vying for the same pool of talent,"" it said."

December 25 is being observed as the Good Governance Day to honour former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, as the late BJP leader was born on this day in 1924.

Yogi Adityanath government is all set to celebrate the 95th birth anniversary of the late Prime Minister. Reportedly, photos of these competitions will also be displayed at the main programme to be held at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Scientific Convention Centre in Lucknow on Tuesday.

On December 25, a two-hour play, 'Rashtra Purush Atal', will be staged by a 200-strong group from Maharashtra. A 'Kavi Sammelan' has been scheduled for the next day.

Soon after coming to power, the NDA government had declared that the birthday of its tallest leader will be observed as Good Governance Day. He was also conferred with India's highest civilian award, Bharat Ratna by the Modi government.

According to a report by The Indian Express, between December 23 and 26, the culture department of UP has lined up a series of programmes that are being organised in coordination with other departments like higher education, secondary education, tourism, information, language and Ayodhya Shodh Sansthan. A meeting was called on December 11, where representatives from all the departments were present. The government has also directed to engage National Service Scheme volunteers in these programmes.

The tourism department has been tasked to make a documentary on three places associated with Vajpayee: Lucknow, Balrampur, and Bateshwar (Agra). While Vajpayee had won his first election from in 1957 from Balrampur, Bateshwar in Agra is Vajpayee's ancestral village. Vajpayee was MP from 2004 to 2009 from Lucknow.

The Yogi Adityanath administration is also planning to install a statue of Vajpayee inside the secretariat of the state government in Lucknow. Recently, the government had renamed Ekana stadium in Lucknow after Vajpayee. It has also proposed to name the Bundelkhand expressway as 'Atal Path'.

Meanwhile, as the day is a national holiday for Christmas, Good Governance Day had to face opposition from several leaders in previous years. In 2016, Nagaland Chief Minister T R Zeliang, said that observing 'Good Governance Day' on December 25 would deeply hurt the religious sentiments of Christians as it coincides with Christmas. Reportedly, in the same year, CMs of northeastern states had opposed the decision in a meeting with the Prime Minister on the ground that the day is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus Christ.

Zeliang had pointed out that the central government has been continuously observing Christmas as a national holiday ever since India's Independence and even before that. Zeliang had said the 'Good Governance Day' could be observed on some other more convenient date, so as not to hurt the sentiments of the minority Christian community in India."

""The ongoing local reaction against Christmas is part of the wider sentiment since Xi took power,"" said Zi Yang, a China expert at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

Xi is trying to broaden the appeal of the Communist Party by casting it as a crusader for Chinese tradition in a fast-changing world, he said. ""Therefore, foreign cultural elements such as Christmas are placed on the chopping block.""

The seasonal humbug follows similar outbreaks of anti-Christmas rhetoric in 2014 and 2017. It appears not to be centrally organised, but rather a spreading resistance to foreign festivals by local authorities seeking to align themselves with the growing tide of cultural nationalism.

The squeeze on Christmas is an example of how efforts to ""normalise"" thinking bleed into the everyday lives of many Chinese. That push exploded into view this year through re-education camps for Uighur Muslims and a crackdown on Christian churches that has continued with force in recent weeks.

In Nanyang, about 950 kilometers west of Shanghai, government officials stopped by the office and shopping complex on December 16 to say that Christmas decorations would have to come down, said Ma, the tutoring company employee.

An official from the city's urban management bureau hung up when asked for comment.

Nine hours by car south, Hengyang, a city in Hunan province, said in a December 19 notice posted on an official government social media account that anyone caught holding Christmas sales or celebrations that blocked the streets would be punished.

Communist Party members, the notice said, should avoid foreign festivals and instead be ""models of adherence to Chinese traditional culture."" Hengyang police posted a video on their official social media account of locals discussing the importance of Chinese culture and plans to avoid ostentatious Christmas celebrations.

Langfang city, just south of Beijing, banned Christmas stage performances and merchandising promotions, according to a notice circulated on social media.

Shop windows were to be stripped of Christmas stickers and streets kept free of Christmas banners and lights. Law enforcement patrols were to be stepped up Dec. 23-25 to prevent illegal signs of celebration.

The Langfang urban management bureau declined comment. The state-run Global Times newspaper argued that Western media are exaggerating China's crackdown on Christmas and reported that the restrictions in Langfang were aimed not at Christmas but at cleaning up roadside stalls and migrant vendors in hopes of winning a ""National Civilized City"" award from the Communist Party.

Some 270 kilometers west, Fuping county, also in Hebei province, issued a similar clean-up notice. Though the December 21 announcement mentions Christmas eleven times, an official from the Fuping urban management bureau said the rules were aimed at street vendors generally, not Christmas.

Police in the Panlong district of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province in southern China, circulated a notice that hotels, karaoke parlors, internet cafes, bars and other crowded places must prohibit Christmas-related decorations and activities.

""It is forbidden to hang Christmas stockings, wear Christmas hats, place Christmas trees, and so on,"" the notice read.

It wasn't clear if the notice applied to all of Kunming city, though a police officer told the AP that the order to circulate it came from city officials. Reverend Jonathan Liu, founder of the Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, a California nonprofit, said the pushback against Christmas reflects Xi's efforts to ""Sinicize"" religion.

Preachers are coached on how to convey Communist Party core values in their sermons and national flags and songs have been injected into some church services, he said.

Liu provided the AP with a notice sent to churches in Zhoukou, a city to the east of Nanyang in Henan province.

It tells churches to vet Christmas plans with the government, forbids minors from participating in Christmas events and caps expenses at 2000 yuan (USD 290). ""I wish you all a happy Christmas! God bless you,"" read the notice, which Liu received from a pastor in China.

An official at the United Front Work Department in Zhoukou referred queries to the religious affairs bureau, which could not be reached for comment.

Before becoming president, Xi went to Finland in 2010 and was photographed with Santa Claus. That kind of chumminess appears to be a thing of Christmas past, experts say.

The central government issued guidelines last year for a cultural revival project that calls for a marked boost in the international influence of Chinese traditional culture by 2025.

Health News, Nation, (New Delhi), December 24:-Physiotherapists at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) may soon be providing robot-assisted physical therapy to patients.

The physiotherapy department of the institute is soon going to procure this new technology for the early rehabilitation of patients. This announcement was made on Sunday on the concluding day of the seventh International Conference of Physical Therapy AIIMS 2018.

Attended by more than 600 delegates from different parts of India and abroad, the two-day conference was inaugurated by Minister of State for Health Ashwini Kumar Choubey on Saturday.

The participating dignitaries said the role of physiotherapists would be well defined under Ayushman Bharat as it is an integral part of the government's wellness programme.

Choubey said the government will soon pass the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 and appealed the opposition to support it as the act would benefit lakhs of Indians.

Nirmal Kumar, organising secretary, said, ""With India's ever-growing aging population, it is inevitable for the physiotherapists to keep themselves abreast of latest trends and innovation while working with healthcare professionals and patients to provide best treatment for early rehabilitation.""

The aim of the conference was to stimulate collaboration between clinicians and academicians. Interactive scientific programmes and hands on workshops were conducted by renowned faculties from various fields of physiotherapy.

""The inclusion of robots in ICU's is set to be a game-changer especially for early rehabilitation of both upper and lower limbs of the patients,"" said Dr Prabhat Ranjan, senior physiotherapist, department of neurology, AIIMS.

He said people suffering from the after-effects of strokes, spinal cord injuries, trauma and other neurological and orthopaedic conditions would really benefit from the new technology and it will surely improve their physical, mental and sensory functions.

In developed countries, robotics is the latest tools in physical therapy and rehabilitation, Ranjan said.

Physiotherapists are quite upbeat after the cabinet approved the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 that seeks to regulate and standardise education, training and services of healthcare professionals including physiotherapists, he said.

Dr Sanjiv K Jha, president of Indian Association of Physiotherapists, said, ""The bill when it comes in force will regularise the system of registration, recognition, standard, quality of education in physiotherapy and will be able to check the unprofessional practice/quackery in physiotherapy by untrained professional.""

It tells churches to vet Christmas plans with the government, forbids minors from participating in Christmas events and caps expenses at 2000 yuan (USD 290). ""I wish you all a happy Christmas! God bless you,"" read the notice, which Liu received from a pastor in China.

An official at the United Front Work Department in Zhoukou referred queries to the religious affairs bureau, which could not be reached for comment.

Before becoming president, Xi went to Finland in 2010 and was photographed with Santa Claus. That kind of chumminess appears to be a thing of Christmas past, experts say.

As many as 65 top US universities, including Harvard and MIT, have challenged the Trump administration in a court against its new stringent visa policy for foreign students, warning that the new 'backdating' rule will have a detrimental effect on America's higher education system. The new policy announced by the Trump administration in August places restrictions on overstaying a visa. Under longstanding immigration policies, when an individual is no longer authorised to remain in the US -- such as when a visa expires -- a period of ""unlawful presence"" begins.

After six months of unlawful presence, an individual can be forced to return to their country of origin and subject to a three year bar from the US. Prior to the August policy change, individuals only began to accrue unlawful presence the day after the government issued an official determination that the visa holder was ""out of status"". With the new rules, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can set retroactive start dates for unlawful presence that begin the day after an individual's degree programme is complete or the day after a person's visa expires.

The top institutions, including Harvard, MIT, Cornell, Yale, and Princeton signed onto an amicus brief filed Monday, arguing that the new rule puts visa-holding students in a position to make ""tough choices"". These institutions argue that the new policy's use of a ""backdated unlawful-presence clock"" will render tens of thousands of F, J and M categories of visa holders subject to three and 10-year re-entry bars without any opportunity to cure. According to the National Association of Foreign Student Advisors (NAFSA), international students contributed USD 39 billion to the US economy during the 2017-2018 academic year. The same study found the economic activity of foreign students supported over 455,000 American jobs.

The 65 institutions and one higher education system Board, mostly member institutions of the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, signed the brief which urges the federal court to grant them motion for a preliminary injunction. The brief explains that the new 'backdating' rule introduces considerable uncertainty into the calculation of unlawful presence and needlessly exposes international students to devastating reentry bans. ""The new rule will harm international students and scholars, as well as institutions which host them,"" it said.

It notes the new backdating rule by US Citizenship and Immigration Services will likely result in fewer international students, scholars and instructors contributing to the communities. The brief supports Guilford College, et al in its lawsuit against US Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M Nielsen et al. It was filed in the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. ""International students and scholars are vital members of our campus communities and important contributors to our nation,"" said John J DeGioia, Georgetown University President and Presidents' Alliance Steering Committee Member. ""The talents, perspectives, insights and passion to serve our world that they bring our campus communities benefits our nation and contributes to the common good that we all share,"" he said.

The brief argues that a 10 per cent rise in the ratio of foreign graduate students to total graduate students results in a 5.1 per cent increase in patent grants. International students and scholars also continue to contribute to the US economy beyond their periods of enrolment. For example, in a study of American startup companies valued at USD 1 billion or more, it was found that nearly one quarter of such businesses had a founder who first came to the United States as an international student, it said.

The backdating rule introduces significant uncertainty and punishes students for reasons that are frequently beyond the students' control. In some cases, students and exchange visitors can fall out-of-status due to unwitting clerical and technical errors, often of someone else's making, the brief said. In many cases, the infraction will not be discovered (or determined, as the F, M, and J regulations are not always clear and may be subject to varying interpretations) until the individual reapplies for another immigration benefit, such as an optional practical training allowance or an H-1B visa, it said.

""A ban, in turn, could have devastating immediate consequences for a student's course of study and would outright bar the student from reentering the US for any reason -- even for business purposes, or to see a child -- for a period of year,"" the brief said, adding that the new rule will diminish US' ability to compete for international students and scholars. This decline in international student enrolment and in engagement with international researchers and professors will have a detrimental effect on the system of higher education in the United States.

""As of today international students continue to make this country the global leader in higher education, but the gap is closing. The United States' 'market share has dropped from 23 per cent in 2000 to 16 per cent in 2012' with China, Canada, Britain and Russia all vying for the same pool of talent,"" it said."

The physiotherapy department of the institute is soon going to procure this new technology for the early rehabilitation of patients. This announcement was made on the concluding day of the seventh International Conference of Physical Therapy AIIMS 2018.

Attended by more than 600 delegates from different parts of India and abroad, the two-day conference was inaugurated by Minister of State for Health Ashwini Kumar Choubey. The participating dignitaries said the role of physiotherapists would be well defined under Ayushman Bharat as it is an integral part of the government's wellness programme.

Choubey said the government will soon pass the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 and appealed the opposition to support it as the act would benefit lakhs of Indians.

Nirmal Kumar, organising secretary, said, ""With India's ever-growing aging population, it is inevitable for the physiotherapists to keep themselves abreast of latest trends and innovation while working with healthcare professionals and patients to provide best treatment for early rehabilitation.""

The aim of the conference was to stimulate collaboration between clinicians and academicians. Interactive scientific programmes and hands on workshops were conducted by renowned faculties from various fields of physiotherapy.

""The inclusion of robots in ICU's is set to be a game-changer especially for early rehabilitation of both upper and lower limbs of the patients,"" said Dr Prabhat Ranjan, senior physiotherapist, department of neurology, AIIMS.

He said people suffering from the after-effects of strokes, spinal cord injuries, trauma and other neurological and orthopedic conditions would really benefit from the new technology and it will surely improve their physical, mental and sensory functions.

In developed countries, robotics are the latest tools in physical therapy and rehabilitation, Ranjan said. Physiotherapists are quite upbeat after the cabinet approved the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 that seeks to regulate and standardise education, training and services of healthcare professionals including physiotherapists, he said.

Dr Sanjiv K Jha, president of Indian Association of Physiotherapists, said, ""The bill when it comes in force will regularise the system of registration, recognition, standard, quality of education in physiotherapy and will be able to check the unprofessional practice/quackery in physiotherapy by untrained professional.""

Experts said physiotherapy colleges have mushroomed across the country and are not as per the standards and are unable to offer quality education.

The Maharashtra State Open School is expected to open for admissions in a fortnight. The board will have study centres in every district of the state.

At present, besides National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), 15 states and a union territory have their own open school system, which Maharashtra lacks. ""The NIOS is a central board and the centres would run on delays due to the large numbers. So the state's open school will be an accessible choice,"" said Nozzer Pardiwala, who has home schooled his children.

The state education department on Saturday issued a GR outlining the enrolment criteria, subject choices and exam timeline. The open board will hold exams for classes V, VIII, X and XII in June and December each year.

The board aim to give dropouts, adults, sportspersons, housewives and anyone who cannot attend regular school, a chance to complete education. Proposed a few years ago, the board was set up in July 2017. While the government resolution then too listed the criteria for enrolment and subjects on offer, there was ambiguity on the board's conflict with the Right to Education Act, 2009 which requires all children under 14 years to be in school. So, the GR issued on Saturday says children under 14 years will be required to register as full time students at the board's study centres.

The revised guidelines for the open board also outline the subject concessions for children with special needs. While all students will appear for two languages, those with special needs can opt for just one language. They will then have the choice to select four from over 24 subjects. The medium of instruction for the board will be English, Marathi and Urdu.

Experts also feel the board would help students with special needs. ""The NIOS is not friendly for students with special needs. So hope the state's open board syllabus fills that gap,"" said Rekha Vijaykar, director of the NGO ADAPT - Able Disabled All People Together.

An official said, ""A few minor changes need to be made to the website. It will open for applications in another week. The first exam will be held in June."" A student can appear for exams six months after enrolling with the board. Students can clear examination in nine attempts over a span of five years.

(PTI)

The newly formed Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh may not have adequate fiscal space or funds left to implement other poll promises in the current financial year after announcing farm loan waivers, according to officials in the three states. The outgoing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments in the three states have spent up to 70% of the funds allocated in the last budget in the first seven months of this financial year, which will end on March 31.

Madhya and Chhattisgarh announced the waiver on Monday last. Rajasthan followed suit two days in line with Congress chief Rahul Gandhi's poll promise of waiving farm loans of up to Rs two lakh within 10 days of forming the governments in three states.

Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan waived all short-term crop loans while the Chhattisgarh government will pay for loans farmers have taken from the state's Gramin Bank. The waivers will cost between Rs 35,000 to Rs 38,000 crore in Madhya Pradesh, Rs 18,000 crore in Rajasthan and Rs 6,100 crore in Chhattisgarh.

Officials said market borrowing was among the options the governments were exploring. ""We are working out the modalities,"" said a Madhya Pradesh finance department official.

Officials cited the limited fiscal space and said it will be difficult to implement other major poll promises in the current financial year. Budgets in the three states will be presented in February-March next year, months before the national polls due in April-May 2019.

The other promises include unemployment allowances of Rs 10,000 and Rs 3,500 each to a member of a family in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The Congress has also pledged a stipend of an unspecified amount in Chhattisgarh.

It has also promised power bills' waiver for the poor and reduction in electricity tariffs by half for others. The other pledges range from free education and medicines to increasing minimum support price for farm produce in the three states.

In Chhattisgarh, the party has also promised liquor prohibition that, too, will lead to revenue losses.

Officials said the outgoing BJP governments have spent between 50% to 70% of funds allocated in the last budget.

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath and his Rajasthan counterpart, Ashok Gehlot, have blamed the previous BJP governments for emptying the coffers and have said that they will look for new avenues to generate revenue.

The BJP has maintained there was enough money if the new governments wanted to implement their poll promises.

In Madhya Pradesh, the farm loan waiver burden would be about one-fifth of the total expenditure of Rs 1,86,683 crore for 2018-19, of which around Rs 1,25,000 crore has been spent till October end.

Officials pointed out the previous government has availed 90% of the borrowing capacity of Rs 60,000 crore to fund sops before the polls.

Madhya Pradesh's principal secretary (agriculture), Rajesh Rajora, said most money provided for different schemes in the budget has been spent. ""We are looking at different options to fund the farm loan waiver,"" he said

In Rajasthan, the farm loan waiver burden would be around one-sixth of the total budget of Rs 1,07,865 crore, of which about Rs 77,000 crore has been spent.

University of Rajasthan's economics professor, V V Singh, said around 25% of the budget will be spent on meeting these poll promises.

He added any additional spending will result in an increase in the fiscal deficit, which is 3.01% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).

Gehlot on Tuesday insisted his government has a borrowing capacity of Rs 36,000 crore as per the present budget. T

he state has already taken over Rs 25,000 crore loan. Gehlot admitted to the fiscal constraints.

The state's outstanding liabilities are 27.57% of its GSDP, which is above the 25% limit the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act has set.

Rajasthan finance commission's former chairperson, Jyoti Kiran Shukla, called the implications of the waiver announcements on the state budget huge. Shukla said the state has to determine what revenue base it will generate to meet these expenditures.

In Chhattisgarh, the farm loan waiver and increasing the minimum support price of paddy and maize to Rs 2,500 per quintal would take away one-tenth of the state's budget of Rs 83,179 crore.

A Chhattisgarh finance department officer hoped they would be able to implement the promises without breaching the fiscal deficit target.

""Some promises may find reflection in the next budget. The political leadership will take the decision.""

He added implementing prohibition in the current financial year will be impossible as it needs a new legal framework like in Gujarat and Bihar.

Economists have spoken against the farm loan waivers saying they will increase non-performing banking assets. State Bank of India's group chief economic advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh estimates the collective burden will range from Rs Rs 60,000 crore to Rs 70,000 if the election-bound states, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Haryana, in 2019 decide to waive farm loans."

Effective midnight, Friday, December 21st, there is a partial federal government shutdown in effect.

Earlier this week, the National League of Cities (NLC) called on federal leaders to do their jobs and find a bipartisan solution to avoid a shutdown and keep every federal agency open.

""Cities expect our leaders in Washington to meet their most basic obligation and keep the federal government open,"" said NLC President Karen Freeman-Wilson, mayor of Gary, Indiana. ""A federal shutdown would impact programs that grow local economies and build more resilient communities. Instead of wasting $6.5 billion a week on a shutdown, let's put that money to good use -- by investing in America's cities.""

This would be a ""partial"" shutdown because Congress met the deadline to approve five of the twelve total appropriations bills. In addition to all ""mandatory"" spending programs, federal discretionary grant programs administered through the following agencies will not be impacted by the partial shutdown:

For city leaders, this means residents can expect uninterrupted operations and payments from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. VA Hospitals and other service providers for veterans should remain open. Before and after school programs funded by the Department of Education's 21 Century Community Learning Center grants should not be interrupted.

Unfortunately for city leaders, the federal agencies that will be shutting down to various degrees are those that administer most federal grants allocated directly to municipal governments, including:

According to this detailed Q&A from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, when a funding lapse results in the shutdown of a federal agency, the government must discontinue all non-essential discretionary functions until new funding legislation is passed and signed into law. And according to this White House Shutdown FAQ, all normally, routine, ongoing operational and administrative activities relating to contract or grant administration (including payment processing) cannot continue when there is a lapse in funding. Moreover, federal agency employees who are paid with annual appropriations and who perform an activity associated with contract or grant administration (including oversight, inspection, payment or accounting) should generally not continue work during a lapse in appropriations.

In other words, federal discretionary grants that are administered to local governments from unfunded federal agencies, including HUD's CDBG and HOME grants, DOJ's COPS grants, DOT's TIGER grants, EDA's economic development grants, SBA's small business loans, and USDA's rural loans and grants, will be unavailable for reimbursement to local governments, and agency staff will generally be unavailable to answer questions or offer technical assistance throughout the duration of the partial government shutdown. Any local employees funded by federal grants may also be required to stop work.

The White House Office of Management and Budget maintains a list of each agency's plans here. Additional contingency information may be posted on individual agency websites as well.

A short shutdown of a week or less will have little to no impact on cities (although it will cost the federal government plenty to furlough employees, mothball offices, and reopen even a short time later). The effects of a longer shutdown would multiply quickly, including inaccessible federal funding, project delays and potential layoffs. As federal funding for services dry up, residents usually expect local governments to step in with supplemental funding. Eventually it will fall on cities and states to bear the cost of the shutdown on the broader economy, which will result in less tax revenue for all levels of government.

The federal law that prohibits agencies from incurring obligations in advance of appropriations, the Antideficiency Act, also requires an ""orderly shutdown"" when there has been a lapse in appropriations. Of course, actual government shutdowns are anything but orderly, and there will be exceptions and inconsistencies across the board, known and unknown.

Among the known exceptions and inconsistencies, if there is a partial government shutdown:"

Lung and colon cancers, as well as advanced-staged cancers, appear to be most strongly associated with an elevated risk of heart attack and stroke caused by blood clots in the arteries.

The study is the largest and most systematic evaluation of these events leading up to a cancer diagnosis, according to researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine, NewYork-Presbyterian, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

""Our data show there is an associated risk of ischemic stroke and heart attack that begins to increase in the five months before the cancer is officially diagnosed and peaks in the month just before,"" said lead study author Babak Navi, MD, MS, an associate professor of neurology in the Department of Neurology and of neuroscience in the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell Medicine, and a neurologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. ""These results suggest that cancer's effect on the clotting system may be what's predominantly driving the associated risk of heart attacks and stroke.""

Cancers can take months and sometimes years to develop and be diagnosed, and some cancers may be exerting biological effects on the body, especially thromboembolic activity, before they come to medical attention, he explained.

Researchers used information from a Medicare database linked to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry and retrospectively looked at the risk of heart attack and stroke in people 67 years and older who were newly diagnosed with breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, bladder, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, uterine, pancreatic, and gastric cancers from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2013. Together, these cancers account for two-thirds of all cancer diagnoses in the United States. The study included 748,662 Medicare beneficiaries and compared patients with cancer to matched controls during the 360 days before the cancer diagnosis.

Overall, the risk of having a heart attack and stroke jumped by 70 percent in the year before cancer diagnosis. The risk was most acute in the month immediately before cancer diagnosis. During this time, patients who were later diagnosed with cancer were more than five times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke compared with those who did not have cancer - 2,313 of cancer patients had an event compared with 413 of matched controls. Beyond five months before a cancer diagnosis, the risks of these events were similar in both groups. The rate of heart attack or stroke was highest in adults with lung and colorectal cancers and those with stage 3 or 4 disease. When analyzed separately, both heart attack and stroke risk were increased in the months before cancer diagnosis, although heart attack events were slightly more common than strokes. Secondary analyses of additional arterial thromboembolic event types (i.e., thromboembolism of arteries supplying the peripheral limbs or mesentery) further substantiated the primary findings.

The data confirm the association of heart attack and stroke with cancer development and delineate when the risk starts and its relative magnitude, said Dr. Navi, who is also chief of the Division of Stroke and Hospital Neurology in the Department of Neurology at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell.

""Our findings suggest that cancer could be a risk factor for arterial thromboembolism, so people who have a heart attack or stroke should be up-to-date with their age- and gender-specific cancer screenings, such as mammograms and colonoscopies,"" Dr. Navi added. ""If someone has a heart attack or stroke and there are any concerning signs for an undiagnosed malignancy, such as weight loss or unexplained anemia, then perhaps a cancer screening should be considered.""

Dr. Navi and his team are planning future research studies to better understand what blood or imaging biomarkers could serve as clues to occult cancer in patients with arterial thromboembolism, as well as what the utility of body CT imaging or other cancer screening tools might be in these patients, particularly in those whose strokes or heart attacks are otherwise unexplained. Dr. Navi also stressed that more investigations are needed to determine the exact cause of arterial thromboembolism in patients with cancer and the optimal strategies to prevent and treat these events.

The use of claims data didn't allow the researchers to account for lifestyle factors, such as smoking status, event severity, or how interruptions in blood thinning therapies prior to surgical procedures may have played a role. As well, some of the events could have led to a cancer diagnosis because of increased medical surveillance and testing.

This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

It was a year of several landmark decisions for the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). In pursuance to objective of providing greater "" Ease of Doing Business"" to all stakeholders, bring about greater transparency in corporate structure and better corporate compliance to enhance efficiency of the processes under Companies Act, 2013, the MCA took several initiatives over the last one year.

The important ones are Companies (Amendment) Act 2017, Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2018, establishment of National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), amendments in Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, eKYC drive for Directors of all companies and speedier processing of incorporation related applications, uniformity in application of rules and eradicating discretion.

And it is not for nothing that India's rankings in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business has been lifted up. India has improved its ranking on the World Bank's ""Doing Business"" 2019 report released on 31st October, 2018. As per the report, India has moved up 23 spots to 77th position as compared to 100th position in 2017 by improving its rank in six out of ten parameters relating to starting and doing business in India. The ministry can legitimately claim its share of credits towards starting a business, insolvency resolution and protection of minority interests. But it is the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code or IBC, which claimed limelight for MCA even over the quick action over IL&FS resurrections jointly done by Ministry of Economic Affairs and then taken forward by MCA.

INSOLVENCY & BANKRUPTCY

In year 2018, the President gave assent to promulgate Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amen­dment) Ordinance, 2018.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy process has taken good shape since 2017 and is a fast evolving legislation. A major factor behind the effectiveness of the new Code has been the adjudication by the Judiciary. The Code provides strict time limits for various procedures under it. In this process a rich- case law has evolved reducing the scope of legal uncertainty.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2018 notified on 19.01.2018 replaced IBC (Amendment) Ordinance which further amended provisions relating to prohibition on certain persons from submitting a resolution plan, so as to provide more clarity. Further, second amendment was also done by the way of Ordinance in August, 2018 on the recommendations of Insolvency Law Committee. The Ordinance was promulgated to amend the code to balance the interests of various stakeholders in the code, especially interests of home buyers and micro, small and medium enterprises, promoting resolution over liquidation of corporate debtor by lowering the voting threshold of committee of creditors and streamlining provisions relating to eligibility of resolution applicants.

It was the most vital work of MCA and the most prominet among the MCA credits are amedments to the IBC. According to E&Y, these amendment gives relief to home buyers. Home buyers and other real estate buyers were not recognized either as ""financial reditors"" (FC) or ""operational creditors"" prior to ordinance. Ordinance now provides that they will be treated as FC. As FC, they will have right to participate in the Committee of Creditors (CoC) through authorized representatives and have voting power to the extent of their outstanding. They would rank as other FCs and would get recovery in line with them, in case of liquidation scenario With RERA in place along with powers given to home buyers under IBC, the regulator has provided a level playing field to the home buyer.

It also allowed Initiation of CIRP by Corporate Applicant saying special resolution must be passed by shareholders of corporate debtor with at least ¾th majority mandatory for filing application. This meant the board of directors or authorised representative cannot unilaterally take the decision to file under IBC and the directors and officers would need to be mindful of provisions in the IBC, which impose civil and criminal sanctions on erstwhile directors and officers of the company for wrongful trading.

CoC voting threshold was also reduced from 75 to 66 per cent for major decisions and it did faciliate quick decision making and improve prospects for approval of viable resolution plan.

Applying for an extension for the CIRP period from 180 to 270 days, appointment and replacement of a resolution professional, approving a resolution plan, certain actions requiring approval of CoC and passing a resolution for liquidation while voting threshold reduced to 51 per cent for routine decisions. It also facilitated creditors to invoke personal or corporate guarantees during the CIRP that would provide better co-operation from promoters during resolution process. In a relief to financial creditors having substantial equity shareholding in corporate debtor, the amendment also provided for the regulated financial creditors who became a related party solely on account of conversion of debt into equity/ instruments, convertible into equity shall be exempted from the prohibition.

The most important amendment was reducing the scope of connected person. Prior to the ordinance, several financial entities having connected persons through their investee companies in India or abroad which suffered from the disqualifications (especially relating to NPAs) listed in Section 29A. Relaxation was provided to these financial entities including foreign financial investors. Relaxation of Section 29A should result in more resolution applicants for distressed corporate debtors and improve competition and value.

While some quarters say the IBC has been slow in giving either resolutions or recovery, the government says otherwise. According to corporate affairs secretary Injeti Srinivas, IBC has catalysed the recovery of around Rs 3 lakh crore from various default cases, directly or indirectly, since its inception in 2016. Creditors have recovered Rs 49,783 crore, or almost 56 per cent of their admitted claims, from 32 stressed companies where insolvency resolution plans were approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) by the end of June, showed data compiled by the insolvency regulator.

The average recovery in the 60-odd insolvency cases that have seen resolution over the past two years has been to the tune of 46 per cent against just 26 per cent under the earlier Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) regime, Srinivas said, highlighting the effectiveness of the nascent insolvency framework.

Explaining the numbers, the secretary said while the resolution of the 60 cases have so far yielded around Rs 71,000 crore, some Rs 50,000 crore is expected to be recovered from Essar Steel, which is at the advanced stage of being resolved. These apart, around 3,500 cases involving defaults of Rs 1.2 lakh crore were withdrawn from the National Company Law Tribunals (NCLTs) before applications were admitted by the adjudicating authority, suggesting that creditors might have recovered money from debtors by just issuing threats of the IBC.

Non-performing assests (NPAs) worth another Rs 45,000-50,000 crore were converted to standard accounts after the borrowers had paid back, ostensibly due to fears of the IBC being invoked by the lenders. The IBC regulator IBBI says there is a need for greater bonding between the partners of this syste. Its chairman MS Sahoo was critical of the tendency of some stakeholders to blame the oversight mechanism for any delay in resolution. He pitched for greater coordination and cooperation between the committee of creditors and resolution professionals to speed up the process. Srinivas too seeks to ask the principal stakeholders of the insolvency ecosystem -- the NCLTs, the committee of creditors and resolution professionals -- to work towards expediting the resolution process.

Despite the average 44 per cent haircut that the creditors in general had to take in these cases, analysts said the IBC has performed much better than the earlier system where the recovery process was strenuous and yielded too little. Of course, the headline numbers are good primarily because of Bhushan Steel, which accounted for close to 64 per cent of the total claims by these 32 firms and an equal amount in recovery.

""The IBC as a system has worked better from the old systems under RBI where recovery used to take a lot of time, and wherever a one-time settlement took place, the amount was usually not more than 20 per cent . In many stressed firms were allowed debt restructuring, which only worsened their state of health. In contrast, the IBC 's time-bound resolution of default cases, is more decisive,"" an analyst said.

So far, 1,198 corporates admitted under IBC, 52 cases resolved and 212 cases resulted in liquidation, says (IBBI) whole time member Navrang Saini. Nevertheless, once these old cases -- where chances of a grand turnaround without massive investments are remote -- are settled and new cases come in, recovery would be much higher, a senior government official said. This is because creditors can invoke insolvency proceedings against defaulting firms very early when chances of turning them around would be much higher and easier.

NATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING AUTHORITY

In the wake of accounting scams and frauds in the corporate sector, National Financial Reporting authority (NFRA) was notified as an independent regulator for auditing profession, which is one of the key changes brought in by the Companies Act 2013. NFRA will review the quality of corporate financial reporting in certain classes and subclasses of companies and take disciplinary action against auditors/audit firms for not discharging their statutory duties with due diligence. The decision is expected to result in higher foreign/domestic investments, acceleration of economic growth while supporting greater globalization of business by conforming to international standards and assisting in the evolution of audit profession. The jurisdiction of NFRA for investigation of chartered accountants and their firms under section 132 of the Act would extend to listed companies and large unlisted public companies, the threshold for which shall be prescribed in the rules. The Government has constituted this authority and has prescribed NFRA (Manner of Appointment and other Terms and Conditions of Service of Chairperson and Members) Rules, 2018 and NFRA Rules, 2018. R. Sridharan and Dr Prasenjit Mukherjee, have been appointed as chairperson and full time member respectively of NFRA on 1st October, 2018.

During the year, MCA allowed exemption of its fee for company incorporation where a government process of re-engineering has been implemented where zero fee for incorporation of all companies with authorized capital upto Rs10 lakh or those companies with no share capital but have upto 20 members.

The other key step towards more transparency and accountability was the eKYC drive for directors of all companies. . This drive is aimed at verification of individual directors and weed out non-existent/dummy ones and ultimately to clean up the Directors' e-Registry. The KYC process is obtaining additional details such as AADHAAR, passport, personal mobile mumber and personal email ID. Further, for stakeholders who do not possess AADHAAR, an exception management is provided. There are around 33 Lakh DINs in the registry and around 15.88 Lakh DIN (Director Identification Number) holders have filed DIR KYC as on 30thNovember, 2018. In this drive, MCA managed to seed 11 lakh Aadhar card holders. This is one of its kinds of drive carried out anywhere in India.

NATIONAL COMPANY LAW TRIBUNAL

To speed up matter related to resolution of bankruptcy and insolvency, MCA proposed setting up 8 special courts under the National Company Law Tribunal to deal with the insolvency cases. These courts are proposed to be set up in the busiest cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad. The proposal aims to reduce the mounting burden on the tribunal despite it having 11 benches all over India. To facilitate timely resolution of IBC cases, it is envisaged to set up exclusive IBC Courts under the NCLT benches of Delhi, Mumbai to start with and step up infrastructure of NCLT. The aim is also to strengthen the insolvency process for faster resolution of NPAs.

INDIAN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In order to bring more transparent accounting, MCA notified Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 115 which would be effective from 1st April 2018. Ind AS 115 is a new revenue recognition standard for customer contracts in line with the international financial reporting standards which will help in more transparent accounting of revenues with an impact on companies operating in diverse sectors, including technology, real estate and telecom. The objective is to establish the principles that should be applied when reporting useful information to users of financial statements. The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue ""to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services""

UNLISTED PUBLIC COMPANIES

In order to bring about greater transparency in Corporate structure and in view of advantages of dematerialisation of securities, especially in terms of KYC and investor protection, the government's focus on ""Digital India"" and the enabling provisions available under section 29(1)(b) of the CA-13, the Ministry has amended the relevant rules to apply the dematerialisation requirements to unlisted public companies, in addition to listed companies. Consultation was held in this regard with all stakeholders and rules were amended on 10th September, 2018 to mandate, w.e.f. 2ndOctober, 2018, issue and transfer of securities by unlisted public companies in demat form only.

INVESTOR EDUCATION

The Investor Education & Protection Fund (IEPF) Authority unveiled its new logo in 2018 to provide for strong brand presence and recognition. The IEPF authority also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the CSC e-governance Services India, wherein the latter would identify village level entrepreneurs for investor awareness projects, among other activities. MCA is actively looking at further reforms in IEPF.

To review the existing claim settlement processes a committee of practicing company secretaries was constituted through the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI). The committee had reviewed the existing processes and have recommended that the entire process should be made online with e-verification of the claims by the companies, online PAN based verification of the claimant etc.

A new portal namely www.iepfportal.in has been developed for increasing the outreach of IAPs and monitoring the programmes conducted by the professional institutes, CSC e-governance and other partner institutions. The portal provides access to the partner institutions like ICAI, ICSI, ICoAI& IICA and CSC e-Governance for uploading the details of past & future programmes.

COMPETITION MATTERS

To enlarge the scope of debate of competition in India and to bring the best practices from around the world on competition issues, Competition Commission of India (CCI) successfully hosted the 17th International Competition Network (ICN) Annual Conference in March 2018 in New Delhi. Around 500 professional attended the conference from 70 plus countries, which included heads of competition agencies, representatives and stakeholders consisting of legal and economic professionals, international organizations and academics.

The MCA constituted an Inter-Ministerial Committee for carrying out ""Competition Assessment of existing policies"" under the chairmanship of Shri. Ramesh Abhishek, secretary, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion with representation from seven other ministries/organizations on dated 1st June, 2018. The prime focus of the committee was to conduct a review of select Acts/Rules/Policies/Regulations formulated in the recent past and some upcoming acts to look into issues of anti-competition aspects and to focus on any restrictions/provisions in laws that pose great threat to competition.

Further, in pursuance of its objective to ensure that legislation is in sync with the needs of strong economic fundamentals, the Government constituted a Competition Law Review Committee under Injeti Srinivas, secretary Corporate Affairs on dated 1st October, 2018. The Committee is mandated to review the Competition Act/Rules/Regulation, to look into international best practices and sectoral interfaces etc.

Competition Commission of India (CCI) has amended the Combination Regulations. The post amendment regulations among others includes permitting withdrawal of notice and refilling the same by parties, allowing submission of voluntary modifications in response to notice, appointing agencies to supervise implementation of modification etc.

As part of competition Advocacy initiative at national and state level, CCI organised roadshows in Mumbai, Delhi and Ahmedabad, including a National Conference on ""Public procurement and Competition Law."" Similar roadshows with focus on competition matters are being held periodically and more are planned to be held in the coming months.

MCA did an effective job in 2018, Mostly IBC resolutions , fraud control , NPA recoveries through IBC will put it to test again in 2019. And not to forget the success of IL&FS plan of action by MCA."

The Tiruvallur police are on the lookout for a government school headmaster after filing a case against him under the POCSO Act for sexually abusing girl students inside the school a few weeks ago.

After it was 'abandoned' a decade ago, the school had become a den for anti-social elements to play cards, booze and indulge in prostitution.

The state government has recently passed an order to start a government girls' high school in the building, which was inaugurated last week by the state school education minister K A Sengottaiyan.

The school was started in 1957 in a tile-roof building at Perumanallur. It was upgraded as government higher secondary school. When the strength increased, lack of infrastructure in the school became an issue. So, the students were shifted to a higher secondary school functioning on Kanakkampalayam Road, around 10 years ago. But the old school building was 'abandoned'.

""Especially women would fear to go near the school building because of the anti-social elements. Apart from the prostitution activities, many college students would camp in the dilapidated classrooms and involve in gambling. Despite continuous complaints, numerous incidents were happening in the school building. A few months ago, a class VIII girl was allegedly molested,"" said P Mouleeswaran, secretary, alumni association of the school.

""After our continuous requests to restart the school, the school education minister Sengottaiyan visited the abandoned school building. Quickly, the government passed an order to divide Perumanallur government higher secondary school, among four other government schools in the state, and separate the girl students from the school. Now, Perumanallur government girls' high school was started in the abandoned building,"" he said.

""A group of alumni of the school has come forward and helped to restore the buildings and established a smart classroom. With 10 classrooms, a well-furnished toilet facility, equipped with sanitary napkin incinerator. The alumni have, so far, spent, more than Rs 40 lakh,"" said Mouleeswaran, the 1981-batch student.

""It is commendable that the alumni were putting their hearts out in reviving the school. The government has ordered to transfer 249 girls, between class VI and class X, from Perumanallur government higher secondary school to this school, which is now Perumanallur government girls' high school. After completion of half-yearly exam holidays, the school will start functioning on January 2,"" M Dhanabaggiam, headmistress of the new school told TOI.

Mouleeswaran said, ""The school education department will soon avail loan of Rs 1.36 crore from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), for the revived school. More classrooms will be constructed soon. The government has also promised to upgrade the school as higher secondary school soon."""

Hasina's ten-year tenure as Prime Minister, from 2009 till date, has been marked by very impressive economic growth. It has been 6% on an average and 7.8% this year. Nikkei recently ran a special story on the ""Rise and rise of Bangladesh"".

According to an IMF report of June 2018, growth in the last ten years has significantly lifted per capita income. Poverty has declined steadily. Gender disparity in education and maternal mortality, has also come down.

Throughout this process, the country has diversified away from an agrarian to a more manufacturing-based economy with rapid growth in the ready-made garment industry, the IMF said. The government showed its humanitarian outlook by opening its doors to 700,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in a very short period.

Bangladesh has been a pioneer in financial inclusion, the IMF noted and added that the introduction of microfinance, mobile financial services, and agent-based banking have been notable initiatives. The government has also been promoting lending for small and medium-sized enterprises and women entrepreneurs.

These efforts have improved the ratio of bank deposit accounts in the adult population and credit provided to small and medium-sized enterprises run by women. They have also helped to boost the number of women entrepreneurs and the number of active mobile money accounts. The forthcoming National Financial Inclusion Strategy will carry forth this momentum, the IMF avers.

Writing in www.bookings.edu, leading Indian economist Dr. Kaushik Basu says that Bangladesh has made significant strides toward educating girls and giving women a greater voice, both in the household and the public sphere.

""These efforts have translated into improvements in children's health and education, such that Bangladeshis' average life expectancy is now 72 years, compared to 68 for Indians and 66 for Pakistan,"" Basu points out.

""Among Bangladeshi adults with bank accounts, 34.1 percent made digital transactions in 2017, compared to an average rate of 27.8 percent for South Asia. Moreover, only 10.4 percent of Bangladeshi bank accounts are dormant (meaning there were no deposits or withdrawals in the previous year), compared to 48 percent of Indian bank accounts,"" Basu notes.

In contrast to India, entrepreneurs in Bangladesh have the advantage of weak labor laws which allow them to hire and fire workers and expand capacity to exploit economies of scale.

Downside

But there is a downside to the economic growth story. Corruption, cronyism, and inequality have tended to increase with economic growth. For instance. Non-Performing Loans in 14 banks had led to the loss of US$ 2.5 billion. Weak labor laws have made industrial safety an issue.

The Hasina regime has been lambasted for the use of the law and the police to suppress opponents. an unbridled force has been used to suppress Islamic terrorists and drug dealers, though observers note that vast sections of people are relieved that these vicious elements have been defanged.

The government had been indifferent to emotional protests such as the school kids' nation-wide agitation against the recklessness of bus drivers this year. World famous photographer Shahidul Alam was arrested and tortured for speaking to Al Jazeera on the agitation.

A 2014 promise to rule by consultation with various groups before taking key decisions has not been kept. This has given rise to a movement against a ""One Person State"" led by Dr.Kamal Hossain of the Jatiya Oikya Front (JOF), which includes the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by three times Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.

Prof. Ali Riaz of Illinois State University, writing in East Asian Forum says that the space for dissent in Bangladesh has shrunk ""remarkably"" in the past five years. The media has either been muzzled or co-opted, and journalists tend to exercise self-censorship. In November, the government enacted a draconian Digital Security Act which curtails freedom of expression.

Bangladesh has also experienced an ""exponential rise in extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances"". At least 456 people were killed and 83 people disappeared between January and November this year, Riaz notes.

But as pointed out earlier, it is learnt that the common man is more keen on law and order, fewer disruptions to his life, and lesser radicalism, than on adherence to Western standards of law enforcement.

Riaz says that the Election Commission (EC) has been failing to ensure a level playing field as it turns a blind eye to the ruling party's election code violations. Another observer said that the EC is going by the letter and not the spirit of the law. This has resulted in some anomalies. Candidatures have been rejected on technical, or as some say, frivolous grounds.

The Daily Star notes that as polling day gets nearer, more and more opposition BNP leaders are ""skidding off the race"". On Friday, five opposition aspirants lost their candidacies following a High Court order. The court had pointed out that the government had not accepted their resignations from the post of Upazila Chairmen. According to the Representation of the People Order (RPO), anyone holding ""an office of profit"" like that of an Upazila Chairman is barred from running for parliament.

With the five gone, the BNP now has no contenders in 15 of the 300 seats up for grabs in parliament (50 of the total of 350 seats are reserved for women chosen by Proportional Representation).

The High Court on Thursday directed the EC to allocate the BNP's symbol ""Sheaf of Paddy"" to four BNP candidates instead of their rivals who had been given the symbol earlier. This was because the candidates who had been given the symbol earlier, had not submitted their resignations to the concerned government department within a ""reasonable"" period.

Pale Shadow

One of the reasons for nominations backfiring is that the BNP of today is disorganized, and is but a pale shadow of what it was earlier. It's Supremo, the aging and unwell Khaleda Zia, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for corruption. Rules bar the use her pictures on BNP posters. Her son and political heir, Tarique Rahman, is a fugitive in the UK.

The BNP's structure is in disarray also because it debilitated itself by opting out of the last elections held in 2014. It quit the arena saying its demand for an independent election-time caretaker government was rejected.

Twenty two Jamaat-e-Islami leaders contesting under the BNP's electoral symbol ""sheaf of paddy"" await the Election Commission's decision on their candidacies. They had taken the BNP's ticket since the EC had scrapped the radical Islamic party's registration as a political party following a High Court ruling.

Aware that she had ruled with an iron fist and that she had not met all the expectations of the electorate, Sheikh Hasina has sought pardon and asked the people to give her another chance.

""To err is human. My colleagues and I might have made mistakes while performing our duties. I, on behalf of myself and my party, fervently request the countrymen to look kindly on our mistakes I promise to build a more beautiful future by learning from the past,"" Hasina she said when releasing her party Awami League's manifesto.

Awami League aims to increase GDP growth to 10% per annum from the present 7.8% in the next five years. It wants to bring down, by 2041, the poverty rate to zero from about 22% now. It promises to create jobs for 10 million plus youths, with foreign employment for 1,000 youths from each Upazila.

In contrast to Khaleda Zia, who alienated India, Hasina has been balancing varying interests very judiciously. She has been very friendly with India despite the dispute over Padma river waters. She pleased New Delhi by crushing Islamic terrorism. But she curbed Islamic terrorism without antagonizing the moderate Islamic lobby. She co-opted the Islamist Hifazat-e-Islam. And she accepted huge investments from China without antagonizing India in the process."

It isn't just dust and noxious gases that are floating in the air. You also have bacteria, fungus and other microbes, which could contribute to the rise of allergens and respiratory infections in the city.

Since 2010, Bengaluru University has been monitoring bioaerosols in the form of bacterial contamination and fungal spores in the air. The annual average number of bioaerosol ranged between 64,000 Colony Forming Units per cubic metre to 89,000 CFU/m3. While there are no standards for bioaerosols in the country, researchers say this exceeds the 10,000 CFU/m3 limit prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for indoor air quality.

Seasonal variation

The study, which also looked at seasonal variation, shows that the city is always under a barrage of bioaerosols, with bacterial microbes and fungal spores alternating in their peaks.

The pre-monsoon season, stretching from March to May, records the worst biological pollution quality, with CFU/m3 reaching upwards of 1,02,000.

Warm temperatures in the city, coupled with urban heat island effect that can see certain areas record more than 37 degree Celsius, are believed to encourage bacterial growth. Many bacterial organisms thrive in these warm temperatures, note researchers whose meteorological observation point to an increase in average temperature in the city from 24.1 to 24.4 degree Celsius in the past seven years.

During winters, when the air is slightly chiller, fungal spores dominate bioaerosols. The lowering of humidity (to around 27%, compared to 50-60% in other seasons) 'enhances' spore formation.

""Solid waste is a major contributor to bioaerosol pollution. Rotting waste sees microbial release and is a platform for mould and fungal growth,"" said Sivasakthivel S., a researcher with Bangalore University.

When released, they attach themselves to particulate matter pollution, which is on the rise through vehicles, construction and other pollution sources.

""These minute particles are the ideal platform for bacteria to grow on. The smaller the particle, the greater its reach in the lungs, and greater the health hazard,"" says the researcher.

Of concern is particulate matter which is less than 1 micron in size and can reach the smaller tracts within the lungs. Currently, State agencies monitor particulate matter on two parameters: of 10 microns or less in size and of 2.5 microns or less. The monsoon, which subdues much of the particulate matter, seeks lower bioaerosol counts in the city.

""If you are talking about pollution and health, then it is very important to measure bioaerosols. It is a big problem which could lead to direct health effects from air-borne pollution,"" says Nandini N., Principal Investigator for the project.

Bioaerosols not monitored

Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) said bioaerosols are not notified as a pollutant by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), preventing regular monitoring.

""There is talk of monitoring PM1 levels due to its health consequences. But, even at the national level, there has been no discussion on bioaerosols,"" said an officer.

Causes of bioaerosol pollution

From open dumpyards, landfills, waste strewn on streets, to frothing lakes and the burgeoning pigeon population, bacterial and fungal particles have multiple ways to get air-borne.

While much of it can be natural -- take for instance, fungus on trees shaken by the wind -- rotting food waste in garbage dumps can aggravate matters.

""Even sewage flowing in the open spews out airborne toxins when it falls from a height. This is something we have observed in Byramangala and Bellandur lakes where along with froth, bacteria in the water is thrown up in the air. What we need is for the civic body, water board and others to take bioaerosols into consideration in their policies to put an end to open dumpyards, and the city is kept clean,"" says Nandini N., Professor, Department of Environmental Science, Bangalore University and Principal Investigator in this long-term monitoring project.

The health effects of bioaerosols have not been directly studied, leaving a gap in understanding their contribution to infections or allergies. Pulmonologist H. Paramesh said that while infections had reduced due to better education about hygiene, allergens are on the rise.

""A recent study shows fungi causes 7.5% of allergies, which is the same as pollen. However, this is overshadowed by dust mites, which cause 60% of allergies. In terms of bioaerosols, much needs to be studied,"" he said."

Merrill Lynch will pay a $5.5 million fine, and disgorge $490,530 it earned as revenue from the sales.

FINRA rules restricting who may purchase IPOs are intended to promote investor confidence and preserve the integrity of the IPO process by ensuring that FINRA members do not provide favorable treatment to industry insiders at the expense of public customers. FINRA Rule 5130 therefore prohibits member firms from selling IPO shares to certain ""restricted persons,"" such as the immediate family members of its own brokers, and its customers who are associated with other broker-dealers.

FINRA found that from 2010 through March 2018, Merrill Lynch made at least 1,462 prohibited sales of IPO shares in 325 different offerings to 149 customer accounts in which brokers at other firms or family members of Merrill brokers held a beneficial interest. Among the IPOs improperly sold to these accounts were highly anticipated and sought-after stocks such as Facebook, Inc., General Motors Co., LinkedIn Corp., and Twitter Inc. At least 120 different financial advisors located in 79 of the firm's branch offices effected the prohibited IPO sales.

FINRA also found that Merrill Lynch's violations occurred because it failed to implement supervisory systems and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the FINRA rule prohibiting IPO sales to industry insiders. Merrill Lynch failed to use information in its own customer records to prevent the sale of IPO shares to clients who were restricted persons; failed to reasonably respond when it learned that it had sold IPO shares to immediate family members of Merrill Lynch financial advisors; and failed to reasonably train its employees to achieve compliance with the IPO rule.

""IPO shares sold to industry insiders are unavailable to investors who might otherwise have purchased them,"" said Susan Schroeder, FINRA Executive Vice President, Department of Enforcement. ""FINRA rules play an important role in preserving the fairness of the IPO process and protecting investors' access to IPOs. Merrill Lynch knew or should have known that these customers were restricted from IPO purchases, but repeatedly sold them shares in violation of FINRA rules.""

New Delhi, Dec 23 The passage of a long-pending bill on transgender rights in the Lok Sabha towards the fag end of the year was the main highlight of 2018 for the Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry, which otherwise strove for implementation of its schemes.

However, several representatives of the transgender community and activists dubbed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill as ""regressive"" and said it disregarded most recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee.

They said the bill was in stark ""violation"" of the fundamental rights of transgender persons enshrined in the Constitution as equal citizens.

On the flip side, the ministry grappled with the implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act with only a third of the states having enacted the rules under the legislation, which was notified for enforcement in April 2016.

The crucial issue of sub-categorisation of the OBCs which had generated a lot of hope within the community with the government forming a panel for the purpose last year has not made much headway.

The National Drug Demand Reduction Policy to address the problem of drug and substance abuse in the country, and the review of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, to toughen provisions dealing with the abuse of old people and lay emphasis on good and affordable healthcare for them also didn't make much progress.

Some of the initiatives which stood out for the ministry in 2018 include launch of the country's first-of-its-kind dictionary aimed at bringing uniformity in sign languages used by hearing and speech impaired people across the nation. The dictionary comprise 3,000 Hindi and English words and their corresponding graphic representation of the signs which are used in daily life.

Arvind told this newspaper on Saturday if Arun failed to come up with satisfactory reply, stern action will be taken against him.

The inquiry was initiated on a complaint from Gopalganj's district education officer (DEO) and district programme officer (establishment). In their letters to the department in August, the DEO and DPO alleged that Arun had committed large-scale bungling in teachers' selection.

According to education department officials, Arun appointed around 100 teachers at panchayat and block level in government primary schools of Gopalganj district without following the criteria of recruitment prescribed by the department.

The passage of a long-pending bill on transgender rights in the Lok Sabha towards the fag end of the year was the main highlight of 2018 for the Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry, which otherwise strove for implementation of its schemes.

However, several representatives of the transgender community and activists dubbed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill as ""regressive"" and said it disregarded most recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee.

They said the bill was in stark ""violation"" of the fundamental rights of transgender persons enshrined in the Constitution as equal citizens.

On the flip side, the ministry grappled with the implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act with only a third of the states having enacted the rules under the legislation, which was notified for enforcement in April 2016.

The crucial issue of sub-categorisation of the OBCs which had generated a lot of hope within the community with the government forming a panel for the purpose last year has not made much headway.

The National Drug Demand Reduction Policy to address the problem of drug and substance abuse in the country, and the review of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, to toughen provisions dealing with the abuse of old people and lay emphasis on good and affordable healthcare for them also didn't make much progress.

The creation of State Open School Board -- where an array of skill-based subjects and other vocations made a foray into mainstream education -- was exalted by teachers and students alike. Now, in a further boost to this phenomenon, the state education department has given it equivalence to Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE). Every student engaged in open schooling will be considered on a par with those who take the traditional route and will be awarded state board's certificate at the end of it.

A final decision in this regard had been pending since the state announced inclusion of open schooling in 2017, with work on the syllabus underway, being carefully scrutinised by the board. They had ascertained that final certificates will bear no difference, and subsequently, this decision was formalised through a December 21 government resolution.

Kale, chairman of MSBSHSE, said, ""An amendment or resolution was important to impart the equivalent status to open schooling. According to the new diktat, students who will appear for classes X and XII exams through open schooling will get the same certificates from the state board.""

The process of setting up open schools is in its final stages with two centres all set to function -- one each in and jurisdictions. A third centre will be disclosed in the coming week, after which enrolments are expected to commence. Also, students will now be allowed to take up home schooling, for which they will have to attempt exams for classes V, VIII, X and XII.

The syllabus will include Marathi as a compulsory subject with other choices being perched in a wide spectrum of vocations -- like Indian classical music and 13 skill-based subjects -- all approved by NCERT. The catalogue of skill-based subjects boasts of courses on beauty, baking and confectionery, printing, agriculture, water management, computer repair, art and craft among others.

The inclusion of such subjects, deemed the core of open schooling, was done with the objective of favouring those students who cannot go to a regular school due to keen interest in extra-curricular activities or sports. Furthermore, there is no upper age limit for enrolment (minimum being 10), the schooling will benefit children with special needs, senior citizens and others who lagged behind on education. They will be able to bag secondary and higher secondary board degrees through experiential learning.

Nonetheless, this announcement is still snagged with doubts as a handful of parents wonder if open schooling will of higher education for their children. For instance, Yamini Dhopavkar, a parent of fiveyear-old, who has been enrolled in an activity centre and planning for board for final examination, emphasised that these tests matter apart from experiential learning. ""It is important that even after imparting open schooling, the child should be able to apply for various higher education courses. If this open schooling gives equivalence to state board then definitely it will be one of the choices,"" she added."

A new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. (Mohit Suneja/HT)

Mass hysteria breaks out in India every few years and is increasingly being fuelled by paranoia about the internet.

To the world, Manish Sarki was the perfect all-rounder.

A strapping boy of 18, Sarki worked hard in school during the day and sent fielders scurrying after his shots at the neighbourhood cricket ground in the evenings. He would never get home later than dinner time even when his friends were out chatting, his mother Chandra Maya remembers, and his closest friends joked about how he would blush talking to girls.

Everyone in the village of St Mary's Hill knew Sarki would grow up to be a policeman or join the army. Maybe because he was so well-behaved, no one noticed when he went quiet. They only noticed on the night of August 20 when he didn't come back home.

The village gathered around the Sarki house around 9pm. A chill was enveloping the small mountain village on the outskirts of Darjeeling in northern Bengal, but a small group of men and women trekked to the local police station a couple of kilometers away. Boys go missing all the time, they were told.

Undeterred, the villagers split into smaller search parties and fanned out into the jungles, determined to find Sarki. Their hopes were dashed around 1.30am when a search team stumbled on Sarki's body hanging from the ceiling of an empty pig warehouse on top of a hill.

Below, in spray paint, were the words ""half blood prince was here"" in what everyone recognised was Sarki's handwriting. On the wall behind was drawn a hangman with two victims, an older boy, and more chillingly, a younger one. Every wall of the building had been scribbled on - the words ""illuminati"", ""last king"", ""savage"", ""doped up"" and the number ""666"" appearing repeatedly.

In the light of day, some of the graffiti might have appeared benign - after all, some the walls displayed banalities like ""be the change you want to see"" or ""the thing you fear the most is fear itself"". But in the eerie quiet of a cold mountain night, the villagers were convinced Sarki's death was the doing of the satan. ""I was heartbroken for my son but also scared out of my wits. We were all scared about who the younger boy could be,"" said Chandra Maya.

By the time police arrived two hours later, a mist of rumours had cloaked the village. Wasn't Sarki always on his phone for the past few weeks? And, wouldn't he go out to the graveyard, barely a kilometer away, every night with his phone? ""I think he was going crazy. That's when I heard about the game,"" added Chandra Maya.

By sunrise, everyone had heard of the game: a shadowy application called the Momo Challenge that had apparently killed Sarki. Several explanations were offered. ""For the past few days, he was very sad and distracted. He would be lost in his phone. He never said anything to me, later I found out that he was playing the Momo game,"" said Sarki's friend Deekchen.

But how did he find out? Villagers say the local police first told them of the game, but the police deny ever saying anything. ""In fact, we have not been able to confirm any role of any Momo Challenge game. We never told the locals about the game. Maybe the graffiti made them think that,"" said Hare Krishna Pai, additional superintendent of police.

The next day, a second death, that of 26-year-old Aditi Goyal in Kurseong town, was also attributed to the Momo Challenge, turning the creeping fear into full-blown panic. By then, local politicians had put out statements about the supposedly lethal game, and everyone in the hills was talking about it.

""The whole area was in trauma and everyone was scared of their phones. We found young boys from Class 7 had started playing it. We started spreading awareness and seized phones from those who seemed vulnerable. Someone even sent a message to my daughter,"" said Raju Gurung, a local from Kurseong.

Hindustan Times spoke to at least 20 people in the area and everyone claimed to know a relative, friend or neighbour who had had a close shave with the game. But everyone had a different notion.

Some described the game, which supposedly sets self-harm challenges that finally end in suicide, as an app, some as a Whatsapp message. Some said they received texts, some described a phone number. Indeed, beyond the ubiquitous image of the oblong faced, bulbous eyed doll that has come to signify the game, every detail was foggy. ""Sometimes people are faking names and photos and sending messages 'Hi, I am momo. Let us play a game.' The fear of the game has hypnotised us,"" said Junita Rana, a schoolteacher in Kurseong.

It began with the braids. In June last year, a girl in Rajasthan claimed someone chopped off her braid while she was asleep. Dozens of women across Rajasthan followed up with similar claims. Over the following months, the pattern spread across north India like an epidemic: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi. By November, over 200 cases of braid chopping had been reported in Kashmir where the trend took its most vicious turn. Many women claimed to have seen Godmen, witches or cats before losing their consciousness. After finding their braids gone, many complained of aches and pains for days after. The police couldn't really find any culprits, so the people took the matter in their hands. In August, a poor woman was killed by a mob in Agra on the suspicion of chopping braids. In October, an old man in Anantnag was killed for the same reason.

Then there was the Blue Whale. In July, a schoolboy's suicide stoked the hysteria around the web-based game created by a Russian tech geek targeting teengers. The 50 challenges begin differently - from shutting yourself in or watching a horror film - proceed incrementally, and end the same way: suicide. Through 2017, more than 150 cases of young suicides across India - West Bengal, Delhi, Indore, Solapur, Dehradun - were blamed on the Blue Whale, often with no more proof that the young person was obsessed with smartphone and videogames. Every case was rife was contradictions and yet, websites were blocked, advisories issued, and in some cases, smartphones banned in schools.

Experts say that underneath the web-fuelled hysteria, something more sinister is going on with the mental health of young people. Samir Parikh, director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, insisted that we cannot dismiss these phenomena, but the focus should be on greater media literacy, on making children understand what is right and wrong content, and on teaching people to seek help if they are feeling vulnerable.

""Is there a component of hysteria in all this? Of course, there are lots of stories in the media and they have an impact. But we cannot deny the fact that there are pressures and problems that young people go through silently. If help and access is not given, they can be misused,"" he added.

Parikh is clear that any approach that aims at shutting down access to the internet is wrong, mainly because it is impossible. ""We need to understand that be it Blue Whale or Momo, if you are vulnerable, you might be pulled towards it. So you give people skills and teach people to not bottle it up, tell parents, block or involve authorities.""

India has had a long history of public panic. From a half-man half-monkey roaming the streets in Delhi, sometimes wearing a helmet, to the Munhnochwa (face ripper) of Mirzapur, claimed to be a flying object emitting beams of green or red light, sending shock waves through anyone who came in its contact, and leaving them with bites and scratches on their faces, to the Rathakaatteri (vampire) of Gundalpatti who allegedly sucked the blood of the village cattle, a new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. Many of these have been analysed as incidents of mass hysteria. The patterns have been revealing. Women are more likely to end up as victims than men, children turn to be more vulnerable than adults. The trends pick up in regions or communities marked by oppression of women, economic uncertainty or social anxiety.

Yet, questions remain about why a particular fear grips a set of people at a given time. Did every woman who complained of braid chopping do it herself? Was every alleged case of Blue Whale suicide made up by the parents or the police to evade responsibility? What do the women whose braids were chopped say now? And, did a year of fear and panic leave us any wiser?

In Kanganhedi, a village of 700 houses on the Delhi-Haryana border, Munesh Devi's hair has grown back just enough to tie it in a ponytail. A lot more has changed in her life since last year besides her hairstyle. ""I can no longer work in our field. I hardly leave the house, except being taken to the doctor by my son every two weeks. Any exertion leaves me tired. Even going to funerals gets up my blood pressure. I lie in bed almost all day. Daughters-in-law press my feet.They also bring me rotis to eat in bed,"" said Devi, sitting on a double bed in the living room. Its doors remain shut and its light dimmed to prevent Devi's recurring headache.

They began in July 2017, immediately after she found her braid chopped at the neck. It was there when she finished feeding the cows in the family's farm, she said, but gone when she got back home and slipped back her pallu. ""Must have gone missing while I was travelling home on the back of my son's motorcycle,"" she added. She remembers fainting after the realisation struck. She continues to feel giddy. ""My head spins. My whole body aches. My feet go numb. My teeth hurt."" She doesn't know what ails her; neither does her doctor. He prescribes her pills for each of her symptoms. She shows off the stash to people asking her how she has been doing since ""the incident.""

Munesh Devi's was one of three braids found missing in the area in the course of one eventful day. The other two women don't know, either, who chopped their braids or why they continue to suffer. Sri Devi said she lost her braid while sitting on a couch in the courtyard of her house. One moment it was hanging down her waist, the next moment it was lying on the floor. She had heard of the braid-chopping phenomenon only hours before. ""My uncle, who was visiting us from Pataudi, had told me about a video he had seen on Facebook. I said, 'Mama, please don't say such things.'"" Her son had called 100 after she fainted at the sight of her severed braid. ""The police are yet to tell us if they found anything,"" she said.

Devi also visited a psychiatrist in Dwarka along with her son, at the urging of the police. ""He asked my son some questions. Gave us no answers,"" she said. Her braid was taken away by a forensics team sent in by the police for further investigations. ""We haven't heard from them."" Perturbed by three incidents in a week, people in the village even consulted a tantrik (mystic). ""He spoke about the presence of a mysterious cat in the village. But no such cat or dog has been found,"" she said.

For many women, the disappearance of braids has been transformative. It has allowed them rightful rest after a lifetime's slog at home and farm, won them the nurturing attention of their families, and given them the chance to talk about themselves for the first time. The third ""victim"" in Kangnahedi, Ombati, a daily-wage labourer who found her braid gone while working around the house, is still waiting for her life to change, however. ""No government compensation, no one has even come to offer me a glass of juice,"" she said, lying on a cot and complaining of a headache.

""We sent a team to that village for a couple of hours after a request from the concerned division of the Delhi police, but we haven't received any formal communication from the top brass,"" explained Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, which had investigated the phenomenon of Delhi's Monkey-man in 2001. ""From the preliminary impressions of our team, in all probability, the incidents in Kanganhedi fit into the pattern of mass hysteria, which tends to subside on its own.""

In Kashmir, the last region to be swept up in the storm, over 100 FIRs were registered over six months. Many women alleged masked men entered their homes when they were alone, sprinkled sedatives in the air, and chopped their braids while they lay unconscious. Separatist leaders accused the Indian government, and armed militants suspected the evil hand of intelligence agencies. As locals flooded the streets in protest, shutting down shops and schools, the police resorted to extreme measures, from announcing an award of Rs 6 lakh for information to unleashing riot-control tactics to disperse the crowds. Several vigilante groups armed with lathis and axes emerged to patrol the streets at night. A 70-year-old man in Anantnag died after being hit by a brick by a group of people who suspected him to be a braid chopper.

But now, police say the paranoia and panic was fuelled by nothing substantive.

""Almost all the cases turned out to be without any substance. There were a few cases where the women had cut their hair themselves. In one case, a maid had cut the hair of a girl,"" said additional director general of police (law and order), Muneer Khan. In Kulgam, where 21 cases had been registered, the state government had formed a special investigation team(SIT). Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Kulgam, Aijaz Ahmad, who was part of the SIT, said that most of the cases have been closed because the allegations had no factual basis.

""In some of the cases, the culprits remain untraced, while maximum cases turned out to be of hysteria,"" Ahmad said. He said the lack of a single eyewitness in all of the cases was particularly baffling.

Across the valley, the police arrested between 70 and 80 people, including members of vigilante groups, for ""raising false alarm about braid chopping and creating disturbances"".

""We felt that this [braid chopping] was being done by agencies. It was a matter of honour of our women. Everybody wanted this should end. Stone pelting was the only option with us. Surprisingly it did end abruptly after that,"" said a villager from north Kashmir who requested anonymity. Some of them are still visiting the courts for hearings.

It was around 5pm on July 29 last year when Manpreet Singh Sahani climbed on the ledge of his fifth-floor apartment. As he teetered on the edge, neighbours and witnesses on the street below called out to him but could only watch helplessly as he jumped. Initial investigations by local police and testimonies of his friends exposed talk of the Blue Whale Challenge. Several of them took to social media to blame the game and link it to Sahani's death.

In 24 hours, reports of the supposedly lethal game had inundated media, and reports of copycat cases were streaming in from all parts of India, ratcheting up paranoia about mobile phone and internet use among teenagers and their parents. Over the next two months, more than 150 deaths or injuries across the country were alleged to be linked to the game.

But while police initially suspected the boy was an avid gamer and could have been influenced by the Blue Whale Challenge, detailed investigation indicated more offline triggers.

""The boy was in love with a girl who had left him for some other boy. We had gone through his email accounts and mobile phone and found a draft on the phone which clarified his intention to commit suicide,"" said Navin Reddy, deputy commissioner of police Zone 10.

This might not be an isolated phenomenon. Earlier this year, Union minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir told Lok Sabha that a committee formed under the chairmanship of the director general of the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) couldn't establish the involvement of the Blue Whale Challenge in any case.

""The committee analysed the internet activities, device activities, call records and other social media activity, other forensic evidences and also interacted with rescued victims associated with these incidents,"" the minister told the lower house.

Of course, by then several other central ministries, a number of state governments, the Central Board of Secondary Education and even the Supreme Court had got involved, with the apex court calling the game a ""national problem"".

But experts say official agencies may have jumped the gun. ""It was definitely a hoax. We need to shift focus from these voyeuristic things and to suicides, which is a big problem that kills a quarter of a million people. Some of these hoaxes have a life of their own because media makes them into a big story. We need long-term institutional solutions,"" said Soumitra Pathare, director of the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy.

Back in St Mary's hill, Chandra Maya Sarki has gone back to her old routine -- wake up at the crack of dawn to draw water, fix food for her husband before he leaves for his daily wage work, and then clean their small wooden house. She likes to keep the television on and stray dialogues from the afternoon soaps animate the living room. She stares not at the screen, however, but at the the small framed photo of Sarki hanging on the blue wall, wondering why the mysterious admins of the Momo Challenge chose her child as their prey.

She doesn't know yet that the cyber cell of the West Bengal police has completed its forensic probe of his phone and found no trace of any Momo Challenge. ""If any application is downloaded, the forensic machine would find a trace, even if it is an unknown application. But we have found no such application, or any message on WhatsApp motivating people to play the game. We have found nothing so far,"" said a senior official of the cyber cell on the condition of anonymity.

She doesn't know that police has ruled out any links between the game and the death of Aditi Goyal and that at least two other cases in the state have been found to be hoaxes traced back to mischief makers sending scary messages through WhatsApp. She doesn't know that Sarki's teacher Sarita Sharma has a simple explanation for why he and his friends would go to the graveyard at night -- the mobile network was the best at that spot.

All she knows is that her beloved younger son will no longer come back home at 8pm every day. That she will never make him his favourite meal of dal-aloo and dum-eggs. The money she had been saving with her husband to send him to Bengaluru for higher studies now seems meaningless. Sometimes she talks to Sarki's sister, now in college, about him and the day that took him away from her. She will probably never know what really happened to Sarki or what troubled him enough to withdraw from his friends. Momo Challenge or not, that is the biggest tragedy of all.

Many of my best friends think that some of my deeply held beliefs about important issues are obviously false or even nonsense. Sometimes, they tell me so to my face. How can we still be friends? Part of the answer is that these friends and I are philosophers, and philosophers learn how to deal with positions on the edge of sanity. In addition, I explain and give arguments for my claims, and they patiently listen and reply with arguments of their own against my - and for their - stances. By exchanging reasons in the form of arguments, we show each other respect and come to understand each other better.

Philosophers are weird, so this kind of civil disagreement still might seem impossible among ordinary folk. However, some stories give hope and show how to overcome high barriers.

One famous example involved Ann Atwater and CP Ellis in my home town of Durham, North Carolina; it is described in Osha Gray Davidson's book The Best of Enemies (1996) and a forthcoming movie. Atwater was a single, poor, black parent who led Operation Breakthrough, which tried to improve local black neighbourhoods. Ellis was an equally poor but white parent who was proud to be Exalted Cyclops of the local Ku Klux Klan. They could not have started further apart. At first, Ellis brought a gun and henchmen to town meetings in black neighbourhoods. Atwater once lurched toward Ellis with a knife and had to be held back by her friends.

Despite their mutual hatred, when courts ordered Durham to integrate their public schools, Atwater and Ellis were pressured into co-chairing a charrette - a series of public discussions that lasted eight hours per day for 10 days in July 1971 - about how to implement integration. To plan their ordeal, they met and began by asking questions, answering with reasons, and listening to each other. Atwater asked Ellis why he opposed integration. He replied that mainly he wanted his children to get a good education, but integration would ruin their schools. Atwater was probably tempted to scream at him, call him a racist, and walk off in a huff. But she didn't. Instead, she listened and said that she also wanted his children - as well as hers - to get a good education. Then Ellis asked Atwater why she worked so hard to improve housing for blacks. She replied that she wanted her friends to have better homes and better lives. He wanted the same for his friends.

When each listened to the other's reasons, they realised that they shared the same basic values. Both loved their children and wanted decent lives for their communities. As Ellis later put it: 'I used to think that Ann Atwater was the meanest black woman I'd ever seen in my life ... But, you know, her and I got together one day for an hour or two and talked. And she is trying to help her people like I'm trying to help my people.' After realising their common ground, they were able to work together to integrate Durham schools peacefully. In large part, they succeeded.

None of this happened quickly or easily. Their heated discussions lasted 10 long days in the charrette. They could not have afforded to leave their jobs for so long if their employers (including Duke University, where Ellis worked in maintenance) had not granted them time off with pay. They were also exceptional individuals who had strong incentives to work together as well as many personal virtues, including intelligence and patience. Still, such cases prove that sometimes sworn enemies can become close friends and can accomplish a great deal for their communities.

Why can't liberals and conservatives do the same today? Admittedly, extremists on both sides of the current political scene often hide in their echo chambers and homogeneous neighbourhoods. They never listen to the other side. When they do venture out, the level of rhetoric on the internet is abysmal. Trolls resort to slogans, name-calling and jokes. When they do bother to give arguments, their arguments often simply justify what suits their feelings and signals tribal alliances.

The spread of bad arguments is undeniable but not inevitable. Rare but valuable examples such as Atwater and Ellis show us how we can use philosophical tools to reduce political polarisation.

The first step is to reach out. Philosophers go to conferences to find critics who can help them improve their theories. Similarly, Atwater and Ellis arranged meetings with each other in order to figure out how to work together in the charrette. All of us need to recognise the value of listening carefully and charitably to opponents. Then we need to go to the trouble of talking with those opponents, even if it means leaving our comfortable neighbourhoods or favourite websites.

Second, we need to ask questions. Since Socrates, philosophers have been known as much for their questions as for their answers. And if Atwater and Ellis had not asked each other questions, they never would have learned that what they both cared about the most was their children and alleviating the frustrations of poverty. By asking the right questions in the right way, we can often discover shared values or at least avoid misunderstanding opponents.

Third, we need to be patient. Philosophers teach courses for months on a single issue. Similarly, Atwater and Ellis spent 10 days in a public charrette before they finally came to understand and appreciate each other. They also welcomed other members of the community to talk as long as they wanted, just as good teachers include conflicting perspectives and bring all students into the conversation. Today, we need to slow down and fight the tendency to exclude competing views or to interrupt and retort with quick quips and slogans that demean opponents.

Fourth, we need to give arguments. Philosophers typically recognise that they owe reasons for their claims. Similarly, Atwater and Ellis did not simply announce their positions. They referred to the concrete needs of their children and their communities in order to explain why they held their positions. On controversial issues, neither side is obvious enough to escape demands for evidence and reasons, which are presented in the form of arguments.

None of these steps is easy or quick, but books and online courses on reasoning - especially in philosophy - are available to teach us how to appreciate and develop arguments. We can also learn through practice by reaching out, asking questions, being patient, and giving arguments in our everyday lives.

We still cannot reach everyone. Even the best arguments sometimes fall on deaf ears. But we should not generalise hastily to the conclusion that arguments always fail. Moderates are often open to reason on both sides. So are those all-too-rare exemplars who admit that they (like most of us) do not know which position to hold on complex moral and political issues.

Two lessons emerge. First, we should not give up on trying to reach extremists, such as Atwater and Ellis, despite how hard it is. Second, it is easier to reach moderates, so it usually makes sense to try reasoning with them first. Practising on more receptive audiences can help us improve our arguments as well as our skills in presenting arguments. These lessons will enable us to do our part to shrink the polarisation that stunts our societies and our lives.

The district education officers have been directed to help the schools dispose of these to create more space for students. Every school has piles of junk items- from broken fans to old furniture pieces - occupying at least one classroom. The department is struggling to accommodate extra students as enrolments in the government schools have shot up in the last few years.

This is first of its kind collective decision taken by the department for clearing junk items from schools can help department by creating additional space in all schools. Along with additional space, the department is also eyeing to generate revenues by auctioning the junk items. The decision would also help the department saving crores as they don't have to construct additional classrooms.

The move came after department officials inspected several schools to learn that almost all schools have several articles lying without any use. State has over 71,000 schools. The department is expecting to generate space equivalent to the around 2,000-3,000 classrooms.

""Since the enrolments in government schools have shot up by 18 lakhs in the last five years. Most of the senior secondary schools have junk occupying a space equivalent of a classroom. This space once cleared can be used to accommodate more students by adding an extra section or a class. The exercise will help in making optimum utilization of resources. The additional space created for fee would save department's crores of rupees,"" said a department official.

The department is taking the scheme very seriously that they have formed nodal officers to monitor the progress of the scheme. Every school has to list such articles and to be submitted to the district education officers. The last date for submitting the list to the district level officers is January 11 and auction will take place on January 18.

""It is a great policy decision. Schools struggle to find a way to depose off the junk pending from years. This decision would help the schools to keep the classroom neat and clean,"" said Ameen Kaimkhany, president of Rajasthan Urdu Teachers Association."

The International English Language Testing System or IELTS is available in two types: Academic or General Training. The Academic format of IELTS is for individuals who want to study or train in an English-speaking university or institutions of higher education. The General Training format focuses on basic survival skills in a broad social and educational context and is for those who are going to English-speaking countries to do secondary education, work experience, migration, or training programmes. If you are applying to US universities, you take the IELTS Academic test.

IELTS Academic test is accepted by over 10,000 education and training institutions across the world, including over 3,300 educational institutions in the US. The test is offered in both paper and computer-based forms through over 1,200 locations in 140 countries. In India, the test is administered through over 90 authorised test centers in 54 cities. Full list of testing locations may be found at the following website https://www.ielts.org/book-a-test/find-a-test-location

The registration fee for IELTS test in India is Rs 12,650. To register for the test, find the nearest test centre and register online. A valid identification document is required to be able to register. You may also register for the test through IDP or British Council websites, the official IELTS administering entities in the country:

https://www.ieltsidpindia.com/Registration/ielts-test-dates-india

https://www.britishcouncil.in/exam/ielts/registration

IELTS Academic tests four English language skills of candidates - listening, reading, writing, and speaking. The total duration of the test is 2 hours 45 minutes. The listening test is of 30 minutes duration, wherein the test taker listens to recordings of native English speakers and responds to a series of questions based on the recordings. The reading and writing sections are 60 minutes each. Reading test involves reading passages and responding to questions based on the passages. In the writing test, test takers describe some visual information (graph/table/chart/diagram) in their own words and also write an essay in response to a point of view, argument, or problem.

Q. I have plans to be in the United States for pursuing my higher studies next year. Hailing from a middle class family, I have to look forward to support myself as far as possible. It will really help me if details and procedures on applying for a job after joining the university are explained. Are there any restrictions on number of working hours for a student who works on the university campus?

- Akshay Kumar, Mettuguda

A. As also mentioned in an earlier column, most international students in the United States go on an F-1 (non-immigrant) student visa. On an F-1 visa, a student is eligible to work only on the campus of their university. Immigration laws of the USA do not allow international students to work off-campus during their studies. On-campus work opportunities are also limited to up to 20 hours per week during the academic semester and up to 40 hours per week during school breaks. Also, please take note that you are eligible for on-campus employment only while you are enrolled full-time in an academic programme.

The on-campus work depends on availability of such positions. If a department/ college offers assistantships, you may apply for the same during your application or after admission. Most of the time, an assistantship means that the student does not pay tuition and receives a scholarship or stipend that can cover some portion of accommodation, meals, books and some personal expenses. The sum paid for assistantship varies by State, town, university, etc. Assistantships are available to students in the form of Teaching Assistantships (TA), Graduate Assistantships (GA), and/or Research Assistantships (RA) wherein students help their departments with teaching, research, both teaching and research, or other department/college work. You may look up the department/college webpage or contact the department for further information about assistantship options. You may also apply for other on-campus jobs that are generally advertised through a student job portal by most universities. There is competition for all open positions, so you should plan to apply as early as possible. Also, have a close look at the eligibility criteria before applying for the position.

F1 students can also avail Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and Optional Practical Training (OPT) after completing one year of coursework. CPT is an off-campus internship or practicum in a major field of study and requires pre-approval by the international student office of your university. OPT is also off-campus work for which you may apply after completion of an academic degree. It is 12 months of work directly related to your academic major, extended up to 24 months for STEM fields.

Q. I am in third year of MBBS. My friends told me about USMLE is required to practice in the US. Can you share details?

The meeting was conducted after 302 workers affiliated to the union were transferred to other states after they had struck work for 100 days seeking benefits.

The collector asked the management to revoke the transfers and asked the union to abandon the strike announced from December 26. He asked the parties to report to the next meeting on January 8.

Members of KMPTOS, under the All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), had been striking work from August 21 to November 29 seeking benefits such as education allowance, dress allowance and bonus. The union members alleged that the management was being partial to them and had been denying benefits.

After a meeting with labour department officials and the management in Chennai on November 26, they called off the strike. But the management transferred more than 300 workers involved in the strike to its plants in Uttarakhand, Pune and Andhra Pradesh.

P Natarajan, president of KMPTOS said the management, during negotiations in Chennai, had said they would not take any revenge measures, but the transfers were acts of revenge.

R Malarvannan, chief people officer of Pricol Limited, said the transfers were necessitated by the business model where the firm's clients wanted to place orders within the vicinity of their plants. He said the workers were transferred because of this. ""The collector asked us to discuss with the management about revoking the transfer orders. But, we told him that it might not be possible to reconsider transfers. The transfers are not permanent. Already, 20 workers have reported for work,"" he said."

The probe transmitted images live as it ascended and acquired data on air pressure, temperature and altitude, said Vignesh Karthikeyan, who built the gadget that was fitted with telemetry equipment and a high definition camera.

Close to 1,000 students watched in awe as the probe was launched using large helium balloons as part of a space exploration and awareness programme at Kovai Vidya Mandhir school. Former ISRO's radar department head G Viswanathan was present at the event.

""In India, we are not allowed to build and launch our own rockets. We can build a satellite, but we could launch it only through Indian Space Research Institute,"" said Karthikeyan, who has been working on various science projects for education to create more awareness on space exploration among the school and college students.

Working within the country's legal frames, Karthikeyan built a probe titled MaxQ Beta 1.1 Femto Satellite that could be launched with a helium balloon. ""The balloon contained around 10-14 cubic feet helium, which was heavy enough to lift the probe. Helium balloons automatically rise due to change in density and pressure, which in turn gives it a life force. The balloon was tethered to the ground through four points, allowing us to monitor and bring down the probe carefully after it reached a stipulated altitude and time,"" he said.

Trilochan Mohapatra, Secretary of the Department of Agricultural Research and Education and Director General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), has called upon farmers in the State to explore the potential of integrated farming with maximum diversification to meet challenges in the agriculture sector.

Opening a seminar on 'Fair agricultural practices' as part of the launch of the Advanced Facility for Post Harvest Technology at the Indian Institute of Spices Research (IISR) here on Saturday, Mr. Mohapatra, a prominent agricultural scientist, pointed out that the possibilities of combination crops should be tried at all possible fields, and that their export potential for more revenue should be explored.

""The Indian agriculture sector has grown to unparalleled heights, and we are not just producers to meet our own demands now. For a majority of farmers, export is a source of steady revenue to flourish,"" said Mr. Mohapatra. He added that research and inventions by agricultural scientists were opening doors to such a coverable progress in the country in terms of increased agricultural production and marketing.

""The only challenge now is the yet-to-be proportionate growth in revenue for farmers despite a rise in production. It is a problem of plenty which we can survive with better planning and marketing strategies,"" he pointed out.

According to him, focus should be laid on efforts to make farming lucrative with newer marketing strategies.

Speaking on research activities taken up by ICAR, Mr. Mohapatra said climate change had emerged as a major concern for farmers where researchers can contribute more in the future.

""The development and supply of seed varieties with strong resistance to unexpected climate changes continue to be a major area of research, and we have plenty of such newly developed plant varieties to support farmers,"" he said.

On the Centre's move to equip all research organisations better with the most effective tools for farmers, Mr. Mohapatra said one of the priority areas while facing unexpected challenges was the development of seed farms with public-private partnership. ""In the case of Kerala where the floods hit farmers' livelihood, the department had made all possible efforts to supply them with the required quality seeds and plants to venture again with confidence. We also initiated an impact study in the State to offer suggestions on addressing farmers' concerns,"" he said.

ICAR Deputy Director General (Horticultural Science) Anand Kumar Singh, Assistant Director General T. Janakiram, and IISR Director Nirmal Babu were present at the function.

Three latest technologies developed by IISR to fight pest infestation in spice cultivation were launched on the occasion.

Students of degree colleges and those pursuing professional courses are still waiting for the free laptops promised to them by the government in the 2017-18 budget. The Education Department is yet to call for tenders to procure them.

Worse, it does not have the funds to fulfil the promise to the nearly three lakh students. This includes first year students of government degree colleges, and medical, engineering, dental, polytechnic, and para-clinical courses.

The department currently has around ₹300 crore for this purpose. However, Higher Education Minister G.T. Deve Gowda said they need at least around ₹400 crore.

Snags and red tape

The tender for the laptops for the previous academic year was initially called in February and there were no bidders. Manufacturers had reportedly sought changes in technical specifications. There was also a delay because of the model code of conduct for the Assembly elections.

A House committee was formed to look into the matter after the former Commissioner of the DCE M.N. Ajay Nagabhushan had objected to floating a tender with four packages.

He had written to the then Chief Secretary stating that a single tender for the laptops should be called. He had also pointed out that calling for a tender in four packages would lead to huge cost variations and increase the cost per laptop.

The three products -- Lecanicillin-G, Bacillich and Pochonin-L -- were released by Trilochan Mohapatra, Secretary of the Department of Agricultural Research and Education and Director General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), during his visit to the IISR campus on Saturday.

Lecanicillin-G will be available to farmers for the biological control of cardamom thrips.

The field application technology was developed using a naturally occurring entomopathogenic fungus isolated from cardamom thrips and identified as Lecanicillium psalliotae.

Scientists associated with the technology say the treatment with the fungus is on a par with synthetic chemical insecticides.

The second product, Bacillich, is useful in controlling bacterial wilt in ginger caused by Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum.

The bacteria was isolated from the apoplastic fluid of ginger and identified as Bacillus licheniformis. According to scientists, the use of this technology is eco-friendly and very effective in combating bacterial wilt pathogen.

Pochonin-L, a liquid formation for biocontrol, is effective in preventing root knot which is prevalent in south India's pepper gardens.

Currently they are managed through the application of chemical nematicides.

The fungus attacks all stages of nematode egg, parasitizes the eggs and sedentary females.

Arguing that specialist formula is not a breast milk substitute, the industry has been aggressively marketing it and using it to forge close ties with healthcare professionals in the UK and globally by sponsoring medical education and research on allergies, the article points out.

This has echoes from the recent controversy in India where the formula industry was accused of trying to circumvent the Infant Milk Substitute (IMS) Act -- a law to prevent predatory marketing practices of baby food companies - citing special nutrition needs of babies born with metabolic errors or allergies that might not allow breastfeeding. It had wanted specialist formulas to not be categorized as infant milk substitute (IMS) in an attempt to stay out of the Act.

According to the BMJ article by Chris Van Tulleken of the University College, London, overdiagnosis of the allergy could undermine breastfeeding. Between 2006 and 2016, in the UK, prescriptions of specialist formula milks for infants with cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) increased by nearly 500%, while National Health Service (NHS) spending on these products increased by nearly 700% from 8 million pounds to over 60 million annually, noted the article, adding that epidemiological data gave no indication of such a large increase in prevalence of the allergy. This raised the question of industry-driven overdiagnosis through funding and influencing of research, guidelines, medical education and public awareness drives on the allergy.

Referring to how the industry targets framing of treatment guidelines, Bob Boyle, deputy medical director and consultant paediatrician from the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust was quoted as stating: ""There are many more milk allergy guidelines published than for other food allergies. Many have direct or indirect support from industry, which has a lot to gain from increased specialised formula use."" Many of the symptoms listed in these guidelines are so broad that virtually every infant could be diagnosed as having an allergy, pointed out another practitioner.

In India too, the food safety and standards authority of India (FSSAI) had constituted a steering committee that included the infant and young child nutrition council of India (IYNCI), a front organization for baby food manufacturers with four of the biggest baby food companies - Abbott, Danone, Mead Johnson and Nestle -- as members. The move to exempt food for special medical purposes (FSMP) from the IMS Act came from this steering committee. Though the IYNCI was dropped from the committee following protests by nutrition experts, paediatricians and the breastfeeding promotion network of India (BPNI), the FSSAI pushed ahead with the exemption for FSMPs.

The food regulator also partnered baby food companies to launch an initiative called Diet4Life, a platform used by these companies to sponsor awareness programs for paediatricians, dieticians and parents, ostensibly to educate them about management of inborn errors of metabolism and allergic conditions in children. Under the IMS Act, baby food companies cannot sponsor healthcare providers or market infant milk substitutes. Doctor Arun Gupta of BPNI had pointed out that it was to circumvent these restrictions that the industry was lobbying hard for its products to be taken out of the categorization ""infant milk substitute"".

The UK has no law like India's IMS Act. All it has is the international code of marketing of breast milk substitutes adopted by the WHO in 1981 after egregious marketing practices of these companies were exposed in the 1970s. Though the code includes marketing restrictions and states that companies cannot sponsor educational events or advertise anywhere within the health system, there have been frequent and widely reported allegations of code violations across the world.

The Indian Academy of Paediatrics resolved more than two decades ago that it would ""not accept sponsorship in any form from any industry connected directly or indirectly"" with products covered by the IMS Act. In contrast, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health accepts funding from Danone and Nestle. The RCPCH website claimed that it only accepted advertising or conference stands providing information about specialist formulas (FSMP), not breast milk substitutes. The British dietetic association with input from the British society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and British society for allergy and clinical immunology (BSACI) all accept funding from baby food companies. The British dietetic association has Abbott, Mead Johnson, and Danone Nutricia as strategic partners and Vitaflo (Nestlé) and Friesland Campina (a global formula producer) as key supporters, pointed out the article.

Most healthcare players who take money from baby food companies say their sponsorship relates only to specialist formulas. But Nigel Rollins from the World Health Organization's department of maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health confirmed to Tulleken that specialist formulas are unequivocally breast milk substitutes in the eyes of WHO and are thus covered by the code. The belief that specialist formulas are exempt from the code may be enabling manufacturers to justify this network of links with clinicians and institutions to pursue a wider agenda, stated the article.

Many clinicians and patients have also expressed concern on the availability of industry-funded online information promoting non-specific symptoms potentially indicating cow's milk allergy in exclusively breastfed infants. This is despite evidence showing that though cow's milk and other food protein can be transferred from mother to infant in breast milk, the quantities transferred are likely to be too small to cause symptoms in most infants. Amy Brown, professor of child public health at Swansea University, said that concerns about breast milk sufficiency or content was one of the main reasons for mothers stopping breastfeeding and the promotion of cow's milk allergy to the public by industry played to this anxiety."

The state education department has roped in the institute for a detailed study of 4,600 merged schools to find out if the reorganisation has brought about any improvement or not, department officials said.

The reorganisation exercise of schools had also caught the interest of IIM Bangalore, which expressed its willingness to carry out a study on the process and its benefits, said the secretary.

The council said that a four-step process -- field inspection; cross-district verification; block and district consultation; and final notification -- was undertaken to merge the schools.

Singh said that 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools had been shifted and 96% of the students had expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty in shifting 150 schools due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue has been resolved, and students from 120 schools have been shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students, giving them better teacher availability, and cut the requirement of 4,500 teaching positions. The merger process saved the government Rs 400 crore by reducing teaching positions and infrastructure requirements, said JEPC officials.

Right To Education (RTE) helpline was launched recently by the Social Welfare Department of Karnataka, which allows one to lodge complaints and get information on the Act. The Executive Director of the Child Rights Trust, Vasudeva Sharma, spoke to RadioActive about how the helpline could be used effectively.

Vasudeva Sharma explained that the RTE Act had been introduced way back in 2009 in Karnataka, and a lot of calls used to be received by the Child Rights Trust members on their personal numbers seeking clarifications. Even though there were no instructions available regarding RTE at that time, they used to clarify or give information in a comprehensible way. Of late, the calls had been about more specific and less common information.

He said they had attempted to set up a hotline back then, which failed because their personal numbers were still popular. The new helpline would have to have employees well-versed in the intricacies of RTE - the national Act as well as the rules for Karnataka and section (12)(1)(C), because (12)(1)(C) was often misused.

He spoke about the dangers of (12)(1)(C) being misused and despite it having popular aspects like forbidding corporal punishment, or stating the kinds of facilities an institution must have, how that could cause people to lose trust in it. It gave the impression that (12)(1)(C) was introduced as an attempt to control private institutions, as the condition laid down for availing this provision spoke only of what was expected of the institutions without placing any responsibility on the government. With the rampant misuse of this section, private institutions became richer but could not be brought under the control - and that such situations would lead to mistrust in the RTE Act itself.

Vasudeva Sharma said that he used to find a lot of children in government schools, but of late the number had been dwindling because they had moved to private schools. However, over time, parents were faced with demands for multiple additional payments. This at times forced the children back into government schools, and other times, they continued education there despite the heavy expenditure.

He also proposed some solutions:

On the move to make 8th standard the equivalent of 10th standard, Vasudeva Sharma said that though there had been discussions, the Central Government was yet to make a decision. He opined that it could not be taken without thorough discussions and analysis but was apprehensive about the imbalance a positive answer would create.

Vasudeva Sharma said that ignorance among activists and officials will deprive the children of the rights extended to them by the government. He suggested that guidelines be prepared wherein the responsibilities of each official is clearly mentioned and that such clarity would enable effective implementation of the Act.

He added that ignorance causes lack of coordination between the concerned departments and organisations, which could lead to failure of the programme."

Each year on the 22 December, schools and educational institutes around the country observe and celebrate National Mathematics Day.

And while not everyone feels the need to celebrate mathematics, the day is observed not to honour the field as a whole, but a very special Indian mathematician whose trust with mathematics has inspired books, art and our tradition to commemorate the genius of Srinivasa Ramanujan on 22 December each year - his birth anniversary - as National Mathematics Day.

Born in 1887 in the charming city of Erode, Tamil Nadu, Ramanujan's earliest stories begin around the age of 12. He had mastered the dizzying logic of trigonometry and developed theorems on his own without any assistance.

His passion for mathematics and the brilliance of the world it translated to at an early age.

The wiz kid

Turning 10 years old in 1897, he aced his primary school exams in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in his district. Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School that year, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.

By age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students lodging at his home, and was lent a book on advanced trigonometry around the same time. He mastered this by age 13, by which time he was discovering sophisticated theorems on his own.

Ramanujan at 14 was being lauded with merit certificates and academic awards in a trend that weaves through his entire school career, where he also assisted the school with logistics of placing 1200 students, each with needs of their own, under the tutelage of its 35-odd teachers.

He would complete mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and unwittingly brought on comments from his peers over the years, who ""rarely understood him"" and ""stood in respectful awe"" of him in the years since.

Awakening the genius

Ramanujan at age 16 in 1903 got access to a library copy of a book - A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, a collection of 5,000 mathematical theorems, which he reportedly studied in great detail. This book is generally acknowledged by accounts of his life as a key element in awakening his genius.

Towards his schooling's end, this earned him a scholarship to study at the Government Arts College of Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu. His headmaster in school would introduce Ramanujan as ""the outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum"". But he squandered the opportunity due to his horrendous performance in other important subjects, including English, philosophy and Sanskrit.

Without a formal degree, Ramanujan is said to have dropped out of college and pursued research in mathematics on his own, living in stark poverty, at the brink of starvation. It was in 1910 at age 23 that support from renowned mathematician Ramaswamy Iyer helped him scored a job clerking at the Madras Port Trust.

Cambridge calling

He would work at the office by day, and do what came naturally to him (theoretical mathematics, that is) in his spare time. British mathematician G Hardy wrote Ramanujan a letter in 1913, expressing interest in learning more about his work. It was ""essential that I should see proofs of some of your assertions"", he is said to have added.

Ramanujan responded to Hardy, who eventually became his mentor, on principles of mutual interest to them, saying:

""I beg to introduce myself to you as a clerk in the Accounts Department of the Port Trust Office at Madras... I have no University education but I have undergone the ordinary school course. After leaving school I have been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at Mathematics. I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed in a University course, but I am striking out a new path for myself.""

G Hardy and Ramanujan ended up working together in Cambridge for five years shortly after their first correspondence. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles, but his work in Mathematics made a left a deep impression on Hardy for years to come. Hardy was quoted to have said about Ramanujan in a book:

""He could remember the idiosyncrasies of numbers in an almost uncanny way. It was Littlewood (a mutual colleague) who said that every positive integer was one of Ramanujan's personal friends. I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. ""No,"" he replied, ""it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.""

A self-made luminary

Born to a housewife and a sari clerk, his family home in Kumbakonam was small and modest. The modest thatched-roof house on Saranhapani Sannidhi Street has been turned into a museum in his honour.

Ramanujan was a self-taught mathematician. He contributed inordinately to the world of mathematics, and was globally popular - one of the most influential mathematicians of his time. From compiling over 3900 mathematical theorems and equations to having discoveries and streets named after him, his assertions in mathematics were unshakeable and profound to others researching mathematics."

""All schools in the state, both private and government, need to abide by the vacation schedule. They will have to follow rules set by the state government,"" said Premlata Yadav, district elementary education officer.

Yadav said that the schedule had been sent to all the block education officers and block elementary education officers who were responsible for passing forward the message to all schools.

Private schools in the city, however, said that they had not received any circular from the education department.

""We had not received any notification about the schedule till Friday evening. Our school will not have classes from December 29 till January 14.

By default, we will be going on vacation around the same time,"" said Sunita Nagpal, principal of Delhi Public School, Sushant Lok.

Nagpal said that most independent schools usually followed their own vacation schedules.

Nidhi Kapoor, principal of Euro International School, said that the school had not received any circular about the vacation schedule. ""We follow our schedule and will be going on vacation from December 31 till January 6. If the government recommends additional holidays owing to future weather conditions, we will be bound to follow them,"" said Kapoor.

All government schools have been notified about the schedule and will be following the same. ""We have received the schedule and will be following the rules,"" said Suman Sharma, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Sector 4/7, Urban Estate, said."

The Himachal Pradesh high court has asked the state's Elementary and Higher Education Department to apprise it of the government's mechanism to check absenteeism among school teachers.

A division bench of justices Dharam Chand Chaudhary and Chander Bhusan Barowalia Thursday ordered the department's director to file an affidavit detailing the mechanism to check the malady in the state's school.

The bench passed the order while dismissing an appeal by a teacher whose absence from the school had been treated by authorities as ""dies non"".

""Dies non"" means a day which is not treated as a day on duty. While it does not constitute a break in the service, the period does qualify as service for pension benefits or increments.

In its order, the bench asked the director if any mechanism has been enforced by the department to ensure that the teachers attend their schools every day and do not proceed on leave without getting it sanctioned.

The bench also asked as to what was the provision for informing the school in case of a teacher proceeding on an emergency leave. Seeking the affidavit within two weeks, the bench adjourned the matter for next hearing on January 7."

AFTER SCIENTISTS, it was the turn of 500 research scholars from reputed research institutions and universities in the city to hit the streets on Friday and register their protest. They formed a human chain and took out a silent march against the delay by the Union government in announcing a hike in their fellowship stipends.

Since July this year, students from a number of national-level research laboratories had demanded an 80 per cent increase in their fellowship stipends. Currently, the stipend is Rs 25,000 and Rs 28,000 for a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) and a Senior Fellowship Fellow (SRF), respectively. The research scholars have also demanded the setting up of a committee to monitor all kinds of student-related activities, including timely disbursement of stipends.

Representing city-based institutes -- CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER), Pune, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) and Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), the students were part in a nationwide protest by 1.5 lakh researchers across the country on Friday. Holding placards, they marched from the main gate of IISER to SPPU, along Pashan Road.

Students from various IITs, NITs, central and state universities and IISERs held similar rallies at their respective parent institutions.

""Ours is a legitimate demand and the government must not make us resort to protests every four years. This time, we have been seeking a stipend hike for over six months. But the government has not made any formal announcements yet,"" said a senior IISER scholar, who said he has not received his stipend for the last five months.

Officials of the main funding agencies -- Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Department of Biotechnology ( DBT) -- have said the process to revise fellowship stipend hike was underway and a favorable announcement could be expected by the month-end.

On Friday, a group of student representatives also met Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, DST. These students said the government was considering a hike similar to previous revisions, which was realised in 2014, 2010 and 2006.

The students, however, threatened to take their protests to the next level if the government failed to come up with a formal announcement within the next 10 days.

""We do not like protesting but what is the way out when the government does not recognise and revise the stipends within regular intervals? If no positive announcement is made by the end of December, we will collectively stage a larger protest in front of the Ministry of Human Resource Development and DST in January,"" said a student representative from IISER, Pune."

Two years back when theatre director Nimi Ravindran, 43, got a grant to teach theatre to students at a public school, she was confident her fluency in the local language, Kannada, would be enough to communicate with the students. Instead she found that all but one of 20 fifth graders at a Kannada-medium public school in Bengaluru's Marathahalli area spoke Bengali.

""Most of them said they were from West Bengal. I wondered what these children were doing so far from home,"" Ravindran said. As she started conducting workshops in Hindi, that the children were somewhat familiar with, their stories started flowing.

""They spoke about the trees near their homes, the spirits that lived in them and the clean air. They missed their home,"" Ravindran recalled.

The Sundarban delta--nearly one million hectare in area--is formed at the point where the rivers Ganga, Brahmaputra and Meghna merge into the Bay of Bengal. The delta is extremely fertile as the three rivers carry an estimated one billion tonnes of sediments.

Nearly 40% of Sundarban--the world's largest mangrove forest, three times as large as Goa--is in India, the rest is in neighbouring Bangladesh.

Sundarban (literally 'beautiful forest') features in the list of UNESCO's 209 natural heritage sites in the world for supporting ""an exceptional level of biodiversity in its terrestrial, marine and aquatic habitats"".

Over the last 40 years, Sundarban has lost 220 sq km--nearly the size of Kolkata--to the sea, according to Sugata Hazra, director of the School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University.

As rising sea levels engulf entire islands, residents are migrating en masse, from the Bangladesh as well as the Indian side of Sundarban.

Not all are environmental migrants, but with no documentation of this kind of migration, the numbers are hard to estimate.

But ripples of this migration are being felt over 2,000 km to the southwest. As many as 40% of students in some Kannada-medium government schools in Bengaluru speak Bengali, according to the Samridhdhi Trust that runs bridge schools to help these children cope.

IndiaSpend tracked some of these migrants from Sundarbans to the Kalihata slum in east Bengaluru's Marathahalli area. Studies show that several districts of West Bengal, not just in Sundarban but across the state, are extremely vulnerable to the impact of climate change.

By 2060, nearly 1.4 billion people across the world will be at risk of becoming environmental migrants, some internal and others flocking across borders. The annual rate of sea level rise is expected to triple by the year 2100, making agriculture as well as everyday life in low-lying places, like Sundarban, unsustainable.

This is the third story in our series on how climate change is disrupting people's lives (you can read the first story here and the second here). The series combines ground reporting from India's climate change hotspots with the latest scientific research, and highlights how people are adapting to the changing climate.

The Sundarban delta, home to the world's largest mangrove forest, is at risk from rising sea levels because of global warming.

One in 10 individuals living in a low-lying coastal area on this planet is in India. Along with China, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam, India has the highest population that will be exposed to the impact of flooding and extreme weather events that the rising sea will bring, according to a 2015 study.

Human activities have already caused global warming by 1 degree Celsius, according to the September 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world body for assessing science related to climate change. Governments of 195 countries are on this panel.

""Over 90% of the heat trapped in the climate system is actually in the oceans. As the oceans warm, just like liquid in a thermometer, it expands and (the) sea level rises,"" said John Church, research scientist and one of the lead authors for the chapter on sea level rise in the IPCC's fifth assessment report.

Melting of non-polar ice, like that in the Himalayas, the thermal expansion of oceans as they warm, and the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are pushing up global sea levels.

""With unmitigated emissions the sea level rise could be as much as one metre by 2100,"" Church said. If the entire ice sheet over Greenland were to melt, that alone would cause global sea levels to rise by seven metres. If all the ice sheets in Antarctica melt, it could push the levels up by another 55 m.

A video by the European Space Agency (ESA) explaining what contributes to sea-level rise.

Sea levels will continue to rise not just through the century but well past 2100. For people living on small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas, this means, at best, that more salt water from the sea will enter their fields making the soil unsuitable for agriculture, there will be increased flooding, frequent cyclones and infrastructure damage. At worst, it means the piece of land they call home would be under water.

Scanty research on the India side of Sundarban

The changing climate in the Bangladesh side of Sundarban is well documented but not much is known about the Indian side, according to Selvin Pitchaikani, an oceanographer at the Institute of Environmental Studies and Wetland Management (IESWM) in Kolkata.

Pitchaikani, who published his data on the changing weather patterns in Sundarban in 2017, found that the land is increasingly growing saline and that cyclonic storms have become frequent. Rainfall patterns have already changed, making conventional cultivation difficult for farmers, his research found.

But ""to come to any conclusion, we need data for a minimum of 20-25 years. We need more weather stations in the region as well as funding"", he said emphasising the need for more research.

With migration, children grow up without a parent, fewer people to care for the elderly

It's a four-hour car ride from Kolkata to the Sundarban delta region. Once here, a car becomes useless. To reach the island of Mousuni, it's another hour-long journey of switching between electricity-powered rickshaws while on small stretches of land, and small boats to cross the streams.

Electricity reached Mousuni--one of the larger islands in the delta with a population of over 25,000--a year ago, trailing climate change by decades.

Mousuni is an island in the Sundarban delta with a population of over 25,000 residents. Frequent floods and the rising sea level have forced many to migrate from Mousuni.

Sheikh Sufi, 27, grew up in Mousuni. His home is on the coast overlooking the Bay of Bengal. ""We used to grow rice and chillies but a decade back there was severe flooding. After that the crops haven't grown,"" Sufi said, holding his three-year-old son Abdul Rehman over his shoulder. Once their land became infertile due to salt water, they learnt to fish. Now, six months a year, Sufi travels over 2,000 km to Kerala to work as a construction worker earning about Rs 300 a day.

Like Sufi, nearly 96% of these environmental migrants are headed to other areas within India, according to a study of 1,315 households in the region. The study was conducted by Deltas, Vulnerability & Climate Change: Migration and Adaptation (DECCMA), a consortium of researchers from universities in UK, Ghana, Bangladesh and India.

Of these migrants, 83% are men and 17% women. Most are young; between the ages 21 and 30. The men interviewed for the study said they were moving for employment opportunities as agriculture was unsustainable. The women were moving to either join their husbands post marriage or to live with other family members.

Left behind are the elderly, children and most women.

""There are two types of migrations--proactive, who plan their retreat from the coast in advance and reactive, who move only when there is no other alternative left. In Sundarban we are still witnessing reactive migration,"" said Indrila Guha, principal at Basanti Devi College, Kolkata and a researcher in environmental economics.

Children growing up without a parent, fewer people to care for the elderly, and poor women who could become easy targets for traffickers, are some of the potential fallouts of this situation, according to Guha.

For the ones who move with their families in tow, life continues to remain tough. The children in Bengaluru's bridge schools struggle to adjust to life in the city, the language barrier making it even more challenging for them to adjust. Parents frequently move in search of jobs and education is one of the first casualties.

Residents adapt to rising seas

As the onslaught of the sea continued, Sufi's home was reduced to rubble. During high tide, the sea waves wash away chunks of his house. On a low tide day, like the one when IndiaSpend visited, his home provides a view of the sea that tourists scout the globe for.

Sufi, his wife and young son live with a neighbour. ""We have no money to build another home. Where can we go?"" he said, with eyes downcast.

Sheikh Sufi, 27, outside his destroyed home in Mousuni. Sufi works as a construction worker over 2,000 km away in Kerala for six months in a year.

""We have no policies directed at rehabilitation and resettlement of people who have lost their land due to sea level rise and coastal erosion,"" said Hazra, of Jadavpur University.

Rainfall is usually heavy, and severe cyclonic storms frequent. This area receives 1,501-2,500 mm of rainfall, compared to the Indian average of 801-1,500 mm.

Those who haven't migrated try to adapt. Shabir Sheikh, 27 and Khushbanoo Bibi, 25, married for 12 years, are constructing a new home for themselves and their three children, on higher ground.

""During floods, the stove gets wet and so we are making sure in the new home it will be higher so flood waters don't reach it,"" Khushbanoo said. Most women here cook in the open, on mud stoves and firewood, which makes it impossible to cook during the floods.

Shabir Sheikh and his wife Khushbanoo Bibi's new home is being built at a higher level to keep flood waters at bay.

The government is helping by building embankments along the coast to stem the flood waters, and flood shelters to accommodate those affected by floods. There are no long-term policies to help relocate and rehabilitate residents.

Double burden of rehabilitation and poor health in Sundarban

Globally, of the regions in the low lying coastal areas at the risk of flooding, most are underdeveloped or developing.

Nearly a third of the children under the age of five in South-24 Parganas, the district where Mousuni is, are stunted--short for their age. Half of the households still lack modern sanitation facilities and as many six in every 10 women are anaemic. Yet, the district is now having to prioritise infrastructure to deal with climate change.

Depending on the material used to build the embankment, a one-km long section could cost as much as Rs 1 crore. As seas rise, locals plead for the government to build more walls even as they are aware that these are just short term measures against climate change.

Threat to biodiversity

More than 200 species of plants, 400 species of fishes and 300 species of birds, numerous phytoplankton, fungi, bacteria, zooplankton, reptiles, amphibians and more call Sundarban their home. Even within Sundarban, species differ depending on the salinity of the soil. Sundarban is also home to many threatened and endangered animals like the Royal Bengal tiger, estuarine crocodile and the Indian python.

The changing temperature of water and increased salinity and acidity in the soil has already impacted the region's biodiversity, according to studies by the Marine Science Department of Calcutta University and the Department of Biological Science of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Kolkata.

While the rising sea level impacts biodiversity, experts also blame human activity. ""If, for instance, there were no obstructions on the major rivers and flows were not diverted, eroded material would have reached the delta,"" said Anurag Danda, senior advisor for Climate Change Adaptation at the World Wildlife Fund.

""Between the Tehri dam (Uttarakhand) and Farraka barrage (Murshidabad, West Bengal), there are at least 1,000 interventions along the Ganges that either divert water or hold water resulting in much reduced sediment delivery,"" he explained.

Problems for nature and man will continue to grow as sea levels continue to rise, scientists say. ""The question would be not whether it would happen but how quickly it would happen,"" Church, co-author of the latest IPCC report, said.

What is the way out for those living along the coastline? Planned retreat to safer places, aided by the government, is the main option, Hazra said. ""It will be economically beneficial as a whole rather than keeping people there and rebuilding embankments."""

It is being reposted from The Quint's archives to on the birth anniversary of Srinivasa Ramanujan)

It all began with a series of letters back and forth between two of the unlikeliest of people.

In 1913, mathematician GH Hardy - arguably, a genius himself, received a 10-page letter from a shipping clerk in Madras. He could have ignored it just like the two other mathematicians who received the letter; except, we could have possibly missed out on the mathematical genius of Srinivasa Ramanujan. Perhaps it was the introduction of the letter that captured Hardy's imagination enough to move him to respond.

""Dear Sir, I beg to introduce myself to you as a clerk in the Accounts Department of the Port Trust Office at Madras on a salary of only £20 per annum. I am now about 23 years of age. I have had no University education but I have undergone the ordinary school course. After leaving school I have been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at Mathematics. I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed in a University course, but I am striking out a new path for myself. I have made a special investigation of divergent series in general and the results I get are termed by the local mathematicians as 'startling.'""An excerpt from the first letter Ramanujan sent to GH Hardy.

What is to be noted is that the selected 100 or so seductive mathematical theorems he sent to Hardy were not supported by much proof. That's where his genius - some would say, mere intuition - comes into play. He would go on to tell Hardy that each equation related to God, in some way, and that Goddess Namagiri (his ancestral deity) would put the equations on his tongue when he was asleep. Hardy, a staunch atheist, saw past the religiousness, a superlative mathematician. What ensued remains one of the most significant scientific partnerships till date.

Hardy reached out and encouraged Ramanujan to come to Cambridge. After much persuasion to go against his religion's theology that forbade crossing the seas, Ramanujan found himself in a university known for breeding prodigies. Under the mentorship of Hardy, which came with its own complications, Ramanujan was able to devise, imagine, prove, disprove - call it whatever you may - mathematical theorems never thought of before. In a memorial speech at Harvard in 1936, Hardy said, ""They [Ramanujan's theorems] must be true, because if they were not true, no one would have the imagination to invent them.""

It has received singular attention as early as 1991, when MIT Professor Robert Kanigel wrote the critically acclaimed biography The Man Who Knew Infinity: The Genius of Ramanujan. Twenty-five years later, Matthew Brown has released a full-length Hollywood feature film by the same name, starring Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) as Ramanujan, and Jeremy Irons (Kafka, The Lion King) as Hardy. Brown succeeds in portraying this friendship beautifully.

They are two men so fundamentally different. Ramanujan was a Brahmin Indian from Madras with no formal education, who believed a formula had no meaning unless it expressed a thought of God. Hardy, on the other hand, was a revered professor at the prestigious Trinity College at Cambridge University and also an avowed atheist. It is an incredible story of how two people were able to overcome their personal differences to form one of the greatest collaborations in the history of mathematics. Ramanujan went on to become the first Indian to be both a Fellow of Trinity College and the Royal Society. While they eventually connected and published great works, there was a cost that came in that Ramanujan's life ended all too soon. It is a very tragic story.Matthew Brown, speaking to The Indian Express.

The first look is enough to draw the viewer in. Cinematics hots of Madras in the early years of the 20th century, Ramanujan losing himself in a frenzy of numbers that come to him in his dreams, his time at Cambridge under the mentorship of Hardy, and the obvious challenges of being an uneducated, poor Indian genius in England during the First World War.

Differences of culture, religion and race are plenty; the overcoming of them - or not - provides for sufficient drama to gorge on. Below, a scene from Brown's movie lays out the tension between two people united by their passion for mathematics.

At the Harvard conference, Hardy summarised his relationship with Ramanujan succinctly. Looking back at the years between 1913 and 1919, Hardy said, ""It was the one romantic incident in my life.""

""But not in a knickers-shredding sort of way,"" Jeremy Irons explained at the screening of the movie at the Toronto International Film Festival, as reported by Metro News. ""It's a romance of a shared passion.""

It is safe to say that the chemistry, the tension and the back and forth initiated by Hardy on mere intuition influenced Ramanujan's mathematics immensely. Hardy himself was one of the forefathers of pure mathematics in England, and served as a father-figure to Ramanujan; a distant, impersonal father who was the ideal taskmaster and had high expectations of Ramanujan.

Was he the best friend the man from a small town in Madras could have had in a foreign country? Possibly not, comments Kanigel in an interview with The Hindu. But, was it the friendship the world needed to discover the bright spark of the genius who knew infinity? Yes.

Then be prepared to take traffic lessons from the cops for three days at the B Division Traffic police station located in Navrangpura. After the lessons you will have to serve with the traffic cops for an hour at one of the city junctions to regulate traffic flow.

Traffic police began offering the innovative punishment to traffic rule violators caught on Friday at Mithakhali Six Roads. In all, 17 traffic rule violators agreed to take lessons for an hour for three days and serve with traffic police at one of the junctions. Their names will be put on the traffic police portal.

This is the latest innovative idea floated by the traffic cops as they don't want youngsters zooming through city streets on their bikes to fall in to legal trouble.

""The FIRs registered against them could prove a hindrance for them in obtaining a lot of identity documents including passports. We don't want that to happen and hence we will be giving them a choice -- either face an FIR or take lessons and manage traffic for one day,"" said inspector K D Nakum of traffic department.

While traffic norm enforcement is getting stringent with every passing day and a lot of commuters, especially those used to driving without helmets are being fined the new innovation by the traffic department, gives a positive chance to start following traffic norms said Rahul Naik, one of the youngsters stopped by cops for driving a two-wheeler without a helmet.

""On the first day of the drive 17 youths agreed to our proposal of sparing three days to learn traffic rules and regulations, one hour per day and to serve one day with the traffic police at one of the traffic junctions to manage traffic for the fourth day of their choice"" said Nakum.

A traffic official said on the choice of taking lessons, ""If the offender agrees to go through the learning process we take a written undertaking and consent from him. We then call him to B Division traffic police station to coach him in traffic norms and regulations.""

In another, new initiative the traffic police is thinking of writing to principals of schools of colleges whose student is found violating traffic rules. ""This will encourage traffic norm education in school and colleges,"" said a senior traffic department official."

At present, teachers whose retirement date falls after June (beginning of an academic year) are given extension till March-April (end of the academic year). Given the surplus teaching strength in government schools, school education department officials said the extensions were causing an additional financial burden in terms of monthly salaries.

A government order released in connection with this stated that there will no more re-employment of teachers who retired at the age of 58. The practice of re-employing retired teachers began in 1959 when there was a shortage of teachers and government found it difficult to find replacements in the middle of an academic year. This in turn had an adverse impact on the students' academic performance. To avoid this, teachers were allowed to serve till the end of the academic year.

On an average, 2,500 teachers retire each year and 500 of them receive extensions, shows data. But now TN has 15,000 surplus teachers, claim government reports. With 2.3 lakh teachers, the teacher:student ratio is around 1:25. Despite lack of subject teachers and existence of single-teacher schools, it is comfortably above national average.

So, re-employment of retired teachers was an additional financial burden and doing away with it won't impact the students, read orders issued by Pradeep Yadav, state school education secretary. Also, most of the teachers are not allotted classes regularly and some are promoted to do administrative work in district-level education department offices, it added. The GO exempted schools where there are no surplus teachers.

In a related development, the government has decided to take strict action against teachers who go on unauthorised leave. District and chief educational officers have been instructed to take strict action against such absentees, failing which disciplinary proceedings will be initiated against them, read a circular sent to schools. The circular warned that pension and other benefits of teachers who die during such unauthorised leave period will be stopped."

It is a mammoth task for the government who has look for those MLAs who can influence the policies and programmes which suits their party ideology. The model code of conduct may have lifted but it continues in the varsity as the administration is yet to function.

Syndicate is an apex body which is responsible for taking all decisions. The body can function without its MLAs by meeting the minimum quorum as per their acts but the fear of objection by them prevents them to hold any such meeting in their absence. ""The university is all set to introduce three new courses and rise in the fees by 10%. It is awaiting the syndicate node which has not taken place due to polls.

The names of two more schools that were shut down are yet to be announced by the education department.

The drive follows the death of two Class I students last week after the wall of an unauthorised school in Sector 101 collapsed on children writing an exam in the open. KM Public School, where the accident took place, had been shut down last year. But it reopened after a few months under a different name.

Bal Mukund Prasad, the basic siksha adhikari, said the exercise to weed out illegal operators would continue over the next few weeks. The education department has formed two teams of four members each to inspect schools on a daily basis. Officials said there were many schools that were affiliated to some board or the other but did not have the permits to operate.

Officials in the education department said they had come across several schools that had reopened with a different name after being ordered to shut down, like the one where the accident happened.

""We have informed all departments concerned in the district that while schools operating without licences will be shut down immediately, those trying to reopen schools after being told to shut could face legal action,"" Prasad said."

However, in order to get an exact figure of the number of school going children and to find out their needs, the school education department is conducting the survey.Over 160 teachers will take part in the survey exercise that will start at 8.30 a.m. The TNSCB has requested at least one member of the family to stay at home. ""The teachers will go door-to-door to find out the number of children and if they are going to school. They will also understand the needs of the children including the medium of education they prefer and what is lacking in the schools in the colony,"" said an official from the school education department.

Based on the survey, the School Education Department will conduct a meeting and decide upon amenities in the schools and upgrading the existing ones. Proposals for the same would be sent to the government.

""We have directions from the government to start a primary school immediately, if necessary. If the students need English-medium schools, we will send proposals for the same,"" added an official from the department. According to the TNSCB officials, the exercise will be carried out in other resettlement colonies soon.

Meanwhile, parents said the main problem they face was the improper functioning of government schools. ""They don't complete the syllabus on time. Besides, the special care given in government or Chennai schools in the city is not found here. This is the reason why many take loans and shift their children to private schools,"" said a parent."

The Congress legislature party leader Ajay Kumar Singh Lallu accused the Yogi Adityanath-led UP government of hiding the encephalitis death figures of the Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRD) in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh by barring the media and not releasing the daily bulletin.

He also walked out from the assembly along with other party MLAs over this issue.

Raising issue of the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur during the last day of UP assembly proceedings on Friday (December 21), Lallu said, ""The government is muzzling the democracy by suppressing information about deaths that take place due to encephalitis. The media is not being allowed to enter inside encephalitis ward. The daily medical bulletin is also not being released.""

Replying to the Congress MLA, UP Health Minister Siddharth Nath Singh said, ""We don't want to create any controversy but the media has been restricted because critical patients are admitted there.

The onus of action is on government because it is the single agency which can regulate both the implant manufacturers and the physicians.

The recent exposé of the poorly regulated medical device industry by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and The Indian Express highlights a matter of grave concern. The worldwide investigations revealed flaws in the medical device market in more than 36 countries. But in my opinion, the India revelations are the most serious and, unfortunately, the most worrisome because we have seen in the past that despite evidence against offenders, hardly any action is taken against them. A similar investigation, the Panama Papers by the ICIJ, did not result in any punitive action in our country (though cases are pending before courts of law) even when in Pakistan a court case sealed the fate of a sitting prime minister in the same scandal.

The exposé has not only thrown up some disturbing facts on medical devices and their poor regulation but has also exposed the intrinsic faultlines in the Indian healthcare system. The ""Implant Files"" show that from the implant manufacturer to the treating physician, impunity pervades the system. The findings make us understand that the interplay between the device manufacturer (or supplier), the end-user, namely the physician, and the regulator, namely the government, is not only complex but also full of opportunities for financial gain and hence wrongdoing is becoming the norm, not the exception.

The implant market in India should thus be seen in the context of the implant manufacturer, the physician and the government. Of the three arms of this unholy trio, the device manufacturer is the one who is exceptionally brazen as we have already seen in the Johnson & Johnson hip replacement case. What more should we expect from a multi-national company? It should be clear to us that the implant manufacturers who bring their stuff in the Indian market do so only for one purpose -- to earn money.

The implant industry in India is currently valued at $5.2 billion and contributes 4-5 per cent to the $96.7 billion Indian health care industry. This huge amount is up for grabs and to believe that the implant manufacturers will not be using this opportunity to earn by all means, legal or otherwise, would be naive. In the process of implant promotion, the expose has shown how gimmicks like live surgeries are arranged by multinational implant companies. These ""live surgeries"" are performed by both national and international experts. In this regard, the stories of Rameshbhai Dodhiya, Dinesh Pillai and Raman Singh, as revealed in this paper, are a chilling reminder of how these companies can behave if surgeries go wrong.

Advertising

The culpability for this should be equally shared by the operating surgeon, the implant manufacturer and the local surgeon who organises the live surgery. But in the absence of specific regulating guidelines, implant manufacturers continue to organise such live surgeries over gullible patients in the name of ""professional education programmes and continuing medical education"", as has been revealed by the Implant Files. Multinational implant giants should be made to realise that implant misuse is as grave an offence in India as it is in western countries. The arrogance of the multinational implant companies in India needs to be urgently reined in.

The second weak link in the Implant Files is the treating physician. The exposé has shown that freebies are distributed among doctors by the implant and pharma companies to promote their products. Implant Files revealed that the cardiac stent manufacturer, Medtronic, gave away Rs 50 crore worth of freebies as ""product giveaways"" to doctors over four years. Doctors becoming ""brand ambassadors"" for drugs and implants is an open secret in the Indian medical bazaar.

The poor reporting of adverse events for a drug or an implant by the treating physician is rampant in India. The expose showed that till 2014, adverse events were hardly reported by the Indian physicians or the manufacturer. Even after the formation of what is called the ""Medical Device Adverse Event"" (MDAE) report, the initial reporting of adverse events was minimal. Compared to this, the exposé revealed that in the UK regulators received 62,000 ""adverse incident"" reports linked to medical devices between 2015-18.

The inappropriate behaviour of the Indian physician has led to the erosion of trust among patients. No wonder the physician, considered to be God by a large chunk of Indian patients, is fast losing the halo. Unfortunately, the regulation of the Indian physician is also not a streamlined process. The confusion within the administration of the Medical Council of India (MCI), with multiple laws passed every other year for the governance of the apex body, has only added to the inappropriate behaviour of the Indian physician.

The MCI or any physician regulating body which replaces it in future needs to be robust in taking immediate punitive action against doctors involved in misappropriation of implants and drugs. It is worth mentioning that the General Medical Council (GMC), the physician regulating body in the United Kingdom, is a doctor administered body which has formulated strict laws for its own doctors. We need to learn from the GMC.

Finally, the onus of implant misappropriation lies with the government because it is the single agency which can regulate both the implant manufacturers and the physicians. A political will in this respect is essential. The exposé has shown that device companies in India are not regulated as per local standards but are dependent on the standards set by either the European regulators or the American FDA. This is a major loophole which is used by the implant manufacturers. The Implant Files reveal that successive governments in India have neglected the medical device sector.

The proposed Medical Device Regulation Bill is still to see the light of day. First drafted in 2006, it is interesting to note that in 2016 it was decided that the bill be converted and introduced only as medical device rules and regulations, applicable from 2018. The Implant Files revealed that this delay in bringing a law and converting it into an executive order was because the bureaucracy of the day felt that a separate bill will bring in ""more control"" and ""curtail growth and innovation"" in the medical device industry.

We can very well imagine that if there is reluctance in the highest offices of the executive, it will be nearly impossible to regulate this ever expanding market of implants in the country. In fact, the Implant Files reveal that under the new rule, despite an estimated 5,000 medical devices being sold in the country, the categories of medical devices ""notified"" and, therefore regulated, number only 23. This is a serious flaw in a market which is supposedly the fourth-largest in Asia after Japan, China and South Korea. The regulations in these three countries are not only robust but also more people friendly.

The Implant Files thus reveal a serious illness within the Indian medical implant and device market. This market is expected to grow to $50 billion by 2025. The onus of regulation of this ever growing market solely rests on the government of the day. For my fellow physicians, I am reminded of what Friedrich Nietzsche had once said, ""I am not upset that you lied to me, I am upset that from now on I can't believe you.""

A new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. (Mohit Suneja/HT)

To the world, Manish Sarki was the perfect all-rounder.

A strapping boy of 18, Sarki worked hard in school during the day and sent fielders scurrying after his shots at the neighbourhood cricket ground in the evenings. He would never get home later than dinner time even when his friends were out chatting, his mother Chandra Maya remembers, and his closest friends joked about how he would blush talking to girls.

Everyone in the village of St Mary's Hill knew Sarki would grow up to be a policeman or join the army. Maybe because he was so well-behaved, no one noticed when he went quiet. They only noticed on the night of August 20 when he didn't come back home.

The village gathered around the Sarki house around 9pm. A chill was enveloping the small mountain village on the outskirts of Darjeeling in northern Bengal, but a small group of men and women trekked to the local police station a couple of kilometers away. Boys go missing all the time, they were told.

Undeterred, the villagers split into smaller search parties and fanned out into the jungles, determined to find Sarki. Their hopes were dashed around 1.30am when a search team stumbled on Sarki's body hanging from the ceiling of an empty pig warehouse on top of a hill.

Below, in spray paint, were the words ""half blood prince was here"" in what everyone recognised was Sarki's handwriting. On the wall behind was drawn a hangman with two victims, an older boy, and more chillingly, a younger one. Every wall of the building had been scribbled on - the words ""illuminati"", ""last king"", ""savage"", ""doped up"" and the number ""666"" appearing repeatedly.

In the light of day, some of the graffiti might have appeared benign - after all, some the walls displayed banalities like ""be the change you want to see"" or ""the thing you fear the most is fear itself"". But in the eerie quiet of a cold mountain night, the villagers were convinced Sarki's death was the doing of the satan. ""I was heartbroken for my son but also scared out of my wits. We were all scared about who the younger boy could be,"" said Chandra Maya.

By the time police arrived two hours later, a mist of rumours had cloaked the village. Wasn't Sarki always on his phone for the past few weeks? And, wouldn't he go out to the graveyard, barely a kilometer away, every night with his phone? ""I think he was going crazy. That's when I heard about the game,"" added Chandra Maya.

By sunrise, everyone had heard of the game: a shadowy application called the Momo Challenge that had apparently killed Sarki. Several explanations were offered. ""For the past few days, he was very sad and distracted. He would be lost in his phone. He never said anything to me, later I found out that he was playing the Momo game,"" said Sarki's friend Deekchen.

But how did he find out? Villagers say the local police first told them of the game, but the police deny ever saying anything. ""In fact, we have not been able to confirm any role of any Momo Challenge game. We never told the locals about the game. Maybe the graffiti made them think that,"" said Hare Krishna Pai, additional superintendent of police.

'HI, I AM MOMO. LET US PLAY A GAME'

The next day, a second death, that of 26-year-old Aditi Goyal in Kurseong town, was also attributed to the Momo Challenge, turning the creeping fear into full-blown panic. By then, local politicians had put out statements about the supposedly lethal game, and everyone in the hills was talking about it.

""The whole area was in trauma and everyone was scared of their phones. We found young boys from Class 7 had started playing it. We started spreading awareness and seized phones from those who seemed vulnerable. Someone even sent a message to my daughter,"" said Raju Gurung, a local from Kurseong.

Hindustan Times spoke to at least 20 people in the area and everyone claimed to know a relative, friend or neighbour who had had a close shave with the game. But everyone had a different notion.

Some described the game, which supposedly sets self-harm challenges that finally end in suicide, as an app, some as a Whatsapp message. Some said they received texts, some described a phone number. Indeed, beyond the ubiquitous image of the oblong faced, bulbous eyed doll that has come to signify the game, every detail was foggy. ""Sometimes people are faking names and photos and sending messages 'Hi, I am momo. Let us play a game.' The fear of the game has hypnotised us,"" said Junita Rana, a schoolteacher in Kurseong.

AN EPIDEMIC OF FEAR

It began with the braids. In June last year, a girl in Rajasthan claimed someone chopped off her braid while she was asleep. Dozens of women across Rajasthan followed up with similar claims. Over the following months, the pattern spread across north India like an epidemic: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi. By November, over 200 cases of braid chopping had been reported in Kashmir where the trend took its most vicious turn. Many women claimed to have seen Godmen, witches or cats before losing their consciousness. After finding their braids gone, many complained of aches and pains for days after. The police couldn't really find any culprits, so the people took the matter in their hands. In August, a poor woman was killed by a mob in Agra on the suspicion of chopping braids. In October, an old man in Anantnag was killed for the same reason.

Then there was the Blue Whale. In July, a schoolboy's suicide stoked the hysteria around the web-based game created by a Russian tech geek targeting teengers. The 50 challenges begin differently-- from shutting yourself in or watching a horror film-- proceed incrementally, and end the same way: suicide. Through 2017, more than 150 cases of young suicides across India -- West Bengal, Delhi, Indore, Solapur, Dehradun-- were blamed on the Blue Whale, often with no more proof that the young person was obsessed with smartphone and videogames. Every case was rife was contradictions and yet, websites were blocked, advisories issued, and in some cases, smartphones banned in schools.

FACE-RIPPERS AND VAMPIRES

Experts say that underneath the web-fuelled hysteria, something more sinister is going on with the mental health of young people. Samir Parikh, director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, insisted that we cannot dismiss these phenomena, but the focus should be on greater media literacy, on making children understand what is right and wrong content, and on teaching people to seek help if they are feeling vulnerable.

""Is there a component of hysteria in all this? Of course, there are lots of stories in the media and they have an impact. But we cannot deny the fact that there are pressures and problems that young people go through silently. If help and access is not given, they can be misused,"" he added.

Parikh is clear that any approach that aims at shutting down access to the internet is wrong, mainly because it is impossible. ""We need to understand that be it Blue Whale or Momo, if you are vulnerable, you might be pulled towards it. So you give people skills and teach people to not bottle it up, tell parents, block or involve authorities.""

India has had a long history of public panic. From a half-man half-monkey roaming the streets in Delhi, sometimes wearing a helmet, to the Munhnochwa (face ripper) of Mirzapur, claimed to be a flying object emitting beams of green or red light, sending shock waves through anyone who came in its contact, and leaving them with bites and scratches on their faces, to the Rathakaatteri (vampire) of Gundalpatti who allegedly sucked the blood of the village cattle, a new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. Many of these have been analysed as incidents of mass hysteria. The patterns have been revealing. Women are more likely to end up as victims than men, children turn to be more vulnerable than adults. The trends pick up in regions or communities marked by oppression of women, economic uncertainty or social anxiety.

Yet, questions remain about why a particular fear grips a set of people at a given time. Did every woman who complained of braid chopping do it herself? Was every alleged case of Blue Whale suicide made up by the parents or the police to evade responsibility? What do the women whose braids were chopped say now? And, did a year of fear and panic leave us any wiser?

LOSING BRAIDS, EARNING REST

In Kanganhedi, a village of 700 houses on the Delhi-Haryana border, Munesh Devi's hair has grown back just enough to tie it in a ponytail. A lot more has changed in her life since last year besides her hairstyle. ""I can no longer work in our field. I hardly leave the house, except being taken to the doctor by my son every two weeks. Any exertion leaves me tired. Even going to funerals gets up my blood pressure. I lie in bed almost all day. Daughters-in-law press my feet.They also bring me rotis to eat in bed,"" said Devi, sitting on a double bed in the living room. Its doors remain shut and its light dimmed to prevent Devi's recurring headache.

They began in July 2017, immediately after she found her braid chopped at the neck. It was there when she finished feeding the cows in the family's farm, she said, but gone when she got back home and slipped back her pallu. ""Must have gone missing while I was travelling home on the back of my son's motorcycle,"" she added. She remembers fainting after the realisation struck. She continues to feel giddy. ""My head spins. My whole body aches. My feet go numb. My teeth hurt."" She doesn't know what ails her; neither does her doctor. He prescribes her pills for each of her symptoms. She shows off the stash to people asking her how she has been doing since ""the incident.""

Munesh Devi's was one of three braids found missing in the area in the course of one eventful day. The other two women don't know, either, who chopped their braids or why they continue to suffer. Sri Devi said she lost her braid while sitting on a couch in the courtyard of her house. One moment it was hanging down her waist, the next moment it was lying on the floor. She had heard of the braid-chopping phenomenon only hours before. ""My uncle, who was visiting us from Pataudi, had told me about a video he had seen on Facebook. I said, 'Mama, please don't say such things.'"" Her son had called 100 after she fainted at the sight of her severed braid. ""The police are yet to tell us if they found anything,"" she said.

Devi also visited a psychiatrist in Dwarka along with her son, at the urging of the police. ""He asked my son some questions. Gave us no answers,"" she said. Her braid was taken away by a forensics team sent in by the police for further investigations. ""We haven't heard from them."" Perturbed by three incidents in a week, people in the village even consulted a tantrik (mystic). ""He spoke about the presence of a mysterious cat in the village. But no such cat or dog has been found,"" she said.

For many women, the disappearance of braids has been transformative. It has allowed them rightful rest after a lifetime's slog at home and farm, won them the nurturing attention of their families, and given them the chance to talk about themselves for the first time. The third ""victim"" in Kangnahedi, Ombati, a daily-wage labourer who found her braid gone while working around the house, is still waiting for her life to change, however. ""No government compensation, no one has even come to offer me a glass of juice,"" she said, lying on a cot and complaining of a headache.

""We sent a team to that village for a couple of hours after a request from the concerned division of the Delhi police, but we haven't received any formal communication from the top brass,"" explained Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, which had investigated the phenomenon of Delhi's Monkey-man in 2001. ""From the preliminary impressions of our team, in all probability, the incidents in Kanganhedi fit into the pattern of mass hysteria, which tends to subside on its own.""

MASKED MEN OR MAIDS?

In Kashmir, the last region to be swept up in the storm, over 100 FIRs were registered over six months. Many women alleged masked men entered their homes when they were alone, sprinkled sedatives in the air, and chopped their braids while they lay unconscious. Separatist leaders accused the Indian government, and armed militants suspected the evil hand of intelligence agencies. As locals flooded the streets in protest, shutting down shops and schools, the police resorted to extreme measures, from announcing an award of Rs 6 lakh for information to unleashing riot-control tactics to disperse the crowds. Several vigilante groups armed with lathis and axes emerged to patrol the streets at night. A 70-year-old man in Anantnag died after being hit by a brick by a group of people who suspected him to be a braid chopper.

But now, police say the paranoia and panic was fuelled by nothing substantive.

""Almost all the cases turned out to be without any substance. There were a few cases where the women had cut their hair themselves. In one case, a maid had cut the hair of a girl,"" said additional director general of police (law and order), Muneer Khan. In Kulgam, where 21 cases had been registered, the state government had formed a special investigation team(SIT). Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Kulgam, Aijaz Ahmad, who was part of the SIT, said that most of the cases have been closed because the allegations had no factual basis.

""In some of the cases, the culprits remain untraced, while maximum cases turned out to be of hysteria,"" Ahmad said. He said the lack of a single eyewitness in all of the cases was particularly baffling.

Across the valley, the police arrested between 70 and 80 people, including members of vigilante groups, for ""raising false alarm about braid chopping and creating disturbances"".

""We felt that this [braid chopping] was being done by agencies. It was a matter of honour of our women. Everybody wanted this should end. Stone pelting was the only option with us. Surprisingly it did end abruptly after that,"" said a villager from north Kashmir who requested anonymity. Some of them are still visiting the courts for hearings.

BLUE WHALES AND PHONE BANS

It was around 5pm on July 29 last year when Manpreet Singh Sahani climbed on the ledge of his fifth-floor apartment. As he teetered on the edge, neighbours and witnesses on the street below called out to him but could only watch helplessly as he jumped. Initial investigations by local police and testimonies of his friends exposed talk of the Blue Whale Challenge. Several of them took to social media to blame the game and link it to Sahani's death.

In 24 hours, reports of the supposedly lethal game had inundated media, and reports of copycat cases were streaming in from all parts of India, ratcheting up paranoia about mobile phone and internet use among teenagers and their parents. Over the next two months, more than 150 deaths or injuries across the country were alleged to be linked to the game.

But while police initially suspected the boy was an avid gamer and could have been influenced by the Blue Whale Challenge, detailed investigation indicated more offline triggers.

""The boy was in love with a girl who had left him for some other boy. We had gone through his email accounts and mobile phone and found a draft on the phone which clarified his intention to commit suicide,"" said Navin Reddy, deputy commissioner of police Zone 10.

This might not be an isolated phenomenon. Earlier this year, Union minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir told Lok Sabha that a committee formed under the chairmanship of the director general of the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) couldn't establish the involvement of the Blue Whale Challenge in any case.

""The committee analysed the internet activities, device activities, call records and other social media activity, other forensic evidences and also interacted with rescued victims associated with these incidents,"" the minister told the lower house.

Of course, by then several other central ministries, a number of state governments, the Central Board of Secondary Education and even the Supreme Court had got involved, with the apex court calling the game a ""national problem"".

But experts say official agencies may have jumped the gun. ""It was definitely a hoax. We need to shift focus from these voyeuristic things and to suicides, which is a big problem that kills a quarter of a million people. Some of these hoaxes have a life of their own because media makes them into a big story. We need long-term institutional solutions,"" said Soumitra Pathare, director of the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy.

THE BIGGEST TRAGEDY

Back in St Mary's hill, Chandra Maya Sarki has gone back to her old routine -- wake up at the crack of dawn to draw water, fix food for her husband before he leaves for his daily wage work, and then clean their small wooden house. She likes to keep the television on and stray dialogues from the afternoon soaps animate the living room. She stares not at the screen, however, but at the the small framed photo of Sarki hanging on the blue wall, wondering why the mysterious admins of the Momo Challenge chose her child as their prey.

She doesn't know yet that the cyber cell of the West Bengal police has completed its forensic probe of his phone and found no trace of any Momo Challenge. ""If any application is downloaded, the forensic machine would find a trace, even if it is an unknown application. But we have found no such application, or any message on WhatsApp motivating people to play the game. We have found nothing so far,"" said a senior official of the cyber cell on the condition of anonymity.

She doesn't know that police has ruled out any links between the game and the death of Aditi Goyal and that at least two other cases in the state have been found to be hoaxes traced back to mischief makers sending scary messages through WhatsApp. She doesn't know that Sarki's teacher Sarita Sharma has a simple explanation for why he and his friends would go to the graveyard at night -- the mobile network was the best at that spot.

All she knows is that her beloved younger son will no longer come back home at 8pm every day. That she will never make him his favourite meal of dal-aloo and dum-eggs. The money she had been saving with her husband to send him to Bengaluru for higher studies now seems meaningless. Sometimes she talks to Sarki's sister, now in college, about him and the day that took him away from her. She will probably never know what really happened to Sarki or what troubled him enough to withdraw from his friends. Momo Challenge or not, that is the biggest tragedy of all.

A recent government resolution (GR) issued by the state education department extended the bonus-marks scheme to the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) students who have participated in national and international events organised by the two associations. Students who take part in the Republic Day parade and related events will get 10 marks while medal winners in these events would be granted 15 marks. Students participating in international youth exchange programmes would be given 20 marks. ""The move intends to increase the participation of students in NCC and Scouts and Guides,"" states the GR.

The GR has also revised the marking scheme for students participating in sports events. Until now, students who participated in district, division and state-level tournaments would be awarded up to 15 marks. This has been scrapped now. Now, only medal winners from these categories would be granted up to 10 marks. Students participating in national and international sporting events would, however, continue to get up to 25 marks.

Schools said the revised policy would encourage students to take up NCC and Scouts and Guides activities.

""A lot of students often don't show interest in the subject as it is only graded. This would push them to look at them more seriously,"" said Shaila Patil, a PT teacher from a suburban school.

In 2016, the state education department introduced bonus marks for Class 10 students excelling in extra-curricular activities to encourage students to pursuing them.

Students could score up to 25 bonus marks as per the policy. With the bonus marks spiking student's scores, the department revised its policy in 2017 capping the maximum marks to 15.

While students can avail these bonus marks from the current academic year, a student can only be awarded a maximum of 25 bonus marks."

However, few among them, mostly land donors are being paid maximum of Rs 1500 a month.

Waheeda Begum, a CPW, despite donating land to the education department to get a sufficient amount is been given a meager salary of Rupees 100 a month to work for 6-7 hours a day.

Appointed in the year 1988, widow and a mother of four, Begum has been serving the Government Middle School (GMS) Chakpath Laripora in South Kashmir's Anantnag district for a meagre amount of Rs 100 which compelled her elder daughter to quit studies in her 9th standard years back.

45-year-old Begum who works in the school as a sweeper from past 30 years while narrating her ordeal of miseries said, ""My father had donated land of 9 Marlas to the education department who in return was promised of a decent salary by appointing any of our family members as a sweeper in the same school constructed in our land, but the department never adhered to their promises and keep on deceiving us by giving a meager amount as my salary.""

She said that her late father Mohammad Ramzan Bhat had also served the same school for many years and he was also been given just Rs 10-25 a month.

""When I was appointed as a sweeper in the schools after my father's death in the year 1988, the education department started giving me 100 rupees a month and till date, no hike has been given by the department, she added.

""There would have a hundred times better outcome if I would have utilized the land for farming purpose rather than donating it to the education department who tricked me to snatch it,"" Firdous said.

He said, ""The School Education Department (SED) is paying chillers and peanuts to us (CPW's) on the name of salary as the majority of us are getting Rs 25, 35, 50 or 100 from the department""

Likewise, another CPW, Nazir Ahmad Khan of Mangam Harshidnar village of north Kashmir's Baramulla district was appointed as a Contingent Paid Worker (CPW) in the year 1997 and is been given Rs 25 salary a month.

Khan said, ""I have donated land of 9 Marlas where government constructed Middle School (MS) in Wagoora zone.

With the donation cheque, Dr. Walser Dental supported the urgently needed acquisition of a trailer specially modified for the needs of the youth fire brigade.

Since their foundation in 2003 the youth fire brigade Beuren a.d.A. has counted continuously between 20 and 30 young members. Thus, the committee and the youth leaders found themselves constrained to acquire a suitable and flexible means of transport. A closed box trailer was the wish of the youth fire brigade. In here they can now transport the baggage and the equipment for the tent camp, like e.g. cots, tables, chairs, tarpaulins and tent poles, dryly to any location.

The closed design of the trailer brings enormous benefits for preparations, since the trailer can already be packed days before the events and can be locked and left outside. The trailer of the youth fire brigade should be used for tent camps, action days, club competitions and club festivals.

The friends' association of the volunteer fire brigade sees its civil and social task as promoting and cultivating the principles of voluntary fire-fighting and youth work. The focus is, that every citizen is given the opportunity to express his interests, his cooperation and solidarity with the volunteer fire brigade Beuren a.d.A. and to assist them in the performance of their duties.

With the aid of the friends' association, topics are to be realized, which are not financially supported by the city of Singen. Like this, the fire brigade of Beuren a.d.A. wants to position itself better in the population in order to constantly address new active members and young people. Courses such as first aiders, fire-fighting training, first aiders for infants, etc. are to be offered. Training sessions on issues such as fire prevention education and appropriate firefighting measures, as well as preventative fire safety measures at home are offered, too.

With a small annual fee of 15,00 EUR anyone can become a member of the association or actively support the association in its various activities or with donations in kind.

The first speaker Dr Anita Kotwani, Professor, Department of Pharmacology, VP Chest Institute, University of Delhi. She spoke on the smart regulation of antibiotic use. She started with a background on what is AMR, and why we are now in the post antibiotics era. Kotwani also covered how smart regulations could redeem the situation.

According to Kotwani, the biggest threat is the increasing use of anti bacterials, which could make them ineffective against common bacterial infections. As a result, the success outcomes of routine surgeries will be hampered which will have grave consequences on patient care and on the economy as well.

She gave a snapshot of some studies done by her to survey the use of antibiotics in the community. The studies threw light in trends like the increasing use of Cephalosporin.

A qualitative study on use of antibiotics found that retail pharmacists were copying the prescriptions of doctors and dispensing antibiotics for common cold, sore throat, diarrhoea. Most of their information comes from medical representatives who give incentives to increase prescription of antibiotics. AMR needs a one health approach for both humans and animals, at both the national and global levels.

The second speaker, Dr Jyoti Joshi, Head-South Asia and GARP, Asia Coordinator, Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy (CDDEP), spoke about an AMR scoping report which revealed that Indians were the largest consumer of antibiotics in 2019, followed by China and the US.

She mentioned that policies and practices have become very defensive as doctors want to save their practice and don't what to be sued. While she appreciated FDCs, she also pointed out how the 118 odd combinations could increase antibiotic resistance levels.

Joshi enumerated the many social factors causing AMR like the trend towards self medication among the general public, perceived patient demand on the part of healthcare practitioners, as well as the heavy patient load in the public sector. Lack of continuing medical education in both the private and public sector makes practitioners seek out and depend on unreliable sources like the Internet or medical representatives.

She also pointed about how the upcoming Kumbh Mela in January 2019 would add to the risk of a rise in AMR as the Ganges is one of the most polluted rivers with high level of antibiotic resistant microbes.

She also pointed out that pharma GMPs do not include environmental safeguards and said that the WHO is working on how effluent norms in pharma GMPs can be tweaked to address AMR concerns."

Asessing a burn wound to know the status of healing is currently done using invasive processes like a biopsy, which is both painful and scarring.

Now scientists have developed a non-invasive technique that involves mere flash of laser light to assess healing.

The method exploits a particular property of some tissue proteins - ability to re-emit light upon absorption. Such proteins, known as tissue fluorophores, have chemical compounds that can re-emit light. Collagen is one such protein that is vital in wound healing. So when laser light is flashed on tissues under examination, the amount of re-emitted light from the healing tissue directly corresponds to collagen concentration, which in turn, indicates the status of the recovery process.

Researchers at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education used commercially available 325 nm laser light to inspect healing by exploring tissue fluorophores, and a detector to collect re-emitted light. The re-emitted spectra were recorded using a fibre optic probe kept very close - about three mm - to the wound site. The spectra was then analysed in a spectrograph connected to a computer.

The collagen levels measured by this technique, known as autofluorescence, were validated by biochemical tests of patient tissues. The comparison showed that autofluorescence was consistent and suitable for assessment of burn wound healing. This study also shown tissue collagen can be used as an optical biomarker for assessing burn wound healing, researchers explained. Tissue samples were collected from burn patients admitted to the Department of Plastic Surgery and Burns, Kasturba Medical College.

In earlier studies, the technique was used in lab-induced wounds in animals. Now it has been tested in tissue samples from human burn patients suffering from different degree of burn wounds. Tissue formed following treatment was excised before grafting and utilized for autofluorescence measurement.

""Our technique is user-friendly and solely dependent on excitation and emission of tissue fluorophores without the addition of any external dye molecule. This helps maintain tissue architecture during the assessment of healing,"" Dr Vijendra Prabhu of Department of Biotechnology at the Manipal Institute of Technology, a member of the research team, told India Science Wire.

For clinical management of wounds, periodic evaluation of injured tissue is necessary to know progress of healing. Sometimes wound assessment is done by trained clinicians but it is a subjective method. The other method is to conduct histopathology and biochemical analysis to measure amount of collagen deposited. Repetitive invasive tests can result in fresh wounds and possibility of infection and scarring.

Through autofluorescence technique, collagen information of the tissue can be gathered just 10 to 15 seconds. ""It can provide complementary data conducive to making clinical decisions. After successful testing on clinical samples, we are ready for mass testing on burn wound patients. This system can also be utilized to test collagen disorders in patients,"" Dr Prabhu said.

The study was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and research findings have been published in the Journal of Biophotonics."

And there's no better time than now to become a giver, if you're not already one. You know that feeling you get when you gift someone you care about? That warm and fuzzy feeling that you get when you gift or give unconditionally to someone is more beneficial than you think.

""Helping, giving, volunteering, and other actions undertaken to benefit others play a critical role in protecting health, promoting education, fighting poverty and hunger, and providing disaster relief,"" the researchers said, as reported by ANI.

The researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and University of Michigan found that reflecting on the satisfaction you get from helping someone makes you feel more caring & helpful as an individual and motivates you to benefit others even more.

Even a little generosity goes a long way in making yourself happier. ""You don't need to become a self-sacrificing martyr to feel happier. Just being a little more generous will suffice,"" says Philippe Tobler and Ernst Fehr form the Department of Economics a the University of Zurich.

Simply promising to behave generously activated the altruistic area of the brain and intensified the interaction between this area and the area associated with happiness. ""It is remarkable that intent alone generates a neural change before the action is actually implemented,"" says Tobler.

Simply promising to behave generously activated the altruistic area of the brain and intensified the interaction between this area and the area associated with happiness. ""Promising to behave generously could be used as a strategy to reinforce the desired behavior, on the one hand, and to feel happier, on the other,"" says Tobler.

His co-author Soyoung Park adds: ""There are still some open questions, such as: Can communication between these brain regions be trained and strengthened? If so, how? And, does the effect last when it is used deliberately, that is, if a person only behaves generously in order to feel happier?"""

IIT-Madras research scholars Friday staged a demonstration inside the campus here demanding a hike in fellowship amount, its timely and regular disbursal from various funding agencies.

They demanded stipend of Rs 45,000 per month for Junior Research Fellows (JRF) from the present Rs 25,000 and Rs 55,000 per month from Rs 28,000 for Senior Research Fellows (SRF).

The protest was as part of a nation-wide agitation announced by research scholars of IITs, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Indian Institute of Science and other central government-run universities.

Scores of research scholars raised slogans and also took out a protest march to the administration block demanding a hike in stipend for research scholars belonging to Non-National Eligibility Test (NET) category who are receiving a ""mere"" Rs 8,000 per month.

A research scholar, on condition of anonymity, said, ""There was a hike in 2014 pegging the stipend to Rs 25,000 (JRF) and Rs 28,000 (SRF). That clearly is insufficient considering that a huge share of it would be given to families of research scholars.""

Moreover, disbursal of stipends have been irregular and delayed for months, he added.

Another said, ""There has been a steep increase in basic necessities as result of inflation. Similar conditions like these led to stipend hike in 2010 and 2014.""

The stipends are issued by Ministry of Human Resource and Development, Department of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology, University Grants Commission, among others.

As per the report -- released on October 31 -- India moved up 23 spots to 77th position as compared to 100th in 2017 and improved its rank in six out of ten parameters relating to starting and doing business in the country.

The Corporate Affairs Ministry has contributed towards starting a business, insolvency resolution and protection of minority interests.

To provide greater 'Ease of Doing Business' to all stakeholders, bring about greater transparency in corporate structure and better corporate compliance so as to enhance the efficiency of the processes under Companies Act, 2013, the Corporate Affairs Ministry took several landmark initiatives during the year.

Among the significant ones were Companies (Amendment) Act, 2017, Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2018, establishment of National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), amendments in Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, eKYC drive for directors of all companies and speedier processing of incorporation related applications, uniformity in application of rules and eradicating discretion.

Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2017 was assented by President Ram Nath Kovind on January 3, 2018 and was enacted as the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2017 (CAA-17).

The Act contains total 93 sections of which 92 have been brought into force along with relevant rules.

Framework reviewed A committee to review the existing framework dealing with offences under the Companies Act, 2013, in its report recommended that the existing rigour of the law should continue for serious offences, covering six categories, while for lapses that are essentially technical or procedural in nature, mainly falling under two categories may be shifted to in-house adjudication process.

This would serve the twin purposes to promote Ease of Doing Business and better corporate compliance.

It would also reduce the number of prosecutions filed in the Special Courts, which would, in turn, facilitate speedier disposal of serious offences and bring serious offenders to book.

Based on its recommendations, the Government decided to promulgate an Ordinance.

Accordingly the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 was promulgated on November 2, this year.

The Ministry also proposes to introduce a Replacement Bill (Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2018) to replace the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 in the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament.

During the year going by, the President also gave assent to promulgate Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy process has taken good shape since 2017 and is a fast evolving legislation.

A major factor behind the effectiveness of the new code has been the adjudication by the judiciary.

The Code provides strict time limits for various procedures under it.

In this process a rich-case law has evolved reducing the scope of legal uncertainty.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2018 notified on January 19 replaced IBC (Amendment) Ordinance which further amended provisions relating to prohibition on certain persons from submitting a resolution plan, so as to provide more clarity.

Insolvency Further, second amendment was also done by the way of ordinance in August, 2018 on the recommendations of Insolvency Law Committee.

The Ordinance was promulgated to balance the interests of various stakeholders in the Code, especially interests of home buyers and micro, small and medium enterprises, promoting resolution over liquidation of corporate debtor by lowering the voting threshold of committee of creditors and streamlining provisions relating to eligibility of resolution applicants.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 has replaced IBC (Amendment) Ordinance.

In the wake of accounting scams and frauds in the corporate sector, National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) was notified as an independent regulator for auditing profession which is one of the key changes brought in by the Companies Act five years ago.

The NFRA will review the quality of corporate financial reporting in certain classes and sub classes of companies and take disciplinary action against auditors/audit firms for not discharging their statutory duties with due diligence.

The Government has constituted this Authority and has prescribed NFRA (Manner of Appointment and other Terms and Conditions of Service of Chairperson and Members) Rules, 2018 and NFRA Rules.

R Sridharan and Dr Prasenjit Mukherjee were appointed as Chairperson and full-time member respectively of NFRA on October 1, this year.

The Ministry to provide for faster and transparent processes, introduced a web base service named as 'Reserve Unique Name' to make the Name Reservation process speedy, smooth, simple and reduce the number of procedures with effective from January 26, 2018 for companies and from October 2, 2018 for LLPs (Limited Liability Partnership).

Re-engineering It also introduced steps such as re-engineering the process of allotment of DIN, exemption of MCA fee for company incorporation, deployment of e-forms due to IFSC & exemption notifications, amendment to Companies Act, CRL-1, implementation of Condonation of Delay Scheme, eKYC drive for directors of all companies, Integrated form for LLP (FiLLiP) incorporation, and setting up Central Registration Centre (CRC) for 'name reservation' and 'incorporation' for LLPs.

During the year, the Ministry in order to speed up matter related to resolution of bankruptcy and insolvency, proposed setting up of eight special courts under the National Company Law Tribunal to deal with the insolvency cases.

These courts are proposed to be set up in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad.

To facilitate timely resolution of disputes, it is envisaged to set up exclusive IBC Courts under the NCLT benches of Delhi, Mumbai to start with and step up infrastructure of NCLT.

The aim is also to strengthen the insolvency process for faster resolution of NPAs.

To bring more transparent accounting, the Ministry has notified Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 115 which would be effective from April 1, 2018.

Ind AS 115 is a new revenue recognition standard for customer contracts in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards which will help in more transparent accounting of revenues with an impact on companies operating in diverse sectors, including technology, real estate and telecom.

As part of bringing about greater transparency in corporate structure and in view of advantages of dematerialisation of securities, especially in terms of KYC and investor protection, the Government's focus on 'Digital India' and the enabling provisions, the Ministry has amended the relevant rules to apply the dematerialisation requirements to unlisted public companies, in addition to listed companies.

Consultations were held with all stakeholders and rules were amended on September 10, 2018 to mandate with effect from October 2, issue and transfer of securities by unlisted public companies in demat form only.

The Investor Education & Protection Fund (IEPF) Authority unveiled its new logo in 2018 to provide for strong brand presence and recognition.

The IEPF authority also signed an MoU with the CSC e-governance services India, which would identify village level entrepreneurs for investor awareness projects, among other activities.

The Ministry is actively looking at further reforms in IEPF.

Though no official instruction has been issued to the educational institutions in this regard, panicked authorities have decided to serve eggs in noon meals and substitute it with the vegetarian fare.

Last week, the death of a large number of crows and pigeons had triggered panic in the district with locals suspecting bird flu. Around 30 crows and pigeons had died mysteriously in Nayabazaar, Badapadaia, Atharbanki, Neheruabangla and Sandhkuda in Paradip. An alert was sounded and surveillance intensified in the coastal pockets. Veterinary officials had collected samples and sent those to Animal Disease Research Institute (ADRI) lab in Cuttack for tests.

Nearly 1.75 lakh students from Classes I to VIII in 1,381 Government schools are being provided with MDM. Every Wednesday and Saturday, eggs are being served to each student. Following bird flu scare, panicked parents and students urged the school authorities not to supply eggs in the noon meals.

Sarat Kanungo, headmaster of a Government-run school, said, ""We had no intention to provide bananas and 'pakodas' under MDM scheme. But following pressure from the parents, we distributed these snacks to students.""

Meanwhile, the move has not been taken lightly by the School and Mass Education department. District Education Officer (DEO) Prativa Manjari Das visited different schools and issued show-cause notices to several headmasters for supplying 'pakodas.'In view of avian influenza, Puri district administration had also prohibited eggs in schools and Anganwadi centres recently.

However, the HSE Department decided to make Saturdays working days and scheduled extra classes in the evening in order to compensate for the loss of working days due to the flood this year.

Though school principals and teachers are trying to finish the syllabus before the final exams in March, they are seeking to restructure the time again from next academic year. Amal Krishnan, an HSS teacher, said students' demands are genuine. ""On many days, they are so tired that we have to stop the classes after seeing many of them sleeping. Some even ask time to go to toilets during class hours as they don't get chance during shortened intervals. This is a serious issue and the government should address it immediately,"" he said.

Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KeSCPCR) Chairman P Suresh said the panel has received several complaints from students and parents about the issue and he sought a report from the schools.

The arrested duo has been identified as Amit Bhati, owner of the school, and Mohammad Ahmad, driver of the earthmover that was being used at the construction site.

Two students had lost their lives while three others got injured on Monday when a boundary wall of New KM Public School collapsed and five children came under it.

A residential construction work was in progress on the plot attached with the school premises. The sand from the construction site was kept along the boundary wall of the school which allegedly led to the collapse. The wall of the school was around 10 feet high and many rock slabs were also kept on its top, police said.

Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has sent a recommendation to slap a penalty of Rs 20,000 on the owner of the plot whose dumped sand led to the incident. ""We have sent our recommendation to the city magistrate as the sand was kept without covering it.

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

He said IIM Bangalore has also expressed willingness for a study of the reorganization process and its benefit."

This shows that the department itself has not taken any major step besides issuing advisory in the case. ""She did not delay taking the action. The moment parents of the survivor told her, she immediately reported the incident to the police,"" a senior official told TOI.

However, this does not match with the statement the in-charge gave to the CCPCR. In her statement, she had said that after the parents reported the matter on October 22 she handed over the case to the school's sexual harassment committee. Then the in-charge telephonically reported the matter to the DEO office. However, a letter was also given to the DEO on October 25.

18. The reason stated for the transfer was ""mistresses (being senior most) are hereby assigned the duties of the in-charge in the schools."" Another person has been made in-charge of the school in her place.

Earlier the CCPCR, despite being the right authority, had refrained from acting tough against those responsible for the delay in reporting of the case and had left the onus to decide action on authorities concerned.

As per former members of the commission, inclusion of officials from the UT education department, health and other departments in the CCPCR has led to show leniency in a serious case.

A Muslim woman from North Goa on Thursday alleged denial of right to appear for the National Eligibility Test (NET) with hijab by the authorities in Panaji.

In a complaint addressed to Nila Mohanan, Secretary for Education, with copies marked to various other authorities, Safina Khan Saudagar (24), a writer and a post-graduate degree holder in Psychology, narrated the entire sequence of events that allegedly led to her being denied entry to write the NET earlier this week.

At a press conference in Panaji on Thursday, she said she would write to Union Minister for Human Resource Development Prakash Javadekar and approach Goa State Human Rights Commission over the issue, ""so that such injustice does not affect other persons, irrespective of communities, in future"".

She said women of different faith have had to bear the brunt of ''derogatory'' rules and forced to remove their belts, hair-clips, jewellery and sacred threads.

Upon reaching the gates at 1:30 pm on Tuesday, Ms Saudagar said she was denied entry during the security check and was asked to remove her hijab (religious head covering) to go ahead for the examination. When she informed the man that she cannot take off her hijab as it pertains to her religious belief and modesty, he insisted that she remove it. His senior officer, a lady, asked her to comply or she would not be allowed to answer her exam, she said.

""She informed me that my ears need to be visible for a photograph and I agreed to it. I asked them to show me to a washroom to be able to redo my hijab to accommodate their request, but they refused and instead asked me to do it in the open with no privacy,"" said Ms. Saudagar.

She was further told that she would have to sit through the entire exam without her headscarf or she would not be allowed to answer, she added

""Article 14 of the Indian constitution provides that I be treated equally. Article 21 of the Indian constitution provides that I cannot be deprived of my personal liberty. Articles 25-28 provide that I have freedom to practice my religion. Therefore, such behaviour is unacceptable in a secular State and is a matter of harassment,"" Ms. Saudagar said in her complaint.

She further said that there were no rules specified on the NET website or elsewhere with regards to restrictions on the hijab or a particular dress code. If there were changes made to the rules, the candidates should have been informed of the same much prior to the examination date, she said.

Ms. Saudagar also pointed out that she was in a hijab in the photograph attached to her online application, and if there had been a change in rules, her application should not have been accepted and the reason should have been specified.

""It has cost me time, effort, money and has also raised questions on my religious identity, humiliated me and belittled my beliefs. Furthermore, I have appeared for NET exam previously, there were no such restrictions forced upon us then. I would like to know on what basis was I not allowed to appear for the exam when there are no specific rules mentioned,"" she asked the authorities in her complaint.

""I would want to know on what authority did the officials at the gate decide to restrict me from answering. I would like to know if it were a matter of security, why weren't arrangements made to protect a woman's modesty or religious belief with no disregard to security measures when it could have been made possible,"" she asked.

When contacted for her reaction to the complaint, Ms. Mohanan initially said that she could not comment till she saw the complaint. When contacted later in the evening on Thursday, Ms. Mohanan added that she had been extremely busy with a Cabinet meeting on Thursday and had not seen the complaint till then.

However, she assured The Hindu that she would see Ms. Saudagar on Friday, discuss with the Department and then respond."

Here's a look at some of them.

""Change is the only constant,"" said Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher. The recent assembly election results have reiterated this. We saw a leadership change at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), with Mr. Shaktikanta Das's appointment as the new RBI Governor, following Mr. Urjit Patel's resignation.

The financial markets have also had their fair share of ups and downs. In 2018, India's equity market witnessed a low when the S&P BSE Sensex dropped to 32,596 (price return index level as of March 23, 2018), but also saw a high of 38,896 (price return index level as of August 28, 2018) -- a fluctuation of 6,300 points and a 19% variation over the year. However, this year the index reached record highs compared with the past 10 years. The S&P BSE Sensex first crossed the 10,000 mark on December 18, 2008, the 20,000 mark on September 21, 2010, and finally the 30,000 mark on April 26, 2017. The fixed income market was no exception, with the 10-year Government Bond yields crossing 8% multiple times in September and October 2018. There has a been an ongoing discussion on the broadening of the Indian debt market, which faces challenges in terms of liquidity, innovation, investor awareness, and participation.

Other changes introduced by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) were style and size definitions for mutual funds, as well as consolidation of mutual fund schemes to a single offering in each style category in order to create a standardization for the market and its investors. SEBI also advised mutual funds to adopt total return indices (TRI) to benchmark their schemes, effective as of Febraury 1, 2018. This would enable investors to compare the appropriate index with the scheme's performance.

With the constantly shifting investment landscape, some changes have been significant. The endless discussion around the active vs. passive debate has also progressed. More and more market participants have aligned with the fact that a passive investment strategy can be part of the overall investment goal achievement. A core satellite strategy easily encompasses both active and passive styles. The SPIVA India Mid-Year 2018 results revealed how large-cap funds in India have been underperforming the benchmark, the S&P BSE 100. The index outperformed the fund category by over 87% in the 1-year period, 78% in the 3-year period, 48% in the 5-year period, and 62% in the 10-year period. Active fund managers have been waking up to the fact that large-cap passive investing is a strategy potentially worth evaluating.

Table is provided for illustrative purposes and reflects hypothetical historical performance. The S&P BSE 400 MidSmallCap Index was launched on Nov. 30, 2017. The S&P BSE India Government Bond Index was launched on Dec. 31, 2013. The S&P BSE India Bond Index was launched on March 12, 2014.

Furthermore, government bodies like the Employee Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) and the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) have supported the passive style of investing with the promotion of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). EPFO's allocation to equity ETFs stood at 15% of its investible surplus, which is over Rs 40,000 crore as of September 2018. Furthermore, the EPFO has been developing software that will allow them to credit the ETFs to subscriber accounts, thereby empowering subscribers for further transaction. DIPAM, on the other hand, used the ETF vehicle successively to liquidate holdings in public sector undertakings. In 2018, they had follow on offers for the ETFs, the S&P BSE BHARAT 22 ETF and the CPSE ETF, both of which were oversubscribed. Their new initiative for a debt ETF could be a strong innovation to promote passive style of investing in the fixed income space.

Passive investing is now getting more emphasis, and as index-based investing offers diversification, transparency, and liquidity, there are positive signals that with growing investor education and awareness, India could witness more growth in the days to come."

Promote Indian systems of Medicine; Work towards standardizing and benchmarking Indian systems of medicine: Vice President Go above & beyond the CSR mandates to provide life saving and essential drugs to those who cannot afford: VP tells Pharma Co's Addresses 70th Indian Pharmaceutical Congress Interacts with CEOs of all major Pharma companies

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called up on the pharmaceutical industry to work towards making India an International Capital of Generic Medicines.

Addressing the 70th Indian Pharmaceutical Congress at Amity University, Noida today, Shri Naidu said that India becoming the largest provider of generic drugs globally with the Indian generics accounting for 20 % of global exports in terms of volume was an eloquent testimony to the competence of the Indian pharma sector in terms of quality and pricing.

The Vice President said that apart from being the world leader in generic medicines, India should promote Indian systems of Medicine. He asked young researchers to work towards standardizing and benchmarking Indian systems of medicine and establish the efficiency, validity and efficacy of these traditional medicines, using globally established experimental protocols.

The Vice President asked Pharma companies to go above and beyond their CSR mandates to provide life saving and other essential drugs to those who cannot afford them. He said that it was essential for a country like India to provide healthcare and medicines at affordable prices. In developing countries, India is rendering yeoman service by providing access to life saving medicines at affordable prices, he added.

Saying that pharmaceuticals was a priority area for Government, Shri Naidu stressed the need to further harness the potential of the sector by use of technology, innovation and research.

Healthcare and its allied industries being the fifth-largest employer among all sectors, the Vice President asked the industry to invest in skilling. Given the significance of highly educated and specialized scientists in the sector, skill development is crucial, he said. He asked for a constant coordination between government and Industry to remove disconnect between demand and supply of skilled manpower in pharmacy sector.

Shri Naidu said that National Skill Development Corporation which has identified more than 60 job roles for the pharmacy graduates and post graduates for consideration under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna would aid the building of vocational and technical training framework, hasten skill up-gradation and encourage innovative thinking.

Earlier, Shri Naidu interacted with CEOs of all major Pharmaceutical companies ahead of the inaugural event of the conference which was attended by more than 5000 participants from across India.

The Minister for Excise and Liquor Prohibition, Uttar Pradesh, Shri Jai Parata Singh and several dignitaries from fields of medicine, pharmaceuticals and other were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to be amongst such a distinguished assembly of Pharma Professionals. I am pleased to learn that more than 5000 participants from across India are attending this annual congress.

Friends,

India has undertaken a long and arduous, yet rewarding journey in Pharmacology, from the ""Charak Samhita"" of traditional Indian medicine system, to becoming the third largest drug manufacturer in the world, in terms of volume, in the field of modern medicine.

Addressing this august gathering reminds me of a shloka from the Charak Samhita which goes on to say that, 'Indra expounded the immortal and sacred science of life, the Ayurveda which consisted of three principles, Hetu - causative factors of disease, Linga - symptomatology and Aushadha - knowledge of therapeutics, treatments and medicines'.

It is clear that since the ancient times India had a very systematic, scientific and rational approach to the treatment of diseases.

The Atharva veda is a treasure trove of knowledge and wisdom in the field of medicine. It is lauded as the earliest source of medical information in India. Ayurveda has been regarded as an upaveda or a subtext of the Atharvaveda.

The Mantras in these ancient texts contain a wealth of information regarding herbs, metals, medicines, diseases and treatments. They speak of the astounding properties and powers that herbs and plants possess to cure diseases.

Sisters and Brothers,

It is indeed gratifying to note that India has succesfully maintained its legacy of being a pioneer in the field of pharmacology and today India enjoys the exalted position of being the 'Pharmacy to the world'.

The Pharma industry has posted a robust, double-digit growth over the last few years. The industry was worth US $36.7 Billion in 2017 and is projected to grow to US $55 Billion by 2020.

It is quite heartening to note that the Pharma sector is out-performing most other sectors in achieving consistently high growth.

India is now among the top five pharmaceutical emerging markets of the world.

India is the largest provider of generic drugs globally with the Indian generics accounting for 20 % of global exports in terms of volume.

Generic drugs export has been growing at a very impressive rate of around 24% per year for the last four years.

In 2012-13, India's pharmaceutical exports stood at $14.7 billion. More than half of it went to western markets which have tight regulations and strong accountability mechanisms.

This is an eloquent testimony to the competence of the Indian pharma sector in terms of quality and pricing.

In developing countries, India is rendering yeoman service by providing access to life saving medcines at affordable prices.

Presently over 80 per cent of the antiretroviral drugs used globally to combat AIDS are supplied by Indian pharmaceutical firms.

Due to the ability of the Indian pharma companies to produce drugs at economical rates, the cost of HIV/AIDS treatment has gone down to $400 per year from $12,000 - a spectacular contribution to global healthcare.

India also has a large pool of talented scientists and engineers who have the potential to lead the industry ahead to greater heights.

We have the desire and capability to absorb new technologies in manufacturing. 'Make in India' is one of the key programmes launched by the government to boost the economy and the aim is to transform India into a global manufacturing hub.

The target is to increase the GDP contribution of manufacturing to 25 % by 2025. Pharmaceuticals is one of the fastest growing contributors to ""Make in India"" campaign since its inception.

Sisters and Brothers,

The Government of India has taken up a number of initiatives to create an ecosystem that fosters manufacturing and have identified a few key areas.

Pharmaceuticals is one of those priority areas. There is immense scope for technology, innovation and research in pharmaceuticals.

India already has the second highest number of US FDA approved facilities and labour costs in Indian are significantly lower than other manufacturing hubs.

The Union Budget 2017-18 shows an increase of 23% in the health expenditure that is likely to give further impetus to the pharma sector.

The government has proposed amendments to the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules to ensure availability of generic drugs at reasonable prices and to promote the use of generic medicines.

It has also introduced a range of fiscal incentives to promote domestic manufacturing, including the reduction of inverted duty structure and basic customs duty.

Drug patenting is significant in catalysing growth in the pharmaceutical sector.

India has always taken a bold and exemplary stand against blind patent protection that benefit global pharma giants.

This uncompromising stand has been demonstrated through the granting of compulsory licence in 2012 to an Indian manufacturer to produce a cancer drug, the patent for which was held by the German company Bayer. Bayer's pricing had made the drug unaffordable to poor cancer patients in India, Africa and elsewhere.

The Supreme Court of India also upheld the 2006 decision of the Indian patent office that refused a patent for a mere incremental innovation to a Swiss Pharma major. The verdict disallowing patent protection caused an international uproar.

Providing essential drugs and medicines at cost-effective prices is the key focus of Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers.

Under the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Policy, as on December 15, 2016, ceiling price of 853 formulations are under price control.

The fixation of ceiling prices on medicines has resulted in a total saving of USD 392 million since May 2014.

The government and the Pharma sector in unison have managed to effectively harness the power of Information technology to improve efficiency.

'Pharma Jan Samadhan', a customer grievances redressal system was launched and a mobile application - 'Pharma Sahi Daam' that provides real-time information to consumers on prices of Scheduled/Non-scheduled medicines has also been introduced.

Sisters and brothers,

Quality medicines at affordable prices are now available to the poor and disadvantaged through the ""Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan aushadhi Kendras"".

There are more than 700 medicines; more than 150 surgicals and consumables are available at affordable prices for all at more than 4000 'Jan Aushadi Kedras' across the nation.

In a very proactive move, the Government of India is setting up an electronic platform to regulate the profusion of online pharmacies that are coming up, under a new policy, to stop any misuse due to easy availability.

Healthcare is the fifth-largest employer among all sectors, both in terms of direct and indirect employment. Given the significance of highly educated and specialized scientists in the sector, skill development is crucial.

The National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER) imparts quality education in the areas of pharmaceutical sciences.

07 NIPERs were approved till 2015, while 3 new NIPERs at Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan were announced in 2016.

National Skill Development Coorporation has identified more than 60 job roles for the pharmacy graduates and post gradutes for consideration under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna.

This would result in the removal of disconnect between demand and supply of skilled manpower. It would aid the building of vocational and technical training frameworks, hasten skill up-gradation and encourage innovative thinking.

Dear Sisters and Brothers,

It is my ambition that along with being the world leader in generic medicines, we should also promote Indian systems of Medicine.

I urge young researchers to work towards standardizing and benchmarking Indian systems of medicine. It is up to you to establish the efficiency, validity and efficacy of these traditional medicines, using globally established experimental protocols.

Speedy introduction of generic drugs into the market should remain in focus. Rural health programmes, lifesaving drugs and preventive vaccines should also receive attention from policy makers and Pharma companies alike.

There should be an unwavering commitment to high standards of quality in drug manufacturing and quality frameworks such as Good Manufacturing Practices should strictly be adhered to.

There should also be a thrust on research and innovation. New healthcare challenges are emerging every day, especially with the alarming rise in the number of non communicable and lifestyle diseases and cancers.

New molecules and new drugs will have to be discovered and treatment protocols will have to be continuously upgraded and updated.

All this will have to be achieved without compromising on the affordability of drugs. Pharmaceutical sector has the crucial responsibility of saving human lives.

Pharma companies should go above and beyond their CSR mandates to provide life saving and other essential drugs to those who cannot afford them.

India should also enter into international partnerships and agreements in the pharmaceutical sector so that we learn from the best and adopt the best protocols and practices.

The Government will also have to increase spending and widen the insurance net so that the exorbitant out of pocket expenditure incurred by the poor and needy is brought down.

I am happy to be amidst this galaxy of prominent figures in the field of Pharmaceuticals. I congratulate the organizers of this congress for making a good beginning in the direction of making India a Pharmaceutical hub by 2030."

There are 320 students in the Primary School, Pipariya in Bhojipura block of Bareilly district.

To inculcate the concept of banking and savings in children, a teacher in a primary school of Bareilly has set up a 'school bank' that is run by students and is meant to meet their stationery requirements during their stay on the campus.

To run this bank, students voluntarily contribute Rs 2 each while teachers also willingly make donations. There are 320 students in the Primary School, Pipariya in Bhojipura block of Bareilly district.

""This money is used in buying pencils, erasers, sharpeners, rulers, few books and kept in a cupboard in the principal's room, which they call green counter. Earlier, when students forgot to bring stationery, they used to go home to bring it, and in the process, often missed the class,"" explained assistant teacher Saurabh Shukla who has introduced the concept.

But all these are things of past. Now, on a day when students don't bring their pencil box, they don't go home. Instead, they walk into the 'school bank' and are allowed to borrow the same at zero interest for a day, he said.

Due to availability of stock in the 'school bank', the students are able to continue with their studies without any hindrances. The class also does not get disturbed. However, while going home after the school gets over, they are required to deposit the same back in the 'school bank', which is managed by students, said the teacher.

One Nikhil, a Class 5 student, has been appointed as manager of the 'School Bank'. But a teacher will assist him. ""The school teacher explained the concept. Everybody was convinced that it will be of great help for everyone. After whatever little money we could raise, teachers opened their wallet and heart to bridge the deficit. The school bank is now doing wonders,"" said Nikhil.

The 'School Bank' follows simple rules. Students of any class may avail the facilities of this bank. If a student fails to bring any stationery, he is not required to go back home and bring it. He just has to go to the bank, make an entry of the borrowed item in the register and attend class.

In case a student misplaces the borrowed item, he is supposed to give it back to the bank within 30 days. ""But below poverty line students are exempt from this rule. Students will be allowed to borrow things twice a week and seven times a month so that they do not make borrowing a habit,"" said Rinki, a student of the school.

The 'school bank' manager will be appointed from a senior class at regular intervals. Candidates with good academic record will be considered for the job, said the teacher.

The basic education department has appreciated the initiative of the school, and if found feasible, the same can be replicated in other schools too, said an official.

The cloak that reaches below the knees is usually made of either of wool or jamewar which is a mixture of wool and cotton.

The order was originally meant for the state secretariat. In September, the General Administration Department of the Civil Secretariat in Srinagar asked government officials to ""be attired in proper formal dress while appearing before any court of law and while attending offices in the State of Jammu and Kashmir and strictly avoid casual or party attire"".

The decision was a security directive. However, the zonal education officer (ZEO) in Langate, following the civil secretariat directive, issued an order last week banning the pheran in educational institutions.

A stream of protest erupted on Twitter criticising the ban, forcing the school department to retract the order. However, the security protocol at the secretariat remains.

Former chief minister, Omar Abdullah, tweeted: ""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned! This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn.""

He added: ""My father and I have worn pherans to official functions many times over the years and will continue to do so, silly government orders notwithstanding. #dontbanourpheran #revokepheranban.""

Mohammad Shafi War, the chief education officer of Kupwara said that the order was withdrawn on Tuesday. He said: ""There is an official dress code but we cannot ignore the significance of pheran. That is why we have withdrawn the order issued by ZEO Langate.""

Kashmiris love their 'pherans'. These loose, warm outer garments are typically worn during winters.

'Pheran' has a long history in Kashmir, and is believed to have a tradition of at least 660 years. Worn over centuries by the inhabitants to brave the harsh winter chill, the garment has worked as a great leveller of the Kashmiri society. It has traditionally dissolved the class difference, being the preferred dress for both the rich and the poor during the cold season. Even when modernity permeated the lives of Kashmiris over the years, the pheran continued to remain a badge of its culture.

Though the etymology is a little unclear, some believe the name pheran is derived from the Greek word 'apron'. Many contend that the tunic owes its origin to the Persian word for shirt,'perahan'. The Tajik word 'peraband' is also closely associated with the Kashmiri pheran. Since Kashmir has a distinct central Asian cultural link, that may well be the case"

In other words, foods that you might otherwise be inclined to eat became less desirable once the calorie content was displayed.

The study is the first of its kind to examine how your brain makes food choices when calorie information is presented. The results are timely given that earlier this year, and certain food chain establishments had to comply with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration's menu labeling law requiring the disclosure of calorie information on menus and menu boards. Also, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, obesity affected nearly 40 percent of U.S. adults in 2015-16.

""Our findings suggest that calorie-labeling may alter responses in the brain's reward system when considering food options. Moreover, we believe that nutritional interventions are likely to be more successful if they take into account the motivation of the consumer, including whether or not they diet,"" says first author Andrea Courtney, who was a graduate student in the department of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth at the time of the study and is currently a postdoctoral student at the Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab at Stanford University.

For the study conducted at Dartmouth, 42 undergraduate students (ages 18 to 22) viewed 180 food images without calorie information followed by images with calorie information and were asked to rate their desire to eat the food while in a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner (fMRI). The images were obtained from either the food pics database or popular, fast food restaurant websites that post calorie information. The 22 dieters and 20 non-dieters viewed the same set of images, including foods such as a cheeseburger, a side of French fries or a slice of cherry cheesecake. On a scale from 1 to 4 (1 = not at all, four = very much), they indicated how likely they would be to eat the food in the dining hall.

While dieters and non-dieters alike rated calorie-labeled foods as less appetizing, this effect was strongest among dieters. Further, the researchers analyzed responses in two brain regions that motivate eating behavior: the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Although all participants showed a decrease in activation in these areas when calorie information was present, dieters showed more similar activation patterns in the left OFC for calorie-labeled and unlabeled foods. This finding suggests that dieters may consider calorie information even when it isn't explicitly present and builds on previous research suggesting that the presence of health cues can lead to healthier food decisions.

""In order to motivate people to make healthier food choices, policy changes are needed that incorporate not only nutritional information, including calorie content but also a public education component, which reinforces the long-term benefits of a healthy diet,"" added senior author Kristina Rapuano, who was a graduate student in the department of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth at the time of the study and is currently a postdoctoral student at the Fundamentals of the Adolescent Brain Lab at Yale University.

The demand was raised in a meeting of the members of the JKJCCPS with the Director Education Kashmir, Dr. G N Itoo, to discuss with ""him issues relating to transport and sale of books at the school premises.""

The JKJCCPS delegation was led by its President Showkat M Chowdhary who was accompanied by its Vice President, Secretary General and EC Members.

JKJCCPS President apprised the Director Education Kashmir about the financial issues the schools are facing for its transportation of the services.

JKJCCPS demanded that the seating arrangement for the students should be made as per 1:1.5 ratio.

Dr. G N Itoo gave a patient hearing and assured support to the private schools by taking up the their recommendations with the Commissioner Transport Motor Vehicles Department.

JKJCCPS also apprised the Director Education about the request of the parents for arranging sale of the books at the schools as per the MRPs from the publishers.

The delegation informed the Director that schools only provide facility to parents for the sale of the books through booksellers at their school premises. They said a proper bill and receipt as per the MRP is given to the parents.

They said the modalities would be worked out after the admissions committee is constituted.

""Currently, suggestions are being sought on the members to be appointed to the Admissions Committee. The admissions committee is likely to be formed in the next two weeks,"" said an official.

The previous Admissions Committee of the varsity had met in January this year and it was decided that the varsity would have online entrance examinations to ensure that students who have not secured high percentage also stand a chance to study in Delhi University.

It was decided that a pilot project would be started for the 2018-2020 session for two-three courses, but it was not done and the admissions to courses happened on the basis of cut-offs.

""The proposal to have online entrance examinations was made by the Department of Commerce. Some members said the online mode would be difficult for students from far-flung areas who are not well-versed with computers,"" said an official.

The official said it was decided that there would be an offline as well as an online entrance exam to the varsity.

It was decided that candidates meeting the minimum eligibility criteria would have to go through a screening test and those who score more than 50 per cent would be shortlisted.

""This was done because there are many education boards across India and each board has different difficult levels and different marking system. The entrance test was thought as a way to ensure that all students can be on par and get a shot at getting through the DU,"" he said.

The Delhi University is also mulling whether the entrance exam can be outsourced to the National Testing Agency.

""It is yet to be decided whether it can be done. The varsity will bring out a notification and subsequently the process will begin after the admissions committee members are finalised,"" he added.

Some faculty members have expressed reservations about the plan saying it will lead to increase in cost of conducting exams and will also put students who are not well-versed with computers at a disadvantage.

A former member of the Admission Committee of the varsity said the time is quite less for working out the modules of online entrance examinations.

""The office of the Dean, Students' Welfare has got new members this year in place of members who had been there for close to 10 years. They should at least be given time to understand the process of admission for a year,"" he added.

However, some faculty members have supported the move saying it will help those students who do not meet the cut-offs to realise their dream of studying in the varsity.

Currently, the varsity holds entrance examinations for nine undergraduate professional courses and for postgraduate courses.

A teachers' group Academics For Action and Development (AAD) condemned the decision of the varsity to hold entrance exams and called it part of the larger design of ""privatisation"".

""It is a conspiracy to deprive students from the SC/ST/OBC, rural and underprivileged segments of society who are not in a position for various reasons to perform well at these examinations. Multiplicity of entrance exams will increase stress levels of students, who are already overburdened,"" said AAD's chairman Aditya Narayan Mishra.

He also said there was no discussion about holding the entrance tests in statutory bodies like the Academic and Executive Councils.

The Jawaharlal Nehru University will be holding online entrance exams in May 2019, a move criticised by the students' union which called it a ""scam"". The JNU students union has alleged that the varsity will have to spend more for the exam at a time when it is having shortage of funds."

New Delhi: The Rashtriya Lok Samta Party president Upendra Kushwaha, who joined forces with the opposition Thursday, days after quitting the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), had given ample clues that his ties with the BJP had become rocky.

Speculation that he would break away from the NDA gained ground in August after his kheer remarks, which was seen as an overture to the opposition. The RLSP chief had been unhappy with the NDA readmitting the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) into its fold.

ThePrint has now learnt that there were tell-tale signs even in the Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry, where Kushwaha served as a minister of state, that he would quit the NDA alliance.

According to those close to him, Kushwaha, who had served close to five years as a junior HRD minister in the Modi government at the time of his resignation, was disenchanted a long time ago.

Kushwaha, who had more experience in the ministry than even the current HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar, did not attend some of the major events, including the meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE), the highest decision-making body on all matters related to education. The meeting took place in January this year.

""Starting from somewhere in the middle of this year, he had started coming less to office. Sometimes just two to three days in a month because he felt that he was not being involved in major policy decisions,"" said a source close to the minister. ""Some of the most crucial policy files reached him towards the end without him being consulted.""

The tipping point for the minister came when his party was denied four seats in the NDA alliance for 2019. Kushwaha, who allied with the BJP in February 2014, exited the alliance early this month.

In a strongly-worded resignation letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said that he joined BJP alliance with a great deal of expectations but ""after having served in the council of ministers for 55 months, he felt dejected and betrayed by his leadership"".

""There has been a fundamental conflict in what you have promised to the people before elections and what you have actually delivered after coming to power,"" he wrote in his letter.

A prominent leader from Bihar, Kushwaha is a Member of Parliament from Karakat Lok Sabha constituency in Rohtas district, a seat dominated by the Kushwaha community.

The Kushwahas or Koeris claim their origin from Lord Ram's son Kush, with his other son Luv said to have initiated the Kurmi caste, to which Nitish Kumar belongs. Kushwaha and Nitish are political rivals.

The Kushwahas are a largely farming community and constitute over 12 per cent of the population in Bihar. Political science theorists believe that his exit will cost the Kushwaha vote for the BJP in Bihar.

""The Kushwahas are a strong community and the reality is that caste dynamics work very strongly in Indian elections,"" said Aditya Narayan Mishra who teaches political science at Delhi University. ""So, Kushwaha's exit is likely to affect the BJP's chances in the state.""

The former minister began his career as a politician in 1985 when he joined the Yuva Lok Dal. He went on to join the Yuva Janata Dal and worked for the Samta Party later.

In March 2013 he floated his own party, the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP).

Kushwaha did his graduation from Patna Science College and went on to complete his post-graduation in Political Science from Bihar's B.R. Ambedkar Bihar University in Muzaffarpur.

Around the same time that he entered politics, he also began his professional career as a teacher. He was a lecturer of Political Science at Samta College's Department of Political Science.

In pursuance to objective of providing greater "" Ease of Doing Business"" to all stakeholders, bring about greater transparency in corporate structure and better Corporate compliance so as to enhance the efficiency of the processes under Companies Act ,2013 , the Ministry of Corporate Affairs ( MCA) has taken several landmark initiatives / decisions during last one year ( January-November ,2018) .

The important ones are Companies ( Amendment ) Act ,2017 , Companies ( Amendment) Ordinance 2018 , establishment of National Financial Reporting Authority ( NFRA) , amendments in Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , eKYC drive for Directors of all companies and speedier processing of incorporation related applications , uniformity in application of rules and eradicating discretion.

India has improved its ranking on the World Bank's ""Doing Business"" 2019 report released on 31st October, 2018. As per the report, India has moved up 23 spots to 77th position as compared to 100th position in 2017 by improving its rank in six out of ten parameters relating to starting and doing business in India. Ministry of Corporate Affairs has contributed towards starting a business, insolvency resolution and protection of minority interests.

The details of Year-long achievements for Ministry of Corporate Affairs are as below:

Till date, all sections of the Companies Act, 2013 [CA-13] except one section viz. Section 465 have been notified. Part of section 2 [clause 67(ix)] and part of section 230 [sub-section (11) and (12)] are yet to be commenced.

COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2017:

Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2017 was assented by Honourable President of India on 3 January, 2018 and got enacted as the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2017 [CAA-17]. The CAA-17 contains total 93 sections. Till date, out of total 93 sections of CAA-17, 92 sections have been brought into force alongwith relevant rules. Commencement of one section (section 81 - relating to Nidhis) and parts of section 23 and 80 of CAA-17 requires amendment in 3 sets of Rules and Forms notified under the Companies Act, 2013 which requires examination in the Ministry and is likely to take some more time. The Ministry proposes to notify section 81 of CAA-17 and part of section 23 of such Act along with relevant rules by 31 December 2018.

The Committee to review the existing framework dealing with offences under the Companies Act, 2013 and related matters submitted its report to the Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs Shri Arun Jaitley. The Committee broke down all penal provisions into eight categories based on the nature of offences. The Committee recommended that the existing rigour of the law should continue for serious offences, covering six categories, whereas for lapses that are essentially technical or procedural in nature, mainly falling under two categories may be shifted to in-house adjudication process. This would serve the twin purposes promoting of Ease of Doing Business and better corporate compliance. It would also reduce the number of prosecutions filed in the Special Courts, which would, in turn, facilitate speedier disposal of serious offences and bring serious offenders to book. The cross-cutting liability under section 447, which deals with corporate fraud, would continue to apply wherever fraud is found. Most sections under review and recommendation have been notified for commencement. Based on the recommendations of the Committee and to achieve objectives of promotion of Ease of Doing Business and better Corporate Compliance the Government decided to promulgate an Ordinance. Accordingly the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 was promulgated on 2.11.2018.

The MCA proposes to introduce a Replacement Bill (viz. Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2018) to replace the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 in the Winter Session (2018) of Parliament.

INSOLVENCY & BANKRUPTCY

In year 2018, the President gave assent to promulgate Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy process has taken good shape since 2017 and is a fast evolving legislation. A major factor behind the effectiveness of the new Code has been the adjudication by the Judiciary. The Code provides strict time limits for various procedures under it. In this process a rich- case law has evolved reducing the scope of legal uncertainty.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2018 notified on 19.01.2018 replaced IBC (Amendment) Ordinance which further amended provisions relating to prohibition on certain persons from submitting a resolution plan, so as to provide more clarity.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 notified on 17.08.2018 has replaced IBC (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018.

NATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING AUTHORITY

In the wake of accounting scams and frauds in the corporate sector, National Financial Reporting authority (NFRA) was notified as an independent regulator for auditing profession which is one of the key changes brought in by the Companies Act 2013. NFRA will review the quality of corporate financial reporting in certain classes and subclasses of companies and take disciplinary action against auditors/audit firms for not discharging their statutory duties with due diligence.

Thanks to efforts of principal Vasudeva Kamath K, in four years, the enrolment has not only increased from 76 to 172 but the infrastructure has been revamped with the help of donors and government grants. The college, started in 1981 about 20km from here, caters to poor, rural students. It has three sections -- arts, commerce and science.

""When I took charge as a principal, I saw students studying in a dilapidated building which was on the verge of collapse. The college had other problems like staff and washrooms. Slowly, we brought in changes,"" says Vasudeva.

Computer science course

In Dakshina Kannada, only three PU college haves computer science course and the Gurupura college is one of them. It was started with Vasudeva's efforts.

The government gave only permission but not infrastructure. ""I approached many donors. They donated us computers, racks, lab instruments and funds to hire staff. The one-year course is going on smoothly,"" Vasudeva said.

He said this academic year, the college has received Rs 1 crore for construction of six classrooms and two washrooms under RIDF 24 Plan from the department of PU education.

Meanwhile, construction of a multi-purpose community hall is in process. Donors, college development committee and Gurupura gram panchayat have together contributed Rs 7 lakh but Rs 10.25 lakh more is needed. He said the hall will meet the needs of rural general public and the college too."

Earlier, K A Sengottaiyan, school education minister, said the department was considering reduction of lessons for Class XI and XII students following representations over the 'voluminous textbooks'.

His statement came soon after the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) announced that syllabus will be halved for CBSE students next year. A senior school education department official said the committee formed to write the new textbooks would proceed with the original plan to not reduce content.

""We might contemplate over this later, after NCERT's announcement is implemented,"" the official added.

Welcoming this, experts called the earlier proposal to reduce content as a retrograde step.

M Anandakrishnan, former IIT Kanpur chairman, said the new syllabus was framed in a a manner to help students in higher education and competitive exams. ""Reducing it will leave them handicapped,"" he said.

Government school teachers, who oppose the 'voluminous syllabus', said the higher secondary students, who were trained under a simple syllabus till Class X, were struggling to cope up with the vast content.

Responding to this, a curriculum revision committee member said, ""The new textbooks is voluminous by pages and not content. A study to compare the old and new textbooks revealed that there was an increase by only 5-7%, excluding value additions and worked out examples. Better design, layout and trimming repetitions in reference sections will reduce the number of pages also.""

The official added that though CBSE lessons might be reduced, NEET content will remain the same. ""Reducing our textbook content in a rush will only put our students at a comparative disadvantage,"" he added. Responding to this, S Prabhudoss from TN Post Graduate Teachers Association said, ""Present training modsule is effective. But without a blueprint, we are unable to guide the students.""

Educationist Prince Gajendra Babu said, ""Tamil Nadu should not follow NCERT's footsteps as it is not a benchmark. It is fine to revisit and make corrections so that contents are age-appropriate."""

They said the modalities would be worked out after the admissions committee is constituted.

""Currently, suggestions are being sought on the members to be appointed to the Admissions Committee. The admissions committee is likely to be formed in the next two weeks,"" said an official.

The previous Admissions Committee of the varsity had met in January this year and it was decided that the varsity would have online entrance examinations to ensure that students who have not secured high percentage also stand a chance to study in Delhi University.

It was decided that a pilot project would be started for the 2018-2020 session for two-three courses, but it was not done and the admissions to courses happened on the basis of cut-offs.

""The proposal to have online entrance examinations was made by the Department of Commerce. Some members said the online mode would be difficult for students from far-flung areas who are not well-versed with computers,"" said an official.

The official said it was decided that there would be an offline as well as an online entrance exam to the varsity.

It was decided that candidates meeting the minimum eligibility criteria would have to go through a screening test and those who score more than 50 per cent would be shortlisted.

""This was done because there are many education boards across India and each board has different difficult levels and different marking system. The entrance test was thought as a way to ensure that all students can be on par and get a shot at getting through the DU,"" he said.

The Delhi University is also mulling whether the entrance exam can be outsourced to the National Testing Agency.

""It is yet to be decided whether it can be done. The varsity will bring out a notification and subsequently the process will begin after the admissions committee members are finalised,"" he added.

Some faculty members have expressed reservations about the plan saying it will lead to increase in cost of conducting exams and will also put students who are not well-versed with computers at a disadvantage.

A former member of the Admission Committee of the varsity said the time is quite less for working out the modules of online entrance examinations.

""The office of the Dean, Students' Welfare has got new members this year in place of members who had been there for close to 10 years. They should at least be given time to understand the process of admission for a year,"" he added.

However, some faculty members have supported the move saying it will help those students who do not meet the cut-offs to realise their dream of studying in the varsity.

Currently, the varsity holds entrance examinations for nine undergraduate professional courses and for postgraduate courses.

A teachers' group Academics For Action and Development (AAD) condemned the decision of the varsity to hold entrance exams and called it part of the larger design of ""privatisation"".

""It is a conspiracy to deprive students from the SC/ST/OBC, rural and underprivileged segments of society who are not in a position for various reasons to perform well at these examinations. Multiplicity of entrance exams will increase stress levels of students, who are already overburdened,"" said AAD's chairman Aditya Narayan Mishra.

He also said there was no discussion about holding the entrance tests in statutory bodies like the Academic and Executive Councils.

The Jawaharlal Nehru University will be holding online entrance exams in May 2019, a move criticised by the students' union which called it a ""scam"". The JNU students union has alleged that the varsity will have to spend more for the exam at a time when it is having shortage of funds."

Hydropower Market size is set to exceed 1,300 GW by 2024, according to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc. Rising electricity demand coupled with increasing investment towards sustainable energy will stimulate the global hydropower market size. As per International Energy Agency (IEA), hydroelectric accounted for over 80% of the total renewable energy mix. North America and Europe have introduced plans to upgrade, renovate, and modernize the existing stations to ensure more efficient operations. For instance, in March 2015, Latvenergo announced to invest USD 222.26 million towards reconstruction of Riga, Plavinas and Kegums hydroelectric power stations in Latvia by 2022.

Large capacity segment in 2016 accounted for over 80% of global hydropower market share. Rising demand for continuous and reliable electricity along with upgradation of existing generating stations will stimulate the business landscape. In 2013, Agder Energi awarded a contract worth USD 24.4 million to Alstom, towards upgradation of the Iveland II hydroelectric plant in Norway, which has a generating capacity of approximately 150-GWh and 50 MW on annual basis. In 2016, Andritz installed three hydroelectric stations in Nicaragua and Brazil with an aggregate value of over USD 75 million with an aim to provide constant and reliable electricity.

Reliable, high operating life cycle coupled with low maintenance costs are some of the key indicators which will stimulate the hydropower market share. Flood control, irrigation, tourism, aquaculture and recreation in remote areas are some of the salient benefits, which will complement the industry outlook. In Europe and North America, the authorities have introduced bond funds to raise investment for hydroelectric projects. These funds are particularly aimed at acquiring present assets over the new build.

Castes of the students were found written before the names of the students in the attendance register of both the schools. In Vaishali school, they were even segregated in classrooms on the basis of their religion and caste.

Education department primary director Giriwar Dayal Singh suspended acting principal of GA Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya Meena Kumari at Lalganj block in Vaishali district and Kamlesh Kumar Swalambi of Uchha Vidyalaya Tenua at Kalyanpur block in East Champaran district after the district education officers of respective districts submitted a report in this connection.

In case of GA Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya, district education officer Sangita Sinha on her visit to the school found that the attendance register had caste of students mentioned before their names. The school also had separate sections for students belonging to separate castes. Acting principal Meera Kumari said, ""This practice was prevalent since 2014 and it was started by former principal Phool Chand Ansari as a tool to save time and quick implementation of government schemes catering to particular caste."" She added they had no intention of hurting the sentiments of anyone.

In case of Uchha Vidyalaya Tenua, no separate classroom was found. However, students had their castes mentioned before their names.

Calling the incident as unfortunate, state education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma said, ""Such things cannot be tolerated.

And this is exactly the situation that we are facing today in our Khasi-Pnar society. And who could possibly feel the direct threat and impact of this situation are the innocent citizens who are not politically or materialistically ambitious in life. From various incidences that have happened in the state recently and during the past few years, we see the breakdown of the rule of law and flouting of the law despite many prohibitions that are in place which I need not elaborate. Even though we always stake claims on customary laws that govern our society, they are mostly in oral form lacking the appropriate authority and power of modern jurisprudence. And the fact that the Khasis never had their own scripts is just another analogy to indicate the nature of hesitation of the people to come under any contract law or agreement but to rely solely on the conscience and conduct of the person, which is not suitable for the administration of justice in a modern state.

On the issue of leadership crisis, this is not a new development but is as old as the community itself. The primary reasons are perhaps that the Khasis have migrated to these hills not as a whole bunch of community or tribe but as individual clans in different times and seasons. And if this is the case then obviously there were frequent conflicts and misunderstandings on governance, land for settlement, etc. Hence, in some instances, these problems have percolated to every subsequent generation and its nature is also being inherited by many individuals and groups till date. But the prominent among these was on who should be the in leading roles because all clans are equal in status. Therefore, the most ideal situation is to have a third person to preside over them such as the 'Chieftain' or the 'Syiem'. Thus in most cases the Syiem is always from outside their circle or an outsider.

As a community we have not been able to raise good leaders for the society because we are so divided politically and culturally into various groups of different thoughts and ideologies which is a result of that crisis. And the reason why I am saying this is because I do not see any capable Chief Minister from among the Khasi-Pnar community as of now and in the near future. The root of the problem lies in the fact that people at large have never understood the basic principles and values of leadership. And those who think and see themselves as leaders are relying exclusively on external factors such as finance, qualification and strategies which can be easily acquired but yet are not intrinsic human characters that will define true leadership. Self-styled leaders may be plenty but genuine and systematic leadership comes from the system within. We have therefore failed as a community and the state as a whole in this aspect.

Apart from this traditional nature, another major modern factor that has contributed immensely to this ongoing leadership crisis is the exemption of this topic from the entire educational curriculum. Right from the very inception of our educational system, this issue was perceived as academically irrelevant and unnecessary. The reason I am saying this is because nowhere in the past, during our school and college days have we ever come across the term leadership. And the primary goal of education was and is to get a government job at any cost in any capacity be it technical, clerical, secretarial and teaching as a security for life. Leadership is such a term which is strange and unfamiliar to the learning community during the past generations and in the present as well. Therefore, there is a lack of leadership skills in every department and sector of governance to ignite the mechanism of growth and development. Leadership et al is only learned in other courses of higher studies and prominently in the Management Institutes. Thank God for such institutions that are now available in our state but how many students from the native state are getting the privilege to enroll in these institutions. The CBSE on the other hand has gone much ahead by introducing leadership right from the primary level. This is outstanding because the opportunity to experience and taste the idea, concepts and challenges of leadership should begin from a very early age. Here again we can question the wisdom of our education policy and the competency therein in the mission and vision to shape the lives of our children and the future generation.

Look at the political parties that are functioning in our state and their leaders. Do we have any hope on any of them? They are there only for the sake of power and position during elections and when they lose the elections they just vanish into thin air. I just happened to watch a programme in a local TV channel attended by our Deputy Chief Minister as Chief Guest on the anniversary celebration of one local church where he unfortunately said, 'Katba nang bun ki balang, katta nang bun ki jingsniew' (the more churches, the more the crimes). What a silly statement from the Deputy CM! Does he mean to say that churches are propagating crimes? As a responsible person he should have put things the other way round. Just because he is in a position of power he has no authority to define things lavishly. It is here that leadership is also like an image that reflects the entire quality of an individual because a simple statement may ruin and damage the whole community thereby hurting the sentiments of many sincere adherents.

We always blame lack of unity for the sorry state of affairs, but in fact unity is the synchronization of each and every effort where we are all components of that effort. The concept of leadership as perceived by many especially the rural population is the strength of financial muscles. What a pathetic situation when money decides who gets elected and who forms the government. So what can we expect from people who pay money for votes? Nothing much, except that they will do all they can to recover their investment in the next five year.

Therefore, there is an immediate need to inculcate the values and qualities of leadership right from the primary level of schooling in order to build the state and community for the future."

At least 100 of the 1,200 houses on the banks of the Mula river in the Patil Estate slum were destroyed in a fire that broke out in the hutment on November 28.

The land was so far reserved for ""educational purposes"" and could not be utilized for anything else. ""A no objection certificate (NOC) came from the education department on Wednesday. This has paved the way for the rehabilitation of the slums,"" MLA Vijay Kale said on Thursday.

CoEP authorities said tenders would be floated for the rehabilitation programme and the contract awarded to the highest bidder. As per the contract, one part of the land would be utilized to rehabilitate over 1,188 dwelling units in accordance with the Slum Rehabilitation Act.

The second part of the land will be used by CoEP to construct an educational building, while the rest will be used by the builder for commercial purposes.

Kale said, ""It will take 5-6 months for the proposal to go through the official process. The buildings will come up in another year or two. If convinced about the utility of the project, people will support us.""

The MLA added, ""The 1,188 dwelling units are the official figures we have following a survey by an NGO, Mashal. We will try to accommodate 5-10 more units missed out in the survey. The entire slum area will be razed before the rehabilitation process starts.""

SRA additional collector Suresh Jadhav said the government changed the formula used to calculate the additional Floor Space Index (FSI) two days ago. ""In the SRA projects, the builders get an additional FSI. Earlier it used to be 1.25-2.5. The new formula takes into account project sites and construction and saleable costs as per the Ready Reckoner rates. The builders can now get 1.5-3 FSI.""

Bhalchandra Birajdar, an applied mechanics professor at CoEP, said, ""The Patil Estate area is unsafe. The lanes are narrow and a small earthquake can cause destruction. The land is owned by the CoEP. A Bombay high court decision had confirmed it a few years ago. We could not use it for educational purpose because of the slums."""

Govt to infuse additional Rs 41,000 cr into PSU banks

The government will infuse additional Rs 41,000 crore in to public sector banks (PSBs), making the total amount for bank recapitalisation at Rs 1.06 lakh crore in financial year 2018-19.

The Council found the advertisement misleading by exaggeration.

The television commercial shows the actor and two other girls applying lipstick, make-up, and saying they love it. When they say that clean-up is tough, Alia tells them that they could clean up using the product in just one swipe.

CERC had approached ASCI raising questions on the claims made by the company in the advertisement.

CERC said in a release that the advertiser (L'Oreal India) could not provide any evidence to show that Alia had done the due diligence prior to endorsing the product, to ensure that the claims made were capable of substantiation. The claim and visuals in the commercial implied that all make-up would be completely off in one swipe. There was no specification regarding the critical threshold (75%, 90%, 95%, 99%) for removal in one swipe.

According to the consumer rights organisation, L'Oreal submitted before ASCI that its claim was made on the basis of an independent study conducted to evaluate the product's make-up removing efficacy. The results showed that up to 93.9% foundation was removed in one swipe, but corresponding value for mascara was only 60.9%.

CERC said that ASCI also found the sample size of 20 too low, and also observed that the test did not include the make-up items such as kajal and lipstick that were referred to in the advertisement.

ASCI concluded that the claim that make-up would be off in just one swipe was not substantiated.

The claim was misleading by exaggeration and likely to lead to grave or widespread disappointment in minds of consumers, it said, while advising L'Oreal to withdraw or to modify the advertisement suitably.

CERC monitors and reports false, misleading, and objectionable advertisements to regulatory authorities, in a bid to curb the menace. It has been awarded a project by the department of consumer affairs to study misleading advertisements.

The Government of Bihar has now ordered action against the principal of the school.

Vaishali District Magistrate Rajeev Roshan said that the reports of the caste-wise seating arrangement were found to be true, following which action was ordered against the principal.

According to a local source, the GA High School in Lalganj Vaishali, which has over 1,000 students enrolled in Classes IX and X, divided the students on the basis of their religion and caste and asked them to sit in separate classrooms accordingly. Their attendance registers also mention their caste along with their names, so as to ensure that all students stuck to the religion and caste-based division while sitting in the classrooms.

""The issue came to the fore when some students of the school raised an objection to the caste-based segregation, following which the district administration probed the matter and ordered action against the principal, Meena Kumari,"" the source added.

Kumari, in her defence, said she only continued with the seating plan decided by her predecessor as it was convenient to implement the various welfare schemes of the government if the students were seated accordingly. She also denied that the students had ever been discriminated due to their religion or caste.

The local officials of the education department have sent a detailed report on the matter to the senior officials for information and further recommendation.

The Government of Bihar not just provides scholarships but also funds for buying the uniform and cycle to the students, most of which is now directly transferred to their bank accounts, if the students have 75% attendance."

Her score would be below expectations until she began learning from the new 'energized' textbooks, carrying quick response (QR) codes.

""It has improved my performance in exams and I have gained confidence in learning the subject,"" she said.

Supriya isn't the only one. The ease with which students are able to access quality content online has made QR codes a hit. Six months after the textbooks were launched for standard I, VI, IX and XI, there have been more than 2 crore scans and over 1 crore downloads, highest compared to Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan, which have also launched these textbooks.

These 'energized' textbooks (a termed coined by the school education department) provide more information and contextualised content in the form of audio and video films made accessible through the codes placed below every lesson. And to get more information all a student or a teacher needs to do is install the DIKSHA app or any other external QR code scanner app. This will be linked to audio, video content or worksheets at the DIKSHA repository.

""The children no more fear subjects like they used to. The new textbooks have brought about a change in the manner students approach subjects such as chemistry, biology, Tamil and maths. Children like Tamil because there is musical content,"" said R C Saraswati, principal, Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Ashok Nagar.

Officials from the department said at least 4,000 such codes had been placed in textbooks across the state.

""These books are used by more than 36 lakh students across the state. Next year we will be launching them for Classes II,VII, X and XII,"" said Satheesh R.M, state coordinator, DIKSHA and Digital Assessment.

Meanwhile, a few teachers from government and private matriculation schools said codes placed in maths and biology textbooks were not working and that in some other textbooks only two or three lessons were linked. Officials from the department said they are looking into the complaints.

The app would have had more takers had there been more awareness. ""Authorities need to train more teachers as many are not aware of this technology,"" said K Shanmugavelayutham, convener, TN-FORCES.

However, officials said they have trained all teachers to use the codes before the launch."

Chudasama gave credit for the achievement to the efforts by Vice-Chancellors of Universities and faculties for enabling Gujarat top in the state. He also said that coordination between Education department, Industries department and Department of Science and Technology has been key to encourage startups, particularly student startups in the state.

State education secretary Anju Sharma told DNA that in about one and a half years, state government has reached out to 74 institutions as a part of outreach exercise to draw students towards startups, reaching out to over 2.45 lakh students.

""It is for the first time that students in tier 2 and tier 3 cities have got a level playing field to convert their ideas into startups. We have created entire pipeline for converting ideas into startups,"" said Sharma. Till now students have proposed 1,879 projects, of which 540 reached Proof-of-Concept stage, 351 patents have been filed so far and 51 startups have emerged out.

However, other actors in the startup ecosystem say that Gujarat has a lot to do to really emerge as an attractive hub for startups.

Sunil Parekh, who played a key role in the execution of state's Startup Policy said that involvement of local industries is lacking.

""The way IT businessmen in southern states have integrated themselves with startups is not happening in Gujarat. That informality and connection is inevitable to create a sustainable startup ecosystem,"" Parekh told DNA.

He, however, acknowledged that of late serious startups have also come up, which is an early indication of emergence of a mature ecosystem for startups.

Manish Shah, vice-president of LJ Group of Institutes said that efforts to link startups with markets are badly needed.

Government, local companies and chamber of commerce should also try to act as a market for startups. On why Gujarat does not have any blockbuster startup, Shah said that such startups are in the field of IT where Gujarat is lagging behind and so there is no such startup to be showcased."

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

We have been able to establish financial trails of money flowing into certain NGOs. These NGOs were floated by middlemen and the money came from aircraft manufacturers supplying to the Indian carriers,"" a senior ED official said.

Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials Thursday said their investigation into alleged money laundering in connection with the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines and acquisition of 111 aircraft by the two carriers during the UPA regime had made headway with the detection of a money trail.

""Our investigation into the acquisition of aircraft is at an advanced stage. We have been able to establish financial trails of money flowing into certain NGOs. These NGOs were floated by middlemen and the money came from aircraft manufacturers supplying to the Indian carriers,"" a senior ED official said.

The ED revelations came on the day French newspaper Le Monde reported that Airbus, one of the aircraft manufacturers that supplied to the Indian carriers, could face fines of several billion dollars in the wake of a US Department of Justice probe into ""improper practices"". According to Le Monde, the probe had found several corruption allegations in multiple countries, mostly in Asia, including India and Malaysia.

Newswire service AFP, reporting from Paris, said Airbus had put out a statement saying it was cooperating with US authorities.

Le Monde said Airbus allegedly used CSR activities and the setting up of aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul to channel funds to middlemen. It also mentioned the case of Deepak Talwar, a corporate lobbyist, who is under probe by CBI and ED for allegedly misusing funds received through CSR from Airbus in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).

In September 2016, The Indian Express first reported that funds donated by Airbus and MBDA, Europe's leading missile manufacturing company, to Talwar's NGO Advantage India had come under the scanner of the Income Tax department. The payments were made to Advantage India between June 2012 and April 2015 in several tranches by MBDA and the erstwhile EADS which in 2014 was reorganised as the Airbus Group.

In November, 2017, CBI registered a case of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy against Talwar for allegedly diverting foreign funds received by his NGO for personal use. It said Advantage India received funds to the tune of Rs 90.72 crore from Airbus and MBDA. The funds had been received as part of corporate social responsibility (CSR) of the two donors and were meant for activities in the field of education.

Talwar was unavailable for comment Friday. But he had earlier told The Indian Express that there had been no wrongdoing, that he had set up the NGO 17 years ago and was no longer involved in its day-to-day functioning.

The ED has registered four cases of alleged money laundering in the matter. Sources in ED said the cases were based on four CBI FIRs lodged last year and have been registered under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. NCP leader Praful Patel was Civil Aviation Minister when the Air India-Indian Airlines merger took place during the UPA-I rule. In media interactions earlier, Patel had denied any wrongdoing and said all decisions had been collective.

""While probing a case of money laundering against corporate consultant Deepak Talwar, we stumbled upon some money trail that is linked to the entire matter of Air India. We have traced a payment linked to the Air India case to an entity linked to Deepak Talwar. The money involved is huge,"" a senior ED official said.

The four ED cases are related to the Air India-Indian Airlines merger, purchase of 111 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus at Rs 70,000 crore, alleged deliberate ceding of profitable routes and schedules to private airlines, and opening of certain training institutes with foreign investment.

In a report tabled in Parliament in January 2012, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), while flagging irregularities, had called the decision to acquire 111 aircraft by Air India ""a recipe for disaster"", which should have raised alarm in the government. It said that the aircraft acquisition through debt had ""contributed predominantly"" to the airline's massive debt liability."

The school owner, Amit Bhati, told TOI that in March 2017, he had given the plot to Sanjeev Jha, principal of the school, and Raghvender Solanki, vice-principal, against Rs 10,000 a month. He denied any share in the school's profits. Asked about the affiliation, Bhati said he was not aware of it.

It is in a conceptual stage and approvals are awaited for the project, which is to be implemented in association with industry and academia, said STPI Director CVD Ram Prasad.

The senior official, who earlier in the day addressed industry body CII's IoT-AI Summit here on Thursday, was elaborating on plans of the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. STPI was established in 1991 as a society under MietY.

The STPI, in association with different partners, has a 200-seater IMAGE (Innovation in Multimedia Animation Gaming and Entertainment) incubation centre. The proposed CoE, he said, was likely to be 100-seater and the investment likely over five years on the facility would be ₹20 crore.

A release from CII said Mr.Prasad highlighted how innovation and disruptive technologies would drive the new age business he said. The Ministry, he said, along with the industry and Academia is setting up CoE in Artificial Intelligence, IoT (Internet of Things) and Blockchain in various States.

According to the Ministry, the CoEs in the emerging sectors would help build next wave of budding entrepreneurs. Such facilities would aim at providing structural and fundamental support and extend requisite lab support, funding and mentoring.

Addressing the summit, Director-Emerging Technologies in the Telangana IT, Electronics & Communications Department L.Ramadevi said State government has been leveraging and adopting digital technologies internally. One such initiative is the chat bots for government tourism sites (T-Aadab).

It planned to soft launch chat bots for RTA website. IoT and AI technologies are also used for various pilot projects to ease the traffic in the city and support disaster management initiatives and agriculture in the State, she said.

Head, Data Analytics Cell of NITI Aayog Avik Sarkar said the Aayog is working on a national strategy paper on AI and all other emerging technologies. Focus areas of the strategy are healthcare, agriculture, education, smart cities and mobility.

With access to cloud computing infrastructure remaining a major challenge in the area of skill development, Niti Aayog has proposed setting up of an artificial intelligence research analytics and knowledge assimilation platform (AIRAWAT) as a common commute platform to support AI, the release said."

Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials Thursday said their investigation into alleged money laundering in connection with the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines and acquisition of 111 aircraft by the two carriers during the UPA regime had made headway with the detection of a money trail.

""Our investigation into the acquisition of aircraft is at an advanced stage. We have been able to establish financial trails of money flowing into certain NGOs. These NGOs were floated by middlemen and the money came from aircraft manufacturers supplying to the Indian carriers,"" a senior ED official said.

The ED revelations came on the day French newspaper

Le Monde reported that Airbus, one of the aircraft manufacturers that supplied to the Indian carriers, could face fines of several billion dollars in the wake of a US Department of Justice probe into ""improper practices"". According to Le Monde, the probe had found several corruption allegations in multiple countries, mostly in Asia, including India and Malaysia.

Newswire service AFP, reporting from Paris, said Airbus had put out a statement saying it was cooperating with US authorities.

Le Monde said Airbus allegedly used CSR activities and the setting up of aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul to channel funds to middlemen. It also mentioned the case of Deepak Talwar, a corporate lobbyist, who is under probe by CBI and ED for allegedly misusing funds received through CSR from Airbus in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).

In September 2016, The Indian Express first reported that funds donated by Airbus and MBDA, Europe's leading missile manufacturing company, to Talwar's NGO Advantage India had come under the scanner of the Income Tax department. The payments were made to Advantage India between June 2012 and April 2015 in several tranches by MBDA and the erstwhile EADS which in 2014 was reorganised as the Airbus Group.

In November, 2017, CBI registered a case of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy against Talwar for allegedly diverting foreign funds received by his NGO for personal use. It said Advantage India received funds to the tune of Rs 90.72 crore from Airbus and MBDA. The funds had been received as part of corporate social responsibility (CSR) of the two donors and were meant for activities in the field of education.

Talwar was unavailable for comment Friday. But he had earlier told The Indian Express that there had been no wrongdoing, that he had set up the NGO 17 years ago and was no longer involved in its day-to-day functioning.

The ED has registered four cases of alleged money laundering in the matter. Sources in ED said the cases were based on four CBI FIRs lodged last year and have been registered under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. NCP leader Praful Patel was Civil Aviation Minister when the Air India-Indian Airlines merger took place during the UPA-I rule. In media interactions earlier, Patel had denied any wrongdoing and said all decisions had been collective.

""While probing a case of money laundering against corporate consultant Deepak Talwar, we stumbled upon some money trail that is linked to the entire matter of Air India. We have traced a payment linked to the Air India case to an entity linked to Deepak Talwar. The money involved is huge,"" a senior ED official said.

The four ED cases are related to the Air India-Indian Airlines merger, purchase of 111 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus at Rs 70,000 crore, alleged deliberate ceding of profitable routes and schedules to private airlines, and opening of certain training institutes with foreign investment.

In a report tabled in Parliament in January 2012, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), while flagging irregularities, had called the decision to acquire 111 aircraft by Air India ""a recipe for disaster"", which should have raised alarm in the government. It said that the aircraft acquisition through debt had ""contributed predominantly"" to the airline's massive debt liability."

Jaleel has raised caution against alleged attempts to alter the country's history in order to further the vested interests of certain sections and foment disunity.

Inaugurating the fourth annual session of the Kerala History Congress at the Karyavattom campus of University of Kerala on Thursday, Dr. Jaleel accused Right-wing fundamentalist outfits of attempting to distort history and challenging the founding ideals of the country. Secularism, a core value of the Constitution, came under unprecedented threat in the process.

""The concept of secularism had figured in the edicts of the Emperor Ashoka, much before it became familiar to the world. However, doubts have been raised regarding the country's fundamental ideals since the days of the Independence movement. The imperialist forces remained firm on their stance that the country with its religious, linguistic, and cultural diversity could not prosper. This reasoning behind the two-nation theory had led to the Partition of India. However, Pakistan would not have witnessed a bifurcation, which led to the formation of Bangladesh, if religion alone could hold a nation together. Now, concerted efforts are being made to project India as a Hindu nation by distorting history,"" Dr. Jaleel said.

The Minister was highly critical of Indian Railways' decision to erase a mural on the Wagon Tragedy at the Tirur railway station, with scant regard for the historical account. ""By bowing to the pressure of Right-wing fundamentalists, Railways have done a disservice to the country. Efforts were made to portray the tragic episode as a communal clash and not part of the freedom struggle,"" he said.

Kerala History Congress president Rajan Gurukkal presided over the function. Prominent historian K.N. Panikkar (in his absence) and local historian Vellanad Ramachandran were felicitated on the occasion. Charithra Edukalile Chithalpadukal, a book authored by P.

About 25,000 schools -- including primary, upper primary and high schools -- will get the biometric equipment. Already, the Aadhaar biometric attendance system was being used in 9,349 government-run schools in 12 districts across Telangana. Now, the Directorate of School Education decided to extend the system to all government-run schools and sent a proposal to the State government seeking budgetary support for installing the machines.

The department tied up with Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and Telangana State Technology Services (TSTS) for implementing the Aadhaar biometric attendance. One biometric machine was being provided for every 100 students, with managements being directed to record attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff twice a day -- morning and evening -- and for students, before serving the mid-day meal.

""The attendance recorded on the biometric machines will be matched with the bills submitted by school managements to ascertain the number of students consuming the mid-day meal. As it is linked with Aadhaar, the managements cannot duplicate admissions,"" an official said.

The machines and software were designed in such a way that biometric fingerprints captured are immediately verified with the biometric details available with UIDAI using Internet and is reflected in the dashboard of the School Education Department's website. A software was being developed to transmit the captured details offline or when network is available in the schools located in remote areas.

The move came a day after the Deputy Mayor, Srinagar Municipal Corporation, Sheikh Imran's video at Chest Disease Hospital went viral in which he has used unparliamentary language like ""bloody and b..ls..t"" with a group of on-duty doctors.

Principal GMC, Dr Samia Rashid said they have taken up the matter with Advisor K Vijay Kumar and have also written to the Commissioner Secretary Health and Medical Education Department.

""I have already taken up the issue with the Advisor. I have written a letter to him, including the Commissioner and have urged them to take necessary action in this regard,"" she said.

Dr Samia said what Imran did on Tuesday at the hospital was not his domain. ""His job is to take care of drains and roads. He cannot intervene into the matters of the hospital,"" she said.

She also said that she has talked with the doctors of the CD hospital and asked them to perform their duties and not to worry about such attacks.

Meanwhile, the rights body, SHRC, has taken suo-moto cognizance of the matter observing that disturbing news reports have appeared in the press while as a video has also gone viral on social media about the Deputy Mayor's visit to the CD hospital.

The Commission said, ""It is well settled that exercising powers by any authority which are not available to him in law amounts to breaking of rule of law and as such violation of human rights.""

SHRC said in a statement said that reports prima facie suggest that the Deputy Mayor's remarks were ""humiliating"" to members of every respectable and notable profession.

Taking cognizance of the matter, SHRC issued a notice to the Deputy Mayor asking him to reply by 26 December 2018.

Imran's video went viral triggering outrage on social media and leaving doctor fraternity fuming.

Assaults against doctors continue in hospitals amid security and CCTV surveillance. On Wednesday night doctors at SMHS Hospital averted three assailants at the emergency ward.

""I had to avert three assaults on my residents by unruly attendants. The working of medical emergency reception was stopped twice and the emergency ward was in chaos for nearly an hour due to which I could not attend a sick patient,"" said a doctor at SMHS Hospital.

On September 17 this year, a lady doctor was ruthlessly beaten up by over a dozen men at Lalla Ded hospital after a patient delivered a dead baby.

In December last year, a consultant surgeon at Community Health Centre, Zainapora, Shopian, was harassed by an administrator after he was coming out of the theatre.

Over the years, doctors in Kashmir have been asking the government to bring an ordinance to make the violence against doctors a non-bailable offence but the government is yet to wake up.

""We want an ordinance to avoid violence against doctors in hospitals in the State. The same has been enacted by 22 States in India and it is much needed here,"" president Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK), Dr Suhail Naik told the Rising Kashmir.

Apart from this, he had taken an education loan of ₹5 lakh from the Sulthan Bathery branch of Punjab National Bank.

He had cultivated many crops, including coffee, pepper, ginger, banana, and vegetables on his 3.5 acres, with little success.

Moreover, village authorities stopped accepting land tax since 2003 as per a directive of the Forest Department after claiming ownership on the land.

It was suspected that the debt forced him to take the extreme step."

Among those protesting are Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Indian Institute of Technology (Mumbai), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune, Bangalore University, among others.

Apart from the campus protests, they also plan an offline campaign by flooding twitter using #HikeResearchFellowship and tagging the concerned authorities. However, if all their efforts go in vain, researchers plan on sending Re 1 cheque to the Prime Minister as well.

The demands include an annual increment in fellowship in accordance to inflation and inclusion of research scholars under Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) or State Government Health Scheme (SGHS) to avail the medical facilities.

""We are doing research at these institutes but many of us don't get any stipend. Out of the 820 institutes under the UGC, barely 65 come under the universities with potential for excellence and only they get the fellowships, the remaining are left out,"" said Arghya Das, a research fellow at the International centre for Theoretical Science (ICTS).

This will be replicated in other campuses in cities like Pune, Mumbai , Kolkata and Lucknow. Researchers from the national capital will gather outside the Department of Science and Technology (Ministry of Science and Technology).

In an attempt to pacify the researchers, Ashutosh Sharma, the secretary of Department of Science and technology, had tweeted on December 16 assuring them that the process for a hike in their fellowship is ""fully on track.""

However, the researchers are in no mood to be pacified.

Sachin Pandey, a PhD Student from IISc, Bengaluru, said that the demand has been pending for months. ""We have approached the MHRD as well as the Department of Science and Technology but, we are given false promises every time. This will be a nationwide protest and if our demands are not met we will even protest in front of MHRD,"" said Pandey.

Earlier, research fellows from IISc had sent around 500 post cards to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) with the same demand."

Therefore, investing in this phase of life determines the child's brain development and potential, said experts at a media roundtable.

The state level media roundtable was organised by UNICEF here today keeping in mind the importance of early childhood development of children.

Addressing the media were Dr (Prof) Ajit Kumar Mohanty, retired professor of psychology, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, Prof. Bhaswati Patnaik, Head, Department of Psychology, Utkal University, Lalita Patnaik, Education Specialist and Officer-in-Charge, UNICEF Odisha and Alka Gupta, Communications Specialist, UNICEF Odisha.

Setting the context to the media round-table Ms. Lalita Patnaik said, ""Children who grow up healthyand educated, loved and protected, are more likely to develop into responsible, productive adults. However, we know that today millions of children across the world are losing out due to poor health, nutrition, and lack of positive stimulation in their lives. Investing in the early years of a child needs multi-disciplinary action: by parents; government, civil society and private sector, working together.""

Addressing the media, Professor Ajit Mohanty said,"" The earliest years of life from birth to eight years of age, are the most important period of development when the brain is developing the fastest. Research shows that for optimum brain development children need good nutrition and health, as well as positive stimulation and protection from violence, abuse and neglect. The poorest and most disadvantaged children face the biggest risk of missing out. Poverty, malnutrition and psychosocial deprivations adversely impact the developing brain of the child.""

Prof. Bhaswati Patnaik speaking on the importance of knowledge management said,"" Generating evidence and knowledge management of interventions that have worked are critical to understanding early childhood development. The Department of Psychology, Utkal University is contributing towards this effort.""

The sustainable, long-term economic growth of any country nation is related to the overall development of its youngest citizens, its children.The price of not investing in these early years of children leads to poorer health, fewer learning skills and reduced ability to earn as well as greater burden on health, education and welfare services, promoting an inter-generational cycle of disadvantage and inequity."

District Magistrate Rajiv Raushan said the inquiry was ordered following media reports claiming that students belonging to different castes and religious communities were made to sit separately at the G A Higher Secondary School in the district's Lalganj block.

He said they have also written to higher authorities in the education department to take ""exemplary action against the school's principal in order to deter others from adopting such practices"".

Students from scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other backward classes and upper castes, as well as from the Hindu and Muslim communities, were assigned separate sections in their respective classrooms, according to the reports.

The reports had also claimed that separate attendance registers were, therefore, being maintained for students belonging to different social segments even though the children freely intermingled outside the school.

Commemorative Postage Stamp on Rajkumar Shukla

For Prelims and Mains: About Rajkumar Shukla and Champaran Satyagraha- significance and outcomes.

Department of Posts has been paying a tribute to eminent personalities who have made a significant contribution to public life especially freedom fighters. With this stamp, the Department has released 43 issues in the current calendar year.

In drawing the attention of Mahatma Gandhi to the plight of peasants suffering under an oppressive system established by European indigo planters in Champaran, Bihar, Rajkumar Shukla made a seminal contribution culminating in the launch of the Champaran Satyagraha in 1917 by Mahatma Gandhi.

It was undertaken in the erstwhile undivided Champaran district in northern Bihar. Mahatma Gandhi went there in April, 1917 on learning about the abuses suffered by the cultivators of the district, forced into growing indigo by British planters/estate owners.

In June 1917, the British administration declared the formation of a formal inquiry committee with Gandhi aboard. The Government accepted almost all its recommendations. The principal recommendation accepted was complete abolition of Tinkathia system. It was a major blow to the British planters who became resentful. But they could not prevent the passage of Champaran Agrarian Act in Bihar & Orissa Legislative Council on March 4, 1918.

For Prelims and Mains: Liberation of Goa and attainment of statehood.

Context: Goa recently celebrated the 57th Liberation Day. On this day, Goa attained independence from the 450-years of Portuguese rule.

Portuguese were the first ones to colonize parts of India and were the last to leave. The Portuguese invaded Goa in the year 1510.

Operation Vijay began on December 17, 1961, when the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ordered the invasion. With a force of almost 30,000, the Indian attack overpowered the ill-prepared Portuguese 3,000 member army. With minimal blood shed, the attack was successful and was carried forward to retrieve the other Portuguese-controlled areas, Daman and Diu.

At this point on December 18, the Portuguese Governor General Vassalo da Silva gave up control of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu. Three days after the attack began, Goa finally became a part of India.

The Goa Opinion Poll was a referendum held in the state of Goa, India, on 16 January 1967, to decide the future of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu within the Indian Union. Although popularly called an opinion poll, it was in fact, a referendum, as the results of the poll were binding on the government of India. The referendum offered the people of Goa a choice between continuing as a union territory or merging with the state of Maharashtra. It is the only referendum to have been held in independent India. The people of Goa voted against the merger and Goa continued to be a union territory. Subsequently, in 1987, Goa became a full-fledged state within the Indian Union.

For Prelims and Mains: All about Winter Solstice- its occurrence, why it occurs, significance and changes associated.

The winter solstice happens every year when the Sun reaches its most southerly declination of -23.5 degrees. In other words, it is when the North Pole is tilted farthest away from the Sun, delivering the fewest hours of sunlight of the year.

Does the winter solstice always occur on December 21st?

While it more often than not falls on December 21st, the exact time of the solstice varies each year. In the Northern hemisphere the winter solstice is the shortest day of the year, because it is tilted away from the sun, and receives the least amount of sunlight on that day.

The term 'solstice' derives from the Latin word 'solstitium', meaning 'Sun standing still'. On this day the Sun seems to stand still at the Tropic of Capricorn and then reverses its direction as it reaches its southernmost position as seen from the Earth. Some prefer the more teutonic term 'sunturn' to describe the event.

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty

For Prelims and Mains: Key features and significance of INF Treaty, Implications of withdrawal by the US.

Context: Russia has confirmed that the United States of America has decided to cancel the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty signed between Russian and the USA in 1987. The USA had already announced the withdrawal decision from the INF treaty in October 2018.

The United States first alleged in its July 2014 Compliance Report that Russia is in violation of its INF Treaty obligations ""not to possess, produce, or flight-test"" a ground-launched cruise missile having a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers or ""to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.""

Subsequent State Department assessments in 2015, 2016, and 2017 repeated these allegations. Russia denies that it is in violation of the agreement. On December 8, 2017, the Trump administration released a strategy to counter alleged Russian violations of the Treaty.

About the Intermediate- Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty:

The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty required the United States and the Soviet Union to eliminate and permanently forswear all of their nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers.

What are the diplomatic implications of withdrawal?

Withdrawal is likely to be controversial with U.S. allies in NATO, further splitting the alliance at a difficult time for transatlantic relations. Many Western European NATO states favor retaining the INF, in conjunction with previous U.S. policy designed to push Moscow back into compliance. This raises concerns that divisions within NATO may worsen when the United States officially withdraws from the INF.

For Prelims and Mains: Yemen issues, peace agreement, features and its significance.

Context: Yemen's warring parties have agreed to an immediate ceasefire in the Red Sea port of Hodeidah in a potential breakthrough at the end of a week of peace talks in Sweden.

A political framework for Yemen will be discussed in a next round of meetings, scheduled for late January. If implemented on the ground, the deal would represent a breakthrough because the port is the gateway for the bulk of humanitarian aid coming into the country, and has been the subject of intense fighting. Ceasefires have also been agreed at two other ports, Salif and Ras Issa.

The ceasefire between Yemen's Houthi rebels and forces loyal to President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi in the port city of Hodeida came into existence on December 18. The agreement was reached in UN-mediated talks held in Stockholm earlier this month. At the time of the negotiations, the city was almost in the hands of the Saudi-led coalition. The coalition had blockaded the port, the main conduit for humanitarian aid to enter Yemen, for months, and the fighters, mostly UAE soldiers, were battling the rebels.

But Saudi Arabia came under increased global pressure to stop fighting in Yemen after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside its consulate in Istanbul triggered a global outcry. The spotlight on Yemen and its deteriorating humanitarian situation has been so strong after the Khashoggi affair that even the U.S., which supports Riyadh in the war, cut down its involvement by ending refuelling of coalition aircraft. With the UN also pushing for talks, the Yemeni government backed by Saudi Arabia gave the green light for talks.

Since the Saudi intervention in 2015, at least 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen, according to the WHO. The widespread damage caused to infrastructure by the coalition airstrikes and lack of supplies of food and medicines due to the blockade have pushed Yemen into a humanitarian catastrophe. About 12 million people are at the risk of starvation if aid doesn't reach them fast. The country has also seen a massive cholera outbreak. A child dies every 10 minutes in Yemen from preventable causes, says UNICEF.

Saudi Arabia interfered in Yemen after the Shia Houthi rebels captured Sana'a, the capital city, and the internationally recognised government of President Hadi moved to the country's south. The Saudis accuse Iran of bankrolling the Houthis and ""destabilising"" the Arabian Peninsula.

The Saudi plan was to expel the Houthis from Sana'a and restore the authority of the government. But almost four years since they launched the attack, the Houthis still control Sana'a and much of the north of Yemen. They also fire short-range missiles across the border into Saudi Arabia, which has become a major security concern for Riyadh.

For Prelims and Mains: Features, objectives, scientific goals and significance of the mission, about GSLV- F11.

Context: ISRO has launched military communication satellite GSAT-7A. GSAT-7A was succesfully injected into its orbit by GSLV-F11 that was launched from Sriharikota.

GSAT-7A has been placed in the geostationary orbit and this communication satellite is expected to help the IAF to interlink different ground radar stations, airbases and AWACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) aircraft. The idea is to improve the IAF's network-centric warfare capabilities.

The GSAT 7 series was launched in 2013 as a dedicated communications satellite for the Indian Navy, which made the Navy completely independent of relying on foreign satellites for its blue water capabilities, thanks to GSAT 7 having a 2,000 nautical mile footprint. This helps in providing real-time inputs to Indian warships, submarines and maritime aircraft.

The GSLV is ISRO's fourth generation launch vehicle that has three stages. The four liquid strap-ons and a solid rocket motor at the core constitute the first stage. The second stage is equipped with a high thrust engine that uses liquid fuel.

The cryogenic upper stage forms the third and final stage of the vehicle. The GSLV-F11 was the seventh flight carrying indigenously developed cryogenic upper stage.

Some of the major proposal were:

* For untied funds: Health Infrastructure status of the States to be used as a criteria- will help States with significant infrastructure deficit and health lag to get more funds.

* 10% of fund to be earmarked for the health sector with atleast 2/3rd being reserved for the primary health.

* For performance based incentives: composite health index to be utilized to encourage states to demonstrate performance on year on year basis - should have a weightage of 20% in the performance linked pool.

* Increase State sector health spending to more than 8% of their budget by 2020.

* Primary Health Expenditure to be 2/3rd of the total health expenditure.

Some of the preliminary issues on the Health Sector under the focus of XVFC are:

* Skilled manpower and conditional financial allocation - the two main challenges of the Health Sector today.

* The change of disease spectrum from infectious diseases to degenerative diseasesrequiring the need to strengthen the Community Health Centers and District Hospitals in the States.

* The health sector as a key driver of the 21st Century economy on account of its employment potential and need to improve the medical education in the country. Need to increase the post graduate doctors in the country.

* Need to create 'Cooperative Model' rather than a 'Competitive Model' between Public and Private Hospitals.

* Integration of the initiatives taken by the Government like 'Ayushman Bharat' and 'Swachh Bharat Mission'.

* Need for a comprehensive ban of private practice by Government Doctors.

* Optimum utilization of the funds allocated by the Centre to the States on Public Health.

* Need to open more Medical Colleges and Hospitals, for training more manpower which could enable to build the gap between doctor-patient ratios.

* Need to think in the lines of the price control mechanism in the pharmacy and drugs market and thereby bring uniformity in the Health Care facility.

* Proposal to include officials from National Health Accounts Division in Ministry of Health which is monitoring the funds allocated to the States. Requirement of data on funds allocated to the States and their optimum utilisation and outcomes.

During the meeting, the Commission highlighted the need to focus on the following issues:

* The way to extract best economic returns from investment already made in health sector.

* Need for a robust audit system in each hospital with a database of statistics of all PHC, CHC, District hospitals etc. The technology enables the daily uploading of data of OPDs, active beds/occupancy, blood tests, ultrasounds, MRIs, deliveries, blood collection, dialysis, surgeries, specialists/nurses working, ICU beds, ventilators etc.and should be available in public domain.

* Ways to increase capability in terms of manpower to face big change for ambitious programmes like PM-JAY.

* Important regulatory legislations for health sector and on which the Ministry should make every effort to secure early Parliament approval. For instance, National Medical Commission, Allied Health Bill deserve priority.

* Horizontal distribution, which is subject to growth without condition is state's entitlement to receivebesides state's specific grant could also be considered by Finance Commission.

* The options/cost/opportunity of the Ayushman Bharat needs to be fully articulated, particularly in relation to its medium term financial implications for Centre and the States. The estimates, premium of insurance companies have widely varying estimates and need greater consistency/credibility.

In a first, the Delhi government has also decided to construct elevated roads for three metro corridors - Rithala-Bawana-Narela, Janakpuri West-RK Ashram and Mukundpur-Maujpur - out of the total six under the 103-km-long Phase 4.

Project to be Completed by 2024

The approval, given at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Kejriwal, comes around two-and-a-half years after it had given in-principle nod to the Phase IV project, which is expected to be completed by 2024.

'Major Changes in Transport'

Kejriwal took to Twitter and said that after the ""revolutionary changes"" in education, health, water and electricity, there would be changes in transport at a major scale.

The chief minister added that he has a dream of seeing Delhi being counted among the select cities of the world, and every citizen, rich or poor, would feel proud of it.

Among the projects chosen under Phase 4 are: Rithala-Bawana-Narela (21.73 km, elevated), Janakpuri West-RK Ashram (28.92 km, 21.18 km elevated ), Mukundpur-Maujpur (12.54 km, elevated), Inderlok-Indraprastha (12.58 km, underground), Aero City-Tughlakabad (20.2 km, 5.58 km elevated), Lajpat Nagar-Saket G Block (7.96 km, 5.89 km elevated).

Sisodia said the government will give its share of Rs 9,707 crore towards the construction work under the project, which is estimated to cost around Rs 45,000 crore.

The AAP-BJP Delay

The Phase 4 project had become a bone of contention between the AAP government and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government as the former did not give its final nod to the project, even after its in-principle approval to the same in February 2016.

The Delhi finance department had submitted its report to the government, saying that some of the proposed corridors were financially ""unviable.""

Following the delay, Hardeep Singh Puri, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister, had said in October: ""We will open a box of sweets only when a formal announcement for the Metro Phase 4 project is made.""

The so-called ""angel tax"" applies to startups incorporated before 2016. It relates to the discrepancy between the valuation of a , once it receives angel investments, and it's actual ""fair market value"" (FMV). Income tax officials calculate the FMV using traditional methods such as the discounted cash flow model that doesn't take into account intangible assets like ""goodwill"" and therefore, undervalues the company.

As per the policy, startups have to pay a 30.9% tax on the positive difference between their valuation post-investment and their FMV, which is classified as ""income from other sources."" Startups incorporated after 2016 under the government's Startup India programme are exempt from the tax.

Following a wave of backlash over this policy, Suresh Prabhu, India's Minister of Commerce and Industry, tweeted on 19 December that the government had ""taken up the issue."" The Central Board of Direct Taxation is currently said to be looking into the matter.

Prabhu was directly responding to a link to an article shared by Mohandas Pai, the chairman of Manipal Global Education, that referred to the taxation policy as ""draconian"" and a hindrance to innovation.

However, the Income Tax Department has maintained that it has only sent notices to companies with financial irregularities since the tax is geared towards preventing money laundering and payments to politicians in the form of shares in these unlisted companies.

The angel tax has reportedly deterred angel from infusing funds into startups for fear of losing a significant chunk of their investment to the taxman. Entrepreneurs and investors had been hoping for a revision of the policy in the Indian government's Union Budget for 2018-19 but it didn't come to pass.

A modicum of relief came in April this year when the government excluded startups from the angel tax in the event that the funds raised from angel investors were ₹100 million or less, subject to the approval of an eight-member ministerial committee.

Speaking on the tax notices issued to the 150 or so startups, an official from the Income Tax Department told the Indian Express that it could pertain to those startups that aren't registered with the commerce ministry's Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP).

The inquiry team has ordered action against the principal of the school at Lalganj in Vaishali district. The District Education Officer-led-team in its written recommendation to the education department has asked for stern action against the principal, Meena Kumari.

""From many years, the system of division of classroom on the basis of caste and religion is existing in the GA Higher Secondary School at Lalganj in Vaishali district. Separate classrooms were allotted for the students belonging to the upper castes, OBCs and Dalits. Similarly, there are also separate sections and rooms for students belonging to Hindu and Muslim communities at the school,"" confirmed Vaishali District Magistrate, Rajeev Roshan to news agency ANI.

After the matter came into light, the officials constituted a team to investigate it further.

""Strict action would be taken against the Principal and she would be suspended from her service,"" Roshan added

Even after the report proved the allegation, Meena Kumari, in her defence, rejected such claims and said, ""Students of every caste and religions sit together, there is no such division.""

Now scientists have developed a non-invasive technique that involves mere flash of a laser light to assess healing.

The method exploits a particular property of some tissue proteins - ability to re-emit light upon absorption. Such proteins, known as tissue fluorophores, have chemical compounds that can re-emit light. Collagen is one such protein that is vital in wound healing. So when a laser light is flashed on tissues under examination, the amount of re-emitted light from the healing tissue directly corresponds to collagen concentration, which in turn, indicates the status of recovery process.

Researchers at the Manipal Academy of Higher Educationused commercially available 325 nm laser light to inspect healing by exploring tissue fluorophores, and a detector to collect re-emitted light. The re-emitted spectra were recorded using a fibre optic probe kept very close - about three mm - to the wound site. The spectra was then analysed in a spectrograph connected to a computer.

The collagen levels measured by this technique, known as autofluorescence, were validated by biochemical tests of patient tissues. The comparison showed that autofluorescence was consistent and suitable for assessment of burn wound healing. This study also shown tissue collagen can be used as an optical biomarker for assessing burn wound healing, researchers explained. Tissue samples were collected from burn patients admitted to the Department of Plastic Surgery and Burns,Kasturba Medical College.

In earlier studies, the technique was used in lab-induced wounds in animals. Now it has been tested in tissue samples from human burn patients suffering from different degree of burn wounds. Tissue formed following treatment was excised before grafting and utilized for autofluorescence measurement.

""Our technique is user-friendly and solely dependent on excitation and emission of tissue fluorophores without the addition of any external dye molecule. This helps maintain tissue architecture during the assessment of healing,"" Dr VijendraPrabhu of Department of Biotechnology at the Manipal Institute of Technology, a member of the research team, told India Science Wire.

For clinical management of wounds, periodic evaluation of injured tissue is necessary to know progress of healing. Sometimes wound assessment is done by trained clinicians but it is a subjective method. The other method is to conduct histopathology and biochemicalanalysis to measure amount of collagen deposited. Repetitive invasive tests can result in fresh wounds and possibility of infection and scarring.

Through autofluorescence technique, collagen information of the tissue can be gathered in just 10 to 15 seconds. ""It can provide complementary data conducive to making clinical decisions. After successful testing on clinical samples, we are ready for mass testing on burn wound patients. This system can also be utilized to test collagen disorders in patients,"" Dr Prabhu said.

The research team included researchers from Manipal Academy of Higher Education - Prof K.K.Mahato (Department of Biophysics, School of Life Sciences); Dr. Vijendra Prabhu (Manipal Institute of Technology); Anusha Acharya (School of Life Sciences); Prof B.S. Satish Rao (Department of Radiation Biology and Toxicology),Bharath Rathnakar (Department of Biophysics); Dr. Pramod Kumar (Department of Plastic Surgery and Burns) and Dr. Vasudeva Guddattu (Department of Statistics).The study was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and research findings have been published in Journal of Biophotonics.

""A grievance cell will be made functional where parents can lodge complaints against schools denying admissions or violating the RTE Act. The district administration has set a target of getting approximately 5,000 students, belonging to the economically weaker sections and disadvantaged groups, enrolled in private schools in their neighbourhoods,"" the DM said and added the administration had helped almost 3500 'poor' students get admission to private schools under the RTE Act last year.

When dollar dreams strike, an MBA from a US university and a plush corner office with a view are the 'final goal', but the first step is always the admission, and even before that, the prep for GRE and GMAT.

Mayank Srivastava founded Experts' Global in 2008 while pursuing his MBA from Boston University. And over the last 10 years, his bootstrapped, profitable edtech venture has successfully placed thousands of students at various business schools in the US through its online Graduation Management Admission Test (GMAT) preparation programme. Talk about helping dreams come true!

Times change, as do the dynamics of the market - and to stay relevant, Mayank decided to shift his focus to technology. The Noida-based Experts' Global is now banking on its newly-developed Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology platform to take its game to the next level.

Mayank and his 12-member team have developed a new platform with strong AI elements, to provide more curated and personalised content to aspiring students. The platform was rolled out in February this year.

""Our software can tell students what their weakness is, thereby helping them to better prepare for the test,"" says Mayank.

Experts' Global, which started as a simple GMAT preparation module for students, now incorporates numerous software elements.

The software gathers and analyses data depending on user behaviour and makes custom recommendations. It also has over 300 conceptual videos embedded in the software to give students the flexibility of study time. Further, there is a significant number of practice questions and computer-based tests.

Mayank says, ""The industry is changing with the presence of both traditional and new-age players. Our largest competition is from US-based companies, and we need to maintain our quality standards.""

Apart from its ease of use, the software also gives the edtech company the ability to reach out to a larger number of students across the world, he adds.

According to the 2017 Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange data released by The Institute of International Education (IIE) and the US Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, the number of Indian students in the US has risen to a record level of over 186,000 - seeing a double-digit growth for the fourth year in a row.

This is an increase of 21,000 students over the previous year and a growth of 12 percent. Further, the number of Indian students in the US has doubled over the last 10 years, and India is the second leading place of origin for students coming to the US, comprising 17.3 percent of all international students. However, the majority of Indian students (56 percent) in the US are studying at the graduate level.

Mayank says affordability and superior software will determine the company's success in the marketplace. Experts' Global's GMAT preparation programme is priced in the range of $50 to $150 depending on the requirement. The duration of the course is about six months.

Since inception, the edtech platform says it has trained around 10,000 students from over 50 countries including India, North America, Europe, Australia and the Middle East. Currently, 50 percent of its students are from India.

The company claims a major part of its business comes from GMAT preparation, but it also has an admission consulting segment. ""Securing GMAT scores is only 30-40 percent of the game, and the real test beings later during the admission,"" says Mayank.

The admission consulting business requires considerable handholding, and Mayank says he personally experienced challenges while securing admission to the right college in the US.

The company now wants to keep this segment small as it requires personalised attention and the number of intakes every year is only around 200.

In its first year of operations, Experts' Global had trained around 300 students for GMAT, and in 2017 it trained close to 2,000 students. This year it expects to cross 3,000 students.

However, the bet now is the AI-driven software platform that will provide a faster trajectory. ""We are expecting 100 percent growth over the next two years and this will be largely due to our software,"" says Mayank. The admission consulting business of Experts' Global has been growing 100 percent every year, while the GMAT preparation segment is growing at around 35 percent.

Amid the growth and profitability the company claims it has maintained over the years, Mayank says he is not looking for any external funding to support future growth plans. ""We are able to generate enough resources internally to fund our expansion plans,"" says Mayank.

At the same time, he has other plans up his sleeve, which he describes as the desire to solve problems. The plan is to come up with software that will help decide career choices for people, starting from the age of 13 going all the way up to 45.

""A lot of people are confused about career decisions and we are developing software which will map one's behaviour with 8,000 different choices,"" he says. The product development is underway and the beta version is projected to go live by early 2020."

""When I told them I couldn't do that, they insisted I had to show my ears for a photograph. After much debating, I said I would re-adjust my hijab so that my ears were visible and requested them to direct me to a washroom to do the same,"" she further said.

The officials, however, refused to allow her to go to a washroom and asked her to re-adjust her hijab right there. ""I was shocked. It didn't end there, they further told me that I will have to sit for the exam without my hijab or I would not be allowed. I debated and argued as much as I could, but in vain.

If you want to see an Indian farmer on screen, tough luck. You might have to buy a ticket to an international film festival. The farmer has all but disappeared from the mainstream Hindi film industry, the same industry which gave us Mother India, Do Bigha Zameen, and Upkar. While smaller films focussing on the plight of the Indian farmer have been made (and feted elsewhere), you are unlikely to know of them.

They barely get a wide release, and the entertainment media do not want to touch them - the Indian farmer and his stories simply do not appeal to the candyfloss imagination that Bollywood caters to. How can one have an item number shot in Monaco in a story about a farmer in Vidarbha?

The rural landscape itself seems to have vanished from the stories we tell on celluloid. Can you think of one big 'Bollywood' film in recent times that has featured a big star and focussed on the lives of rural Indians? There was Lagaan, but cricket was its hook. There was Kadvi Hawa last year, but did you watch it? Peepli Live, in recent memory, came closest to addressing the issues of the farmer to a mainstream audience largely due to it being an Aamir Khan production.

In this 2010 film by Anusha Rizvi, Natha, a farmer, is encouraged by his own brother to commit suicide so his family could get a loan waiver and financial compensation after his death. The news of his impending suicide somehow attracts media attention, and reporters, OB vans and all, descend upon his village to capture the drama. While Natha, now obligated to kill himself, clearly does not want to, and runs away, even as another villager away from the spotlight Hori, who digs dirt for a living, dies.

The seen and unseen stories of Natha and Hori play out in the real world in similar ways - the inability of farmers to pay off debts and therefore resorting to suicides is a narrative we hear all too loudly ahead of any election, but the underlying reasons - the unseen - of a mental health epidemic in rural India, of poor agrarian reforms, of rising input costs and diminishing returns, of fragmented land holding, are barely ever spoken of.

The plight of the farmer, though, finds itself in centre stage in the run up to any election in India. Politicians of every stripe make promises of farm loan waivers ahead of every election. But barely heard are promises to usher in long term agrarian reforms.

Farm loan waivers are like a unicorn - it is the promise of the magical that hides the realities of the practical. They are also like Andy Warhol's fifteen minutes of fame. Loans waived for now... but what next? And how do they impact the larger economy? These are the questions we will address as we dig deeper into the issue of farm loan waivers.

Competitive populism

Hours after being sworn in as the 18th Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, ending the 15-year-long drought for the Congress in the state, Kamal Nath sanctioned the waiver of farm loans up to 2 lakh rupees in the state, as was promised in the election manifesto, and announced by Congress President Rahul Gandhi in June earlier this year.

Rajesh Rajora, Principal Secretary, Farmers' Welfare and Agriculture Development Department, issued an order soon after which read, "" Madhya Pradesh Government has taken a decision to write off short-term crop loan of eligible farmers up to the limit of Rs two lakh, as on March 31, 2018, from nationalised and cooperative banks."" Rajora said an estimated 34 lakh farmers will benefit from the loan waiver whose size he pegged between Rs 35,000 crore and Rs 38,000 crore.

Gandhi tweeted soon after: ""1 done. 2 to go.""

Chhattisgarh, where Congress won as well, followed next with Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel announcing the waiver of short-term agriculture loans to the tune of over Rs 6100 crore of over 16.65 lakh farmers drawn from cooperative banks and Chhattisgarh Gramin Banks. Fulfilling another pre-poll promise, the cabinet in Chhattisgarh decided to hike the minimum support price (MSP) of paddy to Rs 2,500 per quintal.

Upon being asked if loan waiver was the best option to revive the agrarian economy, Kamal Nath, who believes farm loan waivers are ""a necessity"" had a now-familiar tune to sing: When nationalised banks can write off 40-50 percent of loans of big industrialists, why can't cultivators get the same relief? The anger of the rural-dweller has recently manifested in massive farmer protests in the both the national capital and the country's financial hub this year.

One of their most important demands - complete loan waiver. In a year marked by high-profile scams in the banking sector in the country, to the farmer, his demand doesn't sound illogical at all. Loan waivers, whether farm loan or corporate NPAs, both represent a moral hazard, true. That corporate NPAs are a different kettle of fish is not a nuance an angry farmer faced with his dire realities is prepared to understand. And what the farmer dangles before the government is his vote. One wheat farmer in Madhya Pradesh, echoing millions others, said to Reuters: ""I will vote for the party that will write off our loans."" Quid pro quo.

The election results in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are being read as a rebuke to PM Modi. The Indian Express noted, ""The Congress' relentless pursuit of boxing in the Modi government over agricultural issues seems to have paid off as out of a total of 424 rural seats in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, the BJP won just 153 seats as compared to 294 in 2013 - nearly 50 per cent fewer seats.""

With little time left before the general elections, and to ensure the support of India's 263 million farmers and their dependants, reports indicate that the Modi government may be announcing a massive loan waiver - something it has not done since coming to power - to the tune of about Rs 4 lakh crore ($56.5 billion). Congress Chief Rahul Gandhi, on Tuesday, said that if his party is elected at the centre in 2019, it would waive of all farm loans. Gandhi also said that he ""won't let the Prime Minister sleep"" till a nationwide farm loan waiver is announced. Gandhi's farm-loan-waiver promise has certainly paid the Congress rich dividends this election season.

And with a new governor at the RBI, and the possibility of tapping into the excess capital reserves of the central bank now seeming easier than it did during Urjit Patel's time, it's not hard to see what Modi's next step might be.

In a completely unpredicted development, the theme for the 2019 elections, ladies and gentlemen, is farm loan waivers.

Farm loan waivers - A brief history

Gone are the days of free television sets and gold trinkets. Farm loan waivers, it seems, are the new political currency.

Farmers make up over half the labour market in India and are crucial in elections. The first national loan waivers date back to 1990, when the union government waived Rs 100 billion ($5.6 billion) in farm loans. In 2008, the government announced another major round of loan waivers totalling Rs 650 billion, about 1.3 percent of India's GDP.

Over the following nine years, until 2017, the central and state governments waived nearly Rs 890 billion ($14 billion) in loans to 48 million farmers. Since 2017, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh have all announced (or completed the promised) farm loan waivers. Tamil Nadu, under Jayalalithaa, had done so in 2016. Karnataka, with a waiver announced of Rs 44,000 crore tops the list, with

Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra following closely behind, each with upwards of 30,000 crore rupees waived. This brand of competitive populism, ahead of 2019, has spread to Gujarat and Assam as recently as today with these states also announcing a waiver of farm loans and electricity bills.

In 2017, waivers announced in the four states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Karnataka, came at a cost of $13.6 billion. By 2019, farm loan waivers will amount to 2-2.5 percent of the GDP, or about $40 billion, said BofA-ML last year.

As Nilanjan Banik writes in the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW), ""Waivers of farm loans may help any political party win an election once. For them to win an election twice, however, it is important to undertake policy measures that will make a real difference to the life of poor farmers.""

What are waivers useful for? Garnering votes. Agriculture employs nearly 45 percent of India's workforce even though its contribution to the GDP is about 15 percent.

Research studies, like Banik's, over several years have indicated over and over again that farm loan waivers are at best a Band-Aid solution and at worst instruments that engender moral hazard. Additionally, formulae to waive farm loans are not uniform across states.

Rajasthan, for example, calculates waivers based on amount of crop damaged, size of land holdings, and harvest volume. Other states have fixed limits for the amount to be waived. The UPA government 2008 waiver covered only marginal and small farmers (those holding less than 2 hectares of land). Others got a 25 percent waiver. On the flipside, many farmers who do own more than 2 hectares of land are rendered ineligible even though much of the land owned may be uncultivated.

From a macroeconomic perspective, ex-RBI Governor Urjit Patel stated that the farm loan waiver scheme ""undermines an honest credit culture, impacts credit discipline, blunts incentives for future borrowers to repay, in other words, waivers engender moral hazard.""

The RBI also warned that loan waivers will crowd out private borrowers in favour of government lenders and will worsen inflationary risks, limiting the RBI's ability to lower interest rates. His predecessor Dr Raghuram Rajan also reiterated this concern and added that the waivers often go to the ""best connected rather than to the poorest.""The Economic Times put it succinctly when it listed seven reasons why farm loan waivers do not make sense:

Politician promises taxpayer money to waive farmer's loans in exchange for his vote. Taxpayer money is then used to repay these loans thus denting the fiscal standing of the government promising these loans. Writing for Firstpost, Dinesh Unnikrishnan says, ""Since banks do not get money on time from governments, this puts them on a back foot, forcing to go slow on further lending to farmers.""

A report from Kotak Institutional Equities pointed to a strong dip in agricultural loans in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh two-three years after the announcement of waivers there. The report adds, ""While the available data does not clearly substantiate our hypothesis given the other extraneous variables like monsoon, other government initiatives, etc., back of the envelope calculations suggest a modest slowdown.

Additionally, agriculture loan growth has been broadly strong in the years prior to the announcement of a loan waiver in most cases apart from Punjab. Additionally, the growth of agriculture loans in these states has been higher than the industry average or their regions prior to the announcement under most circumstances.""

State governments that have announced these waivers have since seen their debt-to-GDP ratio increase, Unnikrishnan points.

Unfortunately, however, agriculture is a season-dependent trade. Should there be another spell of poor rains, or a glut resulting in lower market prices, the farmer is yet again saddled with loans he cannot repay, and yet again, the politician enters to cash the farmer's vote for a waiver.

Who benefits from farm loan waivers, even if for the short term?

Rich upper caste farmers. Or at any rate, farmers with access to formal bank credit, meaning farmers with some functional financial literacy. And politicians seeking power.

The work of C Shankar Rao, assistant professor at the Council for Social Development, Hyderabad, published in the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW), sheds more light on this. More than 85 percent of India's farmers are either small (0.1 to 1 hectare total land farmed) or marginal (1.1 to 2 hectares). Semi-medium to large landowners constitute the remaining 15 percent of the farmer population in the country. This distinction is crucial to understand the debt-seeking patterns within the farmer community.

There are three main sources of credit for farmers: among formal sources, Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) and co-operatives; among informal sources, private money lenders (PMLs).

It should come as no surprise then that small and marginal farmers mostly borrow from PMLs as they are less likely to have anything to offer in terms of collateral to formal sector credit sources. As SCs constitute the largest chunk of small and marginal farmers, it is also them that have the smallest formal sector credit.

More than a fourth of the total credit taken by Indian farmers came at interest rates of 36 percent per annum - clearly interests levied by private money lenders. Upper castes often also have an advantage accessing cooperative credit, research has gone to show.

(It is to be noted, however, that rich SC farmers, too, do better when it comes to accessing formal credit.)

Nilanjan Banik in the EPW again: ""Loan waivers are not the solution to the farming crisis. In the year following loan waivers, small farmers lose out on three counts: lower access to formal loans, falling agricultural revenue because of higher informal loan cost, and falling agricultural productivity.""

The Times of India reported the stories of several farmers from across the country who were eligible for waivers but eventually only ended up receiving a fraction of what was promised owing to the fine print in these loan waiver schemes.

Simply put, farm loan waivers are only helpful to those who have taken loans from a formal credit source. 85 percent of the country's farmer population constitutes of small and marginal farmers, a large section of whom most often do not even have access to formal bank credit and are at the mercy of private money lenders who levy exorbitant interest rates.

Even more simply put, loan waivers impact those who are in the system. The tragedy though is that the section of the farmer population that is in direst need of help is out of the system and therefore stands to gain nothing.

PRS Legislative Research reiterated this point: ""Marginal and small farmers accounted for 82 percent of all indebted households and 56 percent of the outstanding loans by value. However, only a small proportion of the indebted marginal and small farmers had taken loans from institutional sources such as banks and cooperatives.

Informal sources such as moneylenders, family and friends accounted for 62 percent of indebted households among marginal farmers. Such farmers would not benefit from any scheme that restructures debt taken from banks and cooperatives.""

How does it impact the economy?

The fiscal standing of the governments granting these waivers suffers as a result of loan waiver schemes. Tanika Chakraborty and Aarti Gupta of IIT Kanpur, presenting their research in Ideas for India, went on to note: ""Our research provides evidence that a blanket waiver scheme is detrimental to the development of credit markets.

Repeated debt-waiver programmes distort households' incentive structures, away from productive investments and towards unproductive consumption and wilful defaults. These wilful defaults, in turn, are likely to disrupt the functioning of the entire credit system.""

Let's examine the impact on banks first. In the aftermath of every loan waiver announcement, a spike in NPAs has been observed, simply because even honest taxpayers stop repayments in the hope that their liabilities too might get included in the waiver package. A Kotak Institutional Equities report states an example: ""As we saw in Karnataka, gross NPLs in MP have been rising in recent years. It was at 8 percent in FY2017 which increased to 11 percent prior to the elections."" That phrase again - moral hazard. Moral hazard, which incentivises defaulting on loans. In Dec 2017, The Times of India reported that in some states, the default rate had increased by up to 50 percent in the aftermath of a loan waiver announcement. HFDC Bank reported a 60 percent rise in agricultural loan delinquencies in the quarter ending June 30, 2017.

Public sector banks (PSBs) will be the most negatively affected by the loan waivers. As of 2017, Nomura estimated that state-owned banks hold two-thirds of loans to be waived. The loan waivers would further exacerbate the PSBs asset quality problems and their already weakened capital levels.

The Hindu Business Line noted, ""Economists caution that farm loans waivers would widen a fiscal deficit the government has aimed to cap at 3.3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), or Rs 6.24 lakh crore. Even without the farm loan waiver, some credit rating agencies have estimated the country's fiscal deficit at Rs 6.67 lakh crore - or 3.5 percent of GDP, on muted tax collections. The loan waiver also risks deepening the malaise at public sector banks saddled with most of India's $150 billion in stressed loans.""

In its 2016-2017 annual report, the central bank cautioned against such ""unconditional bailouts"", saying they could affect fiscal credibility in the medium term. The report also noted that the benefits of the waivers were ""highly skewed and concentrated in states where concentration of land holdings was low on account of land reforms."" It added that such random policy shocks ""have an enduring impact on market borrowings of governments, as evident from past episodes of such waivers. They increase the interest rates the governments need to pay for the loans they borrow.""

As for states granting these waivers, some have already seen their fiscal deficits worsen due to the impact of the UDAY (Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana) scheme, which passed on a part of the debt burden of state electricity distribution companies onto the state government. Compromises on productive spending are inevitable - something's gotta give. The states' fiscal deficit widens, as has already been seen. As per the RBI, the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) rose to 3.1 percent breaching the threshold of 3 percent GFD/GSDP ratio recommended by the Finance Commission.

What then are the alternatives to farm loan waivers?

In a nutshell, it is safe to say that farm loan waivers are nothing more than a temporary dike made of mud in the face of a deluge of problems faced by the agrarian sector. It is no more than a populist ploy aimed at getting votes. As P Sainath said, ""waivers are merely a tool, not a transformation; mechanism not a solution; relief not an answer to the greater problem.""

M S Swaminathan, Father of the Green Revolution, said in an interview to Al Jazeera, ""Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary for the revival of farming, do not provide conditions for a secure credit system in the long term.""

Even in large scale reforms, patience is a virtue. It is beyond any doubt that India finds herself in the grip of an agrarian crisis. But the need of the hour is thoughtful long-term planning. Surgery, not band-aids. To incorporate the many reforms that have been suggested is beyond the scope of this piece, and will therefore be dealt with on a follow-up piece, but let's take a quick look at some of them.

Many experts have suggested the implementation of the National Commission on Farmers (NCF). Chaired by M S Swaminathan, it recommended minimum support price for grains, protection of small farmers and addressing risks in overtaking agriculture as a profession. The commission observed that farmers need to have access over resources such as land, water, bio-resources, credit and insurance, technology and markets and that agriculture needs to be shifted to the concurrent list instead of the state list at which it is currently at.

Nilanjan Banik wrote about some reforms from a cost-benefit perspective. He wrote, ""The government can spend money for building more canals and warehouses, on rural electrification, and to operate more e-markets. Each one of these interventions comes with a cost and an associated benefit. As an economist, one would argue government should spend each additional rupee to alleviate farm distress in a way where the impact is more, with a higher benefit-to-cost ratio.""

Noting that 20 percent of India's fresh produce is wasted because of storage problems, he advocated the building of more warehouses and storage facilities. ""The National Centre for Cold Chain Development (NCCD) has estimated Rajasthan's total requirement for storing milk, fruits and vegetables at 74,889 tonnes.

Providing pack houses and trucks would cost ₹5,985 crore. The benefits in terms of the reduced wastage in milk, fruits and vegetables, are worth more than 15 times that figure."" Research also shows that e-markets could result in better prices for farmers. A similar view was echoed by researchers at ICRIER.

Fragmented land holding, depletion of water table level, poor irrigation systems, deteriorating soil quality, rising input costs and diminishing returns, the vagaries of monsoon... these are only a few of the issues faced by the Indian farmer, none of which are truly addressed by loan waivers. What loan waivers do is address a temporary problem with a temporary, and largely ineffective, solution.

For effective long term reform, and to realise the government's dream of doubling farmer income by 2022, policymakers ought to think beyond electoral politics and enact structural changes that go beyond election season rhetoric and populist schemes.

The recent farmer protests seen in Mumbai and New Delhi hint at another crisis within the agrarian community - a crisis of identity. The socio-economic transformation that India has seen post-liberalisation has largely been felt in urban India. The traditional dominance of the farming community is being threatened in the new economic order where formal education and jobs matter more than farm incomes do.

Adding to the crisis of collective identity is an epidemic of mental health disorders. Farmer suicides are tragic, this is undeniable. And most narratives tend to cite poor farm outcomes and burgeoning loans as the reasons for these suicides, sidestepping another brewing crisis within the agrarian community - that of clinical depression.

For the record, as of 2011, the latest year for which suicide data were computed, suicide mortality is lower among farmers than non-farmers (Basu, Das and Misra, EPW, 2016). Dr Neeraj Kaushal, Professor of Social Policy at Columbia School of Social Work, has gone on to note that while the economic distress of a poor harvest may no doubt contribute to the farmer suicides, it is also just as important to address the mental health problems that the community may be suffering from, but is too afraid to address.

Any reform in the agrarian sector would be incomplete if it didn't also consider the well-being - physical and mental - of the agriculturist.Jai Jawaan Jai Kisaan, otherwise, would be merely lip service."

The hi-tech birth certificate was received by Divit's father, who owns a start-up named Super Procure. He told TOI, ""It is good that the government is implementing new technology like blockchain to secure information and prevent manual manipulation.""

The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger or register, that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value. Initially, the technology was brought in for supporting digital currency - the Bitcoin. However, now the technology industry is finding other potential use of the technology.

Highlights this week include a lame duck update on year-end health bills and tax provisions; lawmakers reacting to a federal judge ruling the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional; Sen. Hatch seeks to update Hatch-Waxman; health providers targeted by proposals to reduce the budget deficit; and more.

Congressional Republicans are waiting for President Donald Trump to signal whether he would accept a short-term funding extension that would push back this week's risk of a partial government shutdown into January.

The House last week adjourned until Wednesday, leaving only two days before a Friday deadline when funding expires for about 25 percent of the government that employs 380,000 federal workers. Expiring funding would impact operations at the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security, Interior, State, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development as well as several smaller agencies.

While most spending issues for those departments have been resolved, the White House and congressional Democrats are at loggerheads over Trump's demand for $5 billion for additional fencing along the Mexican border. Although Republicans control Congress until January, any budget bill needs 60 Senate votes, requiring Trump to win over some Democrats.

GOP appropriators on Capitol Hill are preparing two scenarios: a stopgap funding bill that would extend current spending into January and a bill that would keep homeland security funding flat while approving new spending for the other departments.

Most federal healthcare operations - including at HHS, CMS and other agencies - were approved earlier and would be unaffected by a shutdown. But the FDA, which is funded through the agriculture spending bill that has not yet passed Congress, could see nonessential functions stop in a shutdown.

If the government closes, the FDA won't accept regulatory submissions such as new drug and medical device applications that require user fees, and nearly half of the agency's workforce could be furloughed.

Neither the FDA nor HHS has issued guidelines for what happens in the event of a shutdown this week. But when the government was briefly closed in January during a separate budget battle, HHS contingency plans called for many functions funded by industry user fees to continue while other agency operations shuttered.

Although FDA staff were available for emergency facility inspections during that shutdown, routine inspections stopped. The agency said it lacked legal authority to accept user fees and that it couldn't accept regulatory submissions that required an industry fee.

FDA furloughed 42 percent of its workforce earlier this year, but the agency said it could have responded to emergencies such as drug shortages, and outbreaks related to foodborne illness and infectious diseases. FDA also said it could have managed high-risk recalls and pursued criminal enforcement and civil investigations.

The House earlier this year voted to increase FDA's fiscal 2019 budget by $308 million, and the Senate voted to boost FDA funding by $159 million. But final agency funding has been stalled amid Congress' larger budget standoff.

Pharmaceutical manufacturers' efforts to change mandated discounts they provide in the Medicare Part D prescription drug ""doughnut hole"" continue to stall amid opposition from Democrats and the White House.

Medicare covers most drug costs up to $3,750 annually, and beneficiaries are responsible for costs above that and up to $5,000, when catastrophic coverage beings. To help seniors pay for medicine in that coverage gap, manufacturers had been required to provide 50 percent discounts. But an erroneous Congressional Budget Office fiscal forecast led lawmakers in February to increase that mandated discount to 70 percent - costing the industry billions of dollars.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has been leading the effort to lower the discount to 63 percent. This summer, more than 200 House lawmakers - including several dozen Democrats - called on congressional leaders to press for that change.

But House Democrat leaders have blocked it, and the White House is reluctant to support a plan that would save the industry billions of dollars annually at the same time the Trump administration is trying to advance policies to reduce drug prices.

House Republicans last week introduced but then postponed a vote on new legislation that would delay several Affordable Care Act tax provisions.

The measure would suspend the 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices through 2024. It would delay the tax on high-cost health coverage until 2023, and suspend until 2022 an annual fee on health insurance providers. The legislation also includes separate tax changes to education and retirement savings while also including corrections to the 2017 tax reform law.

While Republicans may be able to pass the bill on a party-line vote in the House, it's doubtful they would pick up the nine Democrats needed to win passage in the Senate. House Democrats, who will take control of the chamber next month, want to delay the tax vote until they have more leverage to shape the legislation and extract policy concessions from Republicans.

The House last week overwhelmingly approved a catch-all Medicaid bill that would allow states to coordinate care for children with complex medical needs, but its future in the Senate is unclear.

As lawmakers enter the final days of the lame duck session and with a Friday deadline to approve funding to avert a partial government shutdown, the Medicaid legislation hangs in the balance. It could be added to a year-end spending bill if one is approved. A less clear pathway would be as a standalone bill in the Senate, where any senator could block it.

Introduced by retiring Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, the bill includes an updated version of Barton's ACE Kids legislation, which would allow states to use an existing Health Homes model to coordinate care for children with medically complex conditions.

It also would boost funding for state Medicaid programs to help transition individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities out of institutional care, include a three-month extension of spousal impoverishment rules that protect elderly couples from having to bear the full expenses of nursing home care, and exclude complex rehabilitative manual wheelchairs from Medicare competitive bidding.

To help pay for these programs, the bill includes legislation introduced by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that would permit HHS to fine pharmaceutical manufacturers that overcharge Medicaid by misclassifying their drugs as generics.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) last week catalogued policy changes that lawmakers could consider to reduce the budget deficit, including sharp reductions in federal health programs that would affect both providers and beneficiaries.

To help inform lawmakers, CBO periodically issues policy options to reduce the deficit, which currently stands at $779 billion. Entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare are included along with proposed cuts to discretionary spending such as defense, education and transportation.

Most of CBO's proposed healthcare spending cuts and program changes would be politically explosive and would be unlikely to win congressional approval, including:

Four Democratic senators last week introduced legislation that would give the federal government tools to end ""predatory price gouging on lifesaving drugs.""

The legislation would require drug companies to submit ""justifications"" to HHS for price increases of more than 10 percent. If HHS found a price increase ""in substantial excess of an amount that could be reasonably justified,"" the department could deem the manufacturer guilty of ""price gouging.""

Under the bill, HHS could force manufacturers to reimburse consumers, private payers and Medicare and Medicaid. It also could impose civil penalties up to three times the ""excessive price"" and refer the matter to the Justice Department.

The bill by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., was co-sponsored by Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.

Blumenthal's legislation is just the latest congressional salvo aimed at the pharmaceutical industry. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., last week criticized a pharmaceutical company for ""playing political games"" by raising prices for 41 of its drugs, several months after the company said it would delay price increases.

Earlier this month, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said he wants to tie Medicare drug expenses to prices paid by consumers in countries where costs are fixed by government price controls. If pharmaceutical manufacturers refused to lower prices, the federal government could invalidate the drug's patent and approve an immediate generic version.

Retiring Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah - co-author of the 1984 law that established the pathway for generic drug approval - introduced legislation last week that would require drug patent challengers to choose either the Hatch-Waxman framework or a separate Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) process.

Congress in 2012 overhauled patent law and created the PTO's inter partes review to crack down on so-called patent trolls. Hatch said generic drug and biosimiliars manufacturers have increasingly used IPR to circumvent the patent challenge process in Hatch-Waxman. Hedge funds with no interest in drug manufacturing also have filed IPR challenges, he said, hoping to profit from stock selloffs triggered by the IPR filings.

Hatch said his bill would restore the ""careful balance"" of ensuring a vibrant generic drug industry while ensuring innovator companies are incentivized to invest in research, development and clinical trials. Industry stakeholders, such as the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, praised the senator's bill.

The legislation was co-sponsored by Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and companion legislation was introduced in the House by Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas. The bill is unlikely to win congressional approval in the lame duck session or gain favor next year, when Democrats will control the House.

The decision Friday by a federal judge in Texas to strike down the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as unconstitutional triggered pushback from Democrats, including two leaders who advocated congressional intervention.

Judge Reed O'Connor of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled the law is invalid without the ""individual mandate,"" which Congress effectively repealed in last year's tax reform law by eliminating the tax penalty for individuals who failed to purchase health insurance.

The ruling will be appealed, and it could take years to reach the Supreme Court, if it even gets that far. The ACA remains in effect pending that appeal.

Senate Democrat Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Congress should intervene in the case by passing new legislation. Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the ruling ""absurd"" and said when Democrats take control of the House in January they will ""move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process.""

Congressional Republicans - many of whom were criticized during the midterm elections for undermining the ACA's protections on pre-existing conditions - took a more measured response.

The ruling provides an ""opportunity for truly bipartisan healthcare reform that protects those with pre-existing conditions, increases transparency and choice, and lowers costs,"" said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore.

Incoming Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, tweeted after the ruling that the ACA is ""fatally flawed"" and that his committee will hold hearings on the health law next year.

Insurance companies couldn't apply different cost-sharing requirements for oncology medicines that are administered orally or intravenously, according to bipartisan legislation introduced in the Senate last week.

Health plans' medical benefit typically covers traditional cancer medications administered intravenously, and patients face a moderate co-payment. But oral and self-administered medicines are usually covered under a plan's pharmacy benefit, which frequently requires higher out-of-pocket costs.

Patients prescribed oral oncology drugs can face hundreds or even thousands of dollars more in cost-sharing than patients receiving an IV cancer drug, according to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, which endorsed the Senate bill.

Introduced by Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., the bill would prevent insurance plans governed under federal laws from applying different cost-sharing to oral and self-administered cancer medicines. Forty-three states have enacted similar laws affecting state-regulated plans.

The federal so-called oral parity bill was co-sponsored by Sens. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Roger Wicker, R-Miss. Similar legislation was introduced last year in the House by Reps. Leonard Lance, R-N.J., and Brian Higgins, D-N.Y."

It also believes that the statutory audit services update paper published yesterday by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) presents a missed opportunity to rectify the situation.

The study demonstrates a clear need for reform of the audit market, and this update paper poses 27 questions for the market to consider by 21 January 2019 relating to the study and the six proposed remedies that the CMA has identified: regulatory scrutiny of audit committees; mandatory joint audit or market share cap; additional measures to remove barriers for challenger firms; market resilience; full structural or operational split; and peer review.

As the professional body for governance, ICSA's focus is on the governance issues raised by recent audit failures rather than the impact of specific accounting decisions and not only on what audit is supposed to achieve and how well it does so, but also on the difference between what audit is supposed to achieve and the public expectation of audit and of auditors. The CMA review falls into the trap of assuming that companies select and pay their own auditors, thereby overlooking the independent role of the audit committee. It also makes the assumptions that more regulation will help the market and that one of the major issues with audit is a result of the dominance of the 'big four' audit firms, hence proposals for mandating joint audits and encouraging the use of challenger firms.

In its response to the invitation to comment, ICSA suggested three initial areas needed to be given more attention before proceeding to further action:

Peter Swabey, Policy and Research Director at ICSA: The Governance Institute said: ""Unless the issues of education, training and trust are addressed before a decision is made on future action, the review risks creating solutions which fail to address the underlying issues, consideration of which, we believe, should underpin further analysis. Action which promotes the inclusion of challenger firms in the audit market will not serve to improve that market if those firms are performing at a lower standard. This may not be the case, but it does seem to be a widespread perception and should, we believe, be properly tested before further action is taken. It is imperative that the opportunity is taken to bring together all the various reviews of this issue - Kingman, the CMA, the new review being led for the Department for Business by Donald Brydon and the BEIS Committee - to avoid confusion.""

The District Education Officer-led-team in its written recommendation to the education department has asked for the stern action against the Principal, Meena Kumari.

""From many years, the system of division of classroom on the basis of caste and religion is existing in the GA Higher Secondary School at Lalganj in Vaishali district. Separate classrooms were allotted for the students belonging to the upper castes, OBCs and Dalits. Similarly, There are also separate sections and rooms for students belonging to Hindu and Muslim communities at the school,"" confirmed Vaishali District Magistrate, Rajeev Roshan.

After the matter came into light, the officials constituted a team to investigate further.

""Strict action would be taken against the Principal and she would be suspended from her service,"" Roshan added

Even after the report proved the allegation, Meena Kumari, in her defence, rejected such claims and said, ""Students of every caste and religions sit together, there is no such division."" (ANI)"

In pursuance to objective of providing greater "" Ease of Doing Business"" to all stakeholders, bring about greater transparency in corporate structure and better Corporate compliance so as to enhance the efficiency of the processes under Companies Act ,2013 , the Ministry of Corporate Affairs ( MCA) has taken several landmark initiatives / decisions during last one year ( January-November ,2018) .

The important ones are Companies ( Amendment ) Act ,2017 , Companies ( Amendment) Ordinance 2018 , establishment of National Financial Reporting Authority ( NFRA) , amendments in Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , eKYC drive for Directors of all companies and speedier processing of incorporation related applications , uniformity in application of rules and eradicating discretion.

India has improved its ranking on the World Bank's ""Doing Business"" 2019 report released on 31st October, 2018. As per the report, India has moved up 23 spots to 77th position as compared to 100th position in 2017 by improving its rank in six out of ten parameters relating to starting and doing business in India. Ministry of Corporate Affairs has contributed towards starting a business, insolvency resolution and protection of minority interests.

The details of Year-long achievements for Ministry of Corporate Affairs are as below:

Till date, all sections of the Companies Act, 2013 [CA-13] except one section viz. Section 465 have been notified. Part of section 2 [clause 67(ix)] and part of section 230 [sub-section (11) and (12)] are yet to be commenced.

COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2017:

Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2017 was assented by Honourable President of India on 3 January, 2018 and got enacted as the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2017 [CAA-17]. The CAA-17 contains total 93 sections. Till date, out of total 93 sections of CAA-17, 92 sections have been brought into force alongwith relevant rules. Commencement of one section (section 81 - relating to Nidhis) and parts of section 23 and 80 of CAA-17 requires amendment in 3 sets of Rules and Forms notified under the Companies Act, 2013 which requires examination in the Ministry and is likely to take some more time. The Ministry proposes to notify section 81 of CAA-17 and part of section 23 of such Act along with relevant rules by 31 December 2018.

The Committee to review the existing framework dealing with offences under the Companies Act, 2013 and related matters submitted its report to the Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs Shri Arun Jaitley. The Committee broke down all penal provisions into eight categories based on the nature of offences. The Committee recommended that the existing rigour of the law should continue for serious offences, covering six categories, whereas for lapses that are essentially technical or procedural in nature, mainly falling under two categories may be shifted to in-house adjudication process. This would serve the twin purposes promoting of Ease of Doing Business and better corporate compliance. It would also reduce the number of prosecutions filed in the Special Courts, which would, in turn, facilitate speedier disposal of serious offences and bring serious offenders to book. The cross-cutting liability under section 447, which deals with corporate fraud, would continue to apply wherever fraud is found. Most sections under review and recommendation have been notified for commencement. Based on the recommendations of the Committee and to achieve objectives of promotion of Ease of Doing Business and better Corporate Compliance the Government decided to promulgate an Ordinance. Accordingly the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 was promulgated on 2.11.2018.

The MCA proposes to introduce a Replacement Bill (viz. Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2018) to replace the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 in the Winter Session (2018) of Parliament.

In year 2018, the President gave assent to promulgate Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy process has taken good shape since 2017 and is a fast evolving legislation. A major factor behind the effectiveness of the new Code has been the adjudication by the Judiciary. The Code provides strict time limits for various procedures under it. In this process a rich- case law has evolved reducing the scope of legal uncertainty.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 notified on 17.08.2018 has replaced IBC (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018.

In the wake of accounting scams and frauds in the corporate sector, National Financial Reporting authority (NFRA) was notified as an independent regulator for auditing profession which is one of the key changes brought in by the Companies Act 2013. NFRA will review the quality of corporate financial reporting in certain classes and subclasses of companies and take disciplinary action against auditors/audit firms for not discharging their statutory duties with due diligence. The decision is expected to result in higher foreign/domestic investments, acceleration of economic growth while supporting greater globalization of business by conforming to international standards and assisting in the evolution of audit profession. The jurisdiction of NFRA for investigation of Chartered Accountants and their firms under section 132 of the Act would extend to listed companies and large unlisted public companies, the threshold for which shall be prescribed in the rules.

To provide for faster and transparent processes, the MCA took the following major initiatives towards Ease of Doing Business and standardisation:

To speed up matter related to resolution of bankruptcy and insolvency, MCA proposed setting up 8 special courts under the National Company Law Tribunal to deal with the insolvency cases. These courts are proposed to be set up in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad. The proposal aims to reduce the mounting burden on the tribunal despite it having 11 benches all over India. To facilitate timely resolution of IBC cases, it is envisaged to set up exclusive IBC Courts under the NCLT benches of Delhi, Mumbai to start with and step up infrastructure of NCLT. The aim is also to strengthen the insolvency process for faster resolution of NPAs.

INDIAN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In order to bring more transparent accounting, MCA has notified Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 115 which would be effective from 1st April 2018. Ind AS 115 is a new revenue recognition standard for customer contracts in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards which will help in more transparent accounting of revenues with an impact on companies operating in diverse sectors, including technology, real estate and telecom. Objective of Ind AS 115 is to establish the principles that should be applied when reporting useful information to users of financial statements. The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue ""to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services""

DEMATERIALISATION OF SECURITIES OF UNLISTED PUBLIC COMPANIES

In order to bring about greater transparency in Corporate structure and in view of advantages of dematerialisation of securities, especially in terms of KYC and investor protection, the Government's focus on ""Digital India"" and the enabling provisions available under section 29(1)(b) of the CA-13, the Ministry has amended the relevant rules to apply the dematerialisation requirements to unlisted public companies, in addition to listed companies. Consultation were held in this regard with all stakeholders and rules were amended on 10 September, 2018 to mandate, w.e.f. 2 October, 2018, issue and transfer of securities by unlisted public companies in demat form only.

INVESTOR EDUCATION & PROTECTION FUND

The Investor Education & Protection Fund (IEPF) Authority unveiled its new logo in 2018 to provide for strong brand presence and recognition. The IEPF authority also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the CSC e-governance Services India, wherein the latter would identify village level entrepreneurs for investor awareness projects, among other activities. MCA is actively looking at further reforms in IEPF.

To review the existing claim settlement processes a committee of practicing company secretaries was constituted through the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI). The committee had reviewed the existing processes and have recommended that the entire process should be made online with e-verification of the claims by the companies, online PAN based verification of the claimant etc.

A new portal namely www.iepfportal.in has been developed for increasing the outreach of IAPs and monitoring the programmes conducted by the professional institutes, CSC e-governance and other partner institutions. The portal provides access to the partner institutions like ICAI, ICSI, ICoAI& IICA and CSC e-Governance for uploading the details of past & future programmes.

The Federation of Central Universities Teachers Association (FEDCUTA) has alleged that the Modi government is sitting on quota roster decision for the fear of upper caste votes. Appointments of academic staff in institutes is on hold since July following an order by the Allahabad High Court.

FEDCUTA President Prof Rajib Ray told India Today TV that the Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar had assured an ordinance to restore the previous reservation roster but now since Parliament is in session the government should bring in a bill. The HC verdict in March had struck down 200-point roster treating college/university as unit following which UGC had announced that an individual department should be considered as the base unit to calculate the number of teaching posts to be reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates leaving them at a disadvantage. The stalemate has resulted in colleges/universities forced to run classes with ad hoc teachers.

""Immediately after the HC verdict on March 5, FEDCUTA, DUTA and several other Universities Teachers Associations protested it, after our representations to HRD Minister, we were promised that the Government will file an appeal in the Supreme Court,"" said Prof Ray. ""We had been repeatedly telling the government to bring an ordinance to restore the old roster, but it has so far done nothing except for filing an appeal due to which appointments have come to a standstill,"" he further said.

Prof Ray claimed that since all the political parties, including Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, CPM and CPI have supported the Teachers Association on the issue, so the government should have no problem if it introduces bill to restore the 200-point roster. ""They should have done this in April itself,"" he said.

Prof Ray said that it was shocking to see that immediately after the HC order came, 7 to 10 universities came up with advertisements according to the new anti-reservation roster, clearly indicating that in the academics the anti-reservation position is a major position. ""The indecisiveness of the government has resulted in vacancies rising to 50 per cent in Delhi University Colleges alone and both reserved as well as the general category candidates seeking jobs are suffering,"" he added.

There is no urgency to fill vacant Teachers Associations of the state and central universities have formed a Joint Forum for Movement (JFME) to carry out a march on February 19 next year to protest against the Modi Government's education policy. ""There will teachers from KG to PG protesting in the capital against the policy attack that has happened against publicly funded institutions,"" said Prof Ray. ""The graded autonomy bills, attempt to dismantle UGC, replacing 'grants' from the UGC, with 'loans' from Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) for infrastructure, this is all an attempt towards privatisation and commercialisation of the education sector,"" he added.

Imran had earlier given a dressing down to doc­tors at Chest Disease Hispital Srinagar asking them to improve the healthcare following death of a patient allegedly due to their negligence. ""Negligence of doc­tors at the hospital has led to the death of an elderly woman whose beloved were crying for the help in the premises of the hospital, when I reached there,"" Imran told reporters.

However eve as a faction of the doctors have reacted sharply to his directive ask­ing doctors to improve the healthcare, Imran said that he was supported on the is­sue by majority of the doctors.

Imran said that he did'nt misbehave with the doctors, but rather asked them to im­prove the healthcare. He said that he visited the Chest Dis­ease hospital to ""improve the situation there.""

""I want to seek forgiveness in case I have used any abu­sive language but I want to urge the doctors not to go for strike as it will only add to the miseries of the patients"", Imran said.

He added he has not fired any public servant but has sought that the matter of negligence of the doctors that left an ailing woman dead should be taken up with the Chief Secretary.

""In case I have used any un-parliamentary language, then I am very sorry for that but don't make the people suffer,"" he said.

""I understand there are shortcomings so far as infrastructure is concerned and I want concerned to bring it in our notice"".

""The change has begun and we will not tolerate suffering of people any more"", he claimed.

In a video that had earlier gone viral, Deputy Mayor had during his visit to the hospital asked that doctor that instead of sitting in his room, he should have attended the duties. The video shows a patient also complaining about the lack of healthcare in the hospital.

Imran had also asked the doctors that it was their duty to attend to the patients and said that there was ""no way they could have justified the lack of patient care"" at the hospital. In the video, he is seen to have been seeking an explanation from the doctor.

DAK Protests Measures To Improve Health Care

Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) on Wednesday reacted sharply to the direc­tive of Deputy Mayor, Sheikh Imran, to improve healthcare at CD hospital. In a statement it as Imran to, ""stick to his domain while deploring his misbehav­iour with the doctors.""

DAK president, Dr Suhail Naik said that such interference is a common phenomenon and ""we warn him to mind his own work. The hospitals are working round the clock in every situation.""

""He (Deputy Mayor) should have learned morals before talk­ing to a doctor. It does not seem that he has taken education from a foreign country. We want to tell him to learn from Rural educational institute so that he can get some manners to behave with doctors, "" he said while condemning Imran's behaviour.

""It is not SMC that is paying us; we are being paid through the taxes of people. He should return the money that he owes the bank, rather than telling doctors that

Pics/Sayyed Sameer Abedi

If you have ever been on SV Road at Santacruz around noon, you must have seen the yellow school buses with Podar Education Complex labelled on either side. These are parked along both sides of the road leading to the RN Podar School. The chaos when school is over brings the traffic to a standstill for about an hour on weekdays, a problem that has persisted for many years.

As the school hours of Lilavatibai Podar School and R N Podar School both end within few minutes of each other, the space left after the buses are parked along the footpaths, is occupied by students catching with each other before going home. The primary section at RN Podar School ends at 12.15 pm and the secondary school ends just a few minutes later. Amidst this, are parents who arrive on their scooters, in auto-rickshaws and even in private cars to pick up their children, adding to the chaos. Due to the lack of space on the footpaths, many parents have no choice but to stand in the middle of the road while looking for their child.

Students leaving for the day chat with friends, adding to traffic issues

One-way road adds to chaos

The road between RN Podar and Lilavatibai Podar School is known as Andrews Road. Vehicles can only move in one direction on it. Many vehicle drivers, especially autos and two-wheeler riders can be seen disregarding traffic rules as they try to navigate their way through the crowd of students. Apart from the traffic congestion that creates a problem for parents, local residents, shop keepers as well as motorists just passing through the area, the safety of the children is also an issue. On the road adjacent to RN Podar School, the building that previously was the Podar International School is currently being re-developed. On December 11, a few workers could be seen lifting a massive grille from the ground. The grille dangled just above a school bus which had students sitting inside. Despite being a hazard, none of the school staff on the road seemed bothered by it.

Solutions proposed

Every school has been mandated to form a transport committee that has proposed and implemented solutions to the traffic issues. The school's principal Avnita Bir said that a transport committee which includes members of the PTA has been constituted. The committee meets with the transport department and the traffic police once every six months to find solutions to the traffic issues in the area. ""Letters from the PTA have been sent to the traffic police department repeatedly in the past and for some time they would block the road during dispersal hours. But then a few months ago, they opened the road to the traffic again. While we have the co-operation of the traffic police, it is also our responsibility to ensure easy movement on the road, and our system and guards deal with the traffic,"" Bir said."

-- by Kevin Stacey

The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) dark matter detector, which will soon start its search for the elusive particles thought to account for a majority of matter in the universe, had its first set of ""eyes"" delivered Thursday.

The first of two large arrays of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) -- powerful light sensors that can detect the faintest of flashes -- completed a 2,000-mile journey by truck from Rhode Island to the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota, where LZ is scheduled to begin its dark matter search in 2020.

The second array will arrive in January. When the LZ detector is completed and switched on, the PMT arrays will keep careful watch on LZ's 10-ton tank of liquid xenon, looking for the tell-tale twin flashes of light produced if a dark matter particle bumps into a xenon atom inside the tank.

A team of researchers and technicians from Brown University has spent the past six months painstakingly assembling the two arrays, each about 5 feet in diameter and holding a total of 494 PMTs.

""The delivery of these arrays is the pinnacle of an enormous assembly effort that we've had to execute here in our clean room,"" said Rick Gaitskell, a professor of physics at Brown University who oversaw the construction of the arrays. ""For the last two years, we've been making sure that every piece that's going into the devices is working as expected. Only by doing that can we be confident that everything will perform the way we want when the detector is switched on.""

The Brown team has worked with researchers and engineers from the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and from Imperial College London to design, procure, test, and assemble all of the components of the array. Testing of the PMTs, which are manufactured by the Hamamatsu Corp. in Japan, was performed at Brown and at Imperial College.

""The delivery of the first array of PMTs for LZ to SURF is a critical milestone for the LZ Project,"" said Murdock ""Gil"" Gilchriese of Berkeley Lab, who is the LZ project director.

In preparation for the arrival of the PMT arrays, researchers at SURF had already been working with prototype arrays to practice connecting the PMTs to a complex sequence of cabling. The actual assembly of these cables to the PMTs will take place in a clean room at SURF.

Nobody knows exactly what dark matter is. Scientists can see the effects of its gravity in the rotation of galaxies and in the way light bends as it travels across the universe, but no one has directly detected a dark matter particle. The leading theoretical candidate for a dark matter particle is the WIMP, or weakly interacting massive particle. WIMPs can't be seen because they don't absorb, emit, or reflect light. And they interact with normal matter only on very rare occasions, which is why they're so hard to detect even when millions of them may be traveling through the Earth each second.

The LZ experiment, a collaboration of more than 250 scientists from 38 institutions worldwide, aims to capture one of those fleetingly rare WIMP interactions, and thereby characterize the particles thought to make up more than 80 percent of the matter in the universe. The detector will be the most sensitive ever built: 100 times more sensitive than the LUX detector, which wrapped up its dark matter search at SURF in 2016.

The PMT arrays are a critical part of the experiment. Each PMT is a 6-inches-long cylinder that is roughly the diameter of a soda can. To form arrays large enough to monitor the entire LZ xenon target, hundreds of PMTs are assembled together within a circular titanium matrix. The array that will sit on top of the xenon target has 253 PMTs, while the lower array has 241.

PMTs are designed to amplify weak light signals. When individual photons (particles of light) enter a PMT, they strike a photocathode. If the photon has sufficient energy, it causes the photocathode to eject one or more electrons. Those electrons then strike an electrode, which ejects more electrons. By cascading through a series of electrodes the original signal is amplified by over a factor of 1 million to create a detectable signal.

LZ's PMT arrays will need every bit of that sensitivity to catch the flashes associated with a WIMP interaction.

""We could be looking for events emitting as few as 20 photons in a huge tank containing 10 tons of xenon, which is something that the human visual system wouldn't be able to do,"" Gaitskell said. ""But it's something these arrays can do, and we'll need them to do it in order to see the signal from rare particle events.""

The photons are produced by what's known as a nuclear recoil event, which produces two distinct flashes. The first comes at the moment a WIMP bumps into a xenon nucleus. The second, which comes a few hundred microseconds afterward, is produced by the ricochet of the xenon atom that was struck. It bounces into the atoms surrounding it, which knocks a few electrons free. The electrons are then drifted by an electric field to the top of the tank, where they reach a thin layer of xenon gas that converts them into light.

In order for those tiny flashes to be distinguishable from unwanted background events, the detector needs to be protected from cosmic rays and other kinds of radiation, which also cause liquid xenon to light up. That's why the experiment takes place underground at SURF, a former gold mine, where the detector will be shielded by about a mile of rock to limit interference.

The need to limit interference is also the reason that the Brown University team was obsessed with cleanliness while they assembled the arrays. The team's main enemy was plain old dust.

""When you're dealing with an instrument that's as sensitive as LZ, suddenly things you wouldn't normally care about before become very serious,"" said Casey Rhyne, a Brown University graduate student who had a leading role in building the arrays. ""One of the biggest challenges we had to confront was minimizing ambient dust levels during assembly.""

Each dust particle carries a miniscule amount of radioactive uranium and thorium decay products. The radiation is vanishingly small and poses no threat to people, but too many of those specks inside the LZ detector could be enough to interfere with a WIMP signal.

In fact, the dust budget for the LZ experiment calls for no more than one gram of dust to be contained in the entire 10-ton instrument. Because of all of their nooks and crannies, the PMT arrays could be significant dust collectors if pains were not taken to keep them clean throughout construction.

The Brown University team performed most of its work in a ""class 1000"" clean room, which allows no more than 1,000 microscopic dust particles per cubic foot of space. And within that clean room was an even more pristine space that the team dubbed ""PALACE (PMT Array Lifting And Commissioning Enclosure)."" PALACE was essentially an ultraclean room where much of the actual array assembly took place. PALACE was a ""class 10"" space -- allowing no more than 10 dust particles bigger than 1 hundredth the width of a human hair per cubic foot.

But the radiation concerns didn't stop at dust. Before assembly of the arrays began, the team prescreened every part of every PMT tube to assess radiation levels.

""We had Hamamatsu send us all of the materials that they were going to use for the PMT construction, and we put them in an underground germanium detector,"" said Samuel Chan, a graduate student and PMT system team leader. ""This detector is very good at detecting the radiation that the construction materials are emitting. If the intrinsic radiation levels were low enough in these materials, then we told Hamamatsu to go ahead and use them in the manufacture of these PMTs.""

The team is hopeful that all the work they put in over the past six months will pay dividends when LZ starts its WIMP search.

""Getting everything right now will have a huge impact less than two years from now, when we switch on the completed detector and we're taking data,"" Gaitskell said. ""We'll be able to see directly from that data how good of a job we and other people have done.""

Given the major increase in dark matter search sensitivity that the LZ detector can deliver compared to all previous experiments, the team hopes that this detector will finally identify and characterize the vast sea of stuff that surrounds us all. So far, the dark stuff has remained maddeningly elusive.

A division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi clarified that the PILs would be heard only after they deposited the amount. The bench, however, didn't set any deadline for them to complete the formalities. The judges also refused to issue notices to respondents in the six PILs before the petitioners prove their bona fides.

Among them, four were filed by the same petitioner -- Yogeshkumar Prakash Nandeshwar -- through counsel Shankar Malpe. The others were by social workers Datta Rathod through counsel SS Dhengale, and Chandrabhan Kolte through Ashwin Ingole.

One of Nandeshwar's plea was against the state home department, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli collectors, and superintendent of police (SP) of Bhandara and Gadchiroli, and G-Life India Developers and Colonisers.

According to him, the company having its head office at Sewanagar in Gwalior opened its branches in 2012 in Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gadchiroli, and Yavatmal. It collected huge amounts from gullible investors through agents and issued them debenture certificates. The company also issued renewal subscription receipts in order to renew payments in 2014.

The company, however, failed to return the amount even after the maturity mentioned in the debenture certificates, thus cheating the investors. The investors went to various branches and found them closed. The local agents expressed inability to pay as they were out of reach.

Feeling aggrieved by the company's actions, investors approached Nandeshwar. After collecting information through his trust, the petitioner moved the complaint before the collector and SP, and also organized a demonstration with other social workers.

Rathod's plea was for protecting the forests, where he accused deputy conservator in Pusad circle, Arvind Mundhe, of misusing his rights and administrative powers by permitting excavation work by Reliance Jio Infocomm for laying optical fibre lines on forest land.

He also filed an online complaint and moved applications to the chief conservator of forest, who directed Munde to reply within a week. He also moved a representation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A criminal case was filed against Munde later.

Kolte's plea was against state school education and sports department which failed to take any action regarding alleged illegality committed by erring schools. According to him, the schools running Standard VIII and IX for last two academic sessions had no permission from the authority, thus causing loss to students. He even lodged an FIR in this regard against the schools alleging that precious taxpayers' money was being wasted.

SHGs are already serving MDM to students at many schools run by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Though eager to outsource it to SHGs, schools do have apprehensions about accountability in the way the system will be run. TOI has learnt that the issue will be discussed in the principals' association meet in January.

A principal of an aided school told TOI on condition of anonymity that the idea of outsourcing was not a bad one considering the hassles schools have to deal with. ""We have to coordinate with the officials who deal with MDM and maintain records of each and every transaction plus students fed. One of the office staff is continuously engaged in this operation only, so one would feel that it's best to hand outsource this operation,"" the principal said.

TOI has been told many schools are being urged by MDM officials to select SHG as their vendors. The principal, added "" I hope the money and raw materials are properly accounted for. Pilferage can happen very easily with the school not being directly involved.""

The current set up for aided schools is such that schools get rice directly from the government. The rice sacks are delivered every month straight to the campus from Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns, with no monetary exchange happening between schools and FCI. The quantity of rice sacks to be delivered is conveyed by the school to the education department, which then informs FCI about it. This is the only part of the purchasing process that is common for both urban and rural schools.

Vegetables, pulses and other cooking materials have to be purchased by urban schools which then get reimbursed within two or three months. In rural areas, schools have to simply pick up the ingredients from designated shops and the education department takes care of the payment.

Almost all rural schools have cultivated kitchen gardens and use fresh vegetables in their MDM. Apart from SHG, even NGO Akshay Patra is providing MDM to certain schools as pilot project."

A check and (batch) mate game appears to be on in the first bureaucratic reshuffle of 40 IAS officers by the Gehlot government.

The 1993 batch officers who were holding the top most portfolios in the chief minister office and the secretariat till now have been replaced by their juniors belonging to the batch of 1994, and there is reason for this.

When former chief minister Vasundhara Raje assumed office on December 13, 2013, she appointed Tanmay Kumar as her secretary within a week. A 93 batch officer, Tanmay emerged a power centre and gripped his clutches in the CMO and the secretariat.

After his appointment to the highest office, his batch mate IAS officers, who got training along with him -- Akhil Arora, Aparna Arora, Shikhar Agrawal and Alok -- got appointment on cream posts.

Arora, who has been made principal secretary in social department in Tuesday's transfers, was till now appointed in planning department while Agrawal, after returning from deputation from New Delhi, was rewarded the post of Jaipur Development Commissioner (JDC), a much sought after post among the bureaucrats. Alok, meanwhile, served in important departments including Energy, Revenue and Energy till the time Tanmay was the CM secretary.

As the Gehlot government resumed office, the 94 batch officers fell out of favour and all were shunted out. It could be called a coincidence or a 'deliberate' exercise that their one batch junior officers of 93 batch were appointed on important posts as the new government took charge.

Kuldeep Ranka was appointed principal secretary to the CM, replacing Tammay who got posting as Commissioner of Command Area Development. Along with Ranka, his batch mates were 'crowned' with important portfolios.

Naresh Pal Gangwar, principal secretary planning, Roli Singh, principal secretary higher and technical education and Sreya Guha, principal secretary tourism, all Ranka's batch mates, were appointed in the latest reshuffle. The 93 batch officers, barring some exceptions, have returned to the 'power' finally.

""It happens that any officer appointed as CM secretary works to get plum posts to the batch mates. The trend may be witnessed in coming reshuffling,"" said an IAS officer on the condition of anonymity."

The ongoing program termed as 'Nisarganubhav Shibir 2018', which commenced on November 28, aims to sensitize students from local communities residing in the buffer zone villages of Pench so that they play an active role in conservation. Students between 12-18 years are being selected for this program as it is in this age that their mind can be tapped and moulded towards wildlife conservation. The Pench Foundation is organizing this event while Satpuda Foundation is the primary educational partner.

The Pench Foundation is an entity that uses funds from various sources like the park tourism income for the development of buffer zone villages and its people. While the foundation is funding the whole event and taking care of logistics including transportation, lodging and boarding, Satpuda Foundation is responsible for planning and scheduling of the event and imparting awareness and education to the students.

""The students are made to go through various activities like jungle safari, nature and birding trails, nature games, movie screenings, competitions, lectures, presentations, etc through which they are made to realize the importance of saving their local flora and fauna and safeguarding the forests near their villages,"" said Kishor Rithe, president of Satpuda Foundation.

The teachers who are accompanying the students are also involved in some of the activities and requested to carry out nature and environment related activities in their school regularly,"" says Giri Venkatesan, executive director of Satpuda Foundation.

Rithe said various gifts are being distributed to the students along with certificates like books, pencil boxes, field guide on birds etc. The students are showing great enthusiasm and have promised to remember the learnings that they have imbibed here. Some students were so inspired that they took guidance from the forest department officials and the resource persons regarding how to prepare for examinations like UPSC and MPSC and work for the forest department by becoming IFS/ state forest service officials after completing their education.

Over 15 such camps are being conducted with 40 students in each camp. The students that show great leaning towards nature will be selected for a second round of more comprehensive and rigorous learning camps later to shape their desires and career goals in a phased manner.

Moreover, the schools that participated in this event will be given certain small environmental projects to start with that will be later taken to the community members to find solutions for existing local problems and devise community-based models driven by these students.

Nicholas Slatten was convicted of killing Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubia'y, one of 14 civilians slain when Blackwater guards opened fire in Nisur Square on Sept. 16, 2007, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said in a statement.

Slatten is being held pending sentencing and faces a mandatory life prison term, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.

His murder conviction came a year after a federal appeals court vacated his initial 2014 conviction, saying he should have been tried separately from three other Blackwater guards involved in the incident.

Prosecutors allege that Slatten, of Sparta, Tennessee, fired the first shots and intentionally set off a shooting rampage that killed or wounded 31 civilians, beginning with the death of the driver of a white Kia, Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubia'y, 19. The dead included 10 men, two women and two boys, ages 9 and 11.

The shooting stood out for its brutality even in a city in the grips of a bitter sectarian war, and sparked debate over the role of private security contractors such as Blackwater working for the U.S. government in war zones.

Slatten and his fellow guards were travelling in a heavily armed, four-truck Blackwater Worldwide convoy and had been trying to clear a path for U.S. diplomats after a nearby car bomb.

At Nisur Square, they opened fire on Iraqis, including women and children, with machine guns and grenade launchers.

The U.S. Justice Department has long pursued accountability for the Nisur Square shooting.

The Justice Department's case against Slatten hinged on him having fired the first shots because of a general animosity toward Iraqis. But some evidence suggested an unnamed co-defendant might have fired the initial shots.

The appeals court also ordered the three other Blackwater guards to be resentenced, saying their 30-year terms were too long. That resentencing is pending, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Slatten had received life in prison in the initial conviction.

Blackwater, which was founded by former Navy SEAL Erik Prince, the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was later sold and now operates as Virginia-based Academi.

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on US college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination. Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina. The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the US Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said _ barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees _ or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there _ are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. ""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

Detention camps in Xinjiang

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training center"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the center is government-operated.

""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility."" Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the US, and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear _ jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more _ from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to US customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The US and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the US.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the US, Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the US that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,"" said Smith. ""US consumers should not be buying and US businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

Stringent state security under President Xi Jinping

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Not all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the US

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training."" The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

Following concerns raised by investors regarding angel tax notices sent to startups, Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu said he has taken up the issue. ""We have taken up the issue,"" Prabhu replied in a tweet to chairman of Manipal Global Education T V Mohandas Pai, who had earlier tweeted: ""Draconian Angel tax torturing start-ups: It's killing genuine innovation.""

A top income tax department official said the ""notices issued on angel tax to startups may be for those that are not recognised by the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP)"".

Several startups have raised concerns on taxation of angel funds under Section 56 of the Income Tax Act. Under the Section 56(2)(viib) of the Income-tax Act, companies with closely held shares, when issuing shares, are charged 30 per cent tax on the difference between funds raised as per the actual valuation and the fair-market value of the company. This is known as the angel tax.

The notices consider the value of funding received by startups, which is over and above the enterprise value, as 'income from other sources' and therefore, consider that as taxable.

Advertising

In April, the government had tweaked the definition of startups to provide some relief wherein they were allowed to avail tax concession if total investment including funding from angel investors does not exceed Rs 10 crore. As per a notification by the Commerce and Industry Ministry, an angel investor picking up stakes in a startup should have a minimum net worth of Rs 2 crore or should have an average returned income of over Rs 25 lakh in the preceding three financial years.

ExplainedCalculating 'fair market value' holds the key

Startups incorporated after 2016 and recognised under the Startup India policy are exempted from the levy of 'angel' tax. During the initial round of investment or angel funding, startups are often valued higher than what is considered the 'fair market value'. The taxman uses traditional methods like discounted cash flows for gauging the correct value of a company, but investors and entrepreneurs say this method is outdated. The tax notices being faced by startups not recognised by DIPP or the ones incorporated before 2016, have created concerns among investors.

In February, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had directed income-tax commissioners not to take coercive measures against startups to recover the outstanding tax amount in case valuations have been modified or rejected by an assessing officer. The CBDT had also said that in all the cases that are pending with the Commissioner (Appeals), necessary administrative steps should be taken for expeditious disposal of appeals, ""preferably by March 31, 2018"".

Startups can avail income tax benefit for three out of seven consecutive assessment years, but they have to approach an eight-member inter-ministerial board of certification for getting such concession.

A startup incorporated after April 1, 2016 but before April 1, 2021 is eligible for this tax incentive. As per the DIPP definition, startups set up as private limited company or limited liability partnership and incorporated after April 1, 2016, would be eligible for tax concessions and will have the status of startup up to seven years from the date of incorporation, or up to 10 years if it's in the biotechnology sector. The company, however, loses the startup tag if its turnover in any year exceeds Rs 25 crore.

Tax experts said the angel tax provisions for startups need to be appropriately modified and provisions need to be reevaluated to cover all startups. Vikas Vasal, national leader - tax, Grant Thornton India LLP said, ""The angel tax provisions need to be appropriately modified to carve out an exception for the startups or may be these cases should be referred to a panel before initiating any penal action to distinguish and protect genuine startups vis-a-vis tax avoidance schemes and arrangements. It's not an easy task, however, to encourage entrepreneurship and employment in the country these provisions need to be reevaluated and softened a bit to cover all startups and not just the ones registered with the government."""

These notices consider the value of funding received by start-ups, which is over and above the enterprise value, as 'income from other sources' and hence taxable.

School education department officials have begun the work on opening kindergarten classes in the middle schools in the district and they are expected to chalk out a blueprint at the earliest.

The state government had on Monday passed an order to introduce LKG and UKG classes in 2,381 anganwadi centres functioning in the government middle schools across the state and equip them with teaching aids.

School education department officials said the order would be implemented after taking the strength of each anganwadi centre into account.

""This is an initiative to provide primary education to prepare the children for Class 1.

"835","1022435352","2018-12-19","http://risingkashmir.com/news/fixed-term-employment","Fixed-term employment","RisingKashmir",FALSE,"Due to the changing circumstances, organizations around the world are experiencing an increased level of economic strain and the academic organizations are no exception.

These organizations also employ diverse strategies that would assist in their growth practices with the minimum financial output.

One of these strategies is fixed-term employment, which refers to the appointment of staff who offers services for a pre-determined period of time, depending on the arrangement made between the individual and the employer.

Similarly, the Higher Education Department have opted to make use of an alternative method of staffing, infamously known and called as contractual. As the cost of employing staff members on a permanent basis leads to increased costs, the appointment of these academic arrangement staff members on fixed-term employment contracts incorporates limited benefits, thereby limiting costs to the department.

This option has been financially advantageous to this organization, but it has a negative impact on the job satisfaction of the employees, due to lack of job security and long-term career vision among other factors.

Although, these staff members play an important role in the overall functioning, success and survival of the educational institutions, their needs and levels of job satisfaction has often been ignored.

Since the nineteenth century, motivational researchers in the field of employee satisfaction have explained the importance of fulfilling the needs of employees in establishing a productive and satisfied workforce, for example, Affect Theory by Locke, the Hierarchy of Needs by Maslow, the Dispositional Theory by Judge, Two-Factor theory by Herzberg, the Job Characteristic Model by Hackman and Oldman, etc.

According to research that was conducted by the Harvard Professional Group (1998), job satisfaction can be seen as the sense of achievement and success that is experienced by an employee at the place of employment.

It continues by stating that job satisfaction is the main ingredient that leads the employee towards the attainment of set goals such as recognition, better income structure, promotion to a better position, as well as achievement of other objectives that will ultimately lead to a higher level of motivation and fulfilment.

Experts have emphasized the hampering effect that fixed-term employment conditions may have on job satisfaction of staff and have identified underlying uncertainties and frustrations among fixed-term contract staff members and the challenge of keeping those staff members committed to their academic task.

It has been found that the employees who have a permanent employment contract tend to experience a much higher level of job satisfaction than those employees with a fixed-term contract and this can have a negative influence on the motivation and productivity of these employees.

The lack of formal support from the middle management, the prejudiced perceptions of permanent contract staff members, as well as the negative effect of this kind of appointment on the career paths of these staff members are some of the major reasons for individuals being shy from this type of appointment.

The rising unemployment and lack of alternatives have left no choice for the candidates in our context. The use of fixed-term employees allows flexibility to the educational institutions as the number of lecturers can be increased or decreased according to their need. But there is also rise to a number of managerial challenges on different levels within these institutions. The tension and paradoxes are evident in the relationship between the organizations human resource approach and fixed-term contract employment strategies.

Academic arrangement employees working on fixed-term contract are unhappy about the employment conditions and with lack of support from the management. Subsequently the already existing tension between the state administration and this human resource is aggravated.

Given the context of a fragmented and distraught socio-political milieu, there are other factors which contribute to the degradation of these employees. Rampant corruption; degraded ethics on political and social level to torture the weaker; and lack of professional ethics have led to the discrimination and degradation of these employees. The state political actors have not been able to show any permanent stand.

Being deceitful to safeguard their own interests they have sometimes labelled these employees as inefficient, incapable, and even ineligible which seems to be scapegoating for their own incapability and inefficiency.

Among these employees the new entrants fulfil the current eligibility criteria fixed by the respective managing bodies. Being highly qualified their awards, achievements, and teaching at these institutions proves their ability and efficiency. Those employees who are labelled as ineligible (given the changes in eligibility criteria) have fulfilled their eligibility at the time of their entrance into this type of employment.

Eligibility criteria depend upon the need of the time. Their counterparts in the permanent contract employees are respected for their experience and are supervising the new entrants coming with higher qualifications and are called as seniors.

But the employees on the fixed-term contracts have been rewarded as ineligible for their years of experience, work commitment and continuous investment.

When the fact seems to be that, it is the state administrative failure which couldn't come with any concrete policy to absorb these employees. It is the inefficiency and ineligibility of the human resource management who seem to adopt the Machiavellianism approach, where on the one hand they take the services from these employees on the other hand doesn't even consider them as employees.

Their level of participation and recognition is almost none in other activities within these institutions. When there is need, these employees are threatened for disengagement for not taking the demanded tasks and when it is otherwise they are pushed out of the other related service activities, for example, evaluation, supervision, institution up gradation and development activities, training and orientation courses, etc.

Being labelled as inefficient and ineligible, the service of conveying knowledge is made possible through the fixed-term academic staff members.

Given the present social context, where dignity is awarded on the basis of money and power, it adds more to the discrimination and degradation of these staff members especially the female staff, where no considerations are given to the gender issues when it comes to fixed-term contract female employee.

The level of job satisfaction experienced by the academic staff members is crucial to the output of qualified and equipped students. It is very important that the authorities and the management of the educational institutions implement policies and procedures to ensure that the levels of job satisfaction experienced by the staff members are high.

There is lack of knowledge and poor management practices regarding this staff category. Motivation and job satisfaction begin with leadership that builds or affirms the people and their value to the institution. So the needs of these staff members must be taken into consideration.

Financial and non-financial motivators are determinants. Feeling of working on something worthwhile and working for a good and reliable organization, where sensitivity towards a work-life balance prevails contributes to motivation and job satisfaction.

The system that doesn't take employee needs and quality of life into account, are mainly bureaucratic and task-oriented and don't take personal and interpersonal relationships in a balanced life into account.

The Higher Education Department functions within a set organizational structure having different but interrelated management levels. There must be a specific understanding and delegation of authority and subsequent responsibility within an organization. The concept of authority goes hand in hand with responsibility, and the person higher in the hierarchy will have more responsibility and will be answerable ultimately.

The management structure must be made aware of new trends and challenges, which is of utmost importance. If the basic assumptions, goals and objectives of the organization stay the same, no progress will be made and there will be stagnation, and our higher educational institutions are the best example of this stagnation.

Here the management applies the Theory-X (hard approach; ""we versus they"" approach) of human work motivation on fixed-term contract employees and Theory-Y (soft approach; Democratic approach) on permanent-contract employees.

Whereas the world is constantly developing, they have moved beyond the Theory-Z (optimal managerial style - cultivating moral and ethical excellence), indicating our backwardness, ignorance, and lack of professional ethics.

When it comes to management even the Scientific Management or Taylorismwas considered obsolete by 1930s and a new classical approach known as Human Relations Approach was emphasized. The management should have good human skills. The organization must fulfil their staff's higher order psychological needs. But in this part of the world, we are not able to fulfil even the basic level needs of these staff members.

Employees can be all fired up about their work or can be made working hard. However, if the results of their work do not contribute to the organization and ultimately to the community, then the organization is not any better than if the employees were sitting on their hands and maybe even worse.

And this applies to all whether permanent contract employees or the fixed-term contract employees. An organization is only as strong as the individuals associated with it. The higher educational institutions were totally dependent on fixed-term contract staff members till recent recruitment of permanent staff members.

These posts in majority were also filled by the individuals who had been working as fixed-term contract employees. If these candidates are labelled as inefficient and ineligible, it will indicate that the administration and the management are corrupted and are cheating the public.

When the fact is that, this staffing trend is increasing given the demand and the lack of resources on part of the educational institutions.

Further it can be asserted that the rapid increase of fixed-term lecturers at higher education institutions can be attributed to the relative absence of employment regulation, declining resources with rapid expansion of student enrolments.

These factors combine to encourage numerical flexibility with rapid recruitment and the use of cheap and disposable employees given the unemployment and lack of alternative choices to the candidates.

The Human Resource Management division of an organization is directly involved in the implementation of the strategies that are decided by the higher levels. This division must be functional in every institution. It is imperative that this department, which is an integral link between staff members and the management structure of the educational institutions, keep the best interests of both the staff members as well as the organization in mind.

The situations need to be managed in order to ensure the continuation of the person as well as the organization otherwise there will be further increase in the social problems and disturbances. The number of fixed-term contract employees at various institutions exceeds the number of permanent contract employees.

The administrative decisions must be made. There must be policies for these employees in order to ensure their job security and a better quality of life which inturn will lead to the betterment of the society.

The fixed-term lecturers' account for a higher of the overall workforce of higher educational institutions, but no attention is being paid neither by the administration nor by the management into whether these staff members are satisfied with the roles they have, their responsibilities or the rewards they receive.

It has been found that the fixed-term lectures often bring first-hand knowledge and experience to the classroom and many of the fixed-term lecturers bring with them significant awards and experiences.

The growing numbers as well as the relative permanence of these lecturers at higher educational institutions show that these institutions rely heavily on the services of these fixed-term contract lecturers and they are imperative to the success of the academic environment.

It is observed that these teachers have been neglected when compared to their permanent counterparts in terms of support and policy. This has resulted in the feelings of being ""at the margin"" amongst them. The administration as well as the management must honestly accept this undeniable fact and must make this human resource feel that ""they matter"" and not that they work ""just to fill the gaps"".

Job insecurity; very low salaries with no access to resources and benefits; and no long-term employment options available to them has resulted in a very strong dissatisfaction with their job environments.

Thus, it influences their levels of job satisfaction, and ultimately, the productivity of these lecturers and the higher educational institutions as a whole, which indicates the failure on part of the institutional management and the state administration."

Context: The Lok Sabha has passed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016 to give transgender persons equal rights and protection under law through a voice vote.

The Bill had gone to the standing committee, and as many as 27 amendments have been accepted by the government.

The amendments passed include a change in the previous definition of transgender persons as ""neither wholly female or wholly male"", which was criticised as being insensitive.

According to the new definition, a transgender person is somebody ""whose gender does not match the gender assigned to that person at birth and includes trans-men or trans-women, persons with intersex variations, gender-queers, and persons having socio-cultural identities such as kinnar, hijras, aravani, and jogta"".

Several civil society groups have been vocal about their opposition to the Bill The Bill disregards many of their suggestions as also some of the crucial points raised by the standing committee report of July 2017.

The Bill must recognise that gender identity must go beyond biological; gender identity is an individual's deep and personal experience. It need not correspond to the sex assigned at birth. It includes the personal sense of the body and other expressions such as one's own personal inducing proceeds.

Context: Women and child development ministry has drafted a policy dedicated to the protection of children. Until now, protection of children was only a part of the broader National child policy 2013.

The Supreme Court had asked the centre to consider framing the national policy on protection of children.

Key provisions and highlights of the draft policy:

The Policy should address four aspects- creating awareness, prevention, reporting and responding. The draft needs to go into all these aspects, especially reporting structure involving various nodal bodies and monitoring mechanism for implementation of the guidelines.

The policy makers should take the opportunity to go beyond the role of Institutions and look at the role of individuals.

The norms should be designed in such a way that organisations can customise the policies according to the nature of their work.

Context: A group of researchers at Nagpur-based Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology have developed a new technique which promises to help produce high value graphene from discarded dry cells batteries.

Since graphene is made out of graphite, its production is both expensive and has significant environmental impact. The new technique helps both reduce the cost and preserve environment.

Graphene has been touted in the global electronics industry as a ""miracle material"" given its strength, electrical conductivity and elasticity, and has been seen as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries since its discovery in 2004. It is a form of carbon that can be used to develop smaller, slimmer batteries but with higher capacity.

Graphene is a carbon material that is one atom thick. Its thin composition and high conductivity means it is used in applications ranging from miniaturised electronics to biomedical devices. These properties also enable thinner wire connections; providing extensive benefits for computers, solar panels, batteries, sensors and other devices.

Context: The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has started the process of ""comprehensively amending"" the backbone of forest governance in India -- the Indian Forest Act, 1927 (IFA).

According to the 1996 Supreme Court order, the dictionary definition of the word forest is taken to be the legal definition too. It covers all statutorily recognised forests, whether designated as reserved, protected or otherwise for the purpose of Section 2(i) of the Forest Conservation Act (1980). As per the Court order, the term forest land, occurring in Section 2, will not only include forest as understood in the dictionary sense, but also any area recorded as forest in the government record irrespective of the ownership.

The Indian Forest Act, 1927 was largely based on previous Indian Forest Acts implemented under the British. The most famous one was the Indian Forest Act of 1878.

Many reports like the MB Shah report of 2010 and the TSR Subramanian report of 2015, have talked about amending the IFA.

Mains Question: The recent amendments to the Indian Forest Act, 1927 will create new markets & jobs for poor communities. Critically analyze.

Context: The Tamil Nadu government has distributed 200 Navic- powered satellite- enabled communication devices developed by ISRO to 80 fishing boat groups.

NAVIC is an independent regional navigation satellite system designed to provide position information in the Indian region and 1500 km around the Indian mainland.

IRNSS would provide two types of services, namely Standard Positioning Services available to all users and Restricted Services provided to authorised users.

It is a regional system and so its constellation will consist of seven satellites. Three of these will be geostationary over the Indian Ocean, i.e., they will appear to be stationary in the sky over the region, and four will be geosynchronous - appearing at the same point in the sky at the same time every day. This configuration ensures each satellite is being tracked by at least one of fourteen ground stations at any given point of time, with a high chance of most of them being visible from any point in India.

Why it is necessary to have indigenous global navigation system?

Having a global navigation system bolsters the ability of a nation to serve as a net security provider, especially through the guarantee of such assurance policies. It can also play a significant role in relief efforts post disasters such as the tsunami in the Indian Ocean region in 2004 and the Pakistan-India earthquake in 2005.

Mains Question: Write a note on the objectives and significance of NAVIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation).

The 7 round of India - South Korea Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) negotiations were held in South Korea from 11 to 13 December, 2018.

South Korea imports around 15 lac tones of raw sugar annually and the Indian sugar industry is making efforts to export raw sugar from India during 2018-19 sugar seasons.

India and South Korea will reduce duties on 11 tariff lines in a bid to expand bilateral trade by updating their existing free-trade agreement, called the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA).

In 2017-18, India exported goods worth $4.4 billion to South Korea while imports from the latter were worth $16.3 billion.

CECA - Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement

CEPA - Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement

The major ""technical"" difference between a CECA and CEPA is that CECA involve only ""tariff reduction/elimination in a phased manner on listed/all items except the negative list and tariff rate quota (TRQ) items. CEPA also covers the trade in services and investment and other areas of economic partnership"".

So CEPA is a wider term that CECA and has the widest coverage.

Usually CECA is signed first with a country and after that negotiations may start for a CEPA.

The chief minister added that he has a dream of seeing Delhi being counted among the select cities of the world, and every citizen, be it rich or poor, would feel proud of it.

Among the projects chosen under Phase IV are: Rithala-Bawana-Narela (21.73 km, elavated), Janakpuri West-RK Ashram (28.92 km, 21.18-km elevated ), Mukundpur-Maujpur (12.54 km, elevated), Inderlok-Indraprastha (12.58 km, underground), Aero City-Tughlakabad (20.2 km, 5.58-km elevated), Lajpat Nagar-Saket G Block (7.96 km, 5.89-km elevated).

Sisodia said the government would give its share of Rs 97.07 billion towards the construction work under the project, which is estimated to cost around Rs 450 billion.

The operating losses, if any, would be shared between the government and the Centre at a ratio of 50:50 for the project.

In the 2018-19 financial year, the government will release Rs 110 billion, followed by Rs 17.05 billion the next fiscal, Rs 17.73 billion in 2020-21, Rs 17.31 billion in 2021-22, Rs 162 million in 2022-23 and Rs 12.08 billion in 2023-24.

The cabinet approved construction of the elevated roads on Rithala-Bawana-Narela, Janakpuri West-RK Ashram and Mukundpur-Maujpur. The corridors will be constructed by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and the entire cost would be borne by the government, Sisodia said.

The Phase-IV project had become a bone of contention between the AAP government and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government as the former did not give its final nod to the project, even after its in-principle approval to the same in February 2016.

The Delhi finance department had submitted its report to the government, saying that some of the proposed corridors were financially ""unviable"".

Following the delay, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had, in October, said: ""We will open a box of sweets only when a formal announcement for the metro Phase-IV project is made."

The Archaeology Department launched on Wednesday an excavation on the banks of the Pampa river at Edayaranmula, near Aranmula, exploring the ancient Pampa Valley civilisation. In September, a few fishers had sighted terracotta figurines along a caved-in portion of the river bank near Anjilimoottilkadavu at Edayaranmula.

Rajeev Puliyoor, a Malayalam teacher at the Mahatma Gandhi University B.Ed. Centre at Elanthoor, who has been researching the Pampa Valley civilisation, and K.P. Sreeranganathan, photographer-turned-historian, said the figurines pointed to a centuries-old rich civilisation that prevailed in the Pampa river basin. Mr. Sreeranganathan it was a first of a kind discovery from the banks of Pampa and invited deeper studies.

The pieces include male and female figurines, snake heads, bust of a man and a twin female terracotta statue. The Aranmula-based Pampa Valley Civilisation Study and Research Centre has taken up the matter with Minister for Archaeology Kadannappally Ramachandran, who directed the Archaeology Department to conduct a detailed study and excavation of the site.

A team of experts comprising S. Bhoopesh, conservation engineer, and Rajeshkumar, curator, attached to the State Archaeology Department, visited Edayaranmula and examined the artefacts on October 1. Vasthu Vidya Gurukulam Executive Director P.K. Karunadas visited the site and the terracotta pieces were shifted to a room at the Gurukulam building at Aranmula.

Meanwhile, Mr. Puliyoor contacted historians M.R. Raghava Warrier and M.G.S. Narayanan. Prof. Warrier visited Edayaranmula in the first week of October and said that the artefacts might be 800-1200 years old.

The excavation of the site is progressing under the leadership of K.R. Sona, Superintending Archaeologist. A team comprising Krishnaraj, Abdul Hakkim, R. Rajeshkumar, Jeevamol, Vimalkumar, Baiju, and C.N. Sukumaran, is carrying out the excavation.

Mr. Puliyoor, who is coordinating the excavation, is confident of unearthing more artefacts from the site. He said Prof. Warrier and K.K. Mohammed, historian, too would visit the site.

He said the artefacts unearthed would be displayed at a museum to be set up at Nalkalickal near Aranmula. Dr. Mohanakshan Nair, linguist and Sanskrit scholar, said the 13th Century text, Tirunizhalmala, also mentioned the heritage village of Aranmula on the banks of Pampa and on the presence of education centres there."

""Das can work under any government. He follows the rule book,"" the Minister added.

Well, Das's critics may hold a different view, but being a true-blue Babu seems to have worked in his favour. In times of difficulties, it's always the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officials who seem to be the fall-back persons of ministers.

Yet, take stock of the year gone by and bureaucracy seems to have lost its sheen. Many who are still serving have been tossed around from one ministry to another or prematurely repatriated without being given an opportunity to explain. Some have been intimidated by politicians -- take the case of Delhi Chief Secretary or the shocking sentencing of former coal secretary HC Gupta.

Jawhar Sircar, a former IAS officer who has held key positions as Culture Secretary and CEO of Prasar Bharati, feels that usually working in the Centre is more systematic and impersonal than in the States. But that has changed now, with a pall of fear over the civil servants. Transfers and repatriations happen without any prior warning.

Talent expert Hemant Sharma, former HR head of Sun Microsystems, feels that bureaucracy is losing its sheen is because it is no longer an aspirational job for the brightest minds of our country. ""Till the eighties, getting into the IAS was the dream of educated youths and attracted the best minds of the country. Initially, post Independence, people joined the government, driven by ideals of contributing to nation building. Later, in the 1970s, the power of these roles was a big draw,"" he analyses. Today, the role models for the brightest minds are the Satya Nadellas and Sundar Pichais of the world.

In short, what civil servants today need is a role model -- their own Nadella or Pichai.

To be fair, the Department of Personnel & Training (DOPT) has been attempting to introduce meritocracy in promotions, with concepts like SPARROW -- Smart Performance Appraisal Report Recording Window -- and a 360-degree feedback tool for officers in line to become Additional Secretaries or Secretaries. This June, it even came out with ads for lateral recruitment to senior positions in the government for 10 Department/Ministries.

Although the ad attracted 6,097 applicants, the candidates seem to have fallen short of expectations. Now the task of sifting through the applications has been given to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). On December 11, UPSC asked the candidates to fill a Detailed Application Form, the last date to submit which is January 1, 2019.

But, despite all these moves, some serious rethinking is needed when it comes to management of the bureaucracy. Sharma suggests building employer branding to attract better quality talent. ""While they are called public servants, there is, however, no customer orientation or service orientation in the bureaucracy,"" he says.

Most feel there needs to be greater consistency in postings and specialised expertise is much needed, particularly for the social sector. As Sircar says, ""Today, unfortunately, the officers are not making use of even half of their capabilities because of fear of uncertainties which can follow them even after their retirement.""

Says Dhir Jhingran, Founder Director of Language and Learning Foundation, ""I favour offering specialisation opportunity to interested IAS officers early in their career so they can build domain knowledge and expertise in specific areas. In this time, it has become crucial to understand domains like health, education or any other sector to be able to learn from the best practices across the world.""

Probably this is where lateral entry could work. But even as efforts are being made, why is there such widespread disillusionment within the service?

Sharma cites two reasons. ""The young bright minds join the service with the desire to change things in the country, but they soon lose the motivation, given the rigid rules and regulations which prevent them from implementing out-of-the-box ideas. At a societal level, to the common man, bureaucracy is not necessarily the IAS officer but the Block Development Officer at the grass-roots level. Here, the common citizen encounters corruption at every step of government interface to get public services delivered to him/her.""

Anil Swarup, former Coal and Education Secretary, feels that ""while there is transparency in performance appraisals, similar transparency is missing in selection of officers to senior-level posts. There is absence of communication between those that are responsible for selection/empanelment and those that are not considered for selection. A sincere conversation with those that are left will enable them to improve and will not lead to demoralisation.""

As former IAS officer Vivek Rae, who was also a member of the Seventh Pay Commission, says, there is need for a more rigorous system to recognise and reward merit and punish weak performance, both at the Central and State level. Automatic career progression to higher pay scales, especially through non-functional upgradation, has to stop.

And there is mixed signalling everywhere. As an in-service officer says, ""When we meet the Prime Minister for meetings he calls, we all feel motivated and convinced...but..."".

It's time the government stopped this mixed messaging and put some trust and faith in the civil servants of the country."

This is a contempt of the General Body Meeting and take action against those officials doing works in a wrong way and suspend them, he demanded. Thereafter informing that there were long discussions over this subject in last General Body Meeting, opposition leader Ajay Boraste informed that as former Municipal Commissioner tabled a report stating that city has 2059 unauthorised buildings, there is strong anger among citizens.

In addition, property survey was conducted by college students and how it will be considered proper. Clarification over notices sent to new 59,000 properties has to be made within 21 days.

The state also said that it would submit a copy of the Backward Class Commission report, in its entirety, to the Bombay high court but expressed some apprehensions to make it public without truncating it.

For the public, the report may need to be truncated said the state.

""Some parts of the report goes into history of the Maratha community, that may create some kind of social unrest,"" said Maharashtra advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni before a bench of chief justice Naresh Patil and justice MS Karnik. He added, ""as it sometimes happens that wounds already closed may be opened.""

State's special counsel VA Thorat also said, ""It is our duty to place it before the court."" But he added, ""some issues in the report are not relevant to the issue of reservation and are volatile in nature.""

The HC was hearing petitions filed to challenge the newly-enacted law that gives 16% reservation in education and public employment to Marathas. There were also petitions which challenged, partially supported or partially challenged the ban and some had intervened to fully support the reservations.

Arguing for the first public interest litigation (PIL) filed against the new act, advocate Gunratan Sadavarte and counsel Pradeep Sancheti for another petitioner challenging the reservation said it clearly exceeds a 50% bar laid down by the Supreme Court. They wanted an assurance from the state that till the HC comprehensively hears and passes interim orders in the matter, the state ought not to issue any letter of appointments to members of Maratha community based on the 16% job reservation under socially and educationally backward class, as apart from MPSC they said there over thousand other agencies and government departments including zilla parishads, local bodies and cooperative societies.

A brief hearing had ensued. Thorat first read out the state's affidavit which said that a 'mega recruitment' by Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) which the petitioners questioned will take time as the examination itself is only scheduled on February 17.

""The stage of actual implementation of the impugned statute will arise at the end of the selection process which is bound to take a couple of months,"" said the affidavit by the state's General Administration Department.

Thorat, asked by the court, finally stated, ""till January 23, no appointments will be made under the reservations, in view of the state's affidavit."" The HC had at the last hearing questioned the state's haste and asked what interim arrangements would it make till the PILs are heard.

""The state's general administration department shall issue necessary directions to all local bodies and institutions under its control asking them not to make any appointments under the new legislation till then,"" he said.

The bench raised a query at one point.

""When applying, will the Maratha candidates be applying in the 'open' category or 'reserved'? Meanwhile, two petitions supported the Maratha reservation but said it should be within the OBC category.

Advocate Rajesh Tekale said in 1994 the state sans any commission report had added 100 tribes into OBC.

VM Thorat with daughter-lawyer Pooja Thorat appearing for another petitioner Ajinath Kadam sought the Gaikwad panel report as his case was that the OBC be reduced to accommodate Maratha.

Advocate Satish Maneshinde too sought the report copy. SB Talekar counsel for an intervenor in the matter added, ""It is mandated by law.""

Advocate Mihir Desai said the plea he represented challenged only the extent of the reservation. Yousuf Muchala counsel for a petitioner sought to amend an old plea regarding reservations for Muslims which the state had not pursued."

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination. Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

A building with the words ""Neighborhood Center"" at the top is seen behind barbed wire fences in the Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center in western China's Xinjiang region.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina. The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S. Badger CEO John Anton said that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates, and the U.S. government said Tuesday it was reviewing the reports of forced labor at the factory.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said -- barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees -- or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there -- are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. ""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

Surveillance of Ethnic Minorities in Xinjiang

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training center"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the center is government-operated.

""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility."" Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius , which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,"" said Smith. ""U.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not be importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

Detention Camps in Xi Jinping's China

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Not all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training."" The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

He said the panel will examine the possibility of operating a health insurance scheme in the state directly through a third-party administrator (TPA) by dispensing with the insurer and intermediary, determining the contours of such a scheme and the selection procedure.

The committee, as per the order, has to submit its report by the end of December, the spokesman said.

The panel is being set up two months after Malik had ordered foreclosure of the contract with Reliance General Insurance for implementing the group mediclaim health insurance for the state employees and had asked the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to probe the matter.

The government in September 20 this year had rolled out a group mediclaim health insurance policy for its employees, pensioners and accredited journalists of the state and had a tie-up with Reliance General Insurance for the policy, which was made mandatory for the employees and pensioners.

But on October 25, the governor had cancelled the tie-up with Reliance General Insurance for providing the group medi-claim health insurance policy to employees as there was ""some bungling"" in it.

Two days later on October 27, Malik approved foreclosure of the contract with Reliance General Insurance Company (RGIC) and referred the matter to the newly-established Anti-Corruption Bureau for examining the entire process to see whether it was conducted in a transparent and fair manner.

In a first, the Delhi government has also decided to construct elevated roads under three metro corridors -- Rithala-Bawana-Narela, Janakpuri West-R K Ashram and Mukundpur-Maujpur -- of the total six under the 103-km-long Phase IV.

The approval, given at a cabinet meeting chaired by Kejriwal, comes around two-and-a-half years after it had given in-principle nod to the Phase IV project, which is expected to be completed by 2024.

Briefing reporters about the government's decision, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Siodia said, ""The cabinet has approved the Phase IV of Delhi Metro. It will boost public transport in Delhi.""

Kejriwal took to Twitter and said that after the ""revolutionary changes"" in education, health, water and electricity, there would be changes in transport at a major scale.

The chief minister added that he has a dream of seeing Delhi being counted among the select cities of the world, and every citizen, be it rich or poor, would feel proud of it.

Among the projects chosen under Phase IV are: Rithala-Bawana-Narela (21.73 km, elavated), Janakpuri West-RK Ashram (28.92 km, 21.18-km elevated ), Mukundpur-Maujpur (12.54 km, elevated), Inderlok-Indraprastha (12.58 km, underground), Aero City-Tughlakabad (20.2 km, 5.58-km elevated), Lajpat Nagar-Saket G Block (7.96 km, 5.89-km elevated).

Sisodia said the government would give its share of Rs 9,707 crore towards the construction work under the project, which is estimated to cost around Rs 45,000 crore.

The operating losses, if any, would be shared between the government and the Centre at a ratio of 50:50 for the project.

In the 2018-19 financial year, the government will release Rs 1,100 crore, followed by Rs 1,707.50 crore the next fiscal, Rs 1,773.50 crore in 2020-21, Rs 1,731.50 in 2021-22, Rs 16.2 crore in 2022-23 and Rs 1,208 crore in 2023-24.

The cabinet approved construction of the elevated roads on Rithala-Bawana-Narela, Janakpuri West-RK Ashram and Mukundpur-Maujpur. The corridors will be constructed by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and the entire cost would be borne by the government, Sisodia said.

The Phase-IV project had become a bone of contention between the AAP government and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government as the former did not give its final nod to the project, even after its in-principle approval to the same in February 2016.

The Delhi finance department had submitted its report to the government, saying that some of the proposed corridors were financially ""unviable"".

Following the delay, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had, in October, said: ""We will open a box of sweets only when a formal announcement for the metro Phase-IV project is made.

The lead author of the study was Dr. Huseyin Naci, who is an Assistant Professor of Health Policy at the Department of Health Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), London, UK.

Research proves that systolic blood pressure can be lowered by exercise. The systolic blood pressure is the pressure exerted by the heart while pumping blood out of the heart by contraction of the heart muscles. It represents the top value in a blood pressure reading. However, there are no clinical trials that have directly compared exercise with blood pressure lowering drugs head-to-head, in order to assess which is more effective.

In order to circumvent the above problem, the research team carried out their analyses based on combined data from a large number of clinical trials. The study pooled together data from 194 clinical trials that evaluated the impact of drugs in lowering the systolic blood pressure and 197 clinical trials that evaluated the impact of structured exercise on the same parameter. The total number of subjects in the two combined sets clinical trials (total 391 trials) was 39,742.

The structured exercise regimen was categorized into the following types: The above types of exercises were compared with several classes of blood pressure lowering drugs, based on which the analyses were done. The analyses were based on the following three types of combinations: Since the above analyses were based on trials carried out mostly on young participants having normal blood pressure, the study was repeated in a group of exercise trials that only involved participants having high blood pressure.

The research findings included the following: Some of the major limitations of the study include the following: ""While promising, the findings shouldn't persuade patients to ditch their blood pressure lowering drugs in favor of an exercise regimen just yet, although patients might want to boost their physical activity levels,"" advises Dr. John Ioannidis, the study's senior author, in a linked podcast.

""We don't think, on the basis of our study, that patients should stop taking their antihypertensive medications,"" says Dr. Naci, in a linked podcast.""But we hope that our findings will inform evidence-based discussions between clinicians and their patients,"" he adds.

With reference to prescriptions for exercise to hypertensive patients, there are some issues to consider, he suggests. ""It's one thing to recommend that physicians start prescribing exercise to their patients, but we also need to be cognizant of the resource implications and ensure that the patients that have been referred to exercise interventions can adhere to them and so really derive benefit,"" he emphasizes.

The study was funded by grants from the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the Medical Research Council, UK and the Swiss National Science Foundation.

Program Background

Harvest of the Month (HOM) is a nationwide marketing campaign promoting the use of seasonally available, local products in schools, institutions, and communities. Each month, a different local product is highlighted and participating entities pledge to serve the product and promote it through educational materials and activities. The program launched in California and has been replicated by dozens of other states across the country. With Maine's participation, all of New England will now have Harvest of the Month programs.

Maine Harvest of the Month Background

In its pilot year, Maine's HOM program will develop a unique Maine HOM crop calendar and create corresponding marketing materials and recipes for food service directors and schools to display and utilize. Regional trainings will be delivered to train food service staff and other interested stakeholders on how to best implement the program; support will be provided to schools as needed. The program's goal is to increase the procurement and consumption of local Maine products in schools (K-12), and thus the total number of meals provided. To participate in the program, schools will sign a pledge committing to: serve the local HOM product at least twice per month (local being defined as grown or caught in Maine); display HOM materials provided by the Child Nutrition office; and participate in pre-and post-evaluations. Schools are also encouraged to integrate the HOM into educational activities.

Now CM Kumaraswamy wants the people to help resolve the matter.

Bengaluru: The Karnataka government has been at loggerheads with NGO Akshaya Patra over the question of serving onion and garlic in mid-day meals, and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy is now ready to take the vexed issue to the people's court.

Speaking to ThePrint, Kumaraswamy said he was ready to open the issue for public debate, and let the people decide whether or not they want the ISKCON-run NGO's onion-and-garlic-free food served to their children.

The Akshaya Patra Foundation, a non-profit organisation, is a midday meal partner of the Karnataka government in five districts -- Bengaluru, Mysuru, Ballari, Hubli and Mangaluru.

The Karnataka State Food Commission conducted a survey of government schools, and found that onion and garlic were absent from the meals served at schools where Akshaya Patra was the providing agency. The panel urged for them to be included to make meals tastier and more nutritious.

Akshaya Patra refused, owing to its belief in the Ayurvedic principle of providing 'sattvic' food -- cooked with organic, vegetarian ingredients. Onion and garlic are considered 'tamasic', that is, items that can trigger lethargy and negative emotions.

Naveena Neerada Dasa, ISKCON's head of strategic communication and projects, told ThePrint that it is Akshaya Patra's ""endeavour to promote good health and nutrition"", and that it ""will continue to follow the prescribed norms set by both the state and central government"".

The state government, meanwhile, began facing pressure from civil rights organisations like the Delhi-based Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and the Right to Food Campaign to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra. They insist that Akshaya Patra has no right to decide what food has to be served, and cannot impose ""religious diktats"" on a scheme that embodies one's right to food.

The organisations have also spoken about the question of nutrition, though dieticians say onion and garlic only enhance taste -- their nutritional value can easily be replaced by nuts or fibres of different kinds.

The Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, which oversees the midday meal scheme, does not specify what items are to be provided to children, be it eggs or onion or garlic.

The ministry's guidelines merely state that a primary school child be served food which has a nutritional value of 450 calories -- 12 grams of protein, 100 grams of food grains, 20 grams of pulses, 50 grams of vegetables, 5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

For upper primary schoolchildren, the intake is supposed to be 700 calories -- 20 grams of protein, 150 grams of food grains, 30 grams of pulses, 75 grams of vegetables , 7.5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

The Karnataka government has been reluctant to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra, since the midday meal scheme has helped increase the number of admissions in government schools.

It seems to have decided that the only way this matter can be resolved is if it is opened to public debate, rather than be coerced to take a decision based on the observations of civil rights organisations.

Kumaraswamy has now decided to seek the opinion of various stakeholders, including school teachers, headmasters, food scientists and dieticians, on whether there is an absolute need to add onion and garlic in the food that is being served.

""The question we are raising is whether it would cause any major deficiencies to children if (onion and garlic) are not added to their midday meals. We will be able to take an informed stand only after we receive adequate information on it,"" said Kumaraswamy.

""We will ask food experts, doctors and nutritionists on these aspects, and then take a decision. Let's not rush into any decision.""

While this controversy rages, officials at the Department of Primary and Secondary Education have come up with a new idea to bypass the onion-garlic question and yet enhance children's diet.

Preliminary discussions are on to add fruits to the menu, so that children can have a well-rounded meal.

Sources in the department also said the Mysuru-based Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) has been asked to analyse the nutritional value of onion and garlic, and find if there are alternative fruits or vegetables that can provide the same nutrition."

Now, scientists have developed a non-invasive technique that involves mere flash of a laser light to assess the healing of burn wounds.

The method exploits a particular property of certain tissue proteins - the ability to re-emit light upon absorption. Such proteins, known as tissue fluorophores, have chemical compounds that can re-emit light. Collagen is one such protein that is vital in wound healing. So when a laser light is flashed on tissues during an examination, the amount of re-emitted light from the healing tissue directly corresponds to collagen concentration, which in turn, indicates the status of the recovery process.

Researchers at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) in Karnataka used commercially available 325 nm laser light to inspect healing by exploring tissue fluorophores, and a detector to collect re-emitted light. The re-emitted spectra were recorded using a fibre optic probe kept very close - about three mm - to the wound site. The spectra was then analysed in a spectrograph connected to a computer.

The collagen levels measured by this technique, known as autofluorescence, were validated by biochemical tests of patient tissues. The comparison showed that autofluorescence was consistent and suitable for assessment of burn wound healing. This study also shown tissue collagen can be used as an optical biomarker for assessing burn wound healing, researchers explained. Tissue samples were collected from burn patients admitted to the Department of Plastic Surgery and Burns, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, Karnataka.

Earlier, the technique was used to assess lab-induced wounds in animals. Now, it has been tested in tissue samples from human burn patients suffering from different degree of burn wounds. The tissue formed after the treatment was excised before grafting and utilized for autofluorescence measurement.

""Our technique is user-friendly and solely dependent on excitation and emission of tissue fluorophores without the addition of any external dye molecule. This helps maintain tissue architecture during the assessment of healing,"" Dr Vijendra Prabhu of Department of Biotechnology at the Manipal Institute of Technology, a member of the research team, told India Science Wire.

For clinical management of wounds, periodic evaluation of injured tissue is necessary to know progress of healing. Sometimes wound assessment is done by trained clinicians but it is a subjective method. The other method is to conduct histopathology and biochemical analysis to measure amount of collagen deposited. Repetitive invasive tests can result in fresh wounds and possibility of infection and scarring.

Through autofluorescence technique, collagen information of the tissue can be gathered just 10 to 15 seconds. ""It can provide complementary data conducive to making clinical decisions. After successful testing on clinical samples, we are ready for mass testing on burn wound patients. This system can also be utilized to test collagen disorders in patients,"" Dr Prabhu said."

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination.

Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina.

The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S. Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang.

They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

A child stands near a large screen showing photos of Xi Jinping in Kashgar, western China's Xinjiang region.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories.

Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said -- barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang.

A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees -- or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there -- are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before.

The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang.

""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained.

The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

Buildings are seen around the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux.

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road.

In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign.

They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls.

Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training center"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report.

Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the center is government-operated.

""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience.

Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

CCTV imagery shows trainees working at a garment factory. (CCTV via AP Video, File)

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility.""

Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller.

The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up.

But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory.

In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements.

Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College.

However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years.

He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China.

Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan.

But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments.

The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia.

The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there.

But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump administration on Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,"" said Smith.

""U.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not be importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping.

Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases.

The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Orynbek Koksebek, a former detainee in a Chinese internment camp.

Not all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp.

Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories.

The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks.

Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A police station is seen inside the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls.

The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program.

Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training.""

The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away.

They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp.

He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday.

Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said.

""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

It is bordered by Benin to the west, Niger to the north, Cameroon to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south.

Imports: Machinery; chemicals; transport equipment; manufactured goods; food and live animals

There are five primary forms of companies commonly used by foreign investors:

The minimum number of shareholders for a private company limited by shares is two, while the maximum number of shareholders is 50. In order for a foreign entity to trade in Nigeria it is mandatory that such entity incorporate a company. This is done at the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) situated in the country's capital Nairobi, and is evidenced by a CAC certificate upon the completion of the process. Unlimited liability companies are formed for certain professions which are not permitted to have limited liability.

The following steps need to be taken in order to incorporate a company:

The approximate timeframe will depend on the type of business being set up. A private or public company limited by shares typically takes between 2 to 3 weeks to set up.

Annual general meetings (AGM) are required in Nigeria. AGM's must be held within nine months of the financial year end and not more than 15 months after the previous meeting.

The minimum share capital to incorporate a private limited liability company is approximately USD 55. However, where foreigners will hold shares in the company, there is a minimum investment requirement of approximately USD 55 000 in order for the company to be eligible to apply for a business permit and expatriate quota approval.

The minimum number of directors for any company is 2. Directors can be appointed by the shareholders at incorporation; or by other directors to fill a casual vacancy subject to the ratification of the appointment by the shareholders at the AGM. The appointment of the directors can be done in three to five days.

A Nigerian resident must be appointed as the secretary of the company and all companies. Qualified Nigerian auditors are also required.

Foreigners are allowed to wholly own companies, however certain legislation stipulates mandatory indigenous participation in certain sectors, such as oil and gas and inland water trading. Companies with foreign shareholders are required to apply for a business permit from the Citizenship and Business Department of the Ministry of Interior to enable such company to carry on business in Nigeria.

A branch can be established. A representative office is not authorised to carry on business activities. The process is the same as for trading entities and takes between 2 to 3 weeks to register.

Nigeria currently has no national competition law or policy in place. However, in certain instances specific sector or industry legislation makes provision for competition related aspects.

Further to the paragraph above, competition law is not regulated in Nigeria and there are, accordingly, no specific merger controls in place.

Competition is not regulated in Nigeria and restrictive practices are therefore not regulated.

Owing to the lack of competition regulation in Nigeria, there are no abuse-of-dominance provisions to contend with.

As Nigeria has no competition legislation and/or policy in place, there are no specific sanctions with regard to competition law.

There are various piecemeal legislative provisions in Nigeria which have both a direct and indirect impact on consumer protection. In addition to such legislative provisions there is also the Consumer Protection Council Act, 1992 (CPCA) which is specifically aimed at the enforcement of consumer rights by providing consumers with the appropriate avenues to seek redress.

Some of the key provisions of the CPCA are as follows:

In 2010, the Cyber Security and Information Protection Agency Bill was tabled in Parliament. In terms of which a cyber-security and information protection agency will be established, which will be charged with protecting computer systems and networks, and liaise with the relevant law enforcement agency for the enforcement of cybercrimes laws and related matters. However, to date, no substantial progress has been made in this regard.

However, for the time being, data protection is regulated by the general provisions relating to the protection of privacy as set out in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as well as other relevant legislative provisions. In this respect the following principles apply:

Nigeria is a federation of 36 states, each with its own House of Assembly and laws. The highest court is the Supreme Court of Nigeria which sits above the Court of Appeal; both of these courts have federal jurisdiction. The Federal High Courts and the High Courts of States have concurrent jurisdiction, and the Sharia Court of Appeals and Customary Court of Appeals hear appeals from the lowest courts which are known as Customary, Area and Sharia Courts. The Magistrate's and District Courts hear smaller matters.

It is no longer an inflexible or rigid rule that a plaintiff resident abroad should provide security for costs. Courts must rather exercise discretion with regard to all the circumstances of the case.

The Judge has the discretion to make any order as to costs that he deems fit. In principle, the successful party is entitled to be indemnified for legitimate expenses which he has necessarily incurred by the institution of proceedings, either wholly or partially.

There is a single professional roll for all legal professionals that include both barristers and solicitors.

The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1990 provides authority for the conduct of arbitrations and is modelled closely upon the UNCITRAL model law and its rules. The Constitution empowers the Chief Judge of each state to make practice directives for the incorporation of ADR into the civil procedure, which has resulted in certain states emphasizing ADR in the pre-trial stages. The Nigerian branch of the London based Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators Nigeria, and the Lagos Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration have all handled high profile arbitrations, while the Lagos Chamber Arbitration Centre (LAC), the Society of Construction Industry Arbitrators (SCIArb), the Maritime Arbitrators of Nigeria, and the Negotiation and Conflict Management Group (NCMG) all also handle arbitrations. Nigeria is a party to the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards.

A contract of employment must be given within 3 months of commencement.

There are certain exchange control regulations in Nigeria. A foreign investor may invest in any enterprise or securities with foreign currency or capital imported into Nigeria through an authorised dealer (a licensed bank).

An investor will be issued with a Certificate of Capital Importation (CCI) by the authorised dealer through which the capital is imported into Nigeria.

The CCI typically entitles the foreign investor to open a foreign currency domiciliary account with any authorised dealer for investment purposes, open a special non-resident Nigerian Dollar (Naira) account to which could be credited all receipts from the capital inflows, proceeds from sale of securities, dividends and interests.

Furthermore, to invest in securities in Nigeria out of the balances in the Naira account and repatriate the capital, capital gains, dividends and income received by way of interests through authorised dealers which are subject to deductions of taxes.

Resident companies are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident companies are taxed on profits derived from Nigeria, to the extent that profits are not attributable to operations outside of Nigeria.

Income tax, capital gains tax, tertiary education tax, petroleum profits tax and dividends tax are payable.

Both resident and non-resident companies are taxed at 30% except for petroleum profits tax, which for resident petroleum companies is at a rate of 85%.

CGT is at a rate of 10% on resident and non-resident companies and individuals. Dividends are taxed at 10%. Interest and rent are taxed at 10% on both resident and non-resident companies and individuals.

Royalties are taxed at 10% on royalties earned by resident companies and 5% on royalties earned by resident individuals and non-resident individuals and companies. There is a tax of 10% on consultancy fees and management fees.

Directors are taxed at 10% on director's fees earned by resident individuals.

Nigeria has entered into double taxation agreements with the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Pakistan, Canada, Romania, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Philippines, Japan, China, South Africa and Italy (shipping and air transportation only)."

Prabhu was responding to a tweet by Manipal Global Education Chairman Mohandas Pai, who had asked for urgent government intervention to resolve the matter.

Several startups have been raising concerns about being sent notices demanding tax on angel funds under Section 56 of the Income Tax Act.

Section 56 of the IT Act is used to tax the excess income a company receives from charging a greater than fair market price for shares it issues.

Previously in April, the Centre had allowed startups to claim tax concessions if the total funding they received, including from angel investors, was within Rs 10 crores.

To avail such concessions, startups are required to receive certification from an eight-member inter-ministerial board.

""Notices issued on angel tax to startups may be for those that are not recognised by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP),"" speculated an income tax officer.

Angel Investors are those individual's who invest their personal funds in startups. As per rules of the Commerce and Industry Ministry, an angel investor is required to have a minimum net worth of Rs 2 crore rupees, or an average returned income exceeding Rs 25 lakhs in the three previous financial years."

The plan was set in motion by the then Pune municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar and a consortium of three companies- Prasanna Desai Architects, CEE (Centre for Environment Education) and ITrans was commissioned to prepare the bicycle plan for Pune.

The first-of-its-kind bicycle plan was then launched as part of the Smart City mission project first at Savitribai Phule Pune University, and later at Aundh where bicycle tracks were integrated into the Urban street design along with wide footpaths.

Two more cycle tracks are getting ready on JM road, Ganeshkhind road (Bremen chowk to University circle) and Satara road.

The plan has, however, lost momentum and is suffering from poor implementation.

The expensive red paint used to segregate the cycle tracks at Aundh has been completely worn out and the tracks are found encroached upon by four-wheelers rather than being used by cyclists. Recently, the civic body has diverted Rs50 crore meant for the bicycle plan, out of the Rs55 crore, to pay for water charges to the state irrigation department.

""As there was a need to repay money to the irrigation department, the standing committee diverted the amount of Rs 50 crore from budgetary head of cycle infrastructure,"" said Yogesh Mulik, standing committee chairman.

Srinivas Bonala, chief engineer (projects) said, the plan will not be implemented in parts of the city where it is overlapping with the 24x7 water works scheme. Hence, the PMC has decided to wait till the water supply department completes its work.

""This was a four year plan which has been delayed that is because of the water works department,"" he said.

According to Sanskriti Menon, senior programme director, centre for environment education, who is closely associated with the project, the establishment of a bicycle department which has had meetings with the road department and traffic police to get the work underway; the roll-out of the public bicycle sharing scheme; the identification of 800 cycle parking spots in the city and the creation of three newly designed cycle tracks are among the successes of the scheme.

According to her, the cycle plan needs better implementation. Improvements needed include preventing encroachments, especially by motorcycles on cycle tracks and cycle parking, for which PMC and traffic police department must put in place regular fining, a cycle warden patrol and CCTV; fine tune the designs of the new cycle tracks, especially continuity at junctions and placement of bollards to prevent motorised twowheelers. The bicycle department also needs a full-time bicycle planner and support staff to work with the head of the department to ensure that infrastructure works and all the recommendations of the plan are taken up.

Prior to this plan, nearly 300 kilometres of cycle tracks had been laid out at a cost of ₹100 crore. However, the plan failed miserably as it was not user-friendly and the cycle tracks suffered from encroachments.

What is needed is an aggressive drive - from residents and civic authorities- to bring it back on track."

This information was provided by Medical Education Minister D K Shivakumar to the Legislative Council during the ongoing winter session in Belagavi.

He said the government is considering increasing the annual fee for undergraduate courses from the existing Rs 17,000 to Rs 50,000, and for post-graduate courses from the existing Rs 50,000 to Rs 3 lakh. There are 16 government medical colleges in the state. This will mean a 194 per cent hike and the reason given by the minister for this steep increase is to meet the fund requirements of the government colleges pertaining to the quality of education and extending the facilities to the employees at the colleges.

Besides, the minister said that the government is considering providing admission to Non-Resident Indian (NRI) students at state government medical colleges from the academic year 2019-20. Shivakumar revealed this in the House while replying to a question from MLC S V Sankanur during Question Hour. He added, ""The move to consider NRI quota in government colleges is a major decision.""

He further said that the Department of Medical Education had sought additional grants from the Finance Department for implementing the National Pension Scheme (NPS) for college employees recruited after 2006. ""The Provident Fund scheme has not been extended to employees of government medical colleges and we need to do it,"" he said.

Students oppose move

The minister's proposal to increase the fee and also to admit NRI students has been met with opposition from students and other stakeholders. According to faculty members, it is not a good move. A senior faculty member from Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute said, ""Giving admissions under NRI quota at government colleges will do injustice to meritorious students from the state. This will reduce the number of seats at government colleges made available to general category students."" Gautham Balaji, member of Indian Medical Association (Karnataka branch), said, ""When it comes to the fee hike, it is acceptable as private colleges charge lakhs for undergraduate courses.

These organizations also employ diverse strategies that would assist in their growth practices with the minimum financial output. One of these strategies is fixed-term employment, which refers to the appointment of staff who offers services for a pre-determined period of time, depending on the arrangement made between the individual and the employer.

Similarly, the Higher Education Department have opted to make use of an alternative method of staffing, infamously known and called as CONTRACTUAL. As the cost of employing staff members on a permanent basis leads to increased costs, the appointment of these academic arrangement staff members on fixed-term employment contracts incorporates limited benefits, thereby limiting costs to the department. This option has been financially advantageous to this organization, but it has a negative impact on the job satisfaction of the employees, due to lack of job security and long-term career vision among other factors. Although these staff members play an important role in the overall functioning, success and survival of the educational institutions, their needs and levels of job satisfaction has often been ignored.

Since the nineteenth century, motivational researchers in the field of employee satisfaction have explained the importance of fulfilling the needs of employees in establishing a productive and satisfied workforce, e.g., Affect Theory by Locke, the Hierarchy of Needs by Maslow, the Dispositional Theory by Judge, Two-Factor theory by Herzberg, the Job Characteristic Model by Hackman and Oldman, etc. According to research that was conducted by the Harvard Professional Group (1998), job satisfaction can be seen as the sense of achievement and success that is experienced by an employee at the place of employment. It continues by stating that job satisfaction is the main ingredient that leads the employee towards the attainment of set goals such as recognition, better income structure, promotion to a better position, as well as achievement of other objectives that will ultimately lead to a higher level of motivation and fulfillment.

Experts have emphasized the hampering effect that fixed-term employment conditions may have on job satisfaction of staff and have identified underlying uncertainties and frustrations among fixed-term contract staff members and the challenge of keeping those staff members committed to their academic task.It has been found that the employees who have a permanent employment contract tend to experience a much higher level of job satisfaction than those employees with a fixed-term contract and this can have a negative influence on the motivation and productivity of these employees. The lack of formal support from the middle management, the prejudiced perceptions of permanent contract staff members, as well as the negative effect of this kind of appointment on the career paths of these staff members are some of the major reasons for individuals being shy from this type of appointment.

The rising unemployment and lack of alternatives have left no choice for the candidates in our context. The use of fixed-term employees allows flexibility to the educational institutions as the number of lecturers can be increased or decreased according to their need. But there is also rise to a number of managerial challenges on different levels within these institutions. The tension and paradoxes are evident in the relationship between the organizations human resource approach and fixed-term contract employment strategies. Academic arrangement employees working on fixed-term contract are unhappy about the employment conditions and with lack of support from the management. Subsequently the already existing tension between the state administration and this human resource is aggravated.

Given the context of a fragmented and distraught socio-political milieu, there are other factors which contribute to the degradation of these employees. Rampant corruption; degraded ethics on political and social level to torture the weaker;and lack of professional ethics have led to the discrimination and degradation of these employees.The state political actors have not been able to show any permanent stand. Being deceitful to safeguard their own interests they have sometimes labeled theseemployees as inefficient, incapable, and even ineligible which seems to be scapegoating for their own incapability and inefficiency.

Among these employees the new entrants fulfill the current eligibility criteria fixed by the respective managing bodies. Being highly qualified their awards, achievements and teaching at these institutions proves their ability and efficiency. Those employees who are labeled as ineligible (given the changes in eligibility criteria) have fulfilled their eligibility at the time of their entrance into this type of employment. Eligibility criteria depend upon the need of the time. Their counterparts in the permanent contract employees are respected for their experience and are supervising the new entrants coming with higher qualifications and are called as seniors. But the employees on the fixed-term contracts have been rewarded as ineligible for their years of experience, work commitment and continuous investment.

When the fact seems to be that, it is the state administrative failure which couldn't come with any concrete policy to absorb these employees. It is the inefficiency and ineligibility of the human resource management who seem to adopt the Machiavellianism approach, where on the one hand they take the services from these employees on the other hand doesn't even consider them as employees. Their level of participation and recognition is almost none in other activities within these institutions. When there is need, these employees are threatened for disengagement for not taking the demanded tasks and when it is otherwise they are pushed out of the other related service activities, e.g., evaluation, supervision, institution up gradation and development activities, training and orientation courses, etc. Being labeled as inefficient and ineligible, the service of conveying knowledge is made possible through the fixed-term academic staff members.

Given the present social context, where dignity is awarded on the basis of money and power, it adds more to the discrimination and degradation of these staff members especially the female staff, where no considerations are given to the gender issues when it comes to fixed-term contract female employee. The level of job satisfaction experienced by the academic staff members is crucial to the output of qualified and equipped students. It is very important that the authorities and the management of the educational institutions implement policies and procedures to ensure that the levels of job satisfaction experienced by the staff members are high.

There is lack of knowledge and poor management practices regarding this staff category. Motivation and job satisfaction begin with leadership that builds or affirms the people and their value to the institution. So the needs of these staff members must be taken into consideration.

Financial and non-financial motivators are determinants. Feeling of working on something worthwhile and working for a good and reliable organization, where sensitivity towards a work-life balance prevails contributes to motivation and job satisfaction. The system that doesn't take employee needs and quality of life into account, are mainly beaurocratic and task-oriented and don't take personal and interpersonal relationships in a balanced life into account.

The Higher Education Department functions within a set organizational structure having different but interrelated management levels. There must be a specific understanding and delegation of authority and subsequent responsibility within an organization. The concept of authority goes hand in hand with responsibility, and the person higher in the hierarchy will have more responsibility and will be answerable ultimately. The management structure must be made aware of new trends and challenges, which is of utmost importance. If the basic assumptions, goals and objectives of the organization stay the same, no progress will be made and there will be stagnation, and our higher educational institutions are the best example of this stagnation.

Here the management applies the Theory-X (hard approach; ""we versus they"" approach)of human work motivation on fixed-term contract employees and Theory-Y (soft approach; Democratic approach) on permanent-contract employees. Whereas the world is constantly developing, they have moved beyond the Theory-Z (optimal managerial style - cultivating moral and ethical excellence), indicating our backwardness, ignorance, and lack of professional ethics.

When it comes to management even the Scientific Management or Taylorism was considered obsolete by 1930's and a new classical approach known as Human Relations Approach was emphasized. The management should have good human skills. The organization must fulfill their staff's higher order psychological needs. But in this part of the world,we are not able to fulfill even the basic level needs of these staff members.

Employees can be all fired up about their work or can be made working hard. However, if the results of their work do not contribute to the organization and ultimately to the community, then the organization is not any better than if the employees were sitting on their hands and maybe even worse. And this applies to all whether permanent contract employees or the fixed-term contract employees. An organization is only as strong as the individuals associated with it. The higher educational institutions were totally dependent on fixed-term contract staff members till recent recruitment of permanentstaff members. These posts in majority were also filled by the individuals who had been working as fixed-term contract employees. If these candidates are labeled as inefficient and ineligible, it will indicate that the administration and the management are corrupted and are cheating the public. When the fact is that, this staffing trend is increasing given the demand and the lack of resources on part of the educational institutions. Further it can be asserted that the rapid increase of fixed-term lecturers at higher education institutions can be attributed to the relative absence of employment regulation, declining resources with rapid expansion of student enrollments. These factors combine to encourage numerical flexibility with rapid recruitment and the use of cheap and disposable employees given the unemployment and lack of alternative choices to the candidates.

The Human Resource Management division of an organization is directly involved in the implementation of the strategies that are decided by the higher levels. This division must be functional in every institution. It is imperative that this department, which is an integral link between staff members and the management structure of the educational institutions, keep the best interests of both the staff members as well as the organization in mind. The situations need to be managed in order to ensure the continuation of the person as well as the organization otherwise there will further increase in the social problems and disturbances. The number of fixed-term contract employees at various institutions exceeds the number of permanent contract employees. The administrative decisions must be made. There must be policies for these employees in order to ensure their job security and a better quality of life which inturn will lead to the betterment of the society.

The fixed-term lecturers'account for a higher of the overall workforce of higher educational institutions, but no attention is being paidneither by the administration nor by the management into whether these staff members are satisfied with the roles they have, their responsibilities or the rewards they receive.It has been found that the fixed-term lectures often bring first-hand knowledge and experience to the classroom andmany of the fixed-term lecturers bring with them significant awards and experiences. The growing numbers as well as the relative permanence of these lecturers at higher educational institutions show that these institutions rely heavily on the services of these fixed-term contract lecturers and they are imperative to the success of the academic environment.

It is observed that these teachers have been neglected when compared to their permanent counterparts in terms of support and policy. This has resulted in the feelings of being ""at the margin"" amongst them. The administration as well as the management must honestly accept this undeniable fact and must make this human resource feel that ""they matter"" and not that they work ""just to fill the gaps"". Job insecurity; very low salaries with no access to resources and benefits; and no long-term employment options available to themhas resulted in a very strong dissatisfaction with their job environments. Thus, it influences their levels of job satisfaction, and ultimately, the productivity of these lecturers and the higher educational institutions as a whole, which indicates the failure on part of the institutional management and the state administration."

The commission is chaired by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.

""From day one of her tenure, Betsy DeVos has sought to undermine the safety, dignity and civil rights of students of color, LGBTQ students, students with disabilities and survivors of sexual assault,"" said David Stacy, HRC's Director of Government Affairs. ""While the revocation of this guidance would not change federal civil rights laws, this dangerous action would embolden discriminatory practices that push students of color, including LGBTQ students of color, out of the classroom. It is particularly outrageous to utilize a commission tasked with addressing gun violence in schools as a tool to undermine protections for students of color -- and HRC will continue to fight alongside civil rights and education advocates to stop this administration's harmful agenda and protect the civil rights of all students.""

Schools are prohibited from discriminating against students based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion or disability. Despite these laws, discrimination is rampant in the administration of school discipline. Data collected by the Department of Education clearly shows that black students are suspended and expelled three times more often than white students, and students with disabilities are twice as likely to be suspended or expelled as students without disabilities.

In 2014, the Obama Administration's Department of Education issued guidance reminding schools that they must administer discipline policies in a non-discriminatory manner, and it provided resources to help schools ensure they are providing an equal opportunity for all students.

In March, HRC, along with other leading national LGBTQ organizations, sent a letter to DeVos urging her to keep the 2014 guidance in place.

LGBTQ students also face disproportionate levels of unfairly harsh school discipline practices. According to a study from GLSEN, two thirds of LGBTQ students have experienced some form of discipline, compared to less than half of non-LGBTQ students. Students with multiple marginalized identities, including LGBTQ students of color and LGBTQ students with disabilities, are particularly at risk for being subject to exclusionary school discipline. An HRC survey of more than 12,000 LGBTQ youth found that Black and African American, Native American and Alaska Native, and multiracial respondents reported being expelled from school at more than twice the rate of white respondents. Black and African American respondents also reported receiving out-of-school suspensions at three times the rate of white respondents.

Although the guidance rescinded today does not explicitly talk about LGBTQ students, they are disproportionately impacted by these policies. The consequences of exclusionary school discipline can be devastating to young people, especially those who may already face marginalization in school, their communities and even at home. Students experiencing exclusionary school discipline lose critical instruction time and are often pushed out of school, which can lead to involvement with the juvenile justice system or homelessness.

Fabio Rambelli, Department Chair, wrote back ""...our syllabi are proprietary materials...We are therefore unable to provide you with that information"". Others either did not respond or expressed their inability.

Zed points out that a posting in the Department's Twitter account described goddess Kali as ""wild, violent, and sensual""; while she is widely worshipped in Hinduism and personifies Sakti or divine energy. She is considered the goddess of time and change. Some Bengali poets described her as supreme deity.

Trivializing a highly revered Hindu deity and then refusing to divulge what was being taught in the course was highly inappropriate for a public university like UCSB, which claimed to be a ""leading center for teaching and research"" and number five public university; Rajan Zed noted, and added that Hindus were seeking an official apology from UCSB.

Zed further said that Hinduism was the oldest and third largest religion of the world with about 1.1 billion adherents and a rich philosophical thought and it should not be taken frivolously. Symbols of any faith, larger or smaller, should not be mishandled, Zed stated.

UCSB, founded in 1891 and spread across over 1,000 acres of California coast; enrolls 24,346 students, offers over 200 majors-degrees-credentials; and boasts of six Nobel laureates, over 60 Guggenheim Fellows, and home to 10 national institutes and centers. It claims to be a ""a learning and living environment like no other"".

Its Religious Studies Department, established in 1964, claims to be the ""largest religion department in the University of California system, and one of the most diverse religion departments in the world""

""RG ST 62 Dark Goddesses/Black Madonnas"", a Fall 2018 undergraduate class, showed up ""full"" on UCSB website."

The move comes after a wall collapsed in Noida's New KM Public School in Salarpur village, killing two children and injuring three students. The BSA said they will demolish all unsafe government school buildings and identify illegal private schools to close them down.

""We have written to block education officers to ensure that the private agencies are selected in each village to demolish unsafe government school buildings and construct new ones. The private agencies that will build the new school buildings will be finalised through an open auction in the respective villages. Earlier, due to technical reasons, we could not hire private agencies to reconstruct government schools,"" Balmukund Prasad, BSA, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.

According to officials, there are several government primary and middle schools in various villages across the district that are operating in old, unsafe buildings.

The education department has also written to the block education officer in Dankaur to inspect private schools and shut them down if they are violating norms.

As per the education department, there are 174 illegal schools in the Gautam Budh Nagar district. Over two lakh students study in these schools, that are housed in illegal buildings with no safety measures in place, officials said.

""After a 2017-18 survey, we identified 174 illegal schools in district. Most of them were shut down. Now, to identify more illegal schools, we have formed two teams that will submit monthly reports. The allegations of parents that we were aware of all illegal schools operating in the district are false and baseless,"" Prasad said.

""The block education officer needs to inspect Children's Academy in Chhijarsi; Dayanand Public School, Bahlolpur; Vivek Vidyapeeth, Chhijarsi; Gyandeep School in Chotpur, HI Public School in Chhijarsi; Geeta Public School in Chhijarsi; Jagriti Public School in Chhijarsi and Naveen Gyan Hari Singh Public School. If these schools are illegal, then we will shut them down immediately,"" Prasad added.

The other schools that are to be inspected by the education department are CBSE Public School, Prayag Public School and Sai Public School in Yakubpur village; and Royal Public School, Gayatri Public School and Beena Public School in Sadarpur village.

Pradeep Yadav, whose son was killed when New KM Public School's wall collapsed on Monday, said,""If these 174 schools were illegal and unsafe for children, then why did the education department not act earlier. We demand that the UP government file an FIR against education department officials for laxity.""

Prasad said,""Parents are responsible for checking whether schools are approved or not before they admit their wards. We have decided to seek information from the public about schools they think are illegal as well. We will inspect them and take appropriate action.""

According to him, there are nearly 1,000 legal schools in the district, including private and government schools."

New Delhi: For long, the pheran, a traditional long cloak worn by both women and men, has been a quintessential part of the Kashmiri winter. That, however, hasn't protected it from controversy over the years.

The latest row involving the pheran came last Tuesday, when the Jammu and Kashmir education department's Langate office issued a circular banning its officials from wearing the garment on official visits to the office.

It was later withdrawn after a furore with even former chief minister Omar Abdullah, known to wear the pheran, weighing in. ""My father and I have worn pherans to official functions many times over the years and will continue to do so, silly government orders notwithstanding,"" Omar had tweeted, with the hashtags #dontbanourpheran and #revokepheranban.

But this isn't the first time that there has been a controversy over the garment, which is synonymous with the Valley. The pheran went through a turbulent phase during a dark period in Jammu and Kashmir.

At the peak of militancy, young Kashmiris wearing a pheran suddenly began being viewed suspiciously. As the security scenario worsened, those wearing a pheran, which is usually stitched loose in order to let the traditional fire pot, Kangri, to be carried inside it during chilly winter days, began to attract attention from security forces.

The forces suspected that militants could use the garment for carrying arms in 1990s. Although there was no ban then, it made the people wary.

Thus the period in the 1990s led to the decline of the pheran being worn outside the home. It, however, continued to remain the favourite attire to be worn at home.

In the last six to seven years, the pheran has made a comeback with modern fits and designs, closely resembling overcoats. It has become fashionable winter wear with people even wearing it to office these days.

The latest controversy was sparked by the education department circular dated 11 December which has since been revoked.

""All officials visiting the office are advised to visit in proper dress code during any official visit,"" reads the circular issued on December 11, by Zonal Educational Officer (ZEO) Langate Agha Abdul Rashid. ""It is recommended that no official will visit this office wearing pheran, traditional trousers and sleeper/plastic shoes.""

The Langate region is in North Kashmir.

While the ban has been revoked, local reports say that in the state civil secretariat the pheran is on the list of ""barred items"" that need to be removed near the security gate."

As per the inquiry, the school head, education department officials and the doctors who examined the girl did not report the matter to the police. Copies of the letters are with TOI.

In November, TOI had reported that the commission has refrained itself from recommending action against the persons in question for delay in reporting the case as suggested in the Juvenile Justice Act and had left it to the concerned authorities to decide the punishment. Notably, this is the first time that the child rights commission has shown leniency in a serious case and not recommended FIR against every person from doctors to school heads and education department officials who did not report the matter to the police as per the Act suggests.

As per the information, this was done because the school authorities were found to be unaware about the law that applied in such a case.

In 2015, CCPCR had acted the other way and recommended FIR against the school management of a private Chandigarh school for delaying to report the molestation case of a pre-primary student. The conductor of the school bus had molested a kindergarten student in the bus. Recently, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed a lower court to proceed against a the school principal who had failed to act even after knowing about the molestation.

The JJ Act states under Section 19 (1) that any person who has the apprehension that an offence is likely to be committed or has the knowledge that an offence has been committed, should bring the incident to the notice of the special juvenile police unit or the local police. The failure to report such an offence is punishable with imprisonment or fine or both.

Failing to report the commission of an offence under Section 19 (1) or failing to record such offence under section 19 (2) is punishable under Section 21

(2) which states that any person, being in-charge of any company or an institution (by whatever name called) who fails to report the commission of an offence in respect of a subordinate under his control, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year and with fine.

When 78-year-old Shyamala (name changed) had a heart attack in the middle of the night, there was no one around to help. Shyamala was widowed, and had no children. ""She was wailing from pain all night, but no one heard her. At around 5 am, neighbours came over, and Shyamala had to crawl up to the door to open it,"" says Shyamala's former neighbour G Ramachandra.

Shyamala's condition was critical, and the neighbours took her to a hospital where she was operated on. But afterwards, Shyamala was worried of living alone again. She has since been staying at the Nightingales Elders Enrichment Centre (NEEC) in Malleswaram. NEEC offers living facility for elders who are relatively healthy; it's is also a day centre for seniors to get together and do activities. The elders who live here get meals, and the help of assistants for daily activities like bathing.

Shyamala's case is one among that of thousands of elderly in the city who have chronic health issues, but have difficulty getting care. While Shyamala was able to afford the cost of living at NEEC - Rs 900 per day - this would be unthinkable for the majority of elderly who are on their own.

The population of elderly in India has been rising steeply due to improved life expectancy, but there are no systems to deal with their needs. As per the 2011 Census, 8.6% of India's population - 104 million people - are senior citizens, i.e., those above the age of 60. Of them, 11 million are aged above 80 years.

The elderly are mostly affected by chronic illnesses like diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, which require continuing medication and care. A recent study showed that around 18% of elderly men and 26% of elderly women in India have disability because of chronic diseases. They have difficulty or inability doing daily activities of walking, toileting and dressing. Disability was most prevalent among the elderly who weren't currently married, those aged above 80 years, and those with low income and education. The study was based on data from the India Human Development Survey, 2011-12.

The survey implies that many seniors need the support of their family members just to go to a healthcare facility. Financial dependence is also an issue. N Murthy Rao, Vice President of the Federation of Senior Citizens Forum of Karnataka, says, ""Very few seniors get pension from a former government job. Seniors aged above 70 years have restrictions in getting health insurance too. Only a small percentage have it, mostly by being covered in the family insurance plan of their child."" While insurance premiums generally increase with age, it has become even more expensive for the elderly in recent years.

Karnataka government's Sandhya Suraksha scheme gives old age pension of only Rs 600 per month for disadvantaged elderly. The city's destitute are unable to afford continuing medication with this amount, says Rekha Murthy, Karnataka Head of the NGO HelpAge India, that supplies free medicines to the elderly in the city's slums. In this year's budget speech, Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy announced that the pension would be hiked to Rs 1000 starting November.

Seniors have to depend on their children for healthcare, but many face abuse from children themselves. A 2018 survey by HelpAge India among 218 elderly Bengalurians found that a quarter of them had faced abuse at home. Of those who faced abuse, 73% said they had faced disrespect, 52% had faced neglect, and a small percentage experienced verbal, physical or economic abuse. The survey was held among mostly the ""young-old"" seniors, aged 60-69 years. The reasons for abuse were that the children wanted to live independently, didn't like the elder person's way of living, financial issues etc.

Of the seniors who faced abuse, only one-fifth had confided about the issue to a relative or friend. Hardly anyone had reported the issue to the police or an association. Most elders didn't know how to deal with the issue or wanted to keep the family matter confidential.

Data from the city's Elder Helpline 1090 also shows that many elderly face abuse from their family members. In 2017-18, the helpline got over 15,500 calls. The caller usually registers a complaint only if his issue is not resolved by other means like conciliation, counselling etc. There were 468 written complaints in 2017-18, of which half were about being harassed or cheated by one's own family members. This includes cases where children don't give maintenance to parents even while living with them.

Gurmeet Randhawa, Managing Trustee of Karunashraya, a Trust that gives free palliative care to terminally ill cancer patients in the city, says that they do get many elderly in-patients because the family lacks the time and ability to provide care.

""With the transition to the nuclear families, the elderly lack a support system. Unlike earlier, family members also have lesser attachment with the elderly person. But there are also cases where the family goes out of their way to care for the elder,"" he says. There are also extreme cases of abandonment - every year, the Trust gets 10-12 in-patients who were abandoned by their families in hospitals. Overall, Karunashraya provides in-patient care to about 1400 people a year, and home-based care to 70-80 patients at any time.

Randhawa says that senior citizens who live just with their spouse face more challenges accessing healthcare. ""The logistics of going to a healthcare facility, one spouse having to manage the house while also caring for the unwell spouse, are all challenges. This section of elderly population is increasing as more youth are going abroad for jobs or living separately,"" he says.

Also, like Shyamala, there are some 15 million elders in India who live alone, three-fourths of them women, as per 2011 Census.

Even in cases where children care well for their elderly parents, there are challenges. In case of chronic illnesses, especially those like dementia and advanced cancer where the patient's condition only deteriorates further, the caregiver suffers tremendous physical and emotional strain. Carers, who are most often women, also end up quitting jobs or shifting to part-time jobs.

As per the Dementia India Report 2010, the average cost of caring for a person with dementia was Rs 1.4 lakh annually, as of 2010. The cost would be much higher now. Carers tend to develop depressive disorders and physical ailments as well. A study among 179 carers of people with dementia, cited in the report, had found that 60% of the carers had developed mental health issues.

All these point to a high need for government support in elder care, even in cases where children do care for ageing parents. In many developed countries, there is high investment in elder care. UK government, for example, facilitates home care providers whose services can range from help with domestic work to full-time nursing care. These services - either paid for by the family or funded by the local council - ensure that the elderly person stays comfortable in their familiar home environment, and that the carer gets support. There are also provisions for free equipments, and free nursing care in a care home for those who qualify.

In India, there are no such services yet. During an acute illness, the elderly person may be admitted to a hospital, but there are no facilities for long-term care after discharge. The central government's National Institute for Social Defense (NISD) currently has programmes to train home nurses for elder care. But the number of people trained are minuscule compared to the demand. Hence, most home nurses currently come from the informal/unorganised sector, with little skills and training.

The cost of employing a full-time home nurse is also unaffordable for many families. Except a few organisations like Karunashraya and Nightingales Medical Trust, there are hardly any care homes as well in Bengaluru.

Even though healthcare needs increase with age, there is little focus on geriatric medicine - the specialty that focuses on preventing and treating diseases in the elderly. Currently, only a handful of corporate hospitals in Bengaluru, like Manipal and Apollo, have dedicated geriatric wings; the majority of private and government hospitals don't.

Dr Anoop Amarnath, Chairman of Geriatric Medicine at Manipal Hospitals, says that the lack of trained geriatricians is the main reason for the severe shortage of geriatric facilities. ""There are only a couple of medical colleges in the country that offer an MD in geriatrics. In MBBS also, there's no separate course on geriatrics; there are only a few chapters that mention it,"" says Dr Amarnath. In contrast, in western countries, geriatrics is part of basic medical training, and there are postgraduate courses - like geriatric nephrology - that offer specialisation within geriatrics.

Dr Amarnath says knowledge of geriatric medicine is important for doctors, since it affects outcomes for the patient. Diagnosis and treatment varies for the elderly. ""Manifestation of a disease may be different in the elderly. For eg., a young person with urinary infection will have only regular symptoms, but an elderly person may develop delirium or unconsciousness.""

Also, in case of the elderly, multiple organs are affected, and the treatment can't be as aggressive as in the case of youth. ""In the elderly, multiple organs are usually involved, with multiple issues. The treatment that's good for one organ need not be good for another. Also, aggressive treatment may not be appropriate - a young person with diabetes will be required to control his sugar levels tightly, but it's not to be treated the same way in an elderly person,"" says Dr Amarnath, who was part of the Karnataka Knowledge Commission team that submitted recommendations on elder care to the state government.

Indian government does have a National Programme for the Health Care of Elderly (NPHCE), launched in 2010. But the execution of this programme has lagged severely.

Under the project, 20 medical colleges in the country would be developed as Regional Geriatric Centres, and Bangalore Medical College is one of them. Dr Satish H S, Director cum Dean at the medical college, says that geriatric Out Patient Department (OPD) is already functional here, and that a 30-bedded geriatric ward will start functioning in a couple of months.

However, NPHCE has not been implemented in Bangalore district. Under NPHCE, there will be separate geriatric wards and OPDs in district hospitals; PHCs and CHCs will have geriatric clinics. Also, health workers at sub-centres will visit the elderly at their home and arrange supportive devices. The idea is to provide healthcare to all sections of the elderly, focusing on prevention and on management of chronic diseases. So far, only a few districts in Karnataka have piloted NPHCE.

For now, the government machinery is almost nonexistent in supporting healthcare needs of the elderly."

The Development: The OIG published the names of two health care entities that it deemed ""high risk"" as a result of their refusal to enter into CIAs.

Looking Ahead: False Claims Act (""FCA"") defendants will need to address what will likely be increased pressure to enter into a CIA when negotiating an FCA settlement, but challenges to the OIG''s new approach are likely.

As part of the settlement process in an FCA case, the OIG often will separately seek to impose a CIA on the settling party. Although the OIG has no statutory authority to require a CIA, it is typically presented as an alternative to possible exclusion from participation in federal health care programs or to the OIG's unilateral monitoring. The requirements under a CIA vary depending on the conduct alleged, but they usually include the engagement of an independent review organization to perform periodic audits, required training and education (in addition to any training and education already conducted by the entity), and annual reporting and certification to the OIG. The typical CIA lasts five years, which can be costly and burdensome even for organizations with a mature compliance program.

On September 27, 2018, the OIG released notice of its ""Fraud Risk Indicator"" webpage. The OIG announced it planned to use the Fraud Risk Indicator to publicize an ""assessment of future risk"" posed by health care entities that are subject to the OIG's permissive exclusion authority (most often where the entity settled an FCA case with the Department of Justice (""DOJ"")), but did not agree to a CIA.

The OIG also explained that it would assess entities based on its previously published ""risk spectrum"" in the OIG's nonbinding criteria for implementing its exclusion authority. Categories of risk vary from highest risk, which can result in exclusion, to low risk, which typically covers entities that self-disclose. According to the 2016 guidance, the OIG weighs various factors to determine where an FCA defendant falls on that spectrum, including the nature and circumstances of the alleged conduct, cooperation during government' investigation, corrective measures taken, and history of compliance.

This new initiative is designed to address what the OIG states are ""relatively rare circumstances,"" where an entity has declined to enter into an integrity agreement as part of settlement. That decision may increase the risk of additional scrutiny by agencies following the settlement, such as the initiation of unilateral monitoring or an audit by the OIG or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. With the OIG's new Fraud Risk Indicator, that risk may further increase as the OIG deems certain entities as ""high risk.""

Indeed, on November 6, 2018, the OIG published the names of the first entities that the OIG designated as ""high risk"" based on each entity's decision not to enter into a CIA. The OIG not only identified the entities' names, but also the date of relevant settlement agreements, the city and state where the entity is located, and a link to the DOJ's press release regarding the settlement. The press release further broadcasted the OIG's determination that ""the companies pose a continuing high risk to the Federal health care programs and their beneficiaries.""

The OIG's Fraud Risk Indicator comes more than two years after the 2016 exclusion guidance was released, but on the heels of an April 2018 U.S. Government Accountability Office Report that found that the total number of CIAs in effect had decreased by 44 percent between 2006 and 2016.

In a recent Bloomberg article, the OIG's chief counsel was quoted as saying that the purpose of the Fraud Risk Indicator is to promote transparency but also acknowledged the OIG would welcome any behavioral changes resulting from the public listing. Notably, entities that enter into FCA settlement agreements historically have not admitted any liability or misconduct, but those that refuse CIAs may now be publicly questioned as to their ""future trustworthiness"" based solely on the OIG's Fraud Risk Indicator.

The advent of the ""high-risk"" classification appears to be another way for the government to publicize allegations of fraud, even when they are disputed, and attempt to foreclose the possibility that an entity may challenge its published classification on the OIG's risk spectrum or request removal from the public listing after a certain time period. Further, the OIG acknowledges on the Fraud Risk Indicator webpage that the assessment is based solely on the information received in the context of the FCA case (rather than a comprehensive review of the entity).

Given the potential effects of such public denouncements, challenges to the OIG's new approach are likely."

The incident occurred around 9.30 am on Monday in Salarpur village, while an exam was going on inside the school.

According to principal Jha's statement, the victims were standing outside to either use the washroom or to drink water. Since he was busy inside the school as examinations were going on, he didn't know the exact sequence of the event, said police officials.

Five children were trapped under the rubble of the boundary wall when it collapsed. All five had been rushed to nearby hospitals after they were extricated from the debris by the locals, the police and a team from NDRF.

According to police, construction work was in progress on the adjoining plot. The sand from the construction site was kept along the boundary wall of the school, which was about 10-feet high, and the weight of it allegedly weakened it thereby, leading to its collapse.

Police had registered an FIR against six persons, including the management of the school and the neighbour on whose plot the construction was taking place.

In many departments, there are only one or two faculty members and this has affected the academic performance of the students. Sources in the university said a circular by the University Grants Commission (UGC) over reservation pattern in the appointment of faculty members is the reason for the uncertainty. At present, 40 per cent of teaching positions are lying vacant at the KU.

For the past one-and-a-half year, no fresh appointments have been made in the varsity. Last year, the university had notified the job notification to fill 110 vacancies in various departments. However, the UGC guidelines insist fresh appointments should be made only after ensuring reservation criteria in each department. The varsity requested the reservation pattern by considering the whole university as a single unit rather than reservation in each department. Though the university approached the High court against UGC instructions, the UGC filed an appeal in the Supreme Court. In the fallout, a total number of 110 vacancies are yet to be filled and this has been affecting the whole performance of the varsity, sources said.

""We had already advertised for the posts and the process of filling up vacancies was almost done, but it had to be put on hold. But we cannot appoint new teachers because of the ongoing court case with regard to the UGC's circular on hiring reserved category candidates. The shortage of faculty members resulted in lowering of the grade of the university. National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) will also stop funding the varsity and it was one of the reasons for losing the Chancellor's Award,"" a former syndicate member said.

Recently, many colleges under KU lost their NAAC rankings and this made the university reconstitute the academic system, especially the research segment. Vice Chancellor, V P Mahadevan Pillai told Express the issue is a serious matter of concern and they could not make any appointments due to the stringent instructions of the UGC.

He admitted the UGC circular had put a dampener in the hiring process. ""On one side, the UGC has been instructing us to stop the recruitment and they cut down the funds to the varsity citing the shortage of faculty members on the other side. However, I have called on Higher Education Minister K T Jaleel and discussed the issue. I have also requested the government to create 50 new posts too.

The shortage of faculty members resulted in lowering of the grade of the varsity. NAAC will also stop funding the varsity and it was one of the reasons for losing the Chancellor's Award

In a soup

● For the past 1.5 years, no fresh appointments has been made in the varsity

● Last year, the varsity notified to fill 110 vacancies in various departments.

● The varsity requested the reservation pattern by considering the whole university as a single unit"

The J&K government's reported ban on the traditional winter wear, Pheran, at the offices has received backlash from social media users. Besides J&K's civil secretariat not allowing people wearing Pherans inside its premises, the J&K education department has also reportedly passed orders barring its employees from wearing the traditional cloak.

However, the directive does not seem to have gone down well with the valleyites including politicians like Omar Abdullah. Netizens have come up with #PheranLove hashtag on social media to protest the ban and uploaded their pictures wearing Pheran.

Former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah was one of the first persons to put up a Pheran picture of him and his father Farooq Abdullah.

Soon, there were many uploads from Kashmiris living in the valley and outside professing their love for the traditional wear, which has a history dating back to 19th century. Some historians say that the Pheran has its ancestry rooted in Afghanistan and other parts of Central Asia and even the word Pheran is Persian.

The loosely fitted garment which usually falls below the knees has however undergone a massive transformation over the years. There are newbie designers in Srinagar who have worked to give a modern facelift to Pheran and they swear by the same.

Sadia Mufti, a woman entrepreneur who owns a designer store in Srinagar told International Business Times, India that Pheran is the most sought-after wear in her store, which is bought not only by the locals but even the tourists.

""It is one of the best buys in both winters and summers. That is because it is a part of our cultural identity and the new generation does not want to cut off from the cultural ties,"" she said. Sadia further said that the modern touch to Pheran like adding an extra dose of work or intricate designs have only increased its demand among the customers.

In fact, a very popular tea room in Srinagar, Chai Jaai, has come up with a photo campaign asking locals and non-locals to upload their pictures wearing Pherans on social media.

There is also a serious concern among some that the state administration led by Governor Satya Pal Malik is passing some controversial orders which fiddle with the unique identity of the state.

The earlier directives such as converting J&K Bank into a PSU, issuance of Permanent Residence Certificates were unequivocally condemned by people from all over the valley and the recent Pheran directive is seen as an attack on the unique culture of the state."

At the Public Works Department (PWD) Complex, one of the venues of the ongoing Serendipity Arts Festival, a painting by Chaitali Morajkar, sums up just how much the people, especially women, lived in fear under the Portuguese rule. The artwork is a 16-part collage that has a young girl with a coiling braid, looking out at the unattainable - a book (education). Each of these 16 parts carry written testaments of 16 women, all above 70 years old, in Marathi (except for one in English) about their memories around Goa Liberation. Memories of protest marches, atrocities by the 'pankhle' (white-skinned Portuguese), and an unfulfilled dream of completing basic education.

""Few years ago, after I worked on an art project about influence of Portuguese on Goa, I took the freedom of thinking as an artist and human. It led to this idea of a collaborative artwork involving women voices about Liberation,"" says Morajkar. She first approached her friends' mothers for the exercise, but convincing them to come on board was a task. ""Many were hesitant, said 'we can't write anymore, ...don't remember when we last held a pen,"" recalls the 40-year-old freelance artist and art teacher. ""But once they began writing, they became very interested and were determined to finish their stories.""

There's Prabha Shirodkar, who wrote about how the Portuguese would barge into people's homes and if they spotted photographs of Indian freedom fighters on the walls, they would arrest the members. Shailaija B Nabar, whose is only testimony in English says, how she loves Goa because everything is a stone's throw away, though ""I remember Liberation day... I was quite frightened by the talks going around, and to add to that I had witnessed the bombshell dropping on Akashwani (All India Radio at Bambolim)"".

Pramila Manohar Sardesai's story resonated with Morajkar so much so she even showed her daughter. Sardesai's brother's wife had taken very ill just before Liberation Day, and going to Bombay to seek treatment was the only option. The wife got her ticket but the husband didn't. Unfortunately, despite treatment, the woman passed away. The husband still wasn't allowed to go to Bombay to bring back his wife's body or perform the last rites there."" Post Liberation, however, freedom was generous as one woman remembers how she used to visit the temple alone at 2am to partake in the bhajans without any fear. ""That was the real freedom,"" muses Morajkar, though she's quick to add how many of the women, regretted not having the privilege to complete their education, which their brothers were unquestionably given.

Eighty-four-year Sulochana Mhamai Kamat is one of them, who studied only till Class 8, while her brothers were allowed to continue their studies and ended up with top positions in the education and the government sectors. ""Today, students in Goa get discounted bus tickets, which is taken for granted. The kind of freedom we had hoped for,"" says Kamat.

Now 84, Kamat owns and lives in the one-story, red tiled-roof white-and-yellow Mhamai Kamat Building in Panjim that overlooks the Mandovi River with its casinos, and is also adjacent to the Adil Shah palace (Old Secretariat House), which is hosting a majority of visual arts shows of the Serendipity Arts Festival. She says it was built by her wealthy forefathers about 350 years ago, who were into the business of supplying food grains to the Portuguese who had taken over the Adil Shah palace.

Today, the house is without frills, but palatial space-wise, with 40 rooms, plus additional spaces of two lush tulsi-occupied verandahs, an open chula (kitchen) and a temple. Up, on the walls of the outdoor area, are dusty framed photographs of her ancestors, Raja Ravi Verma framed prints of Laxmi and Saraswati, and snapshots of the guests partaking in community eating, organised by Sulochana's family for Anant Chaturdashi. During Sulochana's childhood all the rooms were occupied. Now only 15 families live. Almost all their tenants - families, individuals having shops outside, plus occupants of their other properties - pay rent through the pagdi system, some as low as Rs 70, which is hampering family expenses. Kamat shared two memories about the Liberation for Morajkar's artwork.

One was of her, young and at her maternal home, stitching the tiranga (India flags) with her siblings which were passed on to freedom fighters to brandish during their staged protests. Though she was afraid about getting caught, she did it out of love for her country. The second instance is on Liberation Day itself, December 19, 1961, when Indian soldiers gathered in front of the Adil Shah palace, to replace the Portuguese flag with the Indian tricolor and declare Independence. Sulochana remembers that after a few soldiers knocked at their door for water, their resident cook prepared a large handi (vessel) of poha (flattened rice dish) with coffee and her family invited the famished lot of uniformed and freedom fighters to eat at their verandah. ""I used to get very scared of the 'pakhle' (white-skin or Portuguese soldiers). I'd had heard stories of them raping women, and my parents always ensured I didn't go out after dark. But today, what's happening?... Indian boys are raping our women. Today women are not safe among their own."""

""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned!"" tweeted National Conference leader and former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah. ""This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn.""

He also posted a photo of his father Farooq Abdullah and him wearing the traditional attire.

Before long, the #saynotopharanban hashtag gained prominence on Twitter, with Kashmiris posting photos of them wearing the double gown.

In September, the General Administration Department of the Civil Secretariat in Srinagar asked government officials to ""be attired in proper formal dress while appearing before any court of law and while attending offices in the State of Jammu and Kashmir and strictly avoid casual or party attire"".

The order was passed a month after the state High Court asked the government to announce an official dress code for officials attending court. The court issued the directive after it found a government officer in court not ""in proper dress"".

The order does not mention any particular form of attire. But, since the pheran is considered to be a casual dress, it is considered by some to be inappropriate in government offices.

According to the Rising Kashmir, the zonal education officer in Langate tehsil, following the civil secretariat directive, issued an order last week banning the pheran. However, the chief education officer of Kupwara told Scroll.in that the order was withdrawn on Tuesday. ""There is an official dress code but we cannot ignore the significance of pheran,"" said Mohammad Shafi War. ""That is why we have withdrawn the order issued by ZEO Langate.""

However, as Rising Kashmir reported, people visiting the secretariat in Srinagar are asked to take off their pherans and put them atop iron poles outside the gates. Officials explained that this is part of security protocol, since the pheran is a voluminous garment that could be used to conceal banned items."

Breathing life into architecture

At the 34th Coomaraswamy lecture organised by the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya on Monday, Pritzker Prize Laureate and eminent architect BV Doshi spoke to an audience of scholars, architects, historians and urban planners.

He highlighted the importance of having an element of flexibility in architecture and recalled how while he was working on the design of IIM Ahmedabad, several directors changed and his design had to be organic enough to absorb these changes. He also advised against creating spaces that don't allow us to live different seasons and experience nature. Words of wisdom for the city's rapidly changing streetscape.

The Godfather of food in India

Such is the power of British chef Marco Pierre White's steely gaze that even the best of the chefs would doubt their techniques. Fans of one of the most popular and widely followed chefs in the world will be delighted to know that White will arrive in Mumbai on January 19 and 20 as part of the gourmet food festival, World on Plate.

Fans will also get a chance to be a part of two masterclasses at Palladium in Lower Parel, and sneak in a chance to have a memorable photograph with the culinary maestro.

Gone too soon

As news of artist Tushar Joag's sudden death reached Mumbai, a pall of gloom descended over the city's art world. The well-known artist died of a massive heart attack. He was 52. ""A public intervention artist who politicises his art and attempts to aestheticise politics"", as Joag described himself, he lived most of his life in Mumbai before moving to Greater Noida where he established the department of art at the Shiv Nadar University with his wife Sharmila Samant.

A Bachelor of Fine Arts from Sir JJ School of Art, he completed his MFA from the MS University in Vadodara -- where years later, he withdrew from an international festival when the university allegedly faced attacks from right wing groups. Urban development, displacement and citizenship, and political satire were some of the key themes of his work, which included a 53-day motorcycle ride from Mumbai to Shanghai to highlight the appropriation of water from Tibetan lakes by the Chinese government.

He was also an advisor for the art education programme for children by Art1st, a Mumbai-based initiative. When this diarist reached out to Art1st founder Ritu Khoda, and poet and art crtic Ranjit Hoskote, both shared that they were too shocked by the news to comment.

A tell-all from the Sinhas

It began with The Paradoxical Prime Minister by Shashi Tharoor, but when it comes to literary attacks on the current government, this one is going to hit harder. Yashwant Sinha's book India Unmade: How the Modi Government Broke the Economy, co-written with mid-day columnist Aditya Sinha will be released later this week.

A known critic of the Prime Minister, the book by Sinha -- who was the Finance Minister of India from 1998 to 2002 -- speaks of why he feels the GDP numbers are misleading, how the RBI's autonomy is in danger, how there is no comparison between Narendra Modi and AB Vajpayee, and why demonetisation is a huge banking scam. Do we hear fireworks?

A dance for a cause

The city will witness a rather special dance performance on December 21. Dance, of course, is an art form that can truly encapsulate a sense of joi de verve. And that's why a group of four international dance teachers have been invited by the Magic Bus Foundation to teach ballet and hip-hop to around 30 underprivileged children from Thane and Kalwa.

Hailing from diverse countries such as the UK, US and Singapore, the teachers -- Kimberley Martin, Clare Tay, Nicola Ciotta and Kathie Tiffany -- have been holding workshops in the two genres, with the rehearsals culminating in a performance on Friday. The entire process is being supervised by Andy Martin, a teacher who works with children who have special needs. All in all, it seems that this is one Christmas that the children will remember forever."

While rooting out such illegal schools is something governments have to do on a war footing, the condition of some state-run schools in the city is no better. Buildings with roofs partially caved in, cracks running across walls, leaking ceilings, broken urinals in washrooms and crumbling walls are what several government schools serve to the hundreds of students who turn up for classes every day. District elementary education officer Prem Lata Yadav, when asked about the state of infrastructure of government-run schools in the city, said, ""The reason behind the poor condition of school buildings is lack of funds. We've written to the education department to look into the issue.""

Government Senior Secondary School , Islampur

Concrete chunks can be seen falling off the ceiling, with cracks running across the walls, at GSSS Islampur. The building has 15 rooms with 550 students in classes VI-XI. Washrooms were stinking, there were no faucets and urinals were broken. The school principal accept the condition of the school's infrastructure is not good. ""A proposal to rebuild the school building has been placed before the authorities. This building will be brought down soon. MCG officials have taken measurements for the new construction a few months ago,"" said Kanwal Nain, principal. ""This building is small, old, and built on low land, because of which, at times, water accumulates at the entrance,"" he added.

Government Primary School, Satlaka

The 46 students of GPS Satlaka have to brace a school building falling apart at its seams. There are five classrooms, but all classes take place in only one, as the condition of the rest is terrible. ""One can spot cow dung on the floors, broken benches, blackboards and doors. Across the building, the seepage is so heavy that during monsoons this year, the roof of one classroom collapsed,"" said Virender Singh, guest teacher.

TOI also spotted dogs roaming in the classrooms. ""This entire building is unsafe and unfit for tiny tots. Since there is no guard, cows wander in and take shelter inside at night. I'm not paid to clean up the dung,"" said Rahisa, the school's sole sanitation staff. Since the building was constructed in 1972, no teacher has spent more than a year in this school.

Shivji Park Primary School

Shivji Park Primary School doesn't even have its own building. It operates out of Government Senior Secondary School Kadipur, whose classrooms are in a shambles. ""Students are forced to sit in the school hallway or even in the open, as none of the eight classrooms we've been allotted are usable,"" said head teacher Satpal. Even teachers of the Kadipur school are unaware when the crumbling walls were last repaired.

The move comes a day after two children were killed and six others injured in a wall collapse at a private school in Noida.

According to police, the school building in Salarpur was ""too old and deteriorated"" and its wall collapsed due to the impact of some construction activity that was going on ""without any official approval"" in the adjoining plot.

Speaking as the chief guest, St Edmund's College principal, Sylvanus Lamare said, ""This day should be taken seriously and not merely for cleaning localities, there should be a state function not only in the state library but in every district of the state. Hope he gets a proper place that is befitting to his name, befitting to his writings and contribution. The Garo community should also know about the works of Soso Tham.""

Lamare said the writings of Tham should live on among us and termed him as a poet without boundaries and pointed to Ki Sngi barim U Hynniewtrep (the olden days of the seven huts) the works of which contain a lot of ideas of the Khasi society and their way of life.

At the programme, he recited verses from some of Tham's poems to highlight the relevance of his poems in people's lives and the present times which include a poem on the effect of climate change on agriculture.

""We live in an age of technology and information and an age of excessive information and Soso Tham rightly said about this,"" Lamare said.

As a line of inspiration he referred to Tham's stanza - Sa shisien pat kin win ki khlaw, sa shisien pat kin khih ki maw (Once more the forests will sound/Once more the rocks will move).

At the programme, there was prize distribution for painting, drawing and quiz competition conducted under the theme, Ki Saw Aiom (The four seasons). The drama on the same theme was also enacted.

Dedicate one chapter to prominent people: KSU

Meanwhile, the Khasi Students' Union (KSU) general secretary, Donald Thabah urged the education department to dedicate one chapter to prominent people from the indigenous community.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday after paying tribute to the Khasi bard, he said the government has given less attention to prominent people of the community. ""There should be one chapter dedicated to freedom fighters and other prominent people of the state,"" he said.

According to him, Khasi literature is very rich judging from the scholarly articles, journals, poetry and others and the Khasi subject was recognized by Kolkata University from 1902 and currently the language is used till Masters and PhD level.

""It is rich but it is not able to make its way to the Eighth schedule of the Indian Schedule and to make it here, there has to be a strong political will from the state government,"" Thabah said.

He said Tham can be regarded as a pioneer to mould and shape the Khasi literature and also a man with a vision.

Thabah maintained there is no grand tribute made to Tham even after 78 years of his death and declaring state holiday is not enough.

""There has to be activities, literary activities or any festival relating to Soso Tham, Kiang Nangbah, Tirot Sing, for children and young people to know,"" he added.

Meanwhile, Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama, Cherrapunjee (Sohra) gave a befitting tribute to renowned poet of Khasi Hills U Soso Tham at Iewthymmai ground, Sohra. 1100 children from 40 schools of the Ramakrishna Mission Asharma Sohra remembered him by performing Calisthenics, Thematic Martial Arts, Yoga for children and Khasi traditional dance styles."

There are eight rooms under the shed in Hallomajra. These include all sections of Classes VI, VIIA and VIIIA. In the evening, all sections of Class I are also conducted under the roof.

In Hallomajra, one class is held in the midday meal room. The block under the tin roof is located on a separate premises. A rickety fence passes off for a boundary wall, leaving students vulnerable to insects and snakes.

The traditional Kashmiri pheran (the loose gown worn during winters) is at the heart of a controversy in Kashmir valley after the education department in Langate banned the dress in its offices.

Leading the campaign against the pheran ban is National Conference vice-president and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, who has started a campaign on Twitter to revoke the ban. Drawing flak, the education department withdrew the order in a bid to calm tempers.

The controversy started when the zonal education officer of Langate issued a circular banning pheran, traditional trousers and sleeper/plastic shoes in his office.

""All officials visiting the office are advised to visit in proper dress code during any official visit. It is recommended that no official will visit this office wearing pheran, traditional trousers and sleeper/plastic shoes,"" read the circular.

The issue snowballed into a major controversy with people taking to social media calling it an assault on the Kashmiri culture. ""My father and I have worn pherans to official functions many times over the years and will continue to do so, silly government orders notwithstanding,"" Omar tweeted, with hashtags #dontbanourpheran and #revokepheranban.

People posted pictures wearing the pheran on Twitter to register their protest and oppose the ban. Omar too posted his and his father's pictures, wearing the pheran during functions.

""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned! This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter, aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn,"" Omar said.

Under fire, the education department on Tuesday withdrew the order in a bid to put an end to the raging controversy. ""Teachers were coming to the office wearing sleepers and trousers. He the (zonal education officer) had reprimanded them not to do so. Then he issued an order in which he also included the pheran. Since pheran is our cultural dress, we have withdrawn the order,"" Mohommad Shafi War, chief education officer, Kupwara, told DNA.

Officials said the directions were issued with an aim to maintain office decorum and discipline. ""Since the pheran ban became an issue, we withdrew the order completely,"" said War.

Pheran is a traditional dress of Kashmir and both men and women take pride in donning it. Older Kashmiri women wear it throughout the year while men prefer to wear it during winters to keep warm.

People also use a 'kangri' (traditional fire pot) under the pheran to keep themselves warm. In 2014, the Army had to withdraw its advisory urging journalists not to wear pheran while visiting its Corps Headquarters."

The internal rivalry between the warring factions had taken a new turn when a group of students had accused two staffers Praful Purohit and Chetan Pandya of passing lewd comments at them.

The representations against the duo by students group state that the duo have been misbehaving with them since the last two years and in the past too a similar complaint was filed against them in 2015.

After repeated complaints, the university had debarred the duo from undertaking any academic responsibilities including exam duties.

The university has also formed a committee to look into the allegations against the duo which both Purohit and Pandya have refuted.

On the other hand, a group of students have also come out in support of the duo, who they say are being targeted by their rivals.

Although the university has appointed another OSD to handle the affairs of BSM, the internal affairs are unlikely to change at the institute.

There is also a feeling inside some sections of BSM that the university itself is not keeping any concrete long-term that can resolve the issues at the institute as all the OSDs appointed so far are those who are out of sync with its affairs."

Envisioned to be an extension of the Happiness Curriculum, Education Minister Manish Sisodia Tuesday announced that 'Entrepreneurship Curriculum' will be launched in the upcoming academic year for secondary and senior secondary students in the city's government schools. The aim is to create an ""entrepreneurial mindset"" in young people so they become ""job creators"" and not ""job seekers.""

The Happiness Curriculum was launched in July for students from nursery to Class VIII, to encourage mental well-being and ""human-centric education"".

During the first convocation of Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women on Tuesday, Sisodia announced that entrepreneurship classes will be held for one period of every school day for classes IX-XII. He said: ""We train all our focus on preparing for jobs -- this is a discourse we need to change. In convocations, we should celebrate people who did not accept big jobs and decided to do something that will generate jobs.""

The need for institutions to produce graduates who will generate jobs had earlier been raised by Sisodia at the convocation of Delhi Technological University last week, where he had called the act of generating jobs ""nationalist."" Speaking to The Indian Express, he said: ""Our schools only teach students to transfer pre-learnt knowledge, and not to think out of the box. Young people are afraid of being wrong, they have a fear of failure because of which they seek the security of a job. This needs to be done away with. That is one of the primary focus areas of the curriculum.""

The curriculum will not be a skill-based programme and will include components like ""personality and communication development"" and ""professionally inspiring stories"". Its framework is being charted, said officials.

Sisodia added that he has informally identified a team from the education department -- which he will formally select within a week. Inputs from domain experts will also be incorporated, Sisodia said.

""Models of entrepreneurship training already exist but they are not for children and are concentrated into shorter periods like two months. I want to extend these over a period of four years by weaving them into our school pedagogy to reshape their orientation and encourage innovation,"" said Sisodia. These classes are to be conducted by government school teachers themselves, for which they will receive training, said officials."

According to officials of the state education department, the project will be examined and as per the results and response from the stakeholders, it will be decided whether or not to continue with the idea.

The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) scrapped the oral examinations which are conducted for language subjects at the school level. These exams carried 20 marks per student, and were assessed by schoolteachers based on students' performance.

However, last year (2017-18), the board announced that it would scrap this pattern for Class 9 students. The same students would have to follow a similar examination pattern - without oral exam marks (20) - by attempting a 100 marks' question paper - in their Class 10. The state education department came up with the idea after receiving several complaints about a biased marking system by schools to better their passing percentage.

A senior official from the department said, ""We should wait and see how things go because the students are the ones who will either get affected or benefitted. However, we are quite positive that things will work out given the mock tests and question paper format being uploaded on the Balbharti website for students to download and practice on their own and at the school level. It is not yet decided but this will surely only benefit the students.""

Several parents however are against the idea of scrapping the orals, given the junior college admissions that will follow after the SSC examinations.

Meanwhile, teachers claim that students are not getting pressurised by the 100 marks' paper as the mock tests, preliminary examinations and question paper dummy are helping them practice before the final exams commence."

Authorities of Bihar's education department were unaware of the regressive practice being followed at the GA Higher Secondary (Plus 2) School at Lalganj in Vaishali district so far. After the matter came to light following a recent inquiry by officials, a shocked state government ordered an inquiry on Tuesday.

While all students of the school usually come to the institute together and leave the premises together, they are made to sit in different classrooms as per their castes and religions according to a system followed for the past four years, said sources. Students from Dalit and Muslim communities are reportedly never allowed to visit other classrooms.

There are also separate sections and rooms for students belonging to Hindu and Muslim communities at the school, said sources. Similarly, separate classrooms have also been allotted for students of each class belonging to the upper castes, OBCs and Dalits. The school also uses separate attendance registers for different social groups of the students.

""An inspection of the school made it clear that such a system indeed prevails there. We are sending a detailed report to the district education officer for instructions on suitable action on the matter,"" said Arvind Kumar Tiwari, the Block Education officer (BEO) of Lalganj.

School headmistress Meena Kumari, however, claimed that the social segregation of students has been proving useful in many ways. ""This system is in place in order to facilitate a smooth educational process and also to ensure that the execution of government schemes becomes easier. There is no discrimination on the basis of caste or religion,"" she said.

""There have been no negative effects of this system at the school so far. Besides, there has never been a complaint against this system, which is running smoothly,"" argued the headmistress.

Bihar education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma expressed shock upon learning of the segregation of students along caste and religious lines at a government-run school.

""It is very unfortunate if it is really happening. I have ordered a thorough investigation of the matter. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against whoever is found responsible for it,"" he added."

The book is laced with facts and figures about the 'miss-governance' of NarendraModi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. The book is a must read for all those who believe in cultural ethos, pluralism and giving free and equal space to their detractors.

Authored by the maverick Member of Parliament from Kerala, ShashiTharoor, it divulges into the details about the early life of incumbent Prime Minister Modi.

Being Modi

The author has credited Prime Minister for being a hard worker who did all the menial jobs like cooking and cleaning for his seniors in RashtriyaSwayamsevakSangh (RSS) in Gujarat. Modi had joined RSS on the day of Diwali in 1958 at the tender age of eight. Modi believed in the mantra that what work you get do it well. During emergency,Modi used to ferry opposition leaders disguised as Sikh. Rising through ranks he became chief minister of Gujarat in 2002.

Tharoor writes that Modi lives alone and maintains little contact with his mother, four brothers or sister. He has no relationship to speak of with his blood relatives and advertises this as part of his incorruptibility.

Quoting Modi's brother in the book, Tharoor says that PrahladModi informed him that after Modi became Prime Minister he won't even offer tea to someone without a reason, especially his family.

When he was younger, Modi liked to fly kites. Being younger brother, Prahlad would host the spool of string while Modi did all the flying.

Prahlad said that: ""If I refused, he would get angry and he would hit me. I am still scared of him, even today.""

Tharoor writes that after Gujarat riots took place the then prime minister A B Vajpayee wanted Modi out but he had to give in to party's 'collective decision' against the idea. After Modi was re-elected as chief minister of Gujarat in 2007, his national wide projection gathered pace and it intensified with his third election victory in 2012.

Building image

The book has provided a detailed information about how building of Modi's image was one of the main tasks where foreign public relation agency and Indian agencies were hired for Modi's image building after the Gujarat riots. Modi also employed top-notch Indian consultants to enhance his brand.

Tharoor writes the objective was to sell Modi to Indian voters using the most advanced modern techniques and also to make sure that foreign governments thought better of him, washing-away his Gujarat riots image.

Modi as PM

""The Paradoxical Prime Minister"" has also shed light on Modi complex relation with the RSS. Modi has initiated a practice whereby his ministers dutifully report to the RSS's leadership about their performance.

The author writes that Prime Minister sees no movies, he is known neither to drink nor smoke, eats non-spicy fare, enjoys a simple khichdi and frequently observes fasts on specific Hindu occasions, particularly during the Navratri festival, when he only drinks nimbupani and a cup of tea during the day.

The book also talks about the exaggerations of Modi and falsely providing the dates of the events. Exaggerations is weakness of Modi from mixing up of the dates to falsely providing figures about India's GDP Modi has got it all wrong in last four years. One such example is when Modi claimed in Davos in 2018 that 600 crore voters had given him a mandate in 2014, a figure that mounts to 6 billion, which would include most of the human race, in fact, India had 81.5 crore (815million) registered voter in 2014, of whom about 60 percent voted, and of whom 31 percent voted for BJP. In other words 17.98 crore approximately voted for him not 600 crore.

Modi's miss-governance

There are number of figures provided in the book which direct towards the increased number of deaths during last four years of Modi regime. More than 389 individuals have been killed while 8890 have been injured in anti-minority acts of violence since mid-2014 and hundreds of others injured, stripped, beaten and humiliated.

Nearly 70 cases of cow-related violence have been reported in last 8 years of which 97 percent (68 out of 70) have occurred during Modi's rule and a majority of these have occurred in BJP-ruled states. Around 136 people have been injured in these attacks and 28 killed, 86 percent of the victims were Muslims.

The book reveals that Maharashtra banned beef in 2015 which destroyed livelihood of around 3 lakh Muslim butchers and truckers. Tharoor writes that the nationwide ban would push more people into poverty. Besides Muslims other minorities also consume beef, as the ""The Paradoxical Prime Minister""says that 2 percent of Hindu population also consume beef but this 2 percent translates to 12.5 million individuals making them the second largest consumers of beef in India.

The book has also talked about the Uttar Pradesh. In 2017, anti-Rome squads in Yogi Adityanath, questioned 21,37,520 people for being out with girls. Out of those questioned 9,33,099 have been officially warned and 1706 FIRs issued against 3,003 persons.

Also, a staggering 36, 420 farmers committed suicide between 2014 and 2016.

Tharoor has also talked in detail about the 320-day long agitation by armed veterans for One Rank One Pension (OROP) and the decision to extend Short Service Commissions for fourteen years.

The book also says that the present Hindutva government has only changed names of the schemes. Instead of being a game-changing government the BJP government has turned out to be name-changing one.

Modi, BJP and fascism

Tharoor has done an interesting analysis about the rightwing forces in India. He has quoted Fintan O'Toole columnist, literary editor and drama critic of The Irish Times, saying that:""fascism doesn't arise suddenly in an existing democracy. It is not easy to get people to give up their ideas of freedom and civility. You have to do trial runs that, if they are done well, serve two purpose. They get people used to something they may initially recoil from and they allow you to refine and calibrate. This is what is happening now and we would be fools not to see it. And then I wonder apply these words to India and to the 'new normal' that has dawned since 2014 are we also fools not to see it?""

Tharoor writes that fascism has come to power on a minority vote and then consolidated itself through fear and intimidation. Seen through this prism, the BJP's 31 percent certainly looks more ominous.

The book talks in detail about the economy, language controversy, the transferring of governors (which the author has referred 'saffronization of the institutions'), education, literature, defence, and scams that have hit India in last four years. The book also talks about the similarities between Modi-Erdogan and Modi-Patel.

Tharoor has referred, to changing the name of TajMahal, as 'cultural nationalism'. He says that after Yogi Aditatnath came to power in Uttar Pradesh, the tourist department of UP, issued a brochure listing the state's all the tourist place and omitted the TajMahal. The historic monument was also denied the any cultural heritage funding in the allotment for the 2017-18 fiscal year, under the BJP ruled state.

The demon of demonetization

""The Paradoxical Prime Minister"" has literally lashed out at the Prime Minister for his hoaxed so-called demonetization drive. It says: 'on the economy, Modi literally has no friend left' and instead of the promised 'good days', India is facing plenty of bad ones.

Only 4 percent of replacement currency was printed, not nearly enough new currency had been printed before the announcement. The banks did not even have a fraction of the money needed to meet the customers demand for new notes.

Tharoor writes that the economy plunged into chaos and the decision looks more like a 'miscalculation' than a 'masterstroke'. Ironically, the rich were relatively unaffected as they hold credit cards and be cashless. The main victims were the poor and the lower middle classes who rely on cash for their daily activities. Also, hundreds of people daily died after waiting in queues or committed suicides. The author writes that only a few among Modi's inner circles knew about demonetisation.

Foreign policy by whim not by design

Like any other Modi's policies, the foreign policy of Modi was also one that saw down spiral as Tharoor writes that Modi has a foreign policy by whim not by design and seriously there is lack of a cohesive foreign policy in India.

The author credits the Prime Minister for getting the UN to adopt International Yoga Day, as the only concrete achievement of Modi's foreign policy.

He has made 41 trips in 4 years to 52 countries till June 2018. Modi was out of his office every third day in his first four years in power, spending 477 out of 1491 days till June 2018.

The favourite destination of Modi's remains China. He has visited China six time followed by USA and Germany.

Meeting Imran Khan

Tharoor has also discussed the newly elected Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan. He has called him a dual-faced personality.

The author writes that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has two faces a liberal, cosmopolitan and urbane one, which is seen in London and Mumbai and an uncompromisingly hawkish Islamist one, an image he reserves for his Pakistani audiences.

Tharoor in the chapter titled 'The India-Pakistan Yo-Yo'writes that Pakistan Army has encouraged and perhaps sponsored Imran Khan's rise as the army sees him as the most plausible and useful instrument for whichever policy they decided to adopt.

He writes that there is no shortage of evidence for the proposition that Imran's views on foreign policy largely mirror the army's as both oppose the US presence in Afghanistan and have condemned US-Pakistan military operations and drone strikes in the area.

Hawkish eye on India

The book claims that Imran Khan's government and the Pakistan army have the same position as far as their Pakistan's arch rival India is concerned.

Tharoor writes that Imran Khan has rarely parted from the military position on India as he also called Nawaz Sharif a coward for not responding militarily to India's surgical strikes in 2016.

Tharoor claims that Imran Khan sought a meeting with an Indian parliamentary delegation, which Tharoor was heading in Islamabad in 2017.

""When told about that security restriction would not permit me to leave the hotel Imran came over and spent an hour with me and my colleagues. He wanted mainly to talk about my book ""An Era of Darkness' which he had read,"" writes Tharoor."

The former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and National conference Vice President Omar Abdullah while urging the School Education Department to withdraw its order asking officials to refrain from wearing the Pheran said, ""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned!""

""This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn,"" Omar wrote on Twitter.

He added: ""My father & I have worn pherans to official functions many times over the years & will continue to do so, silly government orders notwithstanding.""

Following Omar's tweet the social media went abuzz with senior journalist Sankarshan Thakur writing, ""And intrinsic to Kashmiri life in more ways than just one. Ludicrous someone should think of banning such a wonderful and versatile garment 'Pheran'.""

NC leader and former lawmaker Altaf Kaloo wrote, ""Nobody on earth can dictate us for not wearing Pheran.... will continue with this.""

Reacting to the ban, senior Kashmir based journalist Yusuf Jameel while sharing the photographs of various motifs of Pheran wrote, ""The officer who has sought to ban wearing of pheran in office appears to be suffering from 'hum angrezon ke zamane ke sahab hain' syndrome. Get a life! We do take pride in our culture, customs, traditions and living styles. Entirely. Love Pheran.""

Congress leader Salman Nizami while sharing a photograph of him wearing a Pheran wrote, ""Pharan is our cultural identity. What's the governor's agenda?

Right wing Bharatiya Janata Party ally Peoples Conference leader and Mayor Srinagar Municipal Commission Junaid Azim Mattu supported the ban.

""Every workplace has the right to have a reasonably non-invasive general dress code. Nobody has declared a war on Pherans. Most workplaces ban denims. Relax.

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination. Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina. The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labour from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S. Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centres, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centres have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centres but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said -- barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees -- or 10 to 20 per cent of the internment population there -- are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. ""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational centre, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training centre"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemies of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training centre featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the centre is government-operated.

""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training centre collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility."" Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labour and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labour.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labour.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 per cent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labour is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labour in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labour.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, but they are also now profiting from their labour,"" said Smith. ""U.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Not all the camps have forced labour. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labour in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centres. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labour program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city centre.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training."" The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labour contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual labourers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

Minister for School Education K.A. Sengottaiyan said earlier this year that the School Education department was keen on offering LKG and UKG classes for children across the State. The government order too stated that they recognised that the number of students in the age group of 4 to 5 years had been declining in anganwadis as parents had turned to private schools for quality education with infrastructure such as modernized buildings, uniforms.

What one couldn't have missed was the way they handled their roles with a professional touch. It was nothing, but a dedicated show to come out with quality educational videos.

Educational videos are an attempt by the State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT) to make classes more exciting with innovative teaching methodologies. A team of 40 school teachers from across the state have been deployed for the project and they have made about 3,000 videos on various subjects so far.

One of the students, who participated in a shooting in the city recently, said making of educational videos was itself a joyful experience. Just imagine what could be in store for fellow students, who would learn by watching these videos.

""I was scared at first. But during and after the shooting, I was very happy. My parents, teachers and friends have watched my videos in smart phones and appreciated me,"" said Kiruba S, a student who acted in one of the videos.

""Ten students from our school have participated in the shooting of a Tamil poem. The video was completed in a day. This is a digital warm up for our children. The videos give the children an opportunity to see things and learn. For example, there is a chapter about sea turtles in English. Showing videos of them would be the best experience for the students than showing them pictures,"" said A Saravanaselvi, teacher with a panchayat union middle school at Kinathukadavu block, Dasanayakenpalayam.

Another primary class teacher with the CCMA government high school said even parents were happy with the initiative. ""Little children are more attracted to the background music and are happy to learn from the videos. Seven girls from our school have attended the shooting. Parents are overjoyed,'' said Uma Rani S, assistant head master of the school.

The State Council of Education Research and Training has provided QR codes in the textbooks. Once the QR code is scanned using a mobile phone, the video links will open, allowing teachers to help students see and learn. Approximately 2,500 videos have been linked to QR codes for textbooks of Classes I, VI, IX and XI, and the remaining videos are at the editing stage.

Making of videos for the third term is under way and the process is expected to be completed by December-end.

""We have pushed aside the traditional methods of theoretical training and started with digital methods. The videos will be application oriented to inculcate concept visualization. Apart from book learning, it is necessary to visually imagine a phenomenon. We have used graphics wherever necessary.

Jammu, Dec 18 Set to be the biggest in northern India, the ""Jambu"" Zoo project is back on track after being grounded due to a financial crunch and is likely to open doors to the public in June 2019.

The zoo will have an artificial waterfall and will house 27 famous species of animals, including the Royal Bengal Tiger, the Asiatic Lion, leopards, bears, crocodiles, ghadiyals and sambar deer, Chief Wildlife Warden, J&K, Suresh Chug told .

The project was halted due to a financial crunch for over six months. ""The first phase of the Jambu Zoo will be completed and made operational by six months. We are expecting funds from the government,"" he said.

With a view to discuss the progress in the zoo project and to resolve the issues for its early completion, Adviser to the Governor, K Vijay Kumar chaired a meeting of the officers of the Forest and other departments concerned.

""The project was reviewed by the adviser Monday. All details were discussed with him and we are expecting funds from the government. The project has been divided for completion into two phases. While the first phase will be completed in six months, the second phase will take some time,"" Chug said.

Explaining the reason for the halt, he said the project was earlier funded by the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), a programme under the Forest department, but later, the rules were changed and zoos can no longer be funded by the CAMPA.

The chief wildlife warden said only those animal species that can sustain the temperatures of Jammu will be brought to the Jambu zoo.

""One of the major objectives of the Jambu zoo at Jammu is to achieve financial sustainability and it is projected that the facility will attract at least 1 million visitors in its opening year,"" Chug said, adding that it will attract pilgrims visiting the Vaishno Devi shrine as also local tourists.

The zoo will be spread over 625 acres of land and will have facilities like tourist information centres, large parking spaces, cafeterias, restrooms at regular distance, officials said.

They said the main objective is to promote international eco-tourism, research and education on wildlife conservation, animal rehabilitation and mitigation of man-animal conflicts.

Named after ""Raja Jambu Lochan"", the ""Jambu"" zoo project was approved by the authorities at a cost of Rs 121 crore and the work is being taken up in a phased manner. The Central Zoo Authority of India (CZA) approved the concept plan for establishing ""Jambu"" in 2016.

The zoo will house a variety of animal species, including spotted deer, blue bull, black buck, barking deer, hog deer, goat, fishing cat, bear, sloth and wild boar, among others.

Officials said a reptile house, a nocturnal animal house and a butterfly park for conservation of butterfly species will also be part of the zoo.

""Jambu"" will have tie-ups with local universities as well, they said.

The sites will be set up with the local flora and will be supplemented with artificial plantation using local species. AB AD IJT

Children of parents who have alcohol use disorder are more likely to get married under the age of 25, less likely to get married later in life, and more likely to marry a person who has alcohol use disorder themselves, according to a new study by researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University and Lund University in Sweden.

""There are many pathways through which a parent's alcohol problems can influence our own risk for alcohol problems. One important pathway, of course, has to do with the genes that parents pass to their children,"" said the study's lead author, Jessica E. Salvatore, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology in the College of Humanities and Sciences at VCU. ""But another important pathway, which we demonstrate here, is through the social environment.""

The study, ""Parental Alcohol Use Disorder and Offspring Marital Outcomes,"" was published in the most recent issue of the journal Addiction. It is based on data from legal, medical and pharmacy registries with detailed information on 1.17 million people in Sweden who were born between 1965 and 1975.

""Although there have been many studies along these lines in the past, there were some key methodological limitations to these prior studies, including the reliance on small samples,"" Salvatore said. ""We were able to leverage the Swedish national registries to look at these questions in a large sample of over 1 million people.""

The researchers set out to discover if alcohol use disorder (AUD) -- which affects an estimated 16 million people in the United States -- among parents would predict their adult offspring's likelihood of marriage and marriage to a spouse with alcohol use disorder.

""We know from previous research that who you marry plays a big part in whether you develop an alcohol problem,"" Salvatore said. ""What we found in this study is that who you marry is not random -- and, in fact, the people who are at greatest risk for developing an alcohol problem (because they have an affected parent) are most likely to end up with a spouse who is going to exacerbate this risk.""

Researchers found that parental alcohol use disorder is associated with a higher probability of marriage at younger ages, a lower probability of marriage at older ages and a higher likelihood of marriage to an affected spouse compared with no parental alcohol use disorder.

""In this case, we found that you do marry someone who is like your parents,"" Salvatore said.

The researchers also found that most of these effects become stronger when the number of parents with alcohol use disorder increases from one to two. Most effects also held after statistically controlling for parents' socioeconomic status, marital history, other externalizing disorders, and the offspring's own alcohol use disorder status. Additionally, daughters of affected mothers are more likely to have an affected spouse, the researchers found.

The researchers were interested in their findings because previous research has shown that forming and maintaining romantic relationships with ""prosocial"" spouses reduces one's risk of developing alcohol use disorder.

""And what we find here is that people who are at risk of developing AUD (by virtue of growing up with an AUD-affected parent) are less likely to find themselves in these types of protective marital environments,"" Salvatore said.

From a practical standpoint, she said, the study's findings could be useful for clinicians and others who work with the offspring of parents with alcohol use disorder to raise awareness of how parental AUD can influence the types of social environments that can increase one's risk for alcohol use disorder.

""There are large international organizations, like Al-Anon and Alateen, that are geared towards helping and supporting the family members, and in particular children of people affected by alcohol use disorders,"" Salvatore said. ""I think that there is a role for findings like ours as part of these types of family education programs. Specifically, becoming aware of how a parent's alcohol problem might shape one's own likelihood of ending up in the kind of marriage that will increase the risk for alcohol problems may help people choose differently.""

The proposed rules address and significantly expand upon the ""areas of concern"" previously identified by the department in 2017, when it rescinded Obama-era Title IX guidance and issued its own interim guidance. Once final, the new Title IX rules will require colleges and universities to make substantial changes to their existing policies and grievance procedures, including its definitions, investigation requirements and hearing processes.

As it would be impossible for the purposes of this post to discuss all of these changes, the following chart provides an overview of ten key differences between the Obama-era guidance and the proposed regulations, that you need to know:

Obama-Era Title IX Guidance: Broadly defined as ""unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.""

Proposed Title IX Regulations: More narrowly defined as ""unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient's education program or activity.""

Obama-Era Title IX Guidance: Obligation to process complaints involving off-campus conduct, including conduct outside of the U.S., even if the conduct occurred outside of the context of an education program or activity, if the conduct had ""continuing effects"" on campus or in an off-campus education program or activity.

Proposed Title IX Regulations: No obligation to process complaints involving off-campus conduct, unless the conduct occurred in the context of the school's education program or activity.

Obama-Era Title IX Guidance: No requirement or reference to presumption of non-responsibility.

Proposed Title IX Regulations: Grievance procedures must include a presumption that the respondent is not responsible for the alleged conduct until a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance process.

Obama-Era Title IX Guidance: Removal of a respondent as an interim measure was permitted depending on the facts of the case, including the severity or pervasiveness of the allegations; and any continuing effects on the complainant.

Proposed Title IX Regulations: A respondent may only be removed on an ""emergency basis,"" provided that the school undertakes an individualized safety and risk analysis, determines that an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees justifies removal, and provides the respondent with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal.

Obama-Era Title IX Guidance: No prohibition on single investigator model.

Proposed Title IX Regulations: Single investigator model prohibited: decision-makers ""cannot be the same person(s) as the Title IX Coordinator or the investigator(s).""

Obama-Era Title IX Guidance: No specific requirement other than that any such rights that a college may offer be provided to both parties equally.

Proposed Title IX Regulations: Both parties must be given an equal opportunity to inspect and review any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the allegations raised in the complaint (even that which the school does not intend to rely in reaching a determination regarding responsibility) prior to the conclusion of the investigation and during the hearing; and the opportunity to provide a written response to preliminary investigatory findings and investigation report.

Obama-Era Title IX Guidance: No hearing required, but if hearing was part of the policy, direct cross-examination by respondents was discouraged because of its potential to re-traumatize victims.

Proposed Title IX Regulations: A school's grievance procedure must provide for a live hearing and afford respondents the right to cross-examine their accuser by a lawyer or other adviser; the parties may be in separate rooms, using technology if needed.

Obama-Era Title IX Guidance: Required ""preponderance of the evidence"" (more likely than not) standard in adjudicating complaints of sexual misconduct.

Proposed Title IX Regulations: Permits use of either the preponderance of the evidence standard, or the higher ""clear and convincing evidence"" threshold.

Obama-Era Title IX Guidance: No restriction on school's ability to discourage parties from discussing allegations.

Proposed Title IX Regulations: Prohibits schools from restricting ""the ability of either party to discuss the allegations under investigation or to gather and present relevant evidence.""

Obama-Era Title IX Guidance: Mediation in lieu of formal investigation and adjudication process not appropriate in cases involving alleged sexual assault.

Proposed Title IX Regulations: Allows for an informal resolution at any time, provided that both parties voluntarily agree to it.

Client Tip: While purporting to provide more due process protections for respondents and reduced regulatory burdens on colleges, the proposed regulations actually impose highly prescriptive requirements with regard to investigations and hearings that will be time-consuming and costly to implement. It is therefore incumbent upon colleges to contribute their comments individually, or through the associations of which they are members, to the Department of Education before the notice period expires on January 28, 2019, in an effort to reduce the burdens and clarify their obligations. Once the rules are finalized, colleges must be prepared to amend their policies to comply with the new law."

Some have termed it as an onslaught on Kashmir culture.

Former chief minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah termed the move as regressive.

""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned! This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn,"" wrote Omar Abdullah and shared pictures with his father Farooq Abdullah wearing the dress to official functions.

Zonal Education Officer(ZEO), Langate in north Kashmir's Kupwara has issued an order prohibiting the wearing of Pheran for officials.

""All the officials visiting this office are advised to visit with proper dress code during any official visit. It is recommended that no official will visit this office wearing 'Feran', traditional trousers and sleeper/plastic shoes (sic),"" the order read.

Pheran, a loose outer garment often worn over warm clothes in winters, was introduced in Kashmir some 600 years ago from Middle East. Despite differences in the culture, social status and dialect of the local communities, the Pheran worn over the years to brave the chilling temperatures of winter, has been a great leveler of Kashmir society.

Of late this traditional baggy gown has turned fashionable in valley, serving a double purpose for the youth of looking trendy and braving the winter chill. Strapped shoulders, raglan sleeves and contrasting buttons, the Pheran is now tight like an overcoat but covering like a traditional cloak would.

The order saw widespread criticism on social media.

Veteran journalist Yusuf Jameel was scathing against the order. ""The officer who has sought to ban wearing of pheran in office appears to be suffering from 'hum angrezon ke zamane ke sahab hain' syndrome. Get a life! We do take pride in our culture, customs, traditions and living styles,"" he wrote.

A restaurant owner, Roohi Nazki criticized the order saying ""This is illogical, insulting and a cultural put down. Who comes up with this kind of nonsense?""

""Let's not reduce a 'pheran' as purely a cultural artefact. It's more than that - pheran is necessary love in winters,"" wrote Anees Zargar, a Srinagar resident.

However Srinagar mayor Junaid Azim Mattu, who also wears Pheran in his office, appeared to be striking a middle path. ""Every workplace has the right to have a reasonably non-invasive general dress code. Nobody has declared a war on Pherans. Most workplaces ban denims. Relax. There are far more pressing issues that deserve our outrage and attention. There is no 'cultural invasion'. Let's move on,"" Mattu wrote.

Kupwara chief education officer, Mohd Shafi War acknowledged that one of his ZEOs had issued the order. ""Since the mention of Pheran in the order became an issue owing to its cultural significance, we are withdrawing the order,"" War said."

Set to be the biggest in northern India, the ""Jambu"" Zoo project is back on track after being grounded due to a financial crunch and is likely to open doors to the public in June 2019.

The zoo will have an artificial waterfall and will house 27 famous species of animals, including the Royal Bengal Tiger, the Asiatic Lion, leopards, bears, crocodiles, ghadiyals and sambhars, Chief Wildlife Warden, J&K, Suresh Chug told PTI.

The project was halted due to a financial crunch for over six months. ""The first phase of the Jambu Zoo will be completed and made operational by six months. We are expecting funds from the government,"" he said.

With a view to discuss the progress in the zoo project and to resolve the issues for its early completion, Adviser to the Governor, K Vijay Kumar chaired a meeting of the officers of the Forest and other departments concerned.

""The project was reviewed by the adviser Monday. All details were discussed with him and we are expecting funds from the government. The project has been divided for completion into two phases. While the first phase will be completed in six months, the second phase will take some time,"" Chug said.

Explaining the reason for the halt, he said the project was earlier funded by the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), a programme under the Forest department, but later, the rules were changed and zoos can no longer be funded by the CAMPA.

The chief wildlife warden said only those animal species that can sustain the temperatures of Jammu will be brought to the Jambu zoo.

""One of the major objectives of the Jambu zoo at Jammu is to achieve financial sustainability and it is projected that the facility will attract at least 1 million visitors in its opening year,"" Chug said, adding that it will attract pilgrims visiting the Vaishno Devi shrine as also local tourists.

The zoo will be spread over 625 acres of land and will have facilities like tourist information centres, large parking spaces, cafeterias, restrooms at regular distance, officials said.

They said the main objective is to promote international eco-tourism, research and education on wildlife conservation, animal rehabilitation and mitigation of man-animal conflicts.

Named after ""Raja Jambu Lochan"", the ""Jambu"" zoo project was approved by the authorities at a cost of Rs 121 crore and the work is being taken up in a phased manner. The Central Zoo Authority of India (CZA) approved the concept plan for establishing ""Jambu"" in 2016.

The zoo will house a variety of animal species, including spotted deer, blue bull, black buck, barking deer, hog deer, goat, fishing cat, bear, sloth and wild boar, among others.

Officials said a reptile house, a nocturnal animal house and a butterfly park for conservation of butterfly species will also be part of the zoo.

""Jambu"" will have tie-ups with local universities as well, they said.

The sites will be set up with the local flora and will be supplemented with artificial plantation using local species.

The Ramayana festival is a shared heritage of the eastern world which exhibits the essence of cultural bonds amongst the diverse Asian countries. The Vadodara based Parul University on the 2nd of November 2018 was privileged to host the prestigious forth International Ramayana Festival. The occasion was graced by the artistic and divine performances from the Sri Lanka native group Natya Kala Mandir, filling the Parul University auditorium with the vibrant essence of cross-cultural exchange.

The festival was organised in conjunction with the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) as a way to foster and promote a sound exchange of culture and traditions between India and other partner countries.

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on US college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination. Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina. The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the US Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said _ barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees _ or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there _ are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

''The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,'' he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. ''Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.''

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

''American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,'' she said. ''What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?''

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ''vocational skills education and training center'' in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

''Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,'' the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ''global issue.''

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ''unproblematic,'' he said, adding that the center is government-operated.

''We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,'' Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

''I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,'' one Uighur student said. ''The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.''

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ''military facility.'' Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ''apparel employment training base.''

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ''Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person'' and ''No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.''

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

''There are watchtowers throughout,'' Ruser said. ''There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.''

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ''friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.''

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

''We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,'' he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the US, Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the US that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ''training'' there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,"" said Smith. ""US consumers should not be buying and US businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Not all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the US

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ''political training.'' The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

''They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,'' said Kaliaskar. ''What's the point of this training?''

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ''further education.''

Farmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

''They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,'' she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

In addition to the social impact and the potential to bring positive change, another common factor between these three startups is that they were among the 24 winning startups that were part of the Maharashtra Startup Week 2018 in June. The inaugural edition of the startup initiative was a resounding success with participation from over 900 startups.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had reiterated his state government's commitment to make Maharashtra a hub for startups with more initiatives such as the Maharashtra Startup Week. In keeping with this commitment, they have brought back Maharashtra Startup Week within a span of six months.

The second edition of Maharashtra Startup Week is being held from January 28 to February 1, 2019.

Organised by the Maharashtra State Innovation Society, (MSInS) the weeklong initiative aims to encourage, engage and enable the state's entrepreneurial ecosystem. The Maharashtra Startup Week provides startups with a platform to showcase their innovative solutions to the Government of Maharashtra, directly engage with the government to tap B2G opportunities and to scale up their ventures in the overseas market.

The second edition aims to recognise startups from seven key sectors - education & skilling, healthcare, agriculture, sustainability, (clean energy, environment, water & waste water management) smart infrastructure & mobility, governance and financial inclusion/fintech. Additionally, to enable startups from other sectors to leverage the opportunities that an initiative of this kind opens up, the Maharashtra State Innovation Society has also created an additional category that allows startups that do not fit into any of the above categories to participate.

The top 100 startups participating in the Maharashtra Startup Week will be selected to showcase their solutions to a panel of judges comprising representatives from the Government, industry, academia and investors. During the five-day event startups from each sector will make their pitch to the panel, and the best 24 will receive work orders of upto Rs 15 lakh from the Maharashtra State Innovation Society to pilot their solutions and demonstrate the proof of concept. Subsequently, the startups will also receive handholding support in terms of access to government machinery and mentoring from institutional partners for a period of up to 12 months to deploy their solutions on ground.

Apart from the 24 winning startups, the top 100 startups will stand a chance to receive support up to Rs 15 lakh for market development programme. The Maharashtra State Innovation Society is partnering with multiple investors and incubators for the initiative. These partner organisations will consider the top 100 finalists for funding and mentorship. Apart from the 24 winners, select startups will also avail benefits like access to exhibition space and networking with VCs/ ecosystem partners, access to specific ecosystem events, free credits, international linkages and other benefits. Ecosystem partners include of the likes of the Indian Angel Network, Omidyar Network, CII, Acumen, 91 Springboard, among others

The last date for applying for the Maharashtra Startup Week is January 5, 2019. The startups will be evaluated based on Unique Value Proposition, Leadership Team, Social Impact, Sustainability & Scalability, Relevance for government and Technology Advantage (if any).

The results will be out on January 21, 2019 and applicants will be notified about their status. The selected 100 startups will get to participate in the week-long event during which they will pitch to a panel of government officials, investors, incubators, and experts from industry and academia. 24 winning startups will receive support from the Maharashtra Government in deploying their solutions and demonstrating proof-of-concept.

Apply for Maharashtra Startup Week 2019. Win work orders of upto Rs 15 lakh, get a chance to work on government projects, and more.

In its quest to reimagine development in the state, the state government of Maharashtra has taken a proactive step to partner with the private sector, especially startups. It has not only drafted and implemented a strong policy which keeps ease of doing business at its core, it has also made it easier for young and innovative companies which may be fairly new to partner with the government. In addition, the government consciously helps startups tap growth opportunities faster by connecting them to potential customers and related ecosystem players.

The Maharashtra Startup Week has been an amalgamation of these efforts and showcases the immense potential of B2G opportunities. After a stupendous first edition, the next edition of Maharashtra Startup Week 2019 promises to be nothing less.

It's not just the prospect of getting access to funding, mentoring and business that makes the Maharashtra Startup Week 2019 exciting for startups. What makes it even more worthwhile is seeing your solution have a positive impact on development in the country."

Tripura government has imposed a set of restrictions on the creation of new government jobs and advised abolition of vacant posts, in case new posts are created.

A memorandum issued by the Finance Department on Monday stated that Tripura already has the highest level of government employment in the country, in proportion to its population.

Tripura has roughly 200,000 government employees, including 60,000 pensioners. The estimated population of the state is 4,000,000.

""The need for this provision arises due to the fact that salaries and wages constitute the largest item of expenditure and it is absolutely necessary to exercise financial prudence and discipline while committing expenditure under these heads.

""Some departments have a wrong notion that the Finance Department has unlimited funds for salaries and wages and that it is their entitlement to fill up all the vacant posts and create new ones. This is not the case,"" the memo said.

The Department of School Education has violated these instructions and was asked to explain their action.

Earlier this year, the department announced recruitment in over 14,000 teaching positions to fill up vacancies, that were to be created by the retirement of 10,323 school teachers, who were terminated by the Supreme Court in 2017.

As per the new rules, the Finance Department would monitor expenditure on salary and wages by each department on a monthly basis and impose cuts from non-salary budget for departments which exceed their approved funds.

The results of assembly polls in states of Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have brought the issues of the farmers at the forefront and all political parties have now discerned (if not openly accepted) that agricultural distress has reached a climax and needs to be reversed. Though relatively less educated, farmers of our country have now started understanding that non-implementation of the promises and announcements by the policymakers has taken a toll on their lives and they want more than rhetoric. Farming is livelihood of more than half of India's population. This probably is the only vocation, in which same skill and factor of production (land) is passed on from one generation to another for many years to eke out a modest livelihood. Over the past few years, the divisions of landholdings, burgeoning cost of production and lack of education has turned farming into a Hobson's choice for many cultivators. The NSSO study (2003) reported that 40 per cent of Indian farmers expressed their desire to leave farming, it being a non-profitable occupation.

Framers with small landholdings have no other option but to pursue farming, though it is completely unviable for them in the post-liberalisation era.

The agrarian distress had been chasing the farmers for long but of late, more organised protests by the farmers in different states and at the national capital has found voice for their anger and frustration. The major consequence of farm distress is the deteriorating lives of marginal and small farmers, who find it increasingly hard to sustain with small landholdings and are getting pushed out of agriculture. The farmers, of late have united at national level and their recent protest on November 30 in New Delhi was the fourth such congregation in last one and a half year. There have been reports that Narendra Modi led government is contemplating to write-off billions of dollars of loans to please the farmers ahead of General Elections of 2019. The announcements probably are not a guarantee to ballots as the revision of Minimum Support Prices of Crops just before the assembly elections failed to fetch the desired results for Modi Government. The rural voter is more aware now. The manifesto of 2014 election had painted a very rosy picture for the farmers but the farmers across India interviewed for this article told that their plight has gone from bad to worse. The fanfare created around crop insurance scheme, soil health card, e-NAM, hike in minimum support price, doubling of income did not get any results rather opened a new window for misuse of funds and corruption for officials.

Why is farming sector suffering and why the farmers have become more vocal in the recent past? This can be evaluated by discussing some major issues concerning the farmers.

Doubling of Farmers' Income

It has been observed that in the past few years, the real income of the farmers has either remained stagnant or decreased despite rapid increase in productivity (82 million tonnes in 1960-61 to 275.68 million tonnes in 2016-17). In our country, about 80 per cent of the farmers are marginal and small farmers, who are unable to save and invest due to low levels of income. In such a situation, the announcement of doubling of income stimulates hope in the lives of a large number of people who could be prospective beneficiaries of such vision of the government. An investigation into the time required for doubling the farmers' income by 2022 as envisaged by the Modi Government as analysed by NABARD explains that at national level it will take 13.56 years to double the farmers' real income at CAGR of 6.68 per cent. These are the Government's own estimates and shows that poor population is given projections that are difficult to attain.

Crop Insurance

The insurance of crop is imperative for managing yield risk particularly in rainfed areas, more so for marginal and small farmers who face greater degree of difference in yield. The misuse of government funds in the garb of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY) in some states has been reported and may be only a tip of the iceberg. The farmers have been lamenting that the premium of insurance is deduced from their loan account in the banks without their knowledge but for the compensation such enthusiasm of banks is missing. The private insurance companies fleece them and many of them are not even aware of crop insurance in their name and do not seek the claim if crop is damaged. PMFBY ostensibly provides a comprehensive cover at a premium of 2 per cent of the insured value for the kharif crop and 1.5 per cent for rabi crop. The response has been lacklustre as the government itself claims that the coverage of this scheme will be increased from 40 per cent in 2016-17 to 50 per cent in 2018-19. Different parameters used for the insurance for the industries and commercial establishments vis-à-vis agriculture. In crop insurance, the loss of a farmer is calculated on the basis of loss in a block or a village. The individual farm is not eligible for the crop loss suffered. This evidently shows the flaw intentionally designed to favour the corporate. It has been widely covered in media that in the crop year 2016-17 (a year of normal monsoon), a sum of 22,437 was paid to insurance companies as premium, whereas the farmers were issued the crop loss claims worth 8,088 crore. This has disgruntled the farmers in all parts of the country.

Cow vigilantism

The emergence of cow protection squads during the Modi regime has badly hit the farmers' income especially in the northern states where the income from cow breeding helps the farmers to compensate for the low remuneration from farming. The proliferation of self-styled cow protection squads has not only undermined the income generation from breeding but also resulted in growing number of stray cattle. The farmers have to spend for the up-keeping of the abundant animals with their limited means and the space. The financial and social implications of such decisions have not been revisited despite repeated demands from the farmers. According to a senior farmer leader, killing an expensive high milk-yielding cow is something unthinkable as it does not make a business sense. Even then, Gau Raksha Boards have been constituted and it has been mandatory to procure no objection certificate (NOC) from district authorities and Cow Protection Board, that has helped smugglers at cost of the farmers.

Political Rhetoric and Experts' opinion

Although government announces the Minimum Support Prices of 23 crops every year, the actual procurement is done only for wheat, paddy and cotton. Sugarcane is procured under SAP (State Advised Price). This explicitly excludes a huge number of farmers who grow crops other than these four crops. The farmers are advised by the state agriculture departments in the respective states to grow horticulture crops, oilseeds and pulses but the state marketing boards do not make sufficient effort to organise for buyers of the crops. Lack of cold chains and processing facilities at affordable cost dissuade the farmers from diversifying. The different department of the state though headed by the same minister (Agriculture) work in complete isolation and farmers suffer.

The noted agriculture scientist, Professor M S Swaminathan, around whose report, the farmers protests are revolving also believes that the demand for loan waiver emerged from non-remunerative prices of the crops. An integrated approach towards crop production, pricing, marketing and procurement is the need of the hour.

According to BS Dhillon, Vice Chancellor of Punjab Agriculture University, Ludhiana, the agriculture sector in India is marred by low investment in farm infrastructure. The allocation of resources for research in agriculture is much higher in countries like U.S.A. and China. Another disadvantage for the agriculture sector in India is small size of farms. With the mechanisation of agriculture, we have been able to modernise farming to some extent but have not been able to absorb the surplus labour that resulted out of this mechanisation. This has resulted in disguised unemployment, low average income and economic stress. According to NSSO Report of 2012-13, the average monthly income of a farm household in India is 3,350. Is it a sustainable level of income? The disparity in the society between the farming and non-farming communities has been increasing sharply, giving rise to social unrest, manifested in protests and agitations. Loan waivers and MSP are the short-run remedies. We need to contemplate for long run sustainability. We need to understand that natural resources are limited so re-rationalisation of these scarce resources is to be mulled. Blindly aping models of other counties will not solve our problems and we need to design our own models fitting into our socio-economic set-up and natural endowments.

Digitalisation, GST and e-NAM

The Modi government spent a lot of time and money on publicising digitalisation of Indian economy. It was devised to remove intermediaries and bring transparency in payments. Farmers, mostly uneducated, have not been availed any benefit of digitalisation. The small farmers sell their crop either through commission agents (in state where procurement of crops is done) or through large farmers. Hence, in the official records of market committees, the commission agents or the large farmer is a seller and the money is transferred in his account. Poor farmer does not even come to know when the money is transferred electronically in the account of the intermediary and gets delayed payments.

The disparity of tax structure even after the roll out of GST regime has undermined the farming sector. Sushil Mittal, President of Haryana Ginning Mills' Association told that the market fee and cess in the agriculture markets of different states are different. Modi government has a callous disregard for the farmers. A textile hub was promised by the BJP Government in Haryana as Haryana produces 25 lakh bales of cotton annual and its consumption is only 3 lakh bales per annum. It would have created job opportunities as well. It has not been implemented and no one listens to our demands.

He said e-NAM has also been a failure because the infrastructure needed to check the moisture in grain and other parameters for different crop have not been provided. A trader located in down south may need cotton from Haryana but quality certification facilities are not available in the markets.

The farmers have also started understanding now that along with debt waiver the implementation of the recommendations of the National Commission on farmers can only solve their economic distress. The roll out of new schemes with fancy names and publicity cannot cut the ice. The results of assembly polls are surely a warning bell for the political parties. As the saying goes 'United we stand' fits well for farming community at this juncture."

There are 174 illegal private schools operational in villages without requisite approvals for the buildings, officials of education department in Gautam Budh Nagar district said.

The Uttar Pradesh government on April 23, 1976, had established the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) and, according to the Master Plan 2021, the city is spread across 2,031 hectares, comprising 81 villages and 168 Sectors including residential, commercial and Industrial uses.

The Noida authority has the mandate to regulate buildings of all kinds, including schools, in urban and rural areas. It has the power to issue notices and seal illegal and unsafe buildings.

After the twin building collapse in Greater Noida's Shahberi, in July 2018, killed nine persons, the Noida authority had conducted a survey and identified illegal buildings in all villages.

On August 3, the Noida authority had identified 1,757 buildings, which were constructed without approvals.

""However, we did not count unsafe buildings, which are being used for schools in villages. The administration and education department should look into this issue,"" a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to media, said.

Noida authority chief executive officer Alok Tandon and additional chief executive officer RK Mishra were unavailable for comment on the issue despite repeated attempts to reach them. The authority' officer on special duty, RK Singh, refused comment on the issue.

Over 70 of 174 illegal schools are operational in Noida villages, officials of education department said.

""We had acted against illegal schools in 2017 and over 85 were shut down then. We are taking necessary action in this regard and schools, which are illegal, will face tough legal action,"" BN Singh, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.

Officials of the district administration may also write to the Noida authority as to why it did not act against owners of buildings, where illegal schools are operational.

These illegal schools cater to over 1 lakh students. They do not have affiliations to the Uttar Pradesh state education board, the Central Board of Secondary Education or any other board. These schools mostly cater to the children of factory workers and daily age earners, who cannot afford to send their children to recognised private schools.

""Each school, on an average, accommodates over 1,000 students and the fee is in the range of ₹800 to ₹1,500 a month. All these schools are sheltered by the education department.

The spokesperson further said that once the proposal is cleared by the cabinet, the process for other requisite formalities would be initiated on fast track. The university would generate capabilities for the development of knowledge, skills and competence at various levels in the fields of physical education and sports sciences, sports technology and high-performance training of all sports and games.

It would also provide coaching facilities and state-of-the-art infrastructure, besides efficient institutional support and ecosystem to budding athletes to tap their potential at an early stage, the spokesperson added.

Tripura's BJP-IPFT government has imposed a set of restrictions on creating new government jobs in the state. It has also advised abolition of vacant posts that are no longer required and in case new ones are being created.

A Finance Department memo on the creation of posts and filling up of vacant posts issued by Chief Secretary LK Gupta on December 17 said that Tripura already has the highest ratio of government employment in the country in proportion to its population. Fresh recruitments should, therefore, be done to fill post rendered vacant post- retirements every year.

""The need for this provision arises due to the fact that salaries and wages constitute the largest item of expenditure and it is absolutely necessary to exercise financial prudence and discipline while committing expenditure under these heads"", the memo reads.

It also said that each department in state government has a number of posts created in the past that are vacant and no longer required. ""Hence, whenever a department submits a proposal for post creation, it should be accompanied by a proposal for surrender/abolition of posts with equivalent financial implications"", the memo added.

Advertising

Restrictions were imposed on filling up of vacant posts saying all departments must ensure that no process of filling up vacant posts is initiated without prior concurrence of the Finance Department. Violation of the newly laid out plans would invite disciplinary action against officers concerned.

""Some departments have a wrong notion that the Finance Department has unlimited funds for salaries and wages and that it is their entitlement to fill up all the vacant posts and create new ones. This is not the case"", the memo said.

The Department of School Education has violated these instructions and was asked to explain their action. Earlier this year, the department announced recruitment in over 14,000 teaching positions to fill up vacancies that were to be created by the retirement of 10,323 school teachers who were terminated by the Supreme Court in 2017.

As per the new rules, the Finance Department would monitor the expenditure on salaries and wages by each department on a monthly basis and impose cuts from a non-salary budget for departments that exceed their approved funds.

Erstwhile Left Front government, in Delegation of Financial Power Rules (DFPRT), 2017, said that creation of new posts, filling up of vacant posts by direct recruitment, engagement of Daily Rated Workers, Multi Purpose Workers, contingent workers and contractual employees would need prior concurrence from the finance department.

(AP) Barbed wire and hundreds of cameras ring a massive compound of more than 30 dormitories, schools, warehouses and workshops in China's far west. Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside. Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams. This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region where, by some estimates, 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination.

Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately-owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina.

The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labour from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S., Badger CEO John Anton said on Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centres, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang.

According to them, people in the centres have signed agreements to receive vocational training. The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media on Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centres, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories.

Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said -- barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang.

A person with first-hand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees -- or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there -- are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his month long detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. ""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating back to ancient traders on the Silk Road.

In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls.

Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training center"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report.

Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the center is government-operated.""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training centre collabourated with companies to give trainees practical experience.

Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility."" Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller.

The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labour and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory.

In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements.

Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College.

However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labour. All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labour.

Badger chief executive Anton said on Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China.

Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts. ""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan.

But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labour is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labour in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia.

The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labour.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uighurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labour,"" said Smith.

""U.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases.

The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Not all the camps have forced labour. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labour in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories.

The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centres. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labour program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push.

A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes. A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing.

Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program.

Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training."" The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away.

They were taken to a government office and handed labour contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign. If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual labourers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday.

Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

Schools in Nagapattinam district that functioned as relief camps for a few weeks after Cyclone Gaja continue to provide refuge to the affected people at night.

Classes are conducted as usual during the day in schools in Vizhundamavadi, Vettaikaraniruppu, Kovilpathu, Vellapallam and Pushpavanam dotting the coastal stretch between Nagapattinam and Vedaranyam.

After the school hours, displaced residents occupy the classrooms.

The start of relief camps, most of them in schools and other educational institutions, in Nagapattinam and other coastal districts well before the cyclone made its landfall, saved scores of lives.

In Nagapattinam district alone, 77,319 families comprising 1,09,480 men, 1,29,924 women, and 46,063 children were accommodated in 415 camps.

The Nagapattinam district administration declared holidays for schools that housed displaced people in large numbers.

But, subsequently, authorities prevailed upon the displaced people to render their cooperation for smooth conduct of the schools during the day time. There was a compulsion for the Education department to complete the stipulated number of working days in an academic year.

Initially, there was misconception among the displaced people that only those who remained in relief camps would get benefits announced by the State government. They were convinced after repeated assurances by government officials that their fears were misplaced, a senior official of School Education Department said. Fortunately, they also realised their responsibility towards the student community. In most of the camps, children's families were the ones who were displaced, the official said.

Their presence was not felt since the building infrastructure was much more in proportion to pupil strength. The district administration took care of the daily water and food requirements of the people living in the camps, he explained.

""According to a study by ICRIER (a research firm), USD 100 billion investment will have seven-fold multiplier effect on GDP. There is a need of a national mission to make this happen. We are going to launch broadband readiness index for states which will be vital for investments.""Aruna Sundararajan, Telecom Secretary

She said the Ministry of Electronics and IT have also shown interest in states readiness index and want to expand it further.

The telecom ministry will hold first workshop on implementation of the National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP) which envisages USD 100 billion investment in telecom sector by 2022, broadband connectivity at 50 megabit per second speed to every citizen, telecom connectivity at every corner of India and creating 40 lakh jobs.

""This is first preparatory national workshop on implementation of NDCP in which 25 states have confirmed to participate. Here we will launch National Broadband Mission to achieve objective of broadband for all.""

Industry leaders and associations will discuss at the NDCP workshop issues they are facing in states especially in rolling out telecom infrastructure which in turn impact investments.

""We want to ensure that 5G is not limited to urban areas. It should reach rural areas. For this, we have to work with states to ensure that there is 100 percent penetration of optical fibre cables. Without massive OFC penetration, 5G services will not expand. States have to provide smooth right of way permissions,"" Sundararajan said.

5G networks are said to provide broadband speed of upto 1 Gbps. Theoretically, a high definition 2-hour video can be downloaded in 5 seconds at this speed.

The telecom secretary said there is a need to increase mobile tower base by three times and OFC rollout by four-folds to achieve 'broadband for all' target under the National Broadband Mission.

""We have to roll out wifi services in rural and urban areas. To deliver benefit of NDCP to people and create jobs, states have to come forward. We will do comparative evaluation of all states and highlight best policies for other states to adopt it.""

The telecom ministry has floated tender to roll out 10 lakh wifi hotspot across all 2.5 lakh village panchayats.

At present, 1.21 lakh panchayats are ready with broadband services infrastructure. The DoT has awarded task to roll out wifi services in 62,0000 panchayats to Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) and is working with ITI for setting up wifi hotpsots in other panchayats.

""Broadband services have been started in all panchayats covered under Phase 1. Now we are looking at utilisation of broadband where states need to come forward and identify institutions like school, police stations etc that are to be connected with wifi.""

She said states have to ensure that there is enough electronic equipment available at their institutions to start using BharatNet broadband network for various services like tele-medicine, E-health, E-education etc.

""DoT is working to create state-of-the-art telecom infrastructure in next four years and we want states to draw a road map to start using it. At the workshop, we will work on yearly targets that states need to achieve.""

She said the telecom ministry will discuss with states usage of broadband for development at aspirational districts, enhancing connectivity in Naxal-affected areas, north eastern states and islands.

While a similar project proposed earlier was shot down because of lack of funds, officials are hopeful that underprivileged students will finally be able to get their hands on this 'elite' technology, this time around.

According to officials in the civic body, the proposed virtual reality classroom will go beyond pairs of VR goggles and envisions a complete immersive environment. It is learnt that the VR setup proposed will also include chairs, state-of-the-earth goggles, headsets with motion tracking sensors and special interiors.

""Teachers will be able to ingrain concepts in students' minds easily with this technology,"" said a top corporation official, explaining experiencing how body parts work or seeing space in VR, would leave a lasting impression in students.

VR setups in the city, which are generally present in malls, are limited to gaming and cater to a very small section of society. ""We want to give students this modern technology even before private schools,"" said the official, claiming that the facility will be open to students from all corporation schools and can help broaden horizons.

Officials from the corporation's Education department, also expressed confidence in the proposal's potential to induce an affinity to technology. ""Students often think that engineering courses are just about coding. A virtual reality classroom can break that stereotype even as the market for VR and augmented reality grows around the world,"" said a senior official.

Acting against certain government and aided polytechnic colleges for ""not following norms"", the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has directed them to slash their student intake by 25-50 per cent. Some of these institutions have also been put in the 'no admission' category.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and Congress, embroiled in a feud over his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, have five days to reach a deal before a partial government shutdown could leave about a quarter of the federal workforce without paychecks.

Trump has demanded $5 billion as a down-payment on construction of a huge wall that he argues is the only way to keep illegal immigrants and drugs from entering the United States.

""Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line!"" Trump wrote in a Twitter posting on Monday. ""Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control.""

Democrats and some Republicans argue there are less costly, more effective border controls.

The money Trump wants is a fraction of the roughly $450 billion Congress was poised to approve - before the latest battle over the proposed wall - to fund several agencies which will otherwise run out of money on Friday.

Large swaths of the government already are funded through next September, including the U.S. military and agencies that operate public healthcare, education and veterans' programs.

Last Tuesday, Trump and leading congressional Democrats battled each other in front of television cameras in the White House Oval Office.

""I am proud to shut down the government for border security,"" Trump told House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.

Since then, a senior House Republican aide said his party was ""in a pickle"" over how to keep the government open.

The aide noted that Republicans, who will control both houses of Congress until Jan. 3, will not be able to muster the minimum 218 votes needed in the House to pass a funding bill if it contains Trump's demand for border wall money.

During the White House meeting, Pelosi and Schumer proposed two ideas for keeping the government fully funded, which included money for border security but not for a wall. Aides to both on Monday said Trump had not yet responded.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opened the Senate on Monday urging completion of a spending bill. ""We need to make a substantial investment in the integrity of our border and in the safety of American our families,"" McConnell said.

Neither he nor his aides would specify whether border security investments must include wall funds. Aides to House Speaker Paul Ryan were not immediately available for comment.

If funds run out, the NASA space programme would potentially be unfunded, along with national parks, the U.S. diplomatic corps and agriculture programs.

Similarly, the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security would be vulnerable to shutdowns, although ""essential"" employees, such as FBI agents, airport security screeners and border patrol agents, would still report to work.

Their paychecks, however, would not be issued until the shutdown ends and Congress would have to decide whether to award back pay for them as well as any furloughed workers.

A government in disarray might play poorly for Republicans, especially if Americans also view images for two weeks of Trump vacationing at his exclusive Florida beach-front mansion.

""After the president's comments earlier this week when he said he was going to own the shutdown, that sealed the deal for Democrats. There is absolutely no reason for them to cut a deal with this president,"" said Jim Manley, a political strategist and former Senate Democratic leadership aide.

The House is not even bothering to come to work until Wednesday night.

Barring a deal, Manley predicted the government will limp along until Jan. 3, when Democrats take control of the House and promptly advance funding, daring the Republican-led Senate to reject it.

The study titled 'Presentation of a retrospective appraisal on prevention of child marriages in Tamil Nadu' was conducted to find out specific reasons for child marriages in Tamil Nadu and to form evidence-based documentation. The findings of the study were shared with the press on Monday here.

Around 1,636 child marriages were stopped by the State government in 2017. The study group reviewed these cases to identify the driving factors of child marriages in the State. The group found that there were two types of child marriage: One decided by the children themselves and the other decided by the family.

The reasons vary between these two types. The study shows that 95 per cent of marriages were decided due to love affair and four per cent of marriages due to broken family and no one being ready to take care, and one per cent due to pregnancy before marriage.

In arranged marriages, 33 per cent took place due to financial problems of the family. Around 17 per cent were due to fear of love and 11 per cent due to preferential marriage. Also 11 per cent were due to safety issues and sickness of family members, seven per cent due to family norms, and two per cent due to migration of parents and two per cent due to child education related issues.

Also two per cent were due to dowry, two per cent due to other reasons like illicit relationship of parents posing threat to the safety of the child, pre-marital pregnancy of the child. Around one per cent due to exchange of child for loan, and one per cent due to more number of children in the family.

The government actually does not recognise the existence of Rohingya and rather considers them as Bengali.

Stripped of their basic rights, community members have been submitted to extreme violence and atrocities in Myanmar. More than 87,000 people have been displaced since October. For years now, many have fled to neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, where they live a life in limbo.

State counsellor Aung Saan Suu Kyi has thus far remained silent on the issue.

Bangladesh has some 32,000 registered refugees in two official camps located mainly in the Cox's Bazar district bordering the eastern Rakhine State. An additional 200,000 to 500,000 unregistered refugees live in makeshift camps there, alongside locals.

Having faced a continuous flow of Rohingya refugees for over two decades, the Bangladesh government is now planning to relocate the refugees to a remote island in Noakhali district, Thengar Char, about 250 km northwest of current camps.

The government says the move would improve refugees' access to humanitarian assistance. But Rohingya refugees reportedly oppose the plan, and human rights groups have urged the government to cancel the plan, which the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network has declared to be ""dangerous, absurd and inhumane"". Rights groups argue that the island is uninhabitable: it rose from the sea only 11 years ago and is highly prone to flooding and cyclones.

The Bangladeshi people of Cox's Bazar and the Rohingya refugees share a common dialect and culture. As a result, law enforcement forces cannot always differentiate between refugees and locals. Despite restrictions on their ability to work, many refugees find employment in the informal sector, and some children go to local schools. The government has reluctantly allowed the refugees to stay so far, but it is clearly concerned that such opportunities will lead to integration.

Thengar Char is a remote island in the most literal sense. The nearest sub-district office, Hatiya, is two hours away by boat. The surrounding areas are poor and underdeveloped.

For the government, it is easier to manage a refugee population that is concentrated on Thengar Char. Locals there do not speak the same dialect as Rohingyas, decreasing the potential for integration. It will also be practically impossible for them to seek employment and education outside the camp.

But the relocation would also make it very difficult for the UNHCR/UN Refugee Agency International Organisation for Migration and local NGOs to provide humanitarian services. Currently, agencies are mainly based in Cox's Bazar, a popular Bangladeshi tourist destination with the longest sea-beach in the world. It is well connected to Bangladesh and other parts of the world by land and air and offers staff the comforts of living in a city, including basic facilities and security.

Thengar Char, on the other hand, is an exceptional place in overpopulated Bangladesh: it has no human settlement. Villagers who live nearby complain of pirates roaming the nearby waters, stealing goods and holding people hostage. The area's security risks and remoteness may discourage humanitarian agency staffers from relocating there.

The Bangladesh forest department has warned that the Thengar Char island is not yet suitable for human habitation, writing in a letter that:

The soil and environment of Thengar Char is not yet suitable for human settlement. The island is submerged in water during monsoon. Though it emerges during dry season, most of the island goes under water at high tide.

Cyclone are of significant concern. According to a catalogue of tropical storms in Bangladesh, 193 cyclones struck the country between 1484 and 2009. Arguably the deadliest tropical cyclone in history hit the region in 1970, battering the coast with a six-metre storm surge and killing some 300,000 people. If even a small-scale cyclone hits the proposed Rohingya camp, a human catastrophe is nearly certain.

The Noakhali district administration has written that the government would also have to ""build flood protection embankment, cyclone centres and necessary infrastructure and ensure supply of drinking water"" before receiving the Rohingyas in the Thengar Char.

For the Rohingyas, current border camps in Cox's Bazar are close to home not just culturally but also geographically. For some, crossing into Bangladesh is as easy as wading through a little creek on foot or taking a short boat trip.

When Myanmar erupts in violence, many Rohingyas seek safety in Bangladesh, and, when it ends, some of them head back home. There is usually no asylum application, refugee-status determination procedure or UN-assisted voluntary repatriation; registration was last done in 1992. The country's hundreds of thousands of unregistered Rohingya migrants live in limbo, as Bangladesh lacks specific refugee laws.

During relative peace, many Rohingyas also cross the border to seek medical treatment, education, marriage, daily shopping trips, or to visit relatives. Some will embark on a secondary migration, heading to Saudi Arabia or Malaysia. Many of these practices likely violate Bangladeshi law, but they are locally accepted and have been going on for generations.

Newly arrived refugees or migrants often get shelter and other assistance from relatives already living in Bangladesh's camps. Many refugees in the camp also act as bridge between Rohingyas living in Myanmar and the diaspora of approximately one million others who live around the world.

Bangladesh has been negotiating with Myanmar to repatriate the Rohingyas. Many Rohingyas in Bangladesh have expressed their willingness to go back to their homeland if state authorities can ensure their safety.

However, the risk of persecution and violence in Myanmar remains high, and most refugees do not consider it safe there. International law requires that the Bangladeshi government only send back refugees who would voluntarily repatriate.

If the alternative to life in Myanmar is banishment to Thengar Char, many Rohingyas might ""agree"" to return rather than face a dangerous and uncertain future on a remote island of Bangladesh."

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has also advised parents to not approach these schools till the department issues further orders in case any penal action is initiated against schools found to be defaulting the new rules.

""In order to maintain transparency and uniformity in admission, the admission process of these 105 schools at entry level for session 2019-20 shall be on hold till further orders,"" a senior DoE official who was familiar with the matter said. ""If it is found that the said schools are taking admissions despite being prevented to do so, necessary action as per norms will be taken without any further notice,"" the official added.

The distance of student's residence from school, sibling quota, parents being alumni of the school, single child, first child are some of the criteria listed by schools for admissions to the entry-level classes. According to the schedule released by the DoE, the application window will be open from Saturday and the last date of submitting application forms for nursery class admission for 2019-20 session is January 7.

The first list of selected children, along with marks secured by them, will be out on February 4.

The second list will be out on February 21 and the nursery admission process will conclude on March 31.

Twenty-five per cent seats in pre-school, pre-primary and class 1 will be reserved for economically weaker sections EWS)/disadvantaged groups under the Right To Education Act. The directorate had instructed all private schools to upload their criteria -- with points for each criterion -- for admission in open seats, on its official website by December 14. There is, however, no clarity yet on the schedule of the EWS admissions.

The government has also set an upper age limit of less than four years to be eligible for nursery, less than five years for kindergarten, and less than six years for admission to class 1. The proposal for an upper age limit was challenged in the court last year. Though a Delhi High Court order last year had allowed the imposition of the upper age limit, the DoE had decided that the order will be applicable only from 2019 academic session. Apart from the abolished criteria, the schools have been given autonomy to come up with their own points system.

The students of KM Public School were writing their Hindi paper in the open in the absence of enough classrooms to house 150 students in total.

Police said the construction material used to build the wall was of poor quality. But residents of nearby villages said the wall gave in because an earthmover was digging an adjacent construction site and had made the soil at the base of the wall loose. The accident occurred around 9.30am.

Vivek Kumar (7) and Bhupender Singh (10), both students of Class I, were declared dead on arrival at hospitals. Those battling serious injuries have been identified as Naitik (8), Amit (7), Ashish Kumar (8) and Akash (9). The students were writing their test within metres of the wall as the sun was shining bright on the area on a chilly Monday morning.

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has directed the district administration to conduct a speedy investigation and bring the culprits to book. The adjacent plot that was being dug is owned by Deshraj Bhati and his son Sumit. Despite a notice to shut it down, the school was being run by Deshraj's nephew Amit Bhati.

An FIR has been lodged on a complaint by the district administration against Amit Bhati, principal Sanjeev Jha, school organiser Raghvender Solanki, and owners of the adjacent plot Sumit and Deshraj Bhati. The FIR has been lodged under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC and under provisions of the Juvenil Justice (care and protection of children) Act, 2000.

The school has 150 students in total from nursery to Class VIII. As it has only five rooms, including that of the principal, the students are often made to sit in the open. Police said the wall collapsed around 9.30am. The excavator had entered the plot and had been removing mounds of earth. When its wheels reached near the wall, it collapsed on the students who were sitting on the other side.

A police team reached the school within 10 minutes and started rescue operations. ""The National Disaster Response Force was called in for help. The injured students were rushed to Yatharth Hospital in Sector 110 and Prayag Hospital in Sector 41,"" circle officer Shwetabh Pandey said.

But it was the local residents who rushed in to bring the students out of the debris before the police and NDRF teams arrived. ""When the wall collapsed, the school staff fled the spot in fear. The villagers rushed in to help and brought the students out from under the rubble. Many of them were bleeding profusely. We called the police control room after that,"" said Raghav Singh, a villager.

""Three students were rushed to our hospital, of whom one was already dead. One of the two injured students will have to undergo an elbow surgery and the other is being treated for various injuries,"" said Shoaib, a doctor at the emergency ward of Prayag hospital.

Basic education officer Balmukund Prasad said that in August 2017, the education department had served a notice on the school, threatening to issue a fine of Rs 1 lakh if it did not close down. The name of the school was Khajana Devi then. ""After being issued the notice, they reopened the school with another name, KM Public School, without our knowledge. The education department will also lodge an FIR against the school owner and the management,"" Prasad said.

Trai has made a preliminary set of recommendations for 5G, which is under examination of the ministry, she said. But since the ecosystem is not ready, it (spectrum auction) will be only after July-August next year. ""The minister has given a timeline of 2020 for 5G rollout and it (5G rollout) will start at that time. But it doesn't mean the whole country will have 5G at one go,"" she said on the sidelines of a seminar on national digital communications policy (NDCP) vision of the telecom department. Sundararajan said 5G technology field trials have begun.

The task force referred by the secretary is the 5G steering committee, chaired by Stanford University's professor emeritus AJ Paulraj. The panel has made several recommendations to drive 5G adoptions in areas like spectrum policy, regulatory policy, standards and education to DoT.

Earlier, the telecom regulatory authority of India (Trai) had recommended auction of 8,644 MHz at an estimated base price of Rs 4.9 trillion, which included radio waves for 5G services.

The telecom ministry's panel on 5G has said 6,000 Mhz spectrum can be made available without delay for the next generation mobile service. Vodafone Idea, a key telecom player, said on Sunday that it has urged DoT to delay auction to as the 5G ecosystem is not ready and 4G optimisation will happen by then.

The July-August timeline is significant for telcos preparedness for the auction in view of the huge debt that the industry is reeling under. They blame it on pressure on their revenue and profitability due to heightened competition in the sector.

In August, Trai recommended auction of airwaves across seven 4G bands, besides 5G spectrum. The regulator slashed the base price of premium 700 MHz band by 43 per cent to Rs 6,568 crore a unit and also set Rs 492 crore per unit as the minimum rate for 5G.

Sundararajan also asked states to ensure full utilisation of the BharatNet infrastructure. ""But for few, most states have not been able to use them (the BharatNet Infra), so we are now bringing private players and some PSUs for WiFi services. After WiFi, utilisation will be ensured,"" she said.

The ministry will also sign MoUs with states to use the BharatNet connectivity and connect various development institutions. ""We are asking states if they want dark fibre, they can take it from BharatNet Infrastructure and market it. We will go for revenue-sharing with states to incentivise them. This idea is to create not just a supply push but also a demand pull for this infrastructure to raise its (BharatNet) utilization,"" she said.

The secretary asked states to rationalise levies for rights-of-way permission to telcos for laying fibres and setting up towers. ""If you levy 40-50 times the charges, how will the infrastructure be built,"" the secretary asked.

""We are preparing the country for 5G through aggressive fiberisation. To meet the need for large number of towers, as envisaged under the 5G roadmap, then we have to bring states on boards as the power to grant rights of ways for setting up towers are with states,"" she said. Sundararajan also said the government planned to raise optic fibre cable spread from 1.8 million km to 5.5 million km by 2022. On WiFi, she said, ""Our effort is to do as much as possible by March 2019 and Wi-Fi should be available in six months,"" Sundararajan said. She was responding to questions on BharatNet deadline, which is around the corner.

The event, also attended by states, was part of the government push to speed up BharatNet programme expansion that aims to connect 250,000 gram panchayats. It also aims to achieve $100 billion of investment, create 4 million jobs and with $120 billion of additional revenue contribute $670 billion to GDP, she said. The Centre also aims to soon launch national broadband mission with association with states.

In a bid to evolve a plan of action on preventing child marriages in Tamil Nadu, the Indian Council for Child Welfare, in collaboration with UNICEF Chennai and the Department of Social Welfare, has come out with an evidence-based report identifying the determinants of the age-old practice in the State.

A study has shown that nearly 75 % of 1,156 child marriages, which were stopped by the government in 2017, were arranged by parents. In the arranged marriages, 52 % of the parents had not asked the consent of the child. A total of 1,636 child marriages had been stopped, of which data from 1,156 marriages had been analysed.

""Any plan of action that we take towards preventing child marriages should be based on data we have available, which is why we sought to look at the determinants. There is a whole range of emotional factors involved as well and a comprehensive plan of action needs to take everything into consideration,"" explained Girija Kumarababu, honorary general secretary, ICCW-TN.

The determinants for arranged child marriages indicated that nearly 33 % of the cases, the marriage was fixed owing to economic problems of the child's family. This was followed by reasons such as the girl child would have a love affair, safety issues and sickness of family members.

V. Amudhavalli, Commissioner, Social Welfare department, pointed out that the factors tend to vary across districts in the State. ""At the same time, wherever the government mechanisms such as ChildLine have been effectively publicised, more number of cases get reported in those districts. We need all the stakeholders, including the department as well as NGOs, to come together and work towards its prevention,"" she said.

While nearly 46 % of the child marriages were found to have been stopped after engagement, 29 % on the day of the marriage.

Several cases reported in Tamil Nadu, especially through calls on the ChildLine 1098, were by friends of the girl who was about to get married.

While delayed reporting is a major challenge, the report indicated that field workers did not have vehicles to travel far and often faced threats from village leaders or other people.

""Education plays an important part in addressing the gaps and since there are schools in remote areas, all the children should be sensitised about 1098 and reporting any cases that they hear of.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

""Some teachers who own a laptop or tablet, are utilizing it in the classrooms and rest of them are teaching with their mobile phones. Some teachers have spent their money and purchased speakers to at least make it audible to everyone,"" he added.

Another teacher from Pollachi block said he had started to teach students in group. ""Playing the same video again and again I would go to each and every bench separately, so that the students could get a better view and understand what is happening in it,"" he added.

It is time consuming, but do we have any other option, he questioned, adding that if only the department could either provide smart class or distribute tablets or laptops to the schools, the real purpose of introducing video lessons could be achieved.

Even though the students could see the videos back at home, real learning takes place only when it is discussed and learned along with fellow students, the teacher added.

There are over 1,027 government schools in the district and only 50% of them have at least one smart class in their campus and tablets were distributed only to 295 government elementary schools including 237 government middle schools.

""It is just not enough if the government initiates innovative methods, they should also ensure that students are benefitted without facing any difficulties,"" said another teacher from Annaimalai block, who have been struggling with the video lessons as they do not have proper network in that region.

When contacted, officials from the school education department said smart classes would be created in all government schools within a year and necessary steps has already been taken."

The tall claims of Government to provide the best healthcare facilities to people are far from reality as around seven hundred posts including medical officers and gynecologists are lying vacant in the Family Welfare Department in the State.

A senior official in the Family Welfare department told Rising Kashmir that it has sanctioned gazetted strength of 182 posts, of which 118 are in position and 64 are vacant.

""The 64 posts include 7 posts of gynecologists and 41 posts of Medical Officers (MOs). These are lying vacant over the years in J&K,"" the official said.

Due to the staff shortage, it has badly affected patients care both prenatal and postnatal services, especially at peripheries leaving people worried.

Not only this, the official said there are more than 600 posts of non-gazetted cadre lying vacant in the department across Jammu and Kashmir.

Briefing about the details he said the sanctioned non-gazetted cadre of the department is 3341 out of which 2716 are filled and 625 are vacant.

The non-gazetted cadre mostly comprises the posts of Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) and Female Multipurpose Health Workers (FMPHWs) which is 1812.

""Out of 625 vacant non-gazetted posts, 295 vacant posts including 151 posts of ANMs/FMPHWs and 144 Class IV posts have been have been referred to the J&K SSB for recruitment,"" he said.

The school education department has banned the traditional Kashmiri attire 'Pheran' in its zonal offices in the Valley.

The development comes in the backdrop of a similar ban on the Pheran in the civil secretariat (Srinagar) where the commoners visiting the administrative departments have to relinquish it at the main gate.

Following this, the Zonal Education Officer, Langate issued an order last week banning the wearing of Pheran for every official visiting the office.

""All the officials visiting this office are advised to visit with proper dress code during any official visit. It is recommended that no official will visit this office wearing 'Feran', traditional trousers and sleeper/Plastic shoes (sic),"" the order reads.

As per sources, the orders on similar lines are being issued at the behest of verbal orders from the Chief Education Officers in the Valley.

The civil secretariat security staff has put the Pherans on the barred items category.

The decision comes close on the heels of Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) removing Kashmiri from the online portal 'BashaSangam' following a complaint by some Kashmiri Pandits.

And all these decision of interfering with the Kashmiri language and indigenous Kashmiri dress is being looked in the Valley as a cultural onslaught carried by New Delhi on the Kashmiri people.

The move of the government banning the traditional Pheran leaves one wondrous with the former chief minister and National Conference Vice President Omar Abdullah being seen donning the Pheran frequently while the commoners are discriminated.

In 2014, Omar Abdullah had asked the Srinagar-based Army's 15 Corps to withdraw its order asking the journalist fraternity to refrain from wearing the Pheran.

""If the army has in fact told journalists not to wear a pheran to Corps HQ events that is unacceptable & the order should be withdrawn (sic),"" Omar wrote on Twitter in 2014. ""People wear their pheran with pride. It's part of our identity aside from the best way to stay warm in the cold. Can't ban pherans.""

Later the Army while retreating the order had termed the guideline as ""inadvertent"".

Peoples Democratic Party President Mehbooba Mufti also used to wear the Pheran frequently as chief minister while the commoners visiting the Srinagar civil secretariat had to keep their traditional attire atop the iron poles outside the secretariat premises.

Kashmiri politicians across ideological divide have been wearing the Pheran publicly, many times to strike an emotional chord with the local populace.

The Hurriyat (M) Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Faroooq along with Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front Chairman Muhammad Yasin Malik may not be wearing the Pheran for political reasons but they, because of their public profiles, also have been popularising the Pheran as a preferable formal dress in winter by choosing to wear it outside their homes in winters.

The Pheran was further popularized among the Kashmiri youth by Bollywood film actors including ShahidKapoor, RanbirKapoor and Salman Khan who during their film shoots in Kashmir chose to wear Pherans on and off the film shoots.

The Pheran is believed to have been brought into the Valley around 700 years ago from Central Asia where it was used as a cloak under the Persian name ""Pairahan"".

The Central Asian Pairahan is believed to have been adopted by the English who later called it the 'Apron' now donned by the doctors world over.

Over the years, the sale of the tweed cloth for the Pherans in the Valley has witnessed an upsurge while the tailors in the summer capital Srinagar been blending the traditional design of the Pheran with the English coat designs.

With attractive motifs, the popularity of designer Pherans in Kashmir is increasing by the day and Pheran have now crossed the geographical boundaries.

For centuries, Pheran has served as traditional apparel for Kashmiris to combat the harsh winter.

It is used with the traditional fire pot (Kangri) in tow, which serves as a reliable means to keep people warm."

The success of any task or activity depends upon the quality of preplanning and whether accomplish or not the objective must be attempted to solidify. To start with a strong monitoring mechanism is imminent in the School level and a rational commitment is needed from all the stakeholders. In my 20 years of continuous selfless attachment in Service Association work like ANSTA & NSEAOA what I personally observed is a logical working system is in the offing particularly management policies at all level and emphatically requires more inputs on academic interest. And to achieve its goal a tangible policy is impending to formulate through the blessing of political will to improvise its traditional tag. In this regard I would like to lay down the following humble suggestions as a measures for improvement of academic acceleration towards qualitative education in the department.

1. Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

12. The Government may plan for observance of Year of Academic Excellence for School Education Department."

Pointing to the expanding global footprint of Pondicherry University through several MOUs signed over the past year, Prof. Anjaneya Swamy, Dean - School of Management, said this presented a great prospect for students and faculty members to be associated with world-class institutions and gain exposure to global benchmarks and best practices in academia.

Dr. Laurent Thevenet expressed delight at the speed with which this MoU could materialise from the first point of contact made only a few months ago. UPEC is one of the most comprehensive and inclusive universities in France, with an annual enrolment of about 30,000 students, including 3,000 international students, he said.

Prof. Chitra Sivasubramanian, Head - Department of Management Studies, pointed out that France is the third most preferred destination worldwide for international students.

Through this MoU, France has become more accessible to the students of Pondicherry University, she added.

Prof. Victor Anandkumar, Department of Management Studies and MoU coordinator, expressed confidence that this collaboration would be made operational through exchange of MBA students from the academic year 2019-20.

The MoU signing ceremony was also attended by Prof. Balakrishnan, Director of Studies, Educational Innovations and Rural Reconstruction; Prof. Rajeev Jain, Director of Culture & Cultural Relations, Education; Dr. Sasi Kanta Dash, Registrar; A.K. Prakash, Finance Officer and K. Mahesh, Deputy Registrar."

Edited excerpts:

All the [officials] that we met they have mentioned that they have a very long lasting and good relations with Finland. If we think about the companies, the trade between two countries both trading goods and services is growing. We have so-called traditional sectors like pulp and paper, heavy industrial machinery and equipment and ICT [information and communications technology]. For example, Nokia has been here for many years. The business of traditional sectors is growing and then we have found some new potential sectors like artificial intelligence, IoT, different kinds of digital solutions and 5G. So, there is a lot of potential [between the two countries].

We always need to think about the business environment. If Finnish companies see that the business environment here is predictable, [like] there are no trade barriers...that will also be beneficial for both sides. If a Finnish company invests in India, most of the [professionals] they have, I would say 99.9%, are recruited from here. Finnish companies employ a lot of local people. When I talk to my counterparts and other Ministers, it's very important that we identify the areas where we have a common interest. For example, we [recently] signed a memorandum of understanding for 'Innovation Corridor' between Finland and the State of Karnataka. We have many MoUs as we plan to broaden bilateral collaboration. Other new areas we have identified are cybersecurity, environmental space, geological survey, vocational education and tourism.

We are a small country [and] are heavily dependent on exports and we are part of the European Union. EU has done a lot of free trade agreements with many different countries [but] we don't have a free trade agreement with India. And if there are customs tariffs or some restrictions in public procurement, that's deteriorating the [business] environment... we met [Union Minister for Commerce and Industry and Civil Aviation] Suresh Prabhu and discussed these issues [like access into the market]...I think the main message from the companies was that they need to know what kind of laws will be here... But we commend India for climbing up in the [World Bank's] 'ease of doing business index.' Also, the companies said [when] they contact the administration for any problems, they get answers really quickly.

We met the chairman of NTPC [India's largest electricity producer] and we had three companies with us who are global energy players. They have some projects, but I cannot tell anything specific as we are in the negotiation process. But I see if those projects proceed, that would be beneficial for both the countries. We also brought a [delegation] of small and medium-sized companies with us and they had discussions with their counterparts. Business Finland signed MoU with India's Department of Biotechnology for research cooperation. We are also looking to collaborate for IT-based healthcare.

The message I got from the [Finnish] companies is that they trust this market. They want to stay here and grow. There is a very positive thing about India, you have so many highly talented people.

We have launched 'Talent Boost programme' in Finland and we are trying to get your ICT professionals to work in Finland.

We also have accelerator and incubator programmes for start-ups. We don't give incentives [like granted by other countries] but we provide a very good environment to live and work and a lot of help."

The university would generate capabilities for the development of knowledge, skills and competence at various levels in the fields of physical education and sports sciences, sports technology and high-performance training of all sports and games.

It would also provide the best coaching facilities and state-of-the-art infrastructure, besides efficient institutional support and ecosystem to budding athletes to tap their potential at an early stage, the spokesperson added.

Schools run by the West Bengal government will soon have to put up a notice in classrooms, with detailed information about the curricula and chapters that would be taught by the teachers during a particular semester, an official said.

A notification has been issued by the department of school education, asking all state-run schools to abide by the instruction from the next academic session, he said.

""The new rule is aimed at giving the students a clear idea about what they will learn before the next summative internal assessment test. It will also apprise the teachers of the lessons they need to cover in a given period,"" the school department official said.

Three summative assessment tests are held every year in state-run schools - one during March-April, second around July-August and the third in November-December.

""Ideally, the schools can also put up the same notice somewhere on its campus, where the parents have access. The notice will have to be updated from time to time so that students have no confusion about their academic progress,"" the state official said.

Of the remaining 14 states, some are considering expanding Medicaid. States with recent activity relating to Medicaid expansion include - Florida, Idaho, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Utah. States continue to explore different opportunities as it relates to Medicaid expansion. Below we have highlighted recent state grassroots, legislative, and executive action to expand Medicaid.

On November 7, 2017, Maine became the 33 state (including DC) to expand Medicaid and the first state to do so through a citizen's initiative. The State legislature has previously voted on Medicaid expansion on five occasions. However, soon-to-be former Governor LePage repeatedly vetoed legislation expanding Medicaid.

On November 7, 2017, Maine residents voted on Maine Question 2, which required the State to provide Medicaid through the State's MaineCare for the new expansion population. The provision expands Medicaid to persons under the age of 65 with incomes equal to or below 138% FPL. The measure passed with 58.9% of the vote. The Maine Department of Health and Human Services had 90 days after the ballot initiative's effective date to submit a State Plan Amendment to HHS. The Governor failed to meet the 90 day deadline, so on April 30, 2018, the Maine Equal Justice Partners filed suit against the State claiming, ""the failure to expand Medicaid is harming low-income Mainers who by law should be eligible to receive Medicaid insurance this year.""

Oral arguments in the case were heard in early November 2018, however the legal matter is now in limbo because former Governor LePage lost her reelection bid during the November midterms. The new Governor-elect (and former state Attorney General) Janet Mills, is expected to make Medicaid Expansion a priority of her new administration.

In early June of 2018, Governor Northam signed two bills (HB 5001 and 5002) into law, which expand Medicaid to 138% of FPL. Virginia was the 2nd state under the Trump Administration to expand Medicaid (it is the 34 state to expand Medicaid). The Medicaid expansion was initially passed by the Virginia legislature on the condition that the expansion include a work requirement and other measures. Expansion will go into full effect in January 1, 2019.

On November 20, 2018, the state submitted an 1115 waiver application to CMS, titled Virginia COMPASS (Creating Opportunities for Medicaid Participants to Achieve Self- Sufficiency). The waiver requests the implementation of provisions tied to the Medicaid expansion. Specifically it is requesting approval to implement the work requirements (referred to as Virginia Training, Education, Employment, and Opportunity Program (TEEOP)), along with premiums and cost-sharing requirements for those between 100 and 138% of FPL, rewards for healthy behaviors, and housing support benefits for high-needs enrollees. Under the waiver adults ages 19 to 64 with incomes up to 138 percent of the FPL, who do not otherwise qualify for an exemption, must engage in qualifying work or community engagement activities. The work requirement hours will gradually escalate, beginning at 20 hours per month, three months after enrollment, increasing to 80 hours per month, 12 months after enrollment. With the exception of defined exemptions, enrollees shall be ineligible to receive Medicaid benefits, if during any three months of the year they fail to meet the required engagement hours. CMS is currently reviewing this waiver application. To read more about the Virginia 1115 waiver, please click here.

A ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to 133% of the Federal Poverty Line in Idaho passed with more than 60% of the vote during this year's midterm elections but now it faces legal battle. Proposition 2 (the name of the ballot initiative) has been challenged by the Idaho Freedom Foundation, a think tank that advocates for free markets and reregulation. It will be heard by the Idaho Supreme Court in 2019, with oral arguments starting January 29th, but there is no clear date as to when the court is expected to have a decision.

Governor-elect and former Idaho Lieutenant Governor Brad Little, who overtook Democrat Paulette Jordan in the November gubernatorial race, was not a proponent of the initiative, however he stated during the election cycle that he would ""adhere to the will of the voters."" According to Forbes, 69,000 new individuals in Idaho should gain coverage when the initiative goes into effect. This will lower the uninsured rate in the state by almost 5%.

This fall, The Fairness Project led a successful campaign expand Medicaid in Nebraska. The ballot measure, titled Nebraska Initiative 427, passed with 54% of the vote. Governor Ricketts, who won reelection in November, strongly opposed the initiative during the election cycle, The initiative now requires the state to expand Medicaid to 138% of the federal poverty line. It also requires the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to file a state expansion plan with CMS by April 1, 2019.

On March 27, 2018 Governor Herbert signed H.B. 472 into law. The legislation expands Medicaid coverage to include those at or below 95% FPL and not eligible for enrollment in the Medicaid program, with the exception of the Primary Care Network Program. Additionally, the HB 472 includes a work requirement provision for the new expansion population. In the 2018 November primary, Utah residents voted to expand Medicaid to the ACA's full FPL. The measures requires the State to provide Medicaid to persons under the age of 65 and with incomes below 138% FPL. The state will submit a request to CMS for the full 138% expansion in the coming months. (A waiver to implement the bill's provisions, such as work requirements and expanding coverage to those earning up to 95% of the federal poverty level, was submitted to CMS in June 2018 and is still under review by CMS.) To finance the State's portion of the costs associated with expanding Medicaid, the initiative increases the sales tax to 4.85%, currently set at 4.7%. The successful expansion will go into effect on April 1, 2019.

This November, Montana failed to pass a ballot initiative (I-185) that would have continued funding their Medicaid expansion beyond 2019. Expansion first took effect in 2016 after CMS approved a Medicaid expansion waiver. The ballot measure would have added a $2 tax on cigarettes and would have taxed other tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. Tobacco companies spent over $17 million dollars during the election season to prevent the initiative from succeeding. This is over double what those who favored the initiative were able to raise. Unless state lawmakers move to continue funding for the expansion, it will expire, making Montana the first state to undo an ACA expansion.

Earlier this year, the California legislature considered two sister bills that would expand the full scope of Medi-Cal benefits to undocumented adults over the age of 19 who, with the exception of their immigration status, would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid benefits. The bills were effectively shelved without a full committee vote after the passage of a budget that did not account for the potential cost of the initiatives.

On December 3 , state Assembly Member Joaquin Arambula introduced a new bill, AB-4, with the same ambitions. Given the former support for expanding the benefit to undocumented adults, it is possible that the bill will end up on Governor-elect Gavin Newsom's desk, where he may feel pressure to uphold his campaign promises of a universal health system in California.

The Legislature's Analyst Office (LAO) estimates the total net state cost of expanding coverage is approximately $3 billion for 2018-2019. Approximately 3 million individuals living in California remain uninsured. The same report details nearly 60% of those uninsured lack legal statuses; of this population, approximately 1.2 million individuals would qualify for benefits through Medi-Cal.

North Carolina introduced a bill, ""H.B. 662, titled Carolina Cares,"" on April 6, 2017, that would expand coverage to residents not currently eligible for Medicaid with annual incomes up to 133% FPL. It also includes a provision that terminates enrollment if individuals fail to complete premium contributions within 60 days of their due date and would also include work requirements. The bill is still being considered. The state submitted a corresponding 1115 waiver amendment request that includes the provisions outlined in the Carolina Cares bill on November 20, 2017. CMS approved portions of the waiver on October 24, 2018, but did not approve waiver requests outlined in the Carolina Care bill (i.e., work requirements and premiums) since the state does not have legislative authority to implement these provisions."

It further informed that over 50 boys and girls each will be provided with the best of football facilities and guidance in all the 30 Grassroots Football Schools while the Centre of Excellence for Football will have both education and football training facilities for 100 boys.

The letter of intent for setting up of this Centre was handed over by the Chief Minister to Burzis S Taraporevala, Senior Advisor of Tata Trusts.

Trump has demanded $5 billion as a down payment on construction of a huge wall that he argues is the only way to keep illegal immigrants and drugs from crossing into the United States, again pushing the proposal in an early morning tweet on Monday. Democrats and some Republicans argue there are less costly, more effective border controls.

The money Trump wants is only a small fraction of the roughly $450 billion Congress was poised to approve - before the latest battle over the proposed wall - to fund several agencies which will otherwise run out of money on Dec. 21.

Large swaths of the government already are funded through next September, including the U.S. military and agencies that operate public healthcare, education and veterans' programs.

Several Republican and Democratic congressional aides on Friday said there was no apparent progress being made toward resolving the standoff, after Trump and leading congressional Democrats battled each other on Tuesday in front of television cameras in the White House Oval Office.

""I am proud to shut down the government for border security,"" Trump told House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.

Since then, a senior House Republican aide said his party was ""in a pickle"" over how to keep the government open.

The aide noted that Republicans, who will control both houses of Congress until Jan. 3, will not be able to muster the minimum 218 votes needed in the House to pass a funding bill if it contains Trump's demand for border wall money, which Democrats oppose.

If funds run out on Dec. 21, the NASA space program would potentially be unfunded, along with national parks, the U.S. diplomatic corps and agriculture programs.

Similarly, the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security would be vulnerable to shutdowns, although ""essential"" employees, such as FBI agents, airport security screeners and border patrol agents, would still report to work.

Their paychecks, however, would not be issued until the shutdown ends and Congress would have to decide whether to award back pay for them as well as any furloughed workers.

A government in such disarray might not play well for Republicans over the holiday period, especially if Americans also view images for two weeks of Trump vacationing at his exclusive Florida beach-front mansion.

""After the president's comments earlier this week when he said he was going to own the shutdown, that sealed the deal for Democrats. There is absolutely no reason for them to cut a deal with this president,"" said Jim Manley, a political strategist and former Senate Democratic leadership aide.

With the clock ticking, the House is not even bothering to come to work until Wednesday night.

For now, Democrats are waiting for the White House to signal whether it will engage on legislation that would keep programs operating, but without money for Trump's wall.

Lt Governor Anil Baijal Monday asked the Delhi government to audit all third party-run children homes and shelter homes in the city to ensure the safety and security of the inmates. Baijal also instructed officials concerned to deploy more female civil defence volunteers and guards in schools to instill a sense of security among the girl students, an official statement said.

The move comes a day after the sixth anniversary of the 'Nirbhaya' gang rape case.

The lieutenant governor issued a number of directions as he chaired a meeting of the 'Task Force on Women Safety' here. ""The LG directed Social Welfare department to make arrangements for auditing all the children homes as well as shelter homes run by third party under their jurisdiction to ensure safety and security of the inmates to avoid any untoward incidents,"" the LG's office said in the statement.

It further stated that he also directed the Education secretary to ensure that regular inspections are carried out in schools to identify and address security deficiencies in the institutions.

It added that the LG asked the Transport department to expedite the process of installing emergency buttons in DTC buses connected with the Delhi Police headquarters.

A 23-year-old paramedical student was gang-raped in a moving bus in Delhi six years ago on 16th December, and she later died at a hospital. The incident triggered massive outrage and protests across the country, and she subsequently came to be known as 'Nirbhaya', the fearless."

In order to celebrate the unique characteristic of our country, Bhasha Sangam provides an opportunity to schools and educational institution (BIETS, DIETs, CTEs/IASEs, SCERTs, SIEs, School Boards, Directorates of School Education, etc.) to provide multilingual exposure to students in Indian Languages. The objective is to familiarize every child with simple dialogues in all the 22 languages under Schedule VIII of the Constitution of India, taking up one language on each working day, to enhance linguistic tolerance and promote national integration.

The initiative has been widely received and accepted by States and UTs in very positive manner and schools are introducing five simple and commonly used sentences as per their convenience without any additional load on school students. Also, more than 55,000 videos of such experiences have been shared by the schools. There are 77,510 views of these videos on YouTube and 97,83,762 impressions on Twitter.

Section 29(2)(F) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 states that ""medium of instruction shall, as far as practicable, be in child's mother tongue"". The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 emphasises the importance of imparting primary education in the mother tongue of the child. Since education is in the Concurrent List, States have the liberty to decide the medium of instruction in schools. The NCF also states that the 'Three Language Formula' is an attempt to address the challenges and opportunities of the linguistic situation in India. As per the 'Three Language Formula' the first language to be studied, must be the mother tongue or the regional language. In non-Hindi - speaking States, children learn Hindi. In the case of Hindi speaking States, children learn a language not spoken in their area. Sanskrit may also be studied as a modern Indian language in addition to these languages.

The Bhasha Sangam initiative under the 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat' aims to make the students aware about the unique cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity of our country."

Earlier this year, the Government published the general scheme of a Bill, which proposes to require employers over a certain size to publish information on the gender pay gaps in their organisations.

Last month, Minister for State at the Department of Education, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, TD, signalled the Government's intention to fund dozens of women-only professorships over the next three years to help ""eradicate gender inequality"" in higher education institutions. In this article, we consider the interaction between affirmative action and the prohibition on gender discrimination and analyse what steps can be taken.

The principle of equal treatment for men and women is set out in Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. There is an exception to the general equal treatment requirement in Article 157(4), which provides that the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent Member States from adopting measures making it easier for an underrepresented gender to pursue vocational activity or to compensate for disadvantages in professional careers.

Directive 2006/54 specifically prohibits discrimination on grounds of gender in employment matters, with Article 3 of the Directive permitting Member States to engage in affirmative action aimed at ensuring full equality in practice between men and women in working life.

In an Irish context, the Employment Equality Acts 1988-2015 prohibit discrimination on the grounds of gender. This prohibition is without prejudice to measures adopted (a) to ensure equality between men and women in employment and (b) to make it easier for an under-represented gender to pursue vocational activity.

The case law of the EU has clarified the application of the principle of equal treatment, and the derogations permitted from same. This article proposes to examine the balance between affirmative action and discrimination.

In Kalanke v Freie Hansestadt Bremen, one male and one female candidate were shortlisted for promotion within Bremen's parks department. The Bremen council policy was to automatically promote a female candidate if two candidates were equally qualified, and females were underrepresented in that sector. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) was asked whether this policy was permitted pursuant to the derogation from the principle of equal treatment. The CJEU held that the automatic promotion of female candidates constituted discrimination, and the derogation in respect of removing inequalities affecting women's opportunities had to be narrowly construed.

This was elaborated on in Marschall v Land Nordhein-Westfallen where the CJEU held that affirmative action was permitted in favour of a female candidate in the event of under-representation if, (i) objective factors specific to the male candidate were taken into account, and (ii) the criteria adopted did not discriminate against female candidates.

In Re Badeck's application, a question was referred to the CJEU in relation to a German law that permitted the adoption of advancement plans relating to the conditions of access and promotion of women in the public service, with binding targets. In the advancement plans, more than half of the posts to be filled in a section in which women were under-represented were designated solely for women. Additionally, in the event of equal qualifications of a female and male candidate, and the female gender being under-represented in that sector, selection criteria would be weighted in favour of the female candidate.

The CJEU noted that the selection procedure began by assessing candidates' suitability, capability and professional performance in relation to the post to be filled. During this aspect of the assessment, certain positive and negative criteria were taken into account. The CJEU held that prioritising the selection of female candidates was lawful, but this selection:

In Abrahamsson and Aderson v Fogelqvist, the CJEU held that the affirmative action concerned was unlawful as it overrode consideration of the applicants' individual merits. In Abrahamsson, the university's policy was to prefer a candidate of the under-represented sex who was ""sufficiently qualified"", over a more qualified candidate of the other sex who would otherwise have been selected. The CJEU ruled that this practice was contrary to the principle of equal treatment as there was no objective assessment of individuals' qualifications. The CJEU found that ultimately, the candidate was selected on the basis of her gender and that the failure to engage in objective assessment meant that this process fell outside of the permitted derogations to the general principle of equal treatment. The CJEU held that the process adopted in this instance was disproportionate to the aim.

In EFTA Surveillance Authority v Norway, the University of Oslo reserved 20 female-only post-doctoral positions, which were intended to stimulate the recruitment of women into permanent academic positions. The EFTA submitted that the automatic reservation of posts for females precluded any objective assessment of male candidates and exceeded the exceptions permitted to the general principle of equal treatment. The EFTA further submitted that any derogations from the general principle of equal treatment had to go no further than was appropriate and necessary to achieve their aim, i.e. that the measures must be proportionate. The EFTA concluded that the government of Norway had not shown that a less invasive measure would not have achieved the same result.

The EFTA also concluded that in order for the derogations to apply (i.e. that the principle of equal treatment would not prevent measures making it easier for the underrepresented gender to pursue a vocation), the criteria imposed could not be unconditional, and could not exclude objective assessment.

The government of Norway's position was that the ""earmarking"" of the posts was justified by the gender imbalance in academic posts, and that the means used were proportionate to the aim. The government stated that less invasive measures had been used in the past with almost unnoticeable effects, and therefore the pace of change in increasing representation of the underrepresented gender was too slow.

In contrast with Re Badeck's application, the CJEU noted that men were completely excluded from consideration for the ""earmarked"" posts. The CJEU noted the exception to the general requirement of equal treatment in the context of an underrepresented gender, and stated that as this was an exception, the criteria applied must be strictly interpreted. The CJEU cited the case of Marshall v Southampton and South-West Hampshire Area Health Authority and held that any exception to the equal treatment principles must have an element of objective assessment of candidates from both the under-represented gender, and the other gender. The CJEU reiterated that the criteria (i) could not be unconditional and (ii) must have an element of objective assessment.

The CJEU noted that in creating female-only posts there was no question of the objective assessment of male candidates, and therefore this constituted a breach of EU law.

In H. Lommers v Minister van Landbouw, Natuurbeheer en Visserij, nursery places were reserved for female employees' children only, unless a male employee required a space as a matter of ""emergency"". The rationale for this policy was that women were more likely to abandon their careers on the basis of poor child-care facilities, therefore reserving nursery places for female employees' children would encourage women to remain at work.

The CJEU confirmed that the allocation of nursery places constituted a ""working condition"" and held that the allocation of female-only nursery places was permissible, provided that male employees who took care of children alone were afforded the same access to the nursery places as female employees.

As outlined by the aforementioned cases, the jurisprudence of the CJEU distils certain principles in relation to the balance between affirmative action and discrimination, which include:

Therefore, while affirmative action is permitted, it is only allowed as an exception to the general rule prohibiting gender discrimination. Care must be taken to ensure that the above principles are observed in the implementation of any measures, whether by Government or by employers, intended to make it easier for an underrepresented gender to achieve gender equality in the workplace."

The condition decreases the height of the individuals by abnormal development of bones. The team also found the genetic basis of this condition. The work has been published online in the renowned journal, Human Mutation published by Wiley, USA.

Giving details of the discovery Dr. Girish said, ""Two patients from two different families were referred by child specialists when they noticed that the children were gaining height slowly as compared to other children of similar age.""

The clinical genetics team of experts at Manipal comprising Dr. Girish Katta and Dr. Anju Shukla, initially could not identify any known genetic condition. Hence, they started to look for yet unidentified cause of this condition. ""The team used a state of art technique called exome sequencing that analyzes all the genes in an individual,"" Dr. Girish said.

The clinical team was ably assisted by Neethukrishna Kausthubham as a bioinformatics expert and Dr. Srilakshmi Bhavani at Manipal looking into the mechanisms of the disease and correlating with the children's condition. Once the team identified the gene, they were further assisted by the German team comprising Dr. Kerstin Kutsche and Dr. Leonie Von Elsner.

Further experiments were conducted on cell lines and mechanism of disease was elucidated. The overall work had inputs from Dr. Geert Mortier from Antwerp University in Belgium. The research spanned over three years.

Vice-Chancellor, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Dr. H Vinod Bhat remarked; ""This work illustrates the University's commitment to foster collaborations with international universities to take MAHE to the global level in research.""

Dr. Pragna Rao, Dean KMC, Manipal said that the German and Belgian partners are visiting professors of KMC, Manipal. She added, ""The experiments also suggest that this condition is potentially amenable to treatment."" Pro Vice-Chancellor Dr. Poornima Baliga congratulated the genetics team, which has already contributed to the discovery of nearly 15 new disorders from MAHE.

The radiographs of the patients show the abnormal vertebrae instead of normal rectangular shape and parts of the long bones (epiphyses) of the leg are larger when compared to normal bone. (ANI-BusinessWireIndia)"

The A.P. Reorganisation Act also provided for financial assistance to the new state as well as starting of some new institutions in addition to the procedures to be followed in division of employees, institutions, assets and liabilities. These are covered in different sections of the Act.

The first and most important issue was making a reference to the 14th Finance Commission to consider the new states while giving their award. This was incorporated in section 46 of the act. The President of India was to make a reference to the Finance Commission to pass separate awards for each of the successor states. Accordingly a reference was made and the Finance Commission planned their visit to Andhra Pradesh. This visit was very crucial for us since the award of the commission can have a bearing on the finances of the new state. Mr CS Rao, former finance secretary, Government of India, was appointed as advisor in the finance department exclusively to deal with the Finance Commission. He had a long experience in the finance department and is well respected. In fact some of the members of the Finance Commission like Ms. Sushma Nath worked with him when he was the finance secretary at the Centre. The fact that the chairman of the 14th Finance Commission, Dr Y Venugopal Reddy, was from Andhra Pradesh made things easier since he had first-hand knowledge of the division of the state and its problems. Tirupati was indicated as the place to meet the Finance Commission by the Chief Minister and accordingly arrangements were made. We made a forceful presentation for giving us a fair dispensation by the Finance Commission and they were also very reasonable and considerate. When the final award came, Andhra Pradesh was the only state other than the North-eastern states to get revenue deficit grants for all the five years of the 14th Finance Commission's award. They gave an award for Rs 21,113 crores as revenue deficit grants for the five-year period.

We as officers were very happy that we could successfully get a good deal for Andhra Pradesh from the Finance Commission. But the Chief Minister was not happy. He held a series of meetings and telephone conferences on this issue with officers, MPs and started crying, stating that nothing had come for the capital and what has been given is only a pittance. In one meeting Mr CS Rao, who by then lost his patience had to remind the Chief Minister that the Finance Commission goes by its terms of reference, and the issues Sri Naidu was raising do not come within the terms of reference of the commission. He said the award was generous with reference to the state of Andhra Pradesh.

The matter did not end there. In the legislative Assembly, the Revenue Minister started making a personal attack against Dr Y Venugopal Reddy. Mr CS Rao rang me up and said that Dr Venugopal Reddy was pained by these comments and requested me to bring it to the notice of the Chief Minister. Accordingly I informed the CM that Dr Venugopal Reddy was feeling bad that he should be targeted when he did his best for the state. The Chief Minister told me to convey to Dr Reddy that he holds him in high regard and he would be talking to him personally. The same was conveyed to Mr CS Rao with a request to convey it to Dr Venugopal Reddy as it was he who rang me up and informed about this. Subsequently when I enquired with Sri CS Rao whether there was any such call from the CM to Dr Venugopal Reddy, he checked with him and told me there was no such call. In our use and throw policy both Dr Venugopal Reddy and Sri CS Rao had no relevance once the 14th Finance Commission gave its award. Sri CS Rao also left the post after some time as there was no work for him before completing his tenure.

The award of the 14th Finance Commission takes care of AP's revenue deficit from 2015 to 2020. That still left the revenue deficit gap for the 10-month period from June 2014 to March 2015. The statement of the Prime Minister on the floor of Parliament covered this issue. He said the resource gap that may arise in the successor state of Andhra Pradesh in the very first year especially during the period between the appointed day and the award of finance commission would be compensated in the Union budget for 2014-15. Even before the division of the state, the Governor made a calculation of what could be this deficit and sent his report to the Union government indicating Rs 16,000 crores as the possible revenue deficit. Contrary to the assessment made by the Governor, the revenues were very buoyant and expenditure under control, and by December 2014 we knew the deficit will not cross Rs 3,000 to 4,000 crores. By January the Chief Minister started concentrating on this and was particular that higher revenue deficit be built up. He was very confident that with his political connections he would be able to get any amount from the Union government. I am sure his expectations were based on his experience when he was earlier part of NDA-1 when he used to have his way through. So, a huge expenditure was incurred in the last few months of the financial year to build up a higher revenue deficit. Certain industrial incentives which were not being sanctioned for years together were discovered and released, and industrialists who never expected it were too happy to oblige. Expenditure on the electoral promises like loan waiver, and higher amounts for pensions were all booked under this account. Accordingly a revenue deficit of Rs 16,078 crores was incurred for the year 2014-15 and the same was certified by the CAG. Stating that these are CAG-certified figures, the state government made a plea to the Centre to reimburse Rs 16,078 crores. The central Government took the view that like the 14th Finance commission they would only fill the normal revenue gap which is the result of the division of the state, but not amounts incurred on fulfilling electoral promises made by the new government. Their argument was that if they sanction the expenditure incurred on the electoral promises they will get similar demands from other states as well. The state government's argument that the figures were certified by the CAG did not cut any ice with the Union government as they clearly said only eligible portion out of the amount certified by the CAG would be reimbursed and accordingly the deficit was determined as Rs 4,117 crores. I felt the argument of Government of India was very valid. However the state government kept on repeatedly raising this issue with no success. The Centre was willing to consider 2015-16 revenue deficit grant, as sanctioned by the 14th Finance Commission which was coming to about Rs 6,609 crore and were willing to give that amount proportionately for the 10 month period for which the state government was not agreeable. Finally the central government has gone on record through an affidavit before Supreme Court in a case filed by an individual stating that the amount that is due on this account is only Rs 4,117 crores which is the normal deficit incurred by the state government. Right from the beginning, the state government's stand on this issue was not correct and by stretching it too far they lost the possibility of getting more by making a reference to the 14th Finance commission revenue deficit grant for 2015-16.

Section 93 of the act enjoins on the Central government to take all necessary measures as enumerated in the 13th Schedule for the progress and sustainable development of the Successor State within a period of 10 years from the appointed day. Accordingly a set of institutions are listed out in the 13th schedule. They are broadly divided into two categories: educational and infrastructure. While with reference to the institutions listed under the education category, it is specifically mentioned in the act that they ""shall be"" established, no such firm commitment is mentioned in the infrastructure category excepting with reference to one or two organisations. The mandate was only to examine the feasibility of setting up such industries and organisations.

Our first focus was on establishment of the education institutions with reference to which there was a firm commitment in the act. We were keen they should start functioning from 2015-16 academic year. We had a series of meetings with the Secretary, Higher Education, Government of India who was reluctant to start them until the total infrastructure was ready and wanted us to wait for three to four years before the infrastructure actually materialises. We were able to put enormous pressure on GOI politically to ensure that they start operating from 2015-16. Wherever the government was able to allot the land and make temporary buildings available for locating the institutions they started functioning from 2015 and others got delayed where we were not able to provide land immediately or there was a dispute about the location of the institution. One such institution that got delayed was NIT which finally got located at Tadepalligudem. The Endowments Minister wanted it to be located at TP Gudem while another lobby close to the power centre wanted it to be located at Eluru. Finally the minister prevailed. So also was the problem with Petroleum University since the state government was not able to decide whether to locate it in East Godavari or in Vizag. Most of the institutions started functioning from temporary accommodation in a record time before my retirement. Two institutions to establish which legislation was required, got delayed. It is a sad commentary on the manner in which the state government can behave when now they accuse the Central government of running these institutions in temporary accommodation when the fact is that we put pressure on them and got those institutions functioning when they were reluctant to start them until full infrastructure is available.

Regarding the infrastructure projects mentioned in the 13th Schedule, activity started in terms of examining the feasibility. The focus immediately was on Vizag - Chennai industrial corridor and Metro Rail for Vijayawada and Vizag. Regarding Vizag - Chennai industrial corridor, since funding was coming from Asian Development Bank, we had a series of meetings with them and the nodes were finalised. Since I dealt with Hyderabad Metro earlier as finance secretary and was associated with Sri Sridharan of Delhi Metro at that time, I revived my contact with him and brought him to meet the Chief Minister. By the time I retired, Vijayawada Metro project was progressing well and in fact preparations for land acquisition were being done. Subsequently both metros seem to have been stuck at some stage. Regarding the other infrastructure projects, feasibility studies were going on by the time I retired.

The ""special category status"" was on the agenda immediately after I took over as the Chief Secretary. I made a visit to Delhi and sought an appointment with Mr Subrahmanyam in the PMO who is from Jharkhand cadre but belongs to Andhra Pradesh. Presently he is the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir. When the issue of special category status was discussed, his immediate reaction was it is next to impossible and something which needs to be decided at a level much higher than that of officers. He said that this decision needs to be taken in the National Development Council where all Chief Ministers would be present and there is likely to be strong opposition from the other Chief Ministers. He suggested that it should be taken up at political level. I came back and informed the same to the Chief Minister and left it at that. The special package proposal was not initiated when I was in service.

The sex crimes include, but are not limited to, rape, female genital mutilation, prostitution, pandering, carnal knowledge, ""crime against nature,"" voyeurism, and obscenity.

Act 634 adds to existing law to prohibit hiring any person as a teacher who submits fraudulent documentation to the Louisiana Department of Education or Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) as part of an application for a teaching certificate or other teaching authorization, even if that individual neither was convicted of nor entered a no contest plea for a crime listed under La.

Act 634 became effective on July 1, 2018.

SB 209: This state senate bill would provide additional protections to workers facing massive layoffs. The legislature has not passed the bill.

SB 209, the ""Louisiana Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act"" or the ""Louisiana WARN Act,"" would require ""large corporations"" to warn employees of impending ""mass layoffs.""

The Louisiana WARN Act would not supersede the federal WARN Act of 1988, which applies to employers who employ 100 or more employees. The Louisiana WARN Act would apply to companies who employ between 50 and 99 employees.

The Louisiana WARN Act defines ""mass layoffs"" as the closure of a workplace (or portion thereof), modernization of a workplace (or portion thereof), relocation of a workplace (of portion thereof), or implementation or any management policy, in which the employer permanently reduces the number of employees by 50 or more during any 90-day period.

SB 209 would require the employer to refrain from a mass layoff until 60 days after the employer serves written notice of the layoff to each of the following: affected employees, the executive director of the Louisiana Workforce Commission (LWC), members of the state Senate who represent the parish (i.e. county) in which the workplace is located, members of the state House of Representatives who represent the parish in which the workplace is located, and the president of the parish-governing authority.

SB 209 would provide for limited exceptions to the 60-day notice period, such as mass layoffs due to natural disasters (such as a flood), disputes between labor unions and employers, layoffs at a construction site or other temporary workplace, layoffs that are the result of seasonal factors, layoffs which occur as a result of the completion of a particular project or undertaking where the affected employees were hired with the understanding that their employment was limited to the duration of the project or undertaking, or business circumstances not reasonably foreseeable at the time SB 209 would have required notice.

An employer violating the Louisiana WARN Act would face liability for lost wages and health benefits, as well as reasonable attorney's fees and costs, but SB 209 limits damages to a maximum of 60 days.

SB 209 is still in the Senate.

HB 126: The FLSA already requires that an employer shall compensate a tipped employee at a rate of $2.13 per hour, and if the employee fails to earn sufficient tips to bring his or her hourly earnings to the federal minimum wage rate, the employer shall pay the difference to ensure that the employee earns at least the federal minimum wage. HB 126 would create a state minimum wage rate for tipped employees and set it at the rate set by the FLSA. HB 126 would define a tipped employee as an employee who regularly earns at least $30 per month in tips.

HB 126 is still pending in the House Committee on Labor and Industrial Relations.

HB 605: Louisiana requires that women employed as public employees be entitled to the same compensation as men employed as public employees. HB 605 would extend the equal pay requirement to all persons employed in the state of Louisiana. HB 605 would also allow an aggrieved person to file suit in any district court of competent jurisdiction. Currently, since the state equal pay protection law applies only to state employees, an aggrieved employee must file suit in the Baton Rouge-based 19th Judicial District Court. An aggrieved individual must first file a complaint with the Louisiana Human Rights Commission.

In April 2018, the Louisiana House Labor & Industrial Relations Committee members voted 7-4 to involuntarily defer HB 605. An involuntarily deferred instrument may be rescheduled for a committee hearing only by motion adopted by the vote of two-thirds of the committee members present and voting. The author of HB605 vowed to continue to bring similar bills to address pay disparities between men and women.

HB 790: Currently, Louisiana law only provides for workers' compensation benefits for hearing loss when the loss is sustained in a single traumatic accident.

The market for single sign-on services is witnessing remarkable rise across the world. The efficiency of single sign-on services in managing multiple domains and applications is boosting their demand considerably among enterprises. Single sign-on solutions find a widespread usage in large as well as small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), thanks to the emergence of cloud technology, mobile, and social media. Large enterprises report a greater demand for these solutions in comparison with SMEs.

Among SMEs, the demand for cloud-based single sign-on services is particularly high, as these solutions need relatively less capital investment, assist in reducing the operational and maintenance costs, and decrease the management efforts. The trend is likely to remain so among SMEs over the next few years on the grounds of the attractive packages that fit perfectly to their business requirements being offered by vendors. Large enterprises, on the other hand, are expected to keep counting on on-premises single sign-on solutions in the near future.

Global Single Sign-on Market: Drivers and Restraints

The ability of SSO to manage multiple applications at the same time, from different or same domains, which eventually is helping several organizations to increase their productivity, is the primary driver for this market. In the IT department, single sign-on handles the management of security policies and eliminates repeatability. With SSO integrated authentication devices such as biometric and smart cards, the cost of IT administration and support has decreased considerably, and thereby is experiencing extended demand.

The type segment of enterprise single sign-on currently has the maximum demand, which can be attributed to high security-levels offered within the organization for both external and internal applications. The end-use industry segment of education, communications media and services leads the demand in the market, owing to the trend of digital education and the surge of social media.

Global Single Sign-on Market: Regional Outlook

North America contributes most of the demand for single sign-on due to escalating implementation of single sign-on solutions across various industries the in developed countries of the U.S. and Canada. The region of Asia Pacific too is projected for a healthy growth rate, with most of the demand coming from the emerging economies of India, China, Australia, and Japan.

Winning 99 seats, the Congress achieved a major gain of 78 places over its 2013 debacle.

One seat was won by party's ally, the Rashtriya Lok Dal. The party thus secured a majority with the support of its ally. The Congress has retained 16 of the 21 seats it had won in 2013 and it has wrested 76 seats from the BJP and seven seats from others.

In the aftermath of the elections, Congress has the support of nine independent winners who fought as 'rebels' on being denied the Congress symbol. Six winners from the BSP and two from the CPM have also promised support to the Congress government which will take oath on 17th December.

Thus, the Congress now has the support of 117 members in a Legislative Assembly which has a maximum strength of 200. Election to one constituency was deferred due to the death of a BSP candidate.

The BJP, which had secured an unprecedented verdict in 2013 winning in 163 constituencies, suffered a major reverse losing in ninety places and ending up with a tally of 73 seats only.

The defeat of many senior ministers of Vasundhra Raje government viz. Yunus Khan, Rajpal Singh Shekhawat, Prabhulal Saini, Shreechand Kriplani, Arun Chaturvedi, Gajendra Singh Khinvsar and Rao Rajendra Singh reflect the magnitude of the loss. Even the Chief Minister herself faced a tough fight from Manvendra Singh, son of Jaswant Singh one of the founders of the BJP, who deserted the BJP to join the Congress just before the elections. In 65 of the 73 seats that the BJP won, Congress occupied the second position.

The newly formed Rashtriya Loktantrik Party and the Bharatiya Tribal Party registered victories in three and two seats, respectively. Four independent candidates were also successful in winning. It was interesting to see that except for the Congress rebel in the reserved seat of Kushalgarh (ST), all other winning candidates belonging to non-Congress and non-BJP political parties or independents secured 20-30 per cent votes.

The table below shows a peculiar feature of electoral politics in Rajasthan. Over the last two decades, five Assembly elections have been held in the state. The outcome of each of these elections has led to a change of party in power.

The 'revolving door' outcome has been equally shared by the Congress and the BJP. Competitive electoral politics has become increasingly bipolar in the state.

The BSP has become a regular feature in the state garnering about four per cent votes and a few seats. Other than the BSP and the Left parties, all other parties have been ephemeral in nature.

Playing the role of 'spoilers' in one election, these outfits vanish by the next election. The 'independents' are mostly 'rebels' of BJP or Congress who normally rejoin the parent party after some nominal action. What this implies is that although the number of political parties, registered and unregistered, is high in each election, there are only a few 'effective' parties. More than 80 per cent votes and seats are shared between the Congress and the BJP.

Why Did the BJP Lose?

After the resounding BJP victory in 2013 Assembly and 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it was being felt that from now onwards Rajasthan will also follow the path taken by its neighboring states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and even Chhattisgarh.

In these states, the BJP had been in saddle for three or more than three elections. But this did not happen. Very early in its office, the BJP government started to dither. The party lost three of the four Assembly bye-elections held in 2014 and could not do well in the elections held for the local self-government institutions, both in rural and urban areas in 2015.

Early in 2018, the BJP again performed badly losing two Lok Sabha and one Assembly bye-elections. Thus, dissatisfaction with the state government started building up soon and got deeper as years started unfolding. This negative sentiment emerged because of two major reasons: perception of non-performance and corruption.

The Raje government had initiated a slew of welfare schemes in the state but there was poor delivery of the benefits. Rampant unemployment, price rise, inadequate access to drinking water, lack of development and insufficient access to health, education and transportation left the people in a miserable condition.

The peasantry was also deeply dissatisfied with the government because of its callous attitude. Strong perception of corruption further led to a seething anger. Thus, as the stage for the 15th State Assembly elections in December 2018 was being prepared, a common sentiment which was being expressed was that Rajasthan will once again follow the previous trend of circulation of the ruling party and power will come back to the Congress.

The Unsatisfying Congress Victory

In the months preceding the election, the strong anti-incumbency against the BJP government gave the impression that the Congress will attain a comfortable win in the state. But this did not happen as seen above.

The party has secured a bare majority. How does one explain this below par performance of the Congress? A number of reasons converge to explain this.

The initial parleys with the BSP gave the impression that the Congress is not confident about its victory. Due to the unreasonable demands of the BSP, the alliance became implausible for the Congress.

Finally, the party ceded 5 seats to RLD, JD (S) and the NCP. Of these, four were lost. Another reason which can be cited is the delay in distributing party tickets. Many prospective candidates were extremely unhappy with the official party candidates. Some of the disgruntled contested as 'rebels' and also won.

In some places, the dissatisfied worked against the official candidate and ensured their loss. A few others just kept aloof from the whole process to show their resentment. Delay in declaration of election manifesto also harmed the prospects of the party.

One final factor which needs to be mentioned here is the choice of the Congress not to declare its chief ministerial candidate. This issue kept on dogging the party all throughout the campaign. There was a strong perception that if Ashok Gehlot had been declared as the party's chief ministerial candidate, the result would have been better for the Congress.

Gazing Forward

All this is past now. The Congress has won and Ashok Gehlot has been declared as the Chief Minister for the third time. Sachin Pilot will be his deputy. The swearing-in ceremony will be held on 17th December in the presence of the party President Rahul Gandhi and leaders of a host of other political parties who are going to be a part of the Congress-led 'mahagathbandhan' (Grand Alliance) for the forthcoming General elections. Not much time is left for the new government before code of conduct for these election come into play.

The 'iron law' of electoral democracy in India has been that if two major elections are held close to each other, the outcome of one affects the succeeding election. If this pattern continues, the Congress is likely to perform well in the Lok Sabha elections. But nothing can be taken for granted. From now onwards till the summer of 2019, it is going to be an uphill task for the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government. The magician that Gehlot is, he has to neutralize the 'Modi magic'.

The company is hiring for its newly inaugurated Gurgaon office.

Like a typical startup, AglaSem EduTech Pvt Ltd had a humble beginning. From a small rented room occupied by 4 people, today the company is a creative ground for 80 young people who are full of ideas and passionate about what they do. The company has opened its doors wide to hire 200 Graduate Freshers in various teams.

The new office of aglasem.com is in Gurgaon Sector 30, on NH 8. ""We were operating in Delhi for some years, when on the suggestion of a close friend, we decided to open a corporate office in Gurgaon. It was one of our best decisions!"", AglaSem co-founder Anand says. He adds, ""The corporate culture in this place is very conducive to building a team, which we are focused on right now. Metro connectivity, safety for employees, were our top priorities when we zeroed in on this location last year when we started operations in Gurgaon.""

Today the company works primarily from Gurgaon and it recently moved to a larger office to accommodate the growing team and make room for more team members which the HR department is aggressively trying to bring on board.

As soon as one steps into the office, the energy in the air is noticeable. Most of the team members are quite young. However, senior members and leaders are spread across and can be seen mentoring one on one.

While there is a palpable buzz of activities at the workstations, meeting rooms, conference, some members can be seen chilling in the cafeteria or sparring over ideas in the brainstorming room. The YouTube room also has an ongoing shooting.

Expanding team in ongoing projects, and to launch new projects they have in the pipeline, AglaSem is hiring 200 Graduate Freshers for aglasem.com. The teams in which candidates are invited to apply are Content Writing (English), Content Writing (Hindi), YouTube Specialists, Software Engineers.

The company encourages such candidates to apply who enjoy working in the respective fields. Candidates can send either apply through Naukri.com under AglaSem Recruitment or send their CVs with a short email to hr@aglasem.com.

""We are looking for passionate youngsters who wish to learn and grow in their career. They should be actually interested in that work. For example, a content writer should enjoy writing and a software engineer should enjoy coding,"" said Shivani Dagar who is handling Talent Acquisition at AglaSem. Candidates with graduation from any stream are welcome. She adds, ""All degrees (streams) are treated equally. However, internships do play an important role."" A quick peek at her day planner shows that there are more than a dozen interviews scheduled that day.

The selection process consists of three rounds. First is a written test which depends on the position applied for. Then is the HR round which is a PI. Third is a final personal interview. All the rounds help the company understand the candidate better and vice versa. Arunima who leads the content team at AglaSem throws some light on what she looks for in her team members. ""I always ask them these questions; Do you write for yourself? Do you read? Why do you want to be a writer in the education sector? It is very important that the person has a flair for writing.""

While the company has long been content focused, with 'Updated, Authentic, Free' being its motto, they have recently created a tech team. Led by Nikhil who has an industry experience of 7 years, the team aims to give users a better experience and provide useful tools, apps, models for them. Within a month of inception, the team has launched an AglaSem Mock Test platform which already has 50000 registered users. Enthusiastic developers are welcome in their team.

The management is focused upon team building and they understand it is a slow-and-steady task. Learning is an ongoing process for team members at all levels. The immediate goals of this process are to ensure that all team members have good learning opportunities, room for growth within the company, security and stability, and challenges at regular intervals for steady growth at all levels.

While many job seekers who come for interview research about the company, one of the most frequently asked questions is about what does AglaSem do. To answer it, here is a brief overview.

There are two aspects of education and career covered by the company; information and resources. There are over 1000 exams in India, including those taken by school students, entrance exams, government job exams. Say there is a student of class 10th who is about to appear for his board exams. He needs to know exam dates, when and how will he get hall ticket, and when are results. Also, he would like to appear in scholarship exams like NTSE.

So the information pertaining to these, all exams that are relevant to that student, is provided on time and accurately at AglaSem. Now the other aspect involves resources related these exams which comprise of study material, preparation tips, what books to read, and so on. Similarly, information and resources are provided to all students of class 6 to 12, students who seek admission in colleges, students who are wishing to pursue post-graduation, and candidates who are preparing for government job exams. All information and resources are provided free of cost. The motto of AglaSem is 'Updated, Authentic, Free.' (ANI-BusinessWireIndia)"

Someone opens the door and stage whispers my name. ""You've four minutes,"" she says, and asks if I would like some tea. The cuppa loses to the questions and I wade through droves of fans with phone cameras on the ready, special guests, and bouncers as sturdy as oaks, into a room at the Park Hyatt hotel. One of India's most recognisable men is seated on a chair, filling it like he did the throne when he played Mughal emperor Akbar.

Hrithik Roshan, in jeans and a denim Beatles jacket, 'love' embroidered on his muscled bicep, rises to shake my hand. There is a Skeleton strapped to his right wrist. ""If I had to pick a favourite watch right now, I'd pick the Skeleton,"" says the Bollywood actor, who was in the city last weekend to launch the latest from the Rado collection at VR Mall.

Hrithik has been Rado's ambassador for six years now, but the brand is a childhood memory. ""When I was a kid, I was fascinated by how the watch looked on my father's wrist. I didn't know the brand then. Years later when Rado approached me and I saw the collection, I recognised the watch that first enamoured me,"" he says.

Hrithik has been the Hindi film industry's Adonis for nearly 19 years now, his career peppered in equanimity with box office smashes and duds. He's played the workaholic lover boy (Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara), angry young man (Agneepath), heroic Army officer (Lakshya) and super hero (Krissh series) in equal measure, and has an untitled film with Tiger Shroff on the cards.

But as he pushes 45, Hrithik cheerleads the story of a common man and a gifted mathematician who inspired youth to successfully ace the entrance exams to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT). Super 30, scheduled for release on January 25, 2019, is a bio-pic on Patna-based Anand Kumar, best known for his Super 30 programme that coaches economically backward students for one of India's toughest entrance exams. It is a story that mirrors poverty and genius and showcases the struggles of youth in a classroom with unplastered walls, tutored by a man who sells papads in the evenings to supplement the family income.

Hrithik, who plays Anand, says the film called for a lot of prepping and not just in the scruffy looks department. ""I've played emperor and the common man. But this was especially different and difficult as I did not speak Bihari and since it is based on a person's life, the responsibility is so much more. I had to get into the skin of that character and I truly enjoyed doing it.""

Would the film be endorsing India's craze for the IITs? ""If the film endorses anything, it is the spirit of education, the spirit of teaching,"" says Hrithik. ""Even if you are not a teacher, it should inspire you to add growth to the people around you, to help them pursue their dreams. Somewhere, it'll strike a chord to do more for the people who work for you.""

With Krissh 4 due for release in 2020, has he thought of revisiting his roles in Lakshya or Jodhaa Akbar considering he still has the Greek-god attributes to carry off a sequel? ""That really is the call of the director. I wish I could think of things I want to do but I have to depend on filmmakers and the things that inspire them. My favourite role has always been the one I am currently doing, whichever film that may be.""

What does Hrithik, an exercise freak who endorses a fitness startup and has his own line of fitness merchandise, listen to when he works out? There's a pause before his eyes crinkle with laughter, ""The workout is very intense. But I love grand orchestral music and old Hindi songs on my playlist. Something that is calming. I love the contrast.""

And just like that, the minute-hand sweeps past the allotted four minutes."

Hundreds of the company's consultants frolicked in the desert, riding camels over sand dunes and mingling in tents linked by red carpets. Meetings took place in a cavernous banquet hall that resembled a sultan's ornate court, with a sign overhead to capture the mood.

""I can't keep calm, I work at McKinsey & Company,"" it said.

Especially remarkable was the location: Kashgar, the ancient Silk Road city in China's far west that is experiencing a major humanitarian crisis.

About four miles from where the McKinsey consultants discussed their work, which includes advising some of China's most important state-owned companies, a sprawling internment camp had sprung up to hold thousands of ethnic Uighurs -- part of a vast archipelago of indoctrination camps where the Chinese government has locked up as many as one million people.

One week before the McKinsey event, a United Nations committee had denounced the mass detentions and urged China to stop.

But the political backdrop did not appear to bother the McKinsey consultants, who posted pictures on Instagram chronicling their Disney-like adventures. In fact, McKinsey's involvement with the Chinese government goes much deeper than its odd choice to showcase its presence in the country.

For a quarter-century, the company has joined many American corporations in helping stoke China's transition from an economic laggard to the world's second-largest economy. But as China's growth presents a muscular challenge to American dominance, Washington has become increasingly critical of some of Beijing's signature policies, including the ones McKinsey has helped advance.

One of McKinsey's state-owned clients has even helped build China's artificial islands in the South China Sea, a major point of military tension with the United States.

It turns out that McKinsey's role in China is just one example of its extensive -- and sometimes contentious -- work around the world, according to an investigation by The New York Times that included interviews with 40 current and former McKinsey employees, as well as dozens of their clients.

At a time when democracies and their basic values are increasingly under attack, the iconic American company has helped raise the stature of authoritarian and corrupt governments across the globe, sometimes in ways that counter American interests.

Its clients have included Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy, Turkey under the autocratic leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and corruption-plagued governments in countries like South Africa.

In Ukraine, McKinsey and Paul Manafort -- President Trump's campaign chairman, later convicted of financial fraud -- were paid by the same oligarch to help burnish the image of a disgraced presidential candidate, Viktor F. Yanukovych, recasting him as a reformer.

Once in office, Mr. Yanukovych rebuffed the West, sided with Russia and fled the country, accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. The events set off years of chaos in Ukraine and an international standoff with the Kremlin.

Inside Russia itself, McKinsey has worked with Kremlin-linked companies that have been placed under sanctions by Western governments -- companies that the firm helped build up over the years and, in some cases, continues to advise.

It has consulted in many sectors of the Russian economy, including mining, manufacturing, oil and gas, banking, transportation and agriculture. A McKinsey official sat on the Russian government's energy board. Former McKinsey consultants have gone to work in the Russian companies they once advised.

In August, VEB Bank -- which is wholly owned by the Russian state, intertwined with Russian intelligence and under United States sanctions -- hired McKinsey to develop its business strategy.

There is no indication that McKinsey has violated American sanctions, which prohibit only certain transactions with targeted companies and individuals. But the larger question is whether the company, in pursuing legitimate business opportunities abroad, is helping to shore up President Vladimir V. Putin's autocratic leadership.

Other consulting companies serve similar clients, but none have the stature to confer credibility quite like McKinsey, a confidant for 92 years to many of the world's most admired companies.

In China, it has advised at least 22 of the 100 biggest state-owned companies -- the ones carrying out some of the government's most strategic and divisive initiatives, according to a review of Chinese-language material by The Times.

While it is not unusual for American corporations to work with China's state-owned companies, McKinsey's role has sometimes put it in the middle of deeply troubled deals. In Malaysia, the company laid out the case for one of Asia's most corrupt leaders to pursue billions of dollars from China at a time when he was suspected of funneling vast sums of public money into his own pocket, drawing tens of thousands into the streets to protest against him.

McKinsey defends its work around the world, saying that it will not accept jobs at odds with the company's values. It also gives the same reason that other companies cite for working in corrupt or authoritarian nations -- that change is best achieved from the inside.

""Since 1926, McKinsey has sought to make a positive difference to the businesses and communities in which our people live and work,"" the company said in a statement.

""Tens of thousands of jobs have been created, lives improved and education provided thanks to the work we have done with our clients,"" it added.

""Like many other major corporations including our competitors, we seek to navigate a changing geopolitical environment,"" the company said, ""but we do not support or engage in political activities.""

Still, some analysts, veteran diplomats and experts on global governance see McKinsey's role in a different light.

While the United States pulls back from international cooperation and adopts a more nationalist stance, major companies like McKinsey are pursuing business in countries with little regard for human rights -- sometimes advancing, rather than curbing, the contentious tactics of America's biggest rivals.

""It is more likely they enable these regimes and likely become complicit,"" said David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state. ""They don't want to alienate regimes, or they would lose business.""

Oligarchs and Autocrats

His bona fides included two criminal convictions and a rigged election that, many assumed, had finally doomed his presidential ambitions.

So it was a bit surprising when McKinsey helped polish the battered image of Mr. Yanukovych and pitch him as something else: a forward-thinking leader with an economic vision of a better future for all Ukrainians.

McKinsey's role in resurrecting Mr. Yanukovych's political career has been lost in the clamor surrounding the conviction of Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, for secretly taking millions of dollars to help the Ukranian leader win the presidency in 2010.

But McKinsey was financed by the same oligarch who backed Mr. Manafort, and it wrote an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych wielded to disarm his critics -- before discarding much of it after becoming president.

On his 100th day in office, in a Soviet-era palace adorned with Cossack art, Mr. Yanukovych stiffly briefed the nation, laying out his economic plan. After sipping Cognac and Scotch, legislators and guests packed the hall, where the cameras conspicuously stopped on a man with a bright blue suit and a résumé that touched the lives of virtually everyone in Ukraine.

His name: Rinat Akhmetov, the country's richest oligarch. As much as anyone, he was the reason for the gathering, and he had reason to feel good.

He had rescued Mr. Yanukovych through a strategy that included hiring two very different consulting groups: Mr. Manafort, whose Russian-linked team had worked for dictators with little regard for human rights, and McKinsey, the purveyor of best practices for the world's most important corporations.

That these two disparate groups found common ground is a testament to Mr. Akhmetov's vast business empire and political skill. But for McKinsey, it underscored the risk of consulting in an unstable part of the world, where the company might be perceived as enabling autocratic or corrupt governments.

Mr. Manafort's job was twofold: to soften Mr. Yanukovych's reputation and strengthen his Russian-leaning Party of Regions, facilitating his rise to the presidency. McKinsey provided something different -- an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych could use to portray himself as a market-based reformer, tilting to the West.

To ensure that the message got through, Mr. Yanukovych and Mr. Akhmetov pointedly mentioned McKinsey in talks with American officials, according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Akhmetov assured the Americans that his candidate was ""a strong McKinsey supporter,"" while Mr. Yanukovych emphasized that he had instructed his aides ""to work directly with McKinsey experts.""

Diplomats remained wary. A respected Ukrainian journalist warned American officials that Mr. Yanukovych might ""sing a song one moment and knife someone the next.""

There were also questions about Mr. Akhmetov, who had long been suspected of links to organized crime, which he denied. One diplomat called his Party of Regions a haven for ""mobsters and oligarchs,"" noting that it might be trying to shed that image.

Mr. Akhmetov's financial ties to Mr. Manafort and McKinsey went beyond politics. He hired both to advise parts of his corporate empire, which included steel, mining, energy, finance, telecommunications, real estate, media, transportation, agriculture and soccer. He also hired former McKinsey consultants to help run his businesses, placing them in senior positions.

Mr. Akhmetov paid Mr. Manafort by wire transfers funneled through a Cypriot shell company, court records show. Other Party of Regions operatives paid Mr. Manafort through shell companies, eventually resulting in his conviction in the United States for failing to declare the money on his tax returns.

McKinsey, by contrast, was paid through a Ukrainian foundation financed by Mr. Akhmetov and run by a former McKinsey consultant now living in Moscow. Set up to promote economic reform, the foundation also sought to publicize McKinsey -- and by extension, Mr. Yanukovych.

To reach its prime audience in the United States, the foundation held two forums on the Ukrainian economy -- one at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York and the other in Washington. On the whole, McKinsey's work was well received.

But the promise of a better future didn't last long.

Within a few years, Ukraine careened toward economic collapse while Mr. Yanukovych looted the nation, living in a palatial residence surrounded by a private zoo, a golf course, a garage filled with classic cars and a private restaurant in the form of a pirate ship.

If that were not enough, he was also quietly building an enormous seaside retreat, complete with 40-foot ceilings and an indoor swimming pool, that eclipsed his presidential residence.

The capital soon turned against him. Mr. Yanukovych had long promised to tie Ukraine to the West by signing sweeping political and trade agreements with the European Union. Then he abruptly reneged, siding with Russia instead.

Protesters flooded the streets for months, chanting pro-Europe slogans. Mr. Yanukovych's government responded with a heavy hand, culminating in what the European Parliament's envoy called a ""Ukrainian Tiananmen,"" referring to China's deadly crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. More than 80 protesters were killed before Mr. Yanukovych fled the country in 2014.

The chaos didn't end there. Outraged, Mr. Putin pushed into Ukraine, annexed Crimea and stirred up a war that has claimed more than 10,000 lives. The West responded by kicking Russia out of the Group of 8 industrialized democracies and imposing sanctions. The standoff between Mr. Putin and the West had begun.

McKinsey defended its role in Mr. Yanukovych's rise by saying that the foundation was serious about promoting economic development in Ukraine and featured prominent Westerners on its board. The foundation quietly folded -- without achieving its goals -- just before Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia. Neither Mr. Akhmetov nor McKinsey would say how much money McKinsey earned.

""When we concluded that the government was not following through on its stated reform agenda, we ended our work,"" McKinsey said in a statement.

Mr. Akhmetov, who publicly broke with Mr. Yanukovych during the protests, declined to speak to The Times. Inside his gold and chrome headquarters, a spokesman said the foundation had been unsuccessful because politicians lacked the will ""to embrace the reform agenda.""

But critics like Anders Aslund, a Swedish-born economist who advised the Russian government in the 1990s and later the government of Ukraine, lamented how Mr. Yanokovych's image had been sold in Western capitals. It was clear, he said, that Mr. Yanokovych ""was about power and robbery.""

McKinsey's role in Ukraine did not end with Mr. Yanukovych's downfall. ""We build leaders who can deliver lasting, meaningful impact for Ukraine's major companies, its economy and society,"" the company wrote on its website

McKinsey quickly became a favorite of Mr. Yanukovych's successor, Petro O. Poroshenko, an oligarch known as ""the chocolate king"" for his confectionary business.

In a speech last November, Mr. Poroshenko praised McKinsey for its 15 years of work in Ukraine. His daughter-in-law also worked for the company during most of his presidency.

Meanwhile, McKinsey has continued to consult for Mr. Akhmetov, sharing the top floor of a Kiev office building with an Akhmetov company. Another Akhmetov company sits a floor below. In fact, Mr. Akhmetov owns the entire building, which includes a business in the lobby fit for an oligarch: an Aston Martin-Rolls Royce dealership.

Building China's Dream

Deep in the Malaysian jungle, a sprawling construction site sits abandoned, the relentless monsoon rain taking its toll on the rusting fields of steel girders.

It is supposed to be a railway -- part of China's signature Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion global undertaking financed by big Chinese loans, and usually built by Chinese companies.

Chief among them is the China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned behemoth whose initials are stenciled in black on the cement plant at the abandoned site.

China Communications, which was barred for eight years from doing business on some World Bank projects because of a corruption scandal, played a leading role in building artificial islands in the South China Sea that have raised tensions with the United States.

The company's subsidiary also built a new port for Sri Lanka. But the debt turned out to be such a burden that the Sri Lankan government had to give up the port and hand it over for 99 years -- to China.

Sri Lanka's fate was so alarming that Malaysia's new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, worried that the same thing might happen to him. So he suspended the railway project in July.

""That is not good for us,"" Mr. Mahathir said in September. ""Malaysian workers have no jobs that they can do. All the work is hired from China. You can see how one-sided it is.""

But for McKinsey, it was anything but one-sided. The company represented both parties involved in the deal.

In 2015, as China Communications was building the artificial islands and still under World Bank sanctions, McKinsey signed it on as a client, advising it on strategy.

Months later, McKinsey won another contract: this one with the Malaysian government, to review the feasibility of the rail line.

In a confidential PowerPoint report, McKinsey told Malaysian officials that the rail line could increase economic growth in parts of the country by as much as 1.5 percent. It was a figure that the prime minister at the time, Najib Razak, who now has been charged with corruption, liked to cite.

In bullet points, McKinsey also said the project would help improve ties with China -- ""build the nation-to-nation relationship"" -- because of its importance in China's Belt and Road Initiative.

And McKinsey endorsed the idea of heavy borrowing from China, referring to it as a ""game changer"" elsewhere in the region.

It isn't hard to see where McKinsey's enthusiasm for the Belt and Road Initiative came from: The firm had promoted the Chinese policy at the highest levels of the company.

Dominic Barton, McKinsey's managing partner at the time, made Belt and Road the theme of a keynote address in Beijing in 2015, recounting the Silk Road trade from the second century B.C. onward.

McKinsey's in-house research group, the McKinsey Global Institute, sprang into action, producing reports -- widely cited in the Chinese state news media -- extolling the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Mr. Barton -- who has served on the advisory board of China Development Bank, one of the two biggest Chinese lenders to the Belt and Road Initiative -- also batted down concerns in a 2015 interview with Chinese state media that the undertaking might be used as a tool to expand China's global influence.

""The world is waiting for the 'One Belt, One Road' grand blueprint to move from dream to reality,"" Mr. Barton and his colleagues wrote in a report published on the company's Chinese website in May 2015, expressing McKinsey's enthusiasm to work on it.

The feeling was mutual. Nine of the top 20 Belt-and-Road contractors are or have been McKinsey clients, according to research by The Times and figures from RWR Advisory Group, which tracks such projects.

In 2016, McKinsey's client, China Communications, won the $13 billion contract to build the Malaysian railroad. McKinsey justified the project at a time when Mr. Najib was widely accused of corruption, buffeted by street protests over the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars from a state investment fund, and badly in need of cash from an outside lender like China.

The scandal over the deal has enveloped both of McKinsey's clients. Mr. Mahatir told local reporters that China Communications, which won a no-bid contract for the railroad, may have deliberately overstated the costs in order to help Mr. Najib and his allies shovel extra money into the investment fund to replenish the missing amounts.

Tony Pua, a Malaysian lawmaker and an aide to the finance minister, said the deal was brokered by a hard-partying Malaysian businessman named Jho Low, who is accused of siphoning off hundreds of millions of dollars from the fund and is now believed to be in China, avoiding a Malaysian arrest warrant.

McKinsey says it has no knowledge of any collusion between China and Mr. Najib. It said that of course it would discuss China's sweeping Belt and Road plans but rejected the notion that, by representing both sides involved in the project, the company had a conflict of interest in any way. By the time China Communications won the bid, its work for Malaysia had already finished, the firm said.

""Our firm's rigorous internal policies and procedures"" ensure that ""we bring an independent perspective"" to help each client ""pursue its own strategic goals,"" McKinsey said.

But the political backdrop -- a government facing crippling corruption accusations and the prospect that Mr. Najib might turn to China for funds to cover his tracks -- should have been obvious to McKinsey at the time, argued Bridget Welsh, a professor at John Cabot University in Rome who focuses on Malaysian politics.

""They were choosing to engage with actors that were deeply tainted,"" Ms. Welsh said of McKinsey.

A Special Relationship

It was not the first time McKinsey had been drawn into questionable arrangements through its work in China.

The company opened its first office there in 1995, using consultants from the United States and Britain. By the end the decade, McKinsey was on hand to help as Beijing began pushing its moribund state-owned companies to adopt Western-style management, a McKinsey specialty.

The firm landed some big clients. Its star pupil was Ping An, an insurance company set up as part of a state-owned shipping company. Beginning in 1997, McKinsey began a two-decade relationship with the company as it rose from a footnote to one of the world's biggest insurers.

McKinsey's success soon reached into the pinnacle of Chinese politics, dragging it -- unwittingly and unknowingly, the company contends -- into a potential conflict of interest in the most glaring example of official enrichment in the history of the People's Republic of China.

Always in search of top talent, McKinsey brought on a 27-year-old named Liu Chunhang as a full-time associate in 2002. He had just graduated near the top of his class at Harvard Business School, according to school records, and stayed at McKinsey for less than a year. But in that time, his in-laws took steps that would turn them into billionaires.

Mr. Liu was the son-in-law of Wen Jiabao, the country's vice premier in charge of finance. Several months later, Mr. Wen became China's premier, putting him in charge of running the government.

At the time, McKinsey's client, Ping An, was preparing for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The Wen family and its business associates became secret shareholders of Ping An, having acquired their stakes at low cost in late 2002. And as premier, Mr. Wen presided over China's cabinet, which oversaw the insurance industry and signed off on big I.P.O.s.

According to McKinsey, Mr. Liu left the company in July 2003. It's not clear whether he played any role in his extended family's business activities. But when Ping An went public the next year, the Wen family amassed a staggering fortune, largely in company stock. By 2007, the family was worth at least $2.7 billion.

Mr. Liu, who is now a senior official at China's banking regulator, said through a spokesman that he ""never worked on any projects for the firm's Chinese clients,"" and that it would be ""misleading"" to connect him with McKinsey's work for Ping An.

McKinsey said that Mr. Liu had been hired because he was qualified, not because of his family connections.

""Any suggestion that Mr. Liu was hired or employed for improper purpose is false and extremely misleading,"" the company said.

Today, China's best and brightest clamor to work at McKinsey. Partners in the firm have sat in on Communist Party meetings at companies. More than 90 percent of the company's 350 consultants in China are of Chinese descent, according to its website.

And the importance of China to McKinsey over all is evident: The firm's last two managing partners, Mr. Barton and Kevin Sneader, were promoted from the region. Mr. Sneader now runs the entire company from Hong Kong.

McKinsey's name has become so prestigious in the country that a Chinese copycat sprang up, adopting the company's Chinese name.

The copycat firm -- Chengdu McKinsey Management Consulting Company -- even won a contract to advise Sichuan Province on its economic planning. Its ruse was so successful that the China Economic Weekly, a magazine under the Communist Party's mouthpiece People's Daily, wrote a cover article about the spreading influence of the real McKinsey, likening it to an octopus, and marveling at the success of the fake one.

McKinsey said it had not worked on the economic planning in Sichuan Province.

The company, however, has not shied away from contentious programs like ""Smart Cities,"" worrying scholars and human rights advocates who say the approach will strengthen China's surveillance state.

The idea of smart cities is to make them more manageable by collecting data from sources like cameras. In an authoritarian state like China, that raises broad concerns.

""Police patrols cannot be everywhere, for instance, but predictive analytics can deploy them in the right place at the right time,"" McKinsey wrote in a report in June.

""It is about political control,"" said Samantha Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

McKinsey is now working with Ping An to put smart cities into practice in the Chinese city of Nanning to monitor financial fraud.

The company has also championed -- even parroted, critics say -- the Chinese government's ""Made in China 2025"" initiative to become a global leader in sensitive fields like artificial intelligence and aerospace, a policy rattling European and American leaders who fear the plans will undermine their economies and set the stage for Chinese dominance.

In October, Vice President Mike Pence warned that ""through the 'Made in China 2025' plan, the Communist Party has set its sights on controlling 90 percent of the world's most advanced industries.""

McKinsey has produced at least 10 reports in Chinese focusing on ""Made in China 2025."" But earlier this year, China's government ordered the news media to stop writing about it, given the intense criticism from the United States and Europe. McKinsey's reports also stopped mentioning the policy.

""They sometimes seem to be almost like an arm of the People's Daily,"" George Magnus, a former chief economist at UBS, said of McKinsey. ""Obviously they do it in a slightly more subtle way -- sometimes not so subtle.""

Clients Under Sanctions

When Senate investigators wanted to know why Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, met with the head of a Russian bank under sanctions shortly after the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Kushner explained that, as far as he had been told, the bank chief had ""a direct line to the Russian president.""

It is easy to see how. The bank -- Vnesheconombank, or VEB -- is owned by the Russian government and overseen directly by Mr. Putin's inner circle. The bank's former chief -- the one Mr. Kushner met -- graduated from the training school of the F.S.B., the successor agency of the K.G.B. The bank has also come under scrutiny in Congress and by the special counsel investigating possible collusion in the 2016 election.

And the bank is a McKinsey client.

In August, VEB hired the consulting firm to develop its business strategy -- one of several companies that are under sanctions and that McKinsey advises.

Sberbank -- a state-controlled bank that is on the sanctions list and that sponsored Mr. Trump's Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013 -- is also a McKinsey client. In 2016, it agreed to pay the firm up to $5.2 million for advice on restructuring.

Yet another state-owned bank under sanctions, VTB, agreed to pay McKinsey about $4.4 million in 2017 to develop information technology.

McKinsey's work in Russia is extensive. Its Moscow office, the largest of the Western consulting firms working there, has handled about 2,000 projects, working with market leaders in oil, gas, banking and retail, as well as the mining of diamonds, gold and coal. One of its senior partners is the son of the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

McKinsey is so valued in Russia that even as Mr. Putin and Western nations clashed over Ukraine, a partner in the firm served on a Russian energy commission until 2015, along with several business executives who were either the target of individual sanctions or had ties to companies under sanction.

McKinsey clients help expand Russia's reach abroad. One of them -- PhosAgro, a fertilizer giant with ties to the Kremlin -- is pushing hard for new regulations that would give it greater control over Europe's food supply. The European Union already had concerns about Russian influence over its natural gas supply, much of which came from Gazprom, another Russian company under sanctions that McKinsey has advised on strategy and pricing.

McKinsey says it takes jobs in Russia -- or anywhere in the world -- only when it believes it can make a positive contribution. McKinsey also says its consulting is not political in nature, but focused on helping people lead better lives.

The firm has plenty of accomplishments to point to. In Russia alone, it upgraded Aeroflot, the national airline, improved traffic flow in Moscow and improved worker safety.

And McKinsey is far from the only American company working in legal ways with companies under sanctions. Some American officials have long argued that getting involved in the Russian economy not only benefits the American companies working there, but can also help foster better business practices and a greater appreciation for democratic principles overseas.

Others see little evidence of that. Robert G. Berschinski, a State Department official in the Obama administration, said business leaders and policymakers often believed that actively engaging with authoritarian governments would lead to economic reform, which in turn would drive political reform.

""But what is becoming increasingly clear, in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia -- in all three of those instances -- that belief has not proven to be true,"" he said.

China is a prime example, argued Mr. Kramer, the former assistant secretary of state. He said the country had lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, yet companies that do business there ""have nothing to point to"" showing that Chinese people have been granted more civil or political rights.

In some cases, McKinsey's work may have made things worse.

The firm produced a report tracking how some of Saudi Arabia's most important policies were viewed by the public, singling out three individuals who drove often negative conversations on Twitter.

One was later arrested, according to a human rights group. Another said that Saudi government officials had imprisoned two of his brothers and hacked his cellphone. The third -- an anonymous account -- was shut down.

McKinsey said it was ""horrified by the possibility, however remote,"" that the report could have been misused. But the kingdom is a such a vital client for the firm -- the source of nearly 600 projects from 2011 to 2016 alone -- that McKinsey chose to participate in a major Saudi investment conference in October even after the killing and dismemberment of a Washington Post columnist by Saudi agents.

""The world is divided into people who are for beheadings and against beheadings,"" said Anand Giridharadas, a former McKinsey consultant and former Times writer. He added that the firm and other companies were lending ""their reputation and credibility to a regime that deserves none of that.""

For 19 months, Calvert W. Jones, a University of Maryland professor, crisscrossed the Gulf monarchies in the Middle East as part of her research evaluating the work of management consultants in what she calls ""the black box of authoritarian governance.""

""Even if democracy itself remains a distant hope, so the thinking goes, experts might improve the daily lives of citizens in fundamental ways,"" Ms. Jones wrote.

Her conclusions are not likely to make it into recruiting videos for consulting companies seeking idealistic college graduates.

""In the beginning, the best of them want to help, want to do real research, provide data and expert opinions,"" she said. But after initially speaking their minds, she said, they gradually stop.

""They engage in the art of not speaking truth to power,"" she said. ""They self-censor, exaggerate successes and downplay their own misgivings due to the incentive structures they face.""

Outside experts might even reduce, rather than encourage, domestic reform, Ms. Jones said, partly because consultants are often unwilling to level with the ruling elite. The issue is becoming increasingly relevant, she said, as ""the number of experts circulating around the world continues to grow.""

The expansion is clear enough in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh on a weekday morning. There, a former Western diplomat quipped, you can watch the consultants departing for their jobs ""like bats leaving a cave."""

5G networks are said to provide the broadband speed of 1 Gbps. Theoretically, a high definition 2-hour video can be downloaded in 5 seconds at this speed. The telecom secretary said there is a need to increase mobile tower base by three times and OFC rollout by four-folds to achieve 'broadband for all' target under the National Broadband Mission.

""We have to roll out Wi-Fi services in rural and urban areas. To deliver the benefit of NDCP to people and create jobs, states have to come forward. We will do a comparative evaluation of all states and highlight best policies for other states to adopt it,"" Sundararajan said.

The telecom ministry has floated tender to roll out 10 lakh Wi-Fi hotspots across all 2.5 lakh village panchayats. At present, 1.21 lakh panchayats are ready with broadband services infrastructure. The DoT has awarded task to roll out Wi-Fi services in 62,0000 panchayats to Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) and is working with ITI for setting up Wi-Fi hotspots in other panchayats.

""Broadband services have been started in all panchayats covered under Phase 1. Now we are looking at utilisation of broadband where states need to come forward and identify institutions like school, police stations etc that are to be connected with Wi-Fi,"" Sundararajan said.

She said states have to ensure that there is enough electronic equipment available at their institutions to start using the BharatNet broadband network for various services like telemedicine, e-health, e-education etc.

""DoT is working to create state-of-the-art telecom infrastructure in the next four years and we want states to draw a roadmap to start using it. At the workshop, we will work on yearly targets that states need to achieve,"" Sundararajan said. She said the telecom ministry would discuss with states usage of broadband for development at aspirational districts, enhancing connectivity in Naxal-affected areas, northeastern states and islands."

It was on December 17, 2013, that the Medical College was acquired by the government from the Cooperative Academy of Professional Education.

Cathlab and imaging centre

According to Sreekala, principal, EMC, the installation of the much-awaited Cathlab is over. However, the lift is yet to be operational and will take three more months. Hopefully, by March, the Cathlab will be

functional enabling people to avail expensive treatment free of cost.The imaging centre, a project worth around Rs 25 crore, is being made in the pay-ward block. A skeletal structure already existed here. With this, the hospital will also have advanced scanning facilities. The arrival of MRI will be an added advantage when approaching the Medical Council of India for approval of the PG courses.As for super speciality wings, cardiology, neurology and nephrology has got new posts and professors though the professor in neurology is yet to take charge.The appointments have come as a big boost for the college considering the lack of staff at the super speciality wing was a major issue.

Many projects

This will have two phases. The piling work in the first phase is on and the project has a budget of around Rs 368 crore. With regard to e-health and Ardram project, Rs 4.1-crore investment is made to establish an e-token system. Once finished, patients won't have to stand in queues.

Staff integration

When the college was taken over by the government, a five-year stand-alone period was declared. As many as 39 members of the faculty were integrated into government service. Assistants will be taken to the mainstream by considering 2013 as the start of their service. Recently, 31 lecturers also got integrated but it is still an order.""Payment is an issue. Some of us get Non-Practicing Allowance and some are getting

Patient Care Allowance. There is no clarity in most of the allowances and pay scale. However, things are changing slowly,"" said Dr Unnikrishnan, faculty, EMC. The case of non-teaching staff is no different and as the five-year stand-alone period reaches completion, the staff are worried.

Renovation and CCRC

Operation theatres, wards and labour rooms are getting renovated. Hopefully, the Cochin Cancer Research Centre will get the promised theatre by this month. For a hospital which has thousands of people relying on it every day from the lower sections of society and a college which has thousands of students studying various courses including paramedical, there is a long way to for EMC to be an integrated health care provider and a premier college.

PG courses

Though there are five PG courses here, they do not have MCI approval. Each department has its own infrastructural difficulties and sorting them out will take more time. Two batches have already passed out and the students are having difficulty finding jobs, both within the country and outside. The authorities are planning to rectify the defects and move for approval soon."

JAMMU, Dec 16: Uncertainty looms large on the fate of significant recommendation for much talked about reservation to the inhabitants of International Border (IB) in Jammu and Kashmir as the Department of Social Welfare continues to sit over the proposal in this regard by the State Commission for Backward Classes.

Besides this, four other important recommendations of the Commission, such as suitable modification in the J&K Reservation Rules 2005 for restraining reservation under RBA or ALC to non-deserving people, inclusion of 59 identified villages under RBA, treating Kolis as Gaddi-Sippis for reservation benefits to the community and also reservation to Boria and Yogi communities continued to gather dust in the Social Welfare Department since months.

These separate recommendations were formally submitted by the Commission to Social Welfare Department for its consideration and forwarding the same to the Law Department for its concurrence and then placing the matter before Cabinet/State Administrative Council for the nod before final consent by the Governor.

It may be recalled that in September last, the Commission had formally recommended for benefits of reservation to people living in border villages within an area of zero to six kilometers from the International Border by amending sub rule c (11) of the rule 4 of J&K Reservation Rules 2005 and re-cast it as ""residents of the areas adjoining the Actual Line of Control (ALC) and the International Border (IB), instead of residents of area adjoining the Actual Line of Control (ALC)"".

As per the official data, reservation benefits to IB people will approximately cover a population exceeding three lakh and villages numbering over 350 from Kathua to Pargwal in Akhnoor. Residents of the areas adjoining Actual Line of Control (ALC) with Pakistan and China in Jammu and Kashmir have already been provided reservation benefits to the extent of three percent.

The Commission has recommended reservation benefits to the people of International Border in view of their repeated suffering on account of direct line fire, minor skirmishes, cross border fire and other similar incidents. Besides death and destruction, people living in border villages are often subjected to dislocation and displacement, which has physical and psychological affect on them. The people are forced to leave homes and denied health care as well as education. The studies of students of these villages are disturbed frequently and they therefore find it hard to compete with their counterparts of other peaceful areas.

However, even after more than two months since submission of the Commission's recommendations in this regard to the Department of Social Welfare, there has been no further progress on the exercise for according reservation benefits to the IB residents, who are eagerly awaiting for the much talked about succor to them.

Similarly, several other important recommendations of the Commission for Backward Classes are also gathering dust in the Department of Social Welfare.

On April 16, 2018, the Commission had recommended for inclusion of 58 backward villages under RBA category but no further action has been taken so far by the Social Welfare Department. A reminder in this regard was also sent to the Department but again there was no response for the reasons best known to the concerned authorities at the helm of affairs.

The Commission, in its recommendation to the Government on 31-01-2018, has asked for ending discrimination with the Kolis by treating them as Sippis. After detailed deliberations on the issue, the Commission recommended that judgment of the J&K High Court in OWP No. 117/2015 and MP No. 1/2015 whereby the Deputy Commissioner Kathua was directed to make necessary correction in the Revenue records from the word Koli to Sippi wherever occurring, be applied to the entire State.

Pertinent to mention that Sippi and Koli are one and the same caste who have blood relations with each other. In most of the pockets of the State where Kolis reside, they are usually referred to as Sippis.

In its another important recommendation to the Government last year, the Commission proposed that a person claiming benefit for being resident of Backward Area or Areas near Line of Actual Control must establish that he/she has resided in the area for a period not less than 15 years before the date of application and is actually residing in the said area.

Proposing reservation benefits to Boria and Yogi communities in Jammu Kashmir were among other recommendations made by the Commission.

However, all these recommendations notwithstanding their great significance for the people to be benefited, are gathering dust in the Department of Social Welfare, which has allegedly not taken a note of the same.

Official sources said that the Department of Social Welfare has neither approved any of these proposals nor sought any clarification on the same except in the case of recommendation for inclusion of 59 villages under RBA, which was also replied along with a reminder by the Commission on May 3, 2018.

The unprecedented delay on the recommendations is not only depriving the deserving people from the benefit of reservation but also amounts to lowering esteem of the Commission, which is trying its best to achieve the objective behind its establishment.

Despite repeated attempts Secretary Social Welare Department did not respond to the phone calls for Government version on the fate of Commission's recommendation."

""Children from Tripura go to other states, even abroad for studies. But they don't want to come back here because the former dispensation failed to develop the state in last 25 years,"" Deb said.

The department has packages in hand for 3,000 hours which is more than sufficient to telecast without interruptions. Work to schedule programmes are under process.""

Videos lessons - mostly for newly introduced concepts and difficult lessons - which practically explain the concepts of academic syllabus would be aired along with short videos on moral values. Videos to educate students about traditional games, Yoga and Thirukkural would also be aired, the source said.

As talents found in government school students and teachers remain hidden, teachers who had adopted innovative methods in their schools and students with real talent would be featured in the channel.

Live classes would also be taken for students preparing for competitive examinations like NEET and CA, the source said, adding that awareness would also be created about important announcements, government schemes and scholarship programmes.

""90% of the programmes would be aired in Tamil and a programme is designed to train the students in English language,"" the source added.

""A group of teachers from all the 32 districts is roped in for the project. Almost all the videos to be aired in the channel were created by the teachers along with outsourced technicians. Only the government school students, teachers and experts have acted in the videos,"" another official involved in the project said.

A total of Rs 1.35 crore has been allotted to procure equipment, install and to connect the studio with TACTV station through fiber cable. The integrated studio will function from Anna Centenary Library in Chennai, the official said, adding that tender to carry out the process was already floated.

Welcoming the move of the department, a government schoolteacher said it would attract students towards schools.

""Most of the times, teachers in rural regions don't get recognition for their hard work and innovations. When such teachers are recognized and featured, it would encourage other teachers to adopt innovation,"" the teacher said, adding that it would change the public's perspective about government schools."

The government is planning to launch broadband services readiness index of states based on parameters like infrastructure, approval processes and utilisation of high speed Internet, a top telecom department official said on December 16.

""According to a study by ICRIER (a research firm), $100 billion investment will have seven-fold multiplier effect on GDP. There is a need of a national mission to make this happen. We are going to launch broadband readiness index for states which will be vital for investments,"" Telecom Secretary Aruna Sundararajan told PTI.

She said the Ministry of Electronics and IT has also shown interest in states readiness index and want to expand it further.

The telecom ministry will hold first workshop on implementation of the National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP) which envisages USD 100 billion investment in telecom sector by 2022, broadband connectivity at 50 megabit per second speed to every citizen, telecom connectivity at every corner of India and creating 40 lakh jobs.

""This is first preparatory national workshop on implementation of NDCP in which 25 states have confirmed to participate. Here we will launch National Broadband Mission to achieve objective of broadband for all,"" Sundararajan said.

Industry leaders and associations will discuss at the NDCP workshop issues they are facing in states especially in rolling out telecom infrastructure which in turn impact investments.

""We want to ensure that 5G is not limited to urban areas. It should reach rural areas. For this, we have to work with states to ensure that there is 100 per cent penetration of optical fibre cables. Without massive OFC penetration, 5G services will not expand. States have to provide smooth right of way permissions,"" Sundararajan said.

5G networks are said to provide broadband speed of 1 Gbps. Theoretically, a high definition 2-hour video can be downloaded in 5 seconds at this speed.

The telecom secretary said there is a need to increase mobile tower base by three times and OFC rollout by four-folds to achieve 'broadband for all' target under the National Broadband Mission.

""We have to roll out wifi services in rural and urban areas. To deliver benefit of NDCP to people and create jobs, states have to come forward. We will do comparative evaluation of all states and highlight best policies for other states to adopt it,"" Sundararajan said.

The telecom ministry has floated tender to roll out 10 lakh wifi hotspot across all 2.5 lakh village panchayats.

At present, 1.21 lakh panchayats are ready with broadband services infrastructure. The DoT has awarded task to roll out wifi services in 62,0000 panchayats to Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) and is working with ITI for setting up wifi hotpsots in other panchayats.

""Broadband services have been started in all panchayats covered under Phase 1. Now we are looking at utilisation of broadband where states need to come forward and identify institutions like school, police stations etc that are to be connected with wifi,"" Sundararajan said.

She said states have to ensure that there is enough electronic equipment available at their institutions to start using BharatNet broadband network for various services like tele-medicine, e-health, e-education etc.""DoT is working to create state-of-the-art telecom infrastructure in next four years and we want states to draw a road map to start using it. At the workshop, we will work on yearly targets that states need to achieve,"" Sundararajan said."

Her death shows not much has changed","Business Insider",FALSE,"Border officials and facilities are under renewed scrutiny after 7-year-old Jakelin Caal died last week in US Customs and Border Protection custody.

The Guatemalan child died at an El Paso, Texas hospital eight hours after CBP took her into custody.According to a timeline released by CBP, agents first became aware of the girl's symptoms during a bus ride to a police station after the girl was apprehended along with a larger group of migrants.

By the time the group arrived at the station 90 minutes later, Jakelin had stopped breathing.

Border patrol officials on Friday said agents did everything they could to save the girl but that she had not had food or water for days. They added that an initial screening showed no evidence of health problems and that her father had signed a form indicating she was in good health.

The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general said Friday that it was investigating the circumstances surrounding the child's death and a DHS official said the agency's transparency practices are also under review after it took the department nearly a week to publicly announce the incident.

The renewed scrutiny into the border agencies comes after over a year of public outcry prompted by President Donald Trump's harsh immigration policies, reports of abuse and poor conditions, and a recent tear-gas-laden clash between migrants and authorities at the US border. But the incident isn't actually unprecedented.

Juarez said in a later lawsuit that she repeatedly requested medical attention for Mairee's declining condition during their time at the facility, but was only prescribed medication that didn't have any noticeable effect.

Once they were released to join family in New Jersey, Mariee was coughing, vomiting and battling a high fever. Juarez rushed her to an Edison, New Jersey hospital the day after landing in the state on March 25, where she was held for respiratory failure.

Mariee would remain there for weeks before she suffered a fatal hemorrhage on May 10.

After Mairee's death, Juarez filed a notice of claim against Eloy, Arizona, saying that ICE placed her and her daughter in a facility ""with unsafe conditions, neglectful medical care, and inadequate supervision."" The notice goes on to claim that Mairee contracted a respiratory infection that ""went woefully under-treated for nearly a month.""

Juarez's lawyers filed a claim last month for $60 million, to which the government has six months to respond before a suit can be filed.

""Having made the decision to jail small children, the US government is responsible to provide living conditions that are safe, sanitary and appropriate,"" Jones said of the negligence alleged in the case.

As officials maintain the quality of resources in their facilities, which are recorded in documents including inspection reports, the issue of overcrowding by unaccompanied minors near work and education age poses a much easier problem to solve than those associated with quality medical care and screening.The Trump administration and border officials remain at odds with outcries from lawmakers and human rights groups, as

Nielsen said on Fox News the child's death was ""just a very sad example of the dangers of this journey."" No questions about the quality of care she received were asked."

After turning Rakh-i-Arth, a wetland into a settlement colony, the State government is planning to construct a residential colony spread over 4200 kanals of wetland in Bemina outskirts, officials said.

A senior official at Srinagar Development Authority (SDA), wishing anonymity said the government has allocated them around 4200 kanals of land for construction of Satellite Township at Rakhi Gundakshah.

""The housing colony (Rakhi Gundakshah) would be named as Satellite Township and will be having all facilities. At present, the government is reviewing the project. The DPR for the project might be prepared by the end of this year,"" the official said.

The land where the new housing colony would be constructed belongs to the State government and it is under the jurisdiction of Rakhs and Forms - a wing of the Agriculture Department. The land was transferred in 2002 to SDA for this township, the official said.

Till last year, the land was under the control of local farmers who would pay rent to the government and they were given enhancement of 40,000 per kanal, but now farmers demand market rate.

According to officials, the upcoming colony will comprise of plots and would be developed with all modern facilities.

""If the township will be high-rise, it can accommodate more than 40,000 people. It will end 90% of the need of housing in summer capital Srinagar,"" they said adding if authorities leave land unused people might occupy the same.

About the government move, environmental experts in Kashmir have expressed serious concern over the deteriorating condition of wetlands.

Head Department of Earth Sciences, University of Kashmir, Prof Shakil Ahmad Romshoo, said, ""It is unfortunate that the state government is treating wetlands as wastelands.""

""Wetlands are store basins for flood water and state government wants to destroy them,"" he said.

Romshoo said the government has not learnt any lesson from the devastating floods of 2014.

""South part of Srinagar is more vulnerable to floods and earthquakes as compared to the northern part but nothing seems to be done on the ground to save people during disasters.""

According to him all the main government buildings in Bemina area including SDA, State Hajj House, Board of School Education, JVC Hospital, Urban and Local Bodies are prone to damages during natural calamities.

Romshoo demanded that the government should consult environment experts to review the project.

Another environmental expert, Irfan Rashid termed the upcoming township proposal a serious threat to both environment and ecology.

""If people at the helm of affairs have any proposal of construction they must revoke it in the initial stage, otherwise, it will have serious consequences on the environment,"" he said.

Rashid said converting wetland will make Srinagar more prone to floods as this proposed colony will block all the water in the area.

""I think authorities have not learnt any lessons from Rakhi Arth settlement project where houses constructed on marshy land later developed cracks,"" he said.

Hitting at the government Rashid said the government is always in a hurry before they come up with such projects.

""They did so in Rakhi Arth and Central University of Kashmir projects as proper land testing was not followed,"" he said.

Quoting National Centre for Seismology (NCS) 2017 report Rashid said soil in wetlands is weak as per geographical standards and entire Srinagar is highly vulnerable to earthquakes.

Vice Chairman, SDA, Sajad Hussain Ganaie said the project is in pipeline and hoped to get it implemented soon.

""It is satellite township proposal and till now it is conceptual. We hope it will be implemented soon. The government will decide which department will take care of the project,"" he said.

Ganaie said people need such houses, flats with modern facilities. ""Before its foundation is laid we will get 'No Objection Certificate' from every concerned department,"" he said.

Chief Town Planner Kashmir, Fayaz Ahmad Khan said it will be a first-ever mega project in Kashmir. ""It will be having all the modern facilities including recreational, open space. It will be self-sustainable,"" he said.

He stated that the project would be slightly safe as compared to Rakhi-Arth project adding the colony would be open to all, unlike Rakhi-Arth colony.

""The draft will be completed on which the concerned agencies are working. They may take our suggestions for layout,"" the VC added.

When asked whether the project area is a wetland, Khan said they are concerned about the environment. ""We have to maintain ecological balance so that the environment is not affected. It will be a new direction to the art of development in Kashmir. I hope people will see this project from that perspective,"" Khan said."

Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb on December 16 said his government would maintain zero tolerance against crimes and strive hard to develop the state into a ""business hub"".

Addressing the inaugural session of a conference of the state BJP's Law and Legal Affairs Department here, Deb said ""true development"" could be achieved only after containing crimes.

""We would transform Tripura into a business hub and a crime-free state,"" the chief minister asserted.

Referring to places like Dubai, Singapore and Hong Kong, Deb said the rate of crime there was considerably ""low"" and that he wanted to develop Tripura in a similar direction.

""In Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, crime rate is very low. If anyone goes to Dubai, he doesn't have to think about any theft. Taxi drivers of Singapore make sure tourists don't face any trouble. They understand that trouble for a tourist is a loss for their nation and his homestead,"" Deb said.

The CM also observed that youngsters who travel abroad for higher studies often do not come back as the state lagged behind in terms of development.

""Children from Tripura go to other states, even abroad for studies. But they don't want to come back here because the former dispensation failed to develop the state in last 25 years,"" Deb said.

The state government was in the process of drafting a policy so that students do not have to move outside Tripura for education or jobs, he maintained.

""In the next three years, we shall transform Udaipur, Agartala and Dharmanagar into modern cities. All facilities of big cities like Pune, Bangalore will be available there. After that, no child from Tripura will have to go outside the state,"" he added.Udaipur is the district headquarters of Gomati district and Dharmanagar of North Tripura district."

His challenge will be more about making sound ethical judgments (hopefully), while keeping the powers-that-be, happy. That's an art in itself, learnt only from the university of hustle and experience.

Former bureaucrat Shaktikanta Das, 59, has made history by becoming India's first RBI Governor to have graduated with a Masters in History. There is no fixed eligibility criteria for the appointment of a person as RBI governor. However, Das's illustrious predecessors, Urijit Patel and Raghuram Rajan, were renowned economists. Das is remembered primarily for being the Centre's face during those first, few, hideous days post demonetisation. After frantic Googling to ascertain his educational credentials, there's angry speculation among the Twitterati that Das isn't qualified enough for this complex job. In all fairness, Das has had long stints in the finance ministry and has done a management course from IIM Bangalore.

Alas, Das, like every other liberal arts student in India has been written off with contemptuous scorn for studying the social sciences. The fact is, in the hierarchy of BA and MA qualifications, English and History are right at the bottom, while Economics Honours is right on top. Philosophy Honours deserves a special mention -- it's not uncommon for people to collapse in hysterical laughter at hearing a 19-year-old say he's studying the works of Emmanuel Kant.

The Humanities, in public imagination, is that pathetic space for people not bright enough to pursue business studies or Physics-Chemistry-Maths, still the holy grail of education. It's a presumption that Das isn't equipped to steer the RBI. For a start, he would have learnt from recent history not to disagree with the Finance Minister or the PMO, thereby ensuring he is not doomed to repeat the former Governor's dramatic exit.

It is worth noting that if the right degrees and qualifications were all you needed to survive in government, Raghuram Rajan and Urijit Patel would have had less-controversial terms. Having studied what corresponds with one's chosen career will make one slightly more competent but a distinguished academic past is no guarantee of brilliance or glory.

Advertising

No degree even remotely prepares you for everyday problems, like managing conflict and difficult relationships in the office. It's a fantasy that anything we learn in school or college can keep up with the terrifying speed of the changes happening in our world. Algorithms, AI and the cult of coding are valuable buzzwords in the current short term but there's a real possibility that people equipped with these skills will be obsolete in less than a decade. Besides, not everyone wants to become a coder or diligently study whatever makes one a sought-after commodity in the job market. There should be more room (and respect) for people who want to, say, study Nietsche. Contrary to popular perception, it doesn't automatically make you a frivolous dilettante, lucky enough not to have to worry about earning a living.

A liberal arts education takes a broader view of, dare I say it, life. There may not be headhunters breaking down your door the second you graduate after an ambitious study of classic literature in the 15th century, but learning about people and cultures over the centuries hones the crucial skill of rational thinking. ""It's only through carefully studying the past that you have any idea where the world is heading,"" says Nilima Chitgopekar, Associate Professor, Department of History, Jesus and Mary College, Delhi.

With this, the number of deaths has gone up to 13.

Salamma and Maheshwari, both aged around 35 and natives of M.J. Doddi, breathed their last at a private hospital here. The condition of eight persons is said to be serious. At least 66 patients are being treated at eight private hospitals and 28 more in the State-run K.R. Hospital. Relatives continued to throng the hospitals to see the patients.

Minister for Health and Family Welfare Shivananda Patil, accompanied by Chamarajanagar district in-charge Minister Puttaranga Shetty, MP R. Dhruvanarayan, Hanur MLA R. Narendra, and Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey visited K.R. Hospital and the private hospitals. Mr. Patil said his department had sent samples of the ""poison-laced prasada"" and other items to various agencies, including CFTRI and the FSL, for examination. ""We are awaiting reports,"" he said.

Meanwhile, two more suspects have been detained for questioning. Superintendent of Police Dharmendra Singh Meena told The Hindu that four teams comprising 20 officers, led by the Kollegal Dy.SP, are investigating the case. ""The information shared by the suspects is being cross-verified. All leads are being pursued but nothing concrete has emerged so far,"" he said.

On the lack of public health infrastructure for handling the tragedy of this magnitude, Mr. Patil said the Minister for Medical Education will speak on this issue since K.R. Hospital comes under his department. ""But I must say, there was no lapse on any part and doctors handled the crisis well. I'm told that K.R. Hospital has been allocated ₹37 crore out of the ₹120 crore for its improvement,"" he said. To a question on the delay in his visit to the hospitals, a defensive Mr. Patil said the government responded quickly to the episode and made arrangements for the treatment with Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy himself rushing to the hospital a few hours after the tragedy.

He said Home Minister G. Parameshwara will make a statement at the legislature session in Belagavi in the coming week on the investigation into the incident.

According to Kawal Tiger Reserve Field Director Chandrasekharan Saravanan, the tigress, now a little over two years old, was making regular kills and feeding on them. Its last cattle kill was on Saturday, he said. ""We are taking all possible steps, including using tiger urine as a lure, to limit its range and restrict it to a smaller area,"" he said.

Since tigers communicate with each other typically with their sense of smell and urine they spray on trees, it is hoped that by using tiger urine collected from the zoo here in the city, K4's movements can be kept within a smaller area by hoping that it would keep coming back to locations where the urine is sprayed by Forest Department staff. This would make it easier for wildlife veterinarians to tranquilise the animal by waiting at a given location where the injured animal keeps returning to.

Meanwhile, sources said the existing wildlife veterinarian team is likely to be strengthened by inviting back two other veterinarians, who previously excused themselves from the capture operation because of work and education commitments."

Kaur, a housewife in south Delhi's Alaknanda, has shortlisted 35 schools for her daughter. ""For us, nursery admissions are an anxiety-filled two-month experience,"" she said. Her remarks were personified in Pulkit Gogoi and his wife Nidhi from Lodhi Colony. The fretful couple hope their daughter gets into a school because if she doesn't the upper age limit narrows her options next year.

Gogoi and Nidhi were the early birds at The Indian School. ""I asked my father to tend my shop today while I go around to the 15 schools I have shortlisted for the admission process,"" said the father. ""I am worried because the only points we will get will be for the neighbourhood criterion."" Gogoi said the best options for his daughter are Father Agnel School and Green Fields School in Safdarjung Enclave.

Schools reserve points for applicants residing in their neighbourhood and for applicants whose siblings are students or alumni of the institutions. Some also give points for the applicant being a first child or a girl child and for being the child of a single parent.

While Kaur and Gogoi were out to collect admission papers being offered offline, Subhechha Mondal, a resident of Malviya Nagar, appeared irked that many of the schools did not have an online process. Having visited two schools by 11am, she grumbled, ""I have a shortlist of 27 schools, of which 12 require us to submit the forms manually though we can get them online. All schools should have online forms to save us time,"" said Mondal.

Most parents reiterated that the admission process should be fully online. Government school teacher Priya Jangid, for one, had to take leave on the day to be able to pick up the forms. ""My husband is also in the education department, so it is not possible for us to take an off together. We have co-ordinated our leaves to enable us to go submit the forms,"" said Jangid.

There were families that thought on the contrary, accepting the opportunity that buying forms offline gave them to physically visit and see the institution. Ashish Popli from Madangir, for instance, said, ""Both my wife and I are not from Delhi and we have never seen these schools. So when we go to collect the forms, it will give us a chance to assess them.""

But even in schools that offered online forms had visitors in some parents on Saturday. For their benefit, many schools had put up detailed information on their notice boards. The last date to submit the forms is January 7."

Teachers use a mobile phone and enter attendance of children on the application, which is updated in a central server. In all, 13,000 schools are linked to this application so that attendance trends can be monitored and studied, instead of piling it in registers.

The application TN Schools Attendance is facing glitches such as delay in synchronisation of attendance data, absence of database updation and server trouble. Teachers said the entered data was not getting registered in the server and there were other problems with the server too.

""While the data was getting properly marked initially, since the last two weeks we haven't been able to access the application to mark attendance,"" said a teacher from a government school in Ashok Nagar.

The application was created by the school education department's Education Management Information System (EMIS) cell.

The idea behind creating this application was to closely monitor attendance records of each student studying in government schools in cities and districts and intervene if they identify a potential dropout.

The data will be monitored by the State Project Director - Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).

""The officers, after identifying long absentee can take appropriate steps to intervene and help the child, if needed,"" said Pradeep Yadav, principal secretary to government, department of school education.

Since the data is launched on a pilot basis, officials said they were currently working on resolving all glitches, which may be done in next two months. ""If each school has five to 10 classes, with a total of 50,000 students, the server will be getting around 5 lakh hits. Initially, the server could not handle the load, we are slowly implementing changes and resolving the issues,"" said an official from SSA."

The CM had taken the decision considering complaints raised by some elected representatives about the quality of bicycles in the review meeting, and had asked the department to conduct an inquiry and stop the supply for the time being.

The education department has sent a letter to all such teachers, warning them of salary loss. A separate letter was sent to principals of those schools that have refused to allow these teachers to join their new postings. The principals have been told that their post will be de-recognized which ultimately will lead to stoppage of salary from government coffers.

There are just over 700 excess teachers in Nagpur, who have been now given new postings at least on paper. The department has not yet shared details of how many teachers are yet to join, as it is giving some time to everyone to complete the formalities.

The separate letters to teachers and principals were needed because in some cases it is the teachers who do not want to shift to a new school while at other places it is the school that does not wish to appoint them.

Some of the teachers do not want to join other schools either because of distance or unfamiliarity. In some cases, school management feel the government is infringing on their right to appoint teachers.

The school is issuing consent forms to be filled by parents to seek their approval for the vaccination but has not given the same to the twins.

A few days ago, the school gave consent forms to all the children but did not give the same to my children. They were told by their class teacher that they will not be given MR vaccination. I am wondering if MR vaccination is a government scheme or the school's personal scheme.""

The board controls over 93,000 acres of prime land in Maharashtra.

Members of the Maharashtra State Board of Waqf (MSBW) have recommended two names for the post to the state government. Shyam Tagade, principal secretary, minority development department, confirmed the same and said that they are scrutinising.

The MSBW has no full-time CEO since July 2017. SC Tadvi, the department's joint secretary is the additional charge. The baord also lacks a full-time chairman and has only five of 12 members. Under the Waqf Act, 1995, the state government can appoint a CEO from a panel of two names suggested by the Board.

Hussain Dalwai, Congress Rajya Sabha MP and MSBW member, said the board, in its meeting held last month, had recommended the names of SEA Hashmi, additional CEO, Gondia Zilla Parishad and Sajid Pathan, deputy secretary in the medical education department.

""With no full-time CEO, routine works like registering new Waqf properties, completing change reports and encroachment removal have been affected,"" added Dalwai, saying that the board needed budgetary allocations from the state government. He said the Waqf land should be free from encumbrances as it is required to educate the underprivileged from the Muslim community.

After the CEO, Sayyed Aejaz Husain was transferred, Naseema Banu Patel was appointed with an additional charge on September 2015. In August 2016, the board recommended three names to the government, but the state said all three were not eligible or their services could not be made available. AR Qureshi was then appointed in January 2017. Board member Abdullah Khan (Babajani) Durrani approached the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court against the appointment.

In May 2017, the court ordered that the board may suggest names of two eligible officers and the state may appoint one of them as the CEO. Qureshi was to continue till a full-time CEO was transferred in July 2017, after which the board has had no full-time official in the post.

Patel, a revenue officer, was suspended by the state government in March 2017 for allegedly delisting Waqf land at Nashik during her tenure.

Dalwai said the board needed adequate staff. MSBW chairman, former Congress MLC MM Shaikh, who assumed office in August 2016, resigned in November 2017 after being confronted with a no-confidence motion by the members, but is holding the acting charge.

State government statistics suggest that Maharashtra has around 93,418 acres of Waqf land spread over about 23,566 registered properties, with most land parcels in to Aurangabad division, which was part of the dominion of the Nizam of Hyderabad. However, most of these lands are encroached, illegally occupied or transferred."

Taking a strict stand against three of these establishments which were found in violation, the government has filed FIRs registered against them while the rest are facing scrutiny by the labour department.

""Under our Operation Minimum Wages campaign, labour inspectors have registered statements of the labour and owners at these places. Different types of violations like non-payment of minimum wages, late payment and not informing employees about the Provident Fund and Employees' State Insurance are the laws that have found broken,"" said Gopal Rai, Minister of Labour.

Police cases were registered against Orian Security Solutions, M/s Global Enterprise and Digital Web Word. In most of the establishments that were inspected, staff members from the housekeeping, security and even engineering departments have raised complaints. Engineers placed by the Public Works Department in hospitals have also raised issues. In order to strictly ensure payment of minimum wages in the national capital, the Delhi government had launched 'Operation Minimum Wages' for a period of 10 days starting from December 10.

A total of teams, which are part of the special drive, are carrying out inspections in the city to ensure that establishments are not violating the increased minimum wages and other labour laws. According to guidelines, violators can face a fine of upto 50,000 or jail terms for three years, informed officials that were part of the team. Under the campaign, all district Joint Commissioners will hold meetings with employers in their respective districts to implement the increased rates of minimum wages.

Workers who are not getting minimum wages or have other labour complaints can file their complaints on government helpline number 155214. A key takeaway from the raids was that public places like government-run hospitals were also found to be violating the rules of minimum wages.

Minimum wage

The minimum wages for workers in the capital were revised after a Supreme Court order in October. Starting from October 31, the wages for each category were classified by the government. While unskilled workers will now get 14,000 per month or 538 per day, semi-skilled workers will get 15,400 per month or 592 per day and skilled workers will get 16,962 per month or 652 per day.

As part of a campaign against obesity, the Department of Surgical Gastroenterology at Jipmer conducted a Continuing Medical Education (CME) on bariatric surgery.

The seminar sought to highlight the recent advances in the medical and surgical treatment of 'diabesity' against the backdrop of the incidence of obesity or overweight increasing by alarming proportions, worldwide and in India. Obesity is recognised as a risk factor for more than 30 disorders including cancer.

Inaugurating the event, Dr. R.P Swaminathan, Jipmer director, pointed out that Jipmer had launched a comprehensive obesity and metabolic surgery programme in March 2015 to become the only major government institute in the South India and the second after AIIMS, Delhi, to have such a dedicated programme.

The multidisciplinary team at Jipmer includes a surgical gastroenterologist, endocrinologist, pulmonologist, cardiologist, psychiatrist, anaesthesiologist and nutritionist.

The surgery that costs more than ₹3 lakh in private hospitals is performed at Jipmer for approximately ₹65,000 making it the most economical metabolic surgery programme in the country, he added.

The sessions featured experts such as Dr. Parthasarathy from Hyderabad and Dr. Sandip Chandrasekar from Coimbatore. Dr. AS Badhe, medical superintendent, Jipmer, Dr. Biju Pottakkat, additional professor and head of the department of surgical gastroenterology and the coordinator of the obesity, and Dr. Senthil G, assistant professor also participated.

Dr. Kalayarasan, organising secretary, said three years since the launch of metabolic surgery programme, the team had successfully treated 60 patients with morbid obesity. The mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of the operated patients was 45 kg/m2.

The mean excess weight loss of the operated patients at one year was 70% indicating a good response to bariatric surgery. There were no postoperative mortality and none of the patients had any major surgical complications like sleeve leave, anastomotic leak, bleeding or any major complication requiring re-operation making it one of the safest bariatric surgery programme in the country, he said.

In fact, it was in view of the excellent track record of bariatric surgery at Jipmer that the procedure was now covered under Tamil Nadu Chief Minister's Health Insurance Scheme, he said."
