The country did very well in sports. The Indian Cricket team stands on the cusp of winning a series in Australia for the first time in decades. In badminton and boxing, we are clearly making our mark. It was not bad in business although a couple of serious mistakes could have been avoided. The judiciary gave us the odd jolt, but managed to gain balance and poise as the year came to an end. There were truly ugly incidents in which mindless violence was perpetrated by those who claim to protect the cow, calling themselves gorakshaks. Lynching by unruly mobs became the order of the day and killing police officers by pelting stones was carried on with impunity.

Political leaders continued to behave the way they have been doing for some years. They were selfish, narrow minded, communal and anti-people with a sane voice coming across rarely. Nothing to celebrate in education and health from which the governments have been withdrawing, leaving the fate of the poor and underprivileged youngsters in the hands of shabbily run government schools while allowing the private and corporate schools to exploit the middle-class, upper middle-class and the rich. The standards of education in private schools are not being monitored by government officials. There is no mechanism to fix the fees. The same is the case with private hospitals where there is no standard rate card enforced by the governments. Most of the developments in education and health take place without the involvement of the government. It is in the political arena, one saw havoc being played by mischievous, manipulative and selfish politicians. The Constitution is not respected. Even decisions that have to be taken by governments or legislature were left to the courts. The anti-defection law has been flouted at will with no constitutional authority questioning the habitual offenders.

Modi loser, Rahul no gainer

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has lost two allies in Chandrababu Naidu's TDP in AP and Upendra Kushwaha's RLSP in Bihar. The BJP had to concede the Lok Sabha seats it won in 2014 in Bihar to ally with JD(U) to contest in 2019, in order to keep the belligerent Nitish Kumar in the alliance. Ram Vilas Paswan, the cleverest politician in the country, has got six LS seats for contesting in the forthcoming elections and one Rajya Sabha seat in the hard bargain he drove with BJP president Amit Shah. The Modi-Shah duo is struggling to retain its edge in UP and Bihar while regaining the confidence of the people of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh which it lost recently to the Congress. Consolidation of the Hindu vote has always been the trick the BJP depended upon since Advani's Rath-Yatra days.

It is not out of love for Muslim women or respect for their rights that the BJP has been making a lot of noise about passing the Triple Talaq Bill. The argument that this was a ploy to divide the Muslim votes through winning the female voters by championing their cause is unfounded. It is unlikely that Muslim women would defy their men and vote for the saffron party despite the lynching by Gorakshaks and the feeling that minorities are treated as second-rate citizens. The idea is that the Hindu zealots would be happy if the Muslim women are empowered as against men. The Hindus think that only a party like the BJP can deal with the Muslims in a stern manner by bringing about a Bill like this. This notion will help consolidate the Hindu votes.

The BJP leaders are aware that it is not possible to win over the minorities or Dalits at this point in time. The winning mantra would be consolidating the Hindus by impressing them through strong, but sensible policy from the viewpoint of human rights, measures against the Muslim community and revival of the movement to build Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. The Congress party would further get alienated from the Hindu community by stalling the passage of Triple Talaq Bill in Rajya Sabha. The subtle argument put forward by the Congress leaders that it is better to refer to a select committee would not convince the Hindus.

Two Telugu Titans Fight It Out

The Enforcement Directorate informed the highest court in the land that the alleged middleman in VVIP chopper, Augusta Westland, deal, Christian Michel, named Sonia Gandhi and a son of an Italian lady (meaning Rahul) as beneficiaries of the kickbacks. AK Antony, a senior Congress leader known for his integrity and defence minister in 2008, had made it clear that the Gandhis never interfered in the deal while Amit Shah and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis asked Rahul Gandhi to tender an apology to the nation. Rahul flatly refused and continued to say that Modi has been a chowkidar who indulged in theft (Chowkidar Chor Hai) by putting Rs 30,000 crore in the pocket of Anil Ambani, a known defaulter who never produced anything connected to a fighter aircraft in his life, in the Rafale deal. Augusta and Rafale will surely be the main weapons in the battle of ballot in April-May slug-fest which is hardly four months away. Allegations and counter-allegations have marred the debate in the parliament once again. If political parties don't reconsider their strategies in parliament and make a healthy debate possible, the meaning of parliamentary democracy would be lost. We will be reduced to a system of democracy where only elections matter. One has to spend and win elections and then earn more than what was spent making it a vicious circle. All eyes are on Modi and Shah who are expected to use all tricks in their bag to stall the Congress and retain power for another term. While the popularity graph of Modi is falling steeply, the profile of his rival Rahul Gandhi has not been on the ascendant either.

This state of no-winner and no-loser has been manifest in the results of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The Congress could not win a simple majority against the BJP which has been in power continuously for fifteen years suggesting that while the BJP is losing, the Congress is not gaining. This paradox has given scope to regional satraps like K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) to fancy a role for themselves in national politics and entertain unlimited dreams of sitting in the loftiest chair by mobilising other non-Congress, non-BJP parties and drawing them into the so-called Federal Front. Chandrababu Naidu, TDP chief and chief minister of AP, is not one to lag behind. He also declared his intentions that he would cobble up a front that includes the Congress party. The two Telugu titans are flexing their muscles to fight it out in Delhi to have a final say in the formation of the national government after the general elections in 2019. Which Telugu leader has the guts and wits to make a mark on the national scene is the question engaging the attention of the nation, not just the two Telugu States. That way, 2019 is the most crucial year for Modi and Rahul with KCR and Chandrababu Naidu playing their own games in the lobbies."

For the last two months, Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) has been in the eye of the storm as the state government reduced the Eco Sensitive Zone (ESZ) of this protected area by a whopping 100 sq km and further reduced its extent to a bare minimum of 100 m to 1 km. Environmentalists said the present reduction in ESZ is a mockery of both High Court and Supreme Court judgments and also ESZ guidelines.

In a bid to save Bannerghatta, which is considered the last remaining lung space of Bengaluru, citizens from all walks of life - IT professionals, students, activists and resident welfare associations - have come together to protest through every available platform. While some held bike campaigns, others started online protest and petitions on various platforms such as Change.org, Jhatkaa.org and Conservation India. Some also held a public protest/rally in Town Hall, Freedom Park and at different colleges, schools and residential layouts.

Collecting almost 20,000 signatures and petitioning PM Modi on Change.org, people have requested him to consider their submission as a PIL as they said it is a 'criminal conspiracy to plunder BNP and its ESZ'. Another petition by United Bengaluru to Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) too has received support of 20,000 people where they say the arbitrary action not only threatens the fragile ecosystem and biodiversity of BNP but also defeats the stated purpose of establishing an ESZ.Suresh N Ranganath and Vijay Nishanth, United Bengaluru, said, ""Located close to Bengaluru, BNP plays a crucial role in reducing heat and pollution in this mega city and helps in enhancing the overall quality of life for teeming inhabitants.""

The third petition on Jhatkaa.org has received support from almost 15,000 people. They said with BNP facing mining and encroachment issues, Bengaluru is turning into a concrete jungle with rising pollution and heat. Adding their support, Shanthinagar Resident Welfare Association too have joined the protests. Shiv Prasad, their president and other citizens, expressed their support for the 'Save Bannerghatta' campaign.

VVN College joined hands with United Bengaluru by holding an awareness programme for its students/faculty on the ESZ reduction issue and its effect on people and wildlife. Bikers of Bengaluru also organised a rally with support of 'Riders of Bengaluru' and 'Bengaluru Bullet Club' from Town Hall to Bannerghatta on Sunday. According to Samrat Ghodke, Biker Community organiser, the bike ride was to create awareness and sensitise people on this issue.

Record protest

In a one-of-its-kind movement, thousands of citizens have registered their objections online and are sending e-mails to the Union Ministry of Environment of Forests and Climate Change. In a record of sorts, 56,000 people have signed and registered their protest while another 25,000 missed calls have been registered to express their anger against the reduction of ESZ.

Petition submission

Buoyed by the overwhelming support of people, the United Bengaluru group, comprising city's major environmental groups, is now planning to submit a memorandum to Union Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan and request him to reject the draft ESZ 2018 notification and call for a fresh draft based on the 2016 notification.

KIA will also get a new approach road to connect to the current runway, and an alternative entrance for cargo vehicles from the eastern end of the airport.

Water to flow from Mahadayi

After the long-drawn battle with neighbouring Goa for its share of 36.55 tmcft of water under the Mahadayi project, including 7.56 tmcft for drinking water, people of Mumbai-Karnataka finally have reason to smile. According to sources, of the 5.5 tmcft of water allotted for drinking to Karnataka, 3.80 tmcft will be diverted to Malaprabha basin through Kalasa Nala (1.18 tmcft) and Banduri Nala (2.72 tmcft) while 1.50 tmcft is allotted for in-basin consumption in Khanapur region.

Work includes construction of nine major bridges, 44 minor bridges and four road over bridges.

Yeddyurappa to move to national scene?

The state unit of the BJP is likely to get a new president. If sources in the party's Central leadership are to be believed, BS Yeddyurappa will be replaced by a younger state president. Yeddyurappa could be elevated to a national position, to make way for young blood at the state level. CT Ravi, R Ashok, Ananth Kumar Hegde, Nalin Kumar Kateel, Aravind Limbavali, Shobha Karandlaje and Prahlad Joshi are probable alternatives.

Women can breathe easy

A lighter burden for schoolkids

In 2019, children across the country will carry lighter bags on their shoulders. Following the order issued by the HRD Ministry, the state Education Department is preparing guidelines to implement the same.

Q: What are your thoughts on ongoing projects of upgrading schools to hi-tech and international standards?

A: I welcome them. It is essential, as schools in India or Kerala lack the same infrastructure as that of developed countries. However, upgrading schools and colleges to international standards is a long-term process and cannot be achieved during the tenure of a particular government. More than infrastructure, the syllabus and curriculum have to be improved. Also, it is time to think about learning languages used widely across the world. We also need to consider student-exchange. It can be tried between different Indian states.

Q: Travelling to the Himalayas 29 times is no simple feat. What motivated you?

A: I have been asked this often. See, my father was a devout person and every month he visited the Guruvayur Sree Krishna temple. For me, my journeys to the Himalayas are simply something that satisfy my inner self. Nothing more, nothing less.

Q: What were some of your experiences during your journeys?

A: In one of our visits, we were stuck as a big rock had fell on the road, blocking traffic. When we realised we will have to spend the entire night there, two of our team members went looking for a suitable accommodation. They found a Gurudwara and all 110 of us trekked the hill for nearly 3 km in the dark. When we reached there, the authorities there agreed to accommodate us despite our large number. They even gave us food and a hall to rest. We stayed there till the next evening as traffic hadn't been restored. What surprised us was that they refused to take any money. They believed in 'Atithi Devo Bhava'.

Q: Are you planning another trip to the Himalayas?

A: I want to go the Himalayas one more time, to make it my 30th visit, if my health allows. Though I went there on several occasions, I could never complete it due to different reasons.

Q: What is your take on the agitations surrounding the entry of young women into Sabarimala temple?

A: Personally, I feel women of all ages should be allowed to enter the temple. Traditional practices should be reformed as and when society needs it. Earlier, sacrificing animals during yajnas was the practice. Later, a piece criticising the practice appeared in a newspaper, sparking widespread debate. With joint efforts, the practice was later stopped. However, in the case of Sabarimala, women remain divided. If the Supreme Court verdict was welcomed by all, we could have adapted to it by the time of the next generation.

Q: What is your message for the New Year?

A: Last year, we experienced deluge and many lives remain stranded even now. In the coming year, we have to work together to reconstruct society and I look forward to it."

This article is part of Inc42's special year-end series -- 2018 In Review -- in which we will refresh your memory on the major developments in the Indian startup ecosystem and their impact on various stakeholders -- from entrepreneurs to investors. Find more stories from this series here.

""The value of an idea lies in the using of it."" -- Thomas Edison

The cup of ideas runneth over in the Indian startup ecosystem. A good idea is the genesis for any successful startup, but sometimes just having a good idea is not enough.

According to the findings of a survey by the Institute for Business Value and Oxford Economics, 90% of India's startups fail within the first five years. It added that the lack of pioneering innovation is the major reason for the failure of Indian startups -- in essence, they are copycats of startup ideas of the West, the study said.

Turns out, almost half of the Indian startups are actually not needed at all.

It is the absence of scalable ideas that makes 9 out of 10 Indian startups sink like lead balloons, despite the best intentions of founders and investors. The lack of originality is clear from this caveat -- Despite being the third largest startup ecosystem after US and China, the number of international patents India has applied for in 2015-16 was only 1,423 whereas Japan's count stood at 44,235, China at 29,846 and South Korea at 14,626.

This shows the clear mismatch between the number of startups mushrooming and the extent of innovation in the country compared to others.

As per Inc42's The State of The Indian Startup Ecosystem 2018 report, more than 10K Indian startups have shut their operations so far.

While failure is a hard pill to swallow, it is also a great teacher. For a startup founder, there is no bigger disappointment than seeing the product of their efforts come to nought. However there is also the flipside -- if you've never failed, you'll never know what works.

With 2019 just a couple of days away, we at Inc42 have compiled a list of the biggest failed Indian startups of the year. As late-night talk show host, Conan O'Brien said, ""Through disappointment one gains clarity and with clarity comes conviction and true originality""

Just Buy Live connected retailers to buy goods directly from brands across multiple categories such as food, drinks, personal care, auto, smartphones, fashion, stationery, etc. The startup also offered an unsecured credit lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to facilitate the transaction on its portal and provide working capital to small retailers. In August 2017, the startup raised $100 Mn (INR 699.25 Cr) Series B funding from a Dubai-based investment firm, Ali Cloud Investments.

Why it failed

Various reports claim that Just Buy Live may have shutdown due to an unscalable business model and negative cash flow. As per Entrackr's report in March this year, Just Buy Live's cofounder said that the company has temporarily been shut down and would resume operation after raising fresh funding. Its website is currently down.

Shotang was a business-to-business (B2B) online marketplace that connected retailers, distributors and manufacturers to discover, transact and manage their business online using their platform. Its main products were mobiles and apparel. It earned revenue through commissions paid by distributors per transaction.

Why it failed

At its peak Shotang had a $40 Mn (INR 279.7 Cr) market valuation. It had last raised $864K (INR 6.8 Cr) from Patamar Capital in February this year, and $5 Mn (INR 35.94 Cr) from Exfinity Venture Partners in December 2015. Techcircle cited an anonymous person saying that the money it last raised was ""primarily meant to pay off creditors, employees, partners. It tried but failed.""

It is likely that the business was forced to scale down its operation amid fierce competition from the likes of Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm Mall.

PortDesk provided an e-procurement software solution for logistics management for port-related operations such as accounting, cash management, ports DA estimate and voyage, layout and contract management.

Why it failed

In June this year, it was reported that PortDesk has shutdown its business, however, the reason is still unknown. Only a year earlier, the startup had raised $2 Mn (INR 13.98 Cr) in a seed funding round from a Singapore-based maritime services company, Alphard Maritime Group. The startup's founder Pushpit Pallav was not reachable for comments.

Undoubtedly India's largest crypto exchange, Zebpay (till its closure) enabled users to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, and Litecoin, or to purchase airtime and gift cards. According to its website, it had over 3 Mn users.

Why it failed

Zebpay decided to down its shutters in the aftermath of the circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 6 April 2018, restricting banks and regulated payments companies from extending any services to crypto exchanges and wallets.

Many Indian cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as crypto groups, soon knocked the doors of the Supreme Court which, after multiple hearings, has listed the matter for further hearing in January next year.

However, amid the lack of crypto rules and regulations in India, Zebpay, on September 28, 2018 announced its closure. In a statement, it said, ""At this point, we are unable to find a reasonable way to conduct the cryptocurrency exchange business."" The crypto exchange, however, continues to allow users to deposit and withdraw coins/tokens into their wallet.

Since then, the situation has only worsened -- the founders of Unocoin, another leading crypto exchange, were arrested on October 23 by Bengaluru Police over a Bitcoin ATM installation.

Not only Zebpay, a slew of exchanges including Coinsecure, BTCXIndia, MoneyTrade, Bitconnect and more shut down for various reasons this past year.

Online parenting app Babyberry helped parents of a newborn baby to provide the best possible care for their child's holistic growth and development from physical, cognitive, social to emotional growth. The app included features such as digital vaccination chart and reminders, health records management and access to the nearest doctors based on geolocation.

Why it failed

It is uncertain as to what lead BabyBerry to shutdown its operations. Its website is pulled down, it hasn't posted any feeds on its social media since October last year, nor any queries to the founders could elicit any response. In August this year, a report had cited its founder saying that the startup is currently looking to solve technical errors on the platform after many of its customers reported the glitches. Notwithstanding, the startup had raised $1 Mn (INR 6.99 Cr) in 2016 meant for product development and marketing.

MrNeeds offered consumers an online subscription-based service for the delivery of products such as milk, bread, eggs, and other grocery items. In June 2017, ET had cited Wadhwa saying that its ""per delivery costs are 50% to 70% lower than the industry standard,"" and was serving 36K monthly orders for 9K families across Noida.

Why it Failed

The startup has pulled down its website, and is mobile application is not found anymore on Google's play store. It is, however, not clear as to what lead the startup to shut its operations. It is likely that the startup closed down its shutters amid fierce competition from the likes of BigBasket, DailyNinja, and others. Inc42's efforts to reach out to the founders have gone unanswered.

Bike rental startup Tazzo was focussed on point-to-point commuting service and charged INR 5 per km. Its mobile application was integrated using GPS technology and tracked every movement of its entire fleet in real-time, including overspeeding, theft, etc.

Why it failed

TheDearth of the follow-on funding was the main reason for Tazzo to shut down its operation. In October 2016, the startup had raised about $225K (INR 1.5 Cr) seed funding from DSG Consumer Partners, but the capital-intensive nature of the sector it catered too, and the lack of funding, forced the startup to halt its operation in September this year.

Trucks and logistics platform Ezytruk connected carriers, shippers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), to enable systematic transportation of goods. It offered services such as price comparison between carriers, real-time information of the goods, warehouse space management, etc.

Why it failed

Ezytruk had raised a seed funding of $147K (INR 1.02 Cr) from Dubai-based investors Ajith Nair and Anish K in January 2017. However, the startup could not scale and grow further as it was unable to raise further rounds of funding, reported Techcircle, which ultimately led the founders to shutdown the operation this year.

B2B wholesale marketplace Wydr offered a range of products across categories like fashion, home, automotive and electronics to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. The platform allowed sellers to customise their requirements, negotiate prices, and instantly close deals. As at February 2018, the startup claimed to have added over 10K manufacturers and distributors across cities in India.

Why it failed

A report by Entrackr on November 3 cited ShopClues cofounder Sandeep Aggarwal and an early investor in Wydr as confirming the shutdown. The report said that ""the company (Wydr) was scaling down for the past three months and finally pulled the plug a couple of days ago."" An email query sent to Wydr did not elicit any response. Its official website (www.wydr.in) is currently pulled down.

Monkeybox provided Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) - approved vegetarian meals for kids in the age group of 3-18 at school. As on July 2017, the company claimed to be supplying over 1,500 meals per day to more than 85 schools in Bengaluru, with over 2K subscribers on its platform.

Why it failed

The Blume Ventures-backed foodtech startup shut down its operations amid much surprise and speculation. On one hand, the startup had been making quite a few acquisitions -- such as food delivery company 75 In A Box, juice delivery startup RawKing -- and, on the other, there was speculation that it was shutting down as it had failed to garner the required revenue to stay afloat amid fierce competition. On March 23, Monkeybox published a statement saying that ""the operation will be temporarily terminated.""

However, the termination was final. Its official website (www.monkeybox.in) was pulled down.

Apart from Indian startups that shut shop, there are some companies that ceased their operations in India after facing stiff competition and declining revenue. Here are the top top international companies whose India operations were shut down this year.

Walmart-owned ecommerce company Flipkart acquired the Indian arm of global retail company eBay in March 2017 for an undisclosed amount. Like any other ecommerce platform, eBay facilitates consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales through its website.

However, the big difference between eBay and the others is it enables trading on its platforms both in an auction or a fixed price sale. In a buyer's auction, buyers bid for a specific product and in a seller auction, different sellers bid their fixed price for a single product and the buyer chooses the best offer.

Why it failed

In May this year, eBay announced that it was ending its partnership with Flipkart and also forbade the latter to use the eBay.in brand. As the partnership ended, Flipkart migrated eBay India sellers and customers to its platform. Although being among the first players in India's ecommerce space, eBay couldn't actually rake in much revenue and faced fierce competition from Flipkart and Amazon.

As the company slowed down, and before Flipkart took over, eBay India had fired more than 350 employees from its Indian arm.

The reasons for eBay's failure in India have been many: the marketplace model was ahead of its time (eBay launched in 2005); there was no guarantee of product quality for either the buyer or the seller, and Indians never really warmed up to the idea of online auctions.

The company CEO, Devin Wenig, has announced eBay will be relaunched with a new business model in India.

The Alibaba-backed Chinese dockless bike rental company, Ofo, offered bicycles for rent on campuses and gated communities across New Delhi, Indore, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Pune, Coimbatore, and Chennai. At the time of announcing its India operations, the company claimed to have completed 1 Mn rides across seven countries.

Why it failed

Ofo's move to shut down its dockless bike renting service in India is part of company's strategy to scale down its operations in international markets, including countries such as Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, and Israel.

Ofo maintains that the move is aimed at remaining profitable. Techcrunch cited Ofo France general manager Laurent Kennel as saying that the company would focus on ""mature and promising markets"" such as Singapore, the US, the UK, France, and Italy. Moving forward, it is believed to be communicating with local markets about its plans.

Tapzo was an ""all-in-one"" app that used to aggregate more than 35 different apps in one place, across categories such as cabs, food, recharge, bill payment, news, cricket, horoscopes, and more. Tapzo's numbers were definitely impressive: 14,000 daily user base, 55K daily transactions, and an annual run rate (ARR) of INR 210 Cr in GMV/bookings.

Why It Failed

Tapzo's reduced valuation at its last funding round can be considered as a trigger towards its shutdown. Tapzo raised $1.9 Mn (INR 13.28 Cr) in December 2017 from existing investors RB Investments Pte Ltd and Ru-Net South Asia at a post-money valuation of $47.3 Mn (INR 308 Cr) -- nearly 50% less than its valuation in the previous round -- $85.54 Mn (INR 600 Cr).

Around mid of 2018, in August, the startup got finally acquired by Amazon. After the acquisition, Amazon has merged the entire Tapzo team with Amazon Pay, and it was working in the backend. Media reports said that Tapzo's founders are likely to get on board Amazon Pay's team in India.

HolaChef was a food aggregator that connected customers with chefs across the city, offering a new menu selection every day as per its website. Before shutting its operations three months back, the company was managing packaging, storage and delivery of the food.

Why It Failed

The startup was shut down around May 2018 amid a cash crunch. A media report in August has suggested that Kalaari Capital and India Quotient had already resigned from the board of directors of HolaChef earlier in the year.

With the increased dominance of players like Foodpanda, Zomato and Swiggy in the online food delivery market, investors lost interest in the startup. This was coupled with a market correction to make things worse. The last funding raised by Holachef was in February this year when it raised $28,602 (INR 20 Lakhs) in Series B round.

Foodpanda pounced on the chance, acquiring the startup for cheap -- the deal was said to fetch minimal returns HolaChef investors. For Foodpanda, the acquisition was an attempt to test waters in the cloud kitchen space, which its bigger rivals Swiggy and Zomato were already exploring.

A cursory glance at the startup shutdowns reported by Inc42 in the past three years shows that of the 32 startups that ceased their operations, most of them were from sectors such as consumer services, ecommerce, and fintech sectors. However, these sectors were among the top trending sectors in 2018, attracting investment, mergers, acquisitions, and new ventures. In fact, these are sectors that are expected to do better than all other sectors as well.

Goes to prove that it's not all about the idea, doesn't it?

What startups can learn from these stories is to buckle up their business strategy, take stock and identify even the most minuscule problems, and start rectifying them, immediately. They can also sleep on the fact that an idea -- or even market demand -- doesn't alone make a brilliant startup. It's also about execution and the right time, right place. As Edison also said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.""

Update: Holachef and Tapzo have been acquired and not shutdown as was wrongly stated in an earlier version of this article."

2. Bhima Koregaon: Before Memorial Day, Fear Under Security Blanket

Many who will welcome the new year under flimsy pandals around the Bhima Koregaon war memorial have spent every December 31 here, swatting mosquitoes and singing Ambedkarite songs to distract from the cold. But January 1, 2019, is different. It marks a year of deepening faultlines at the site of the 1818 war that saw a Colonial army, helped by a Mahar regiment, defeat the Peshwas. This new year, the day that marks the overthrow of upper-caste rule is time to mull over what remains a divided society.

""It's going to be peaceful tomorrow,"" says Santosh Davne, 35, from Nanded. A vendor of trinkets featuring Dr B R Ambedkar and the Buddha, the disabled Davne has been visiting the Jaystambh, the obelisk to honour soldiers who died on January 1, 1818, on the banks of the Bhima, for 12 years. ""I set up a stall every year, but I have never seen such police presence or such quiet fear among people,"" he says.

""In order to instil nationalism from a young age, it is directed that students of all schools, government, grant-in-aid as well as private, should say 'Jai Bharat' or 'Jai Hind', instead of 'Yes sir' or 'Present sir' across the state from January 1, 2019.

7. 30 Lakh Reapply for Inclusion in Assam NRC

About 30 lakh of the 40.07 lakh people left out of the final draft of the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) published five months ago have applied again for inclusion during the claims and objections round that ended on Monday.

During the phase, 600 objections also came in from those who doubted the citizenship of others included in the draft.

The window for 40.07 lakh of the 3.29 crore applicants excluded from the complete draft was opened on 25 September. It was to have closed on 15 December, but the Supreme Court, which is monitoring the exercise, extended the last day to 31 December after the Assam government said the panchayat election, held on 5 and 9 December, had robbed the people and officials of precious time.

8. Pumps to Remove Water from Meghalaya Mine on Tuesday

Personnel of multiple agencies engaged in the search and rescue operation for at least 13 miners trapped in a coal mine at Ksan in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills, found a wooden structure, coal and mud near the bottom of the pit on Monday.

Six divers of the Indian Navy and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had on Sunday detected a few rat-holes - narrow tunnels where miners have to crawl into to extract coal.

R. Susngi, spokesperson for the district administration, said the site had been cleared for the Odisha Fire Service to start pumping out water from the main shaft measuring about 150 sq ft in area and about 350 ft deep. Other shafts were being prepared to keep at least three of the 10 high-power pumps brought from Odisha operating for longer durations, he said.

9. Pujara and Kohli Difference Between Two Sides, Says Australia Coach Langer

Australian coach Justin Langer has lamented a lack of world-class batsmen in his side's line-up and pointed out that Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara have been the difference for the visitors in the on-going four-match Test series.

India won the third Test at the MCG by 137 runs to take an unassailable 2-1 lead in the series. The fourth Test begins in Sydney on Thursday, 3 January.

""At this stage, the difference in the series is Pujara and Kohli, if we're frank. Pujara averages 53 and Kohli has averaged 46 and got a duck in the second innings. The lesson we learn from that is he just absorbed all our pressure,"" Langer said on Monday.

The rice was stocked for sale in the open market.

While the raid was conducted on December 25, Kashimira police on Sunday arrested the owners of Mahadev Food Agro Mill, Narendra Rane, Dilip Thakkar and Ashok Thakkar on Sunday. Four other suspects are absconding.

Bhayander assistant superintendent of police Atul Kulkarni, along with his team, raided the godown and seized 12,035 gunny bags containing the foodgrain. Each 50 kg bag had the stamp of the Food Corporation of India (FCI), Punjab. The crop year mentioned was 2017-18.

Investigations revealed the rice was allotted under the MDM scheme. Instead of transporting it to the beneficiary schools, it had been offloaded at the mill. Around 10 trucks loaded with foodgrain, parked outside the mill, were also seized.

The owners claimed the rice had arrived at the mill for cleaning and polishing and would then be transported to the schools. The owners, however, were not able to give details of the schools where the rice had to be delivered. Police seized two machines used for cleaning and sorting the rice. Police said the mill did not have licence to store foodgrains procured from the FCI.

The Delhi High Court has directed police to expeditiously probe the death of a 12-year-old girl, who committed suicide after allegedly being rebuked and humiliated by her teacher.

The girl was found hanging in the bedroom she shared with her lawyer-mother in a locality in southwest Delhi on December 1.

Naming the school, principal, class teacher and another teacher as party to the petition, the mother approached the court seeking a CBI enquiry into the child's death, alleging that police was not probing the case properly.

Justice Najmi Waziri, before whom the plea came up for hearing, asked the area's Joint Commissioner to personally look into the matter and take legal action against the culprits within 48 hours. The judge also directed police to lodge an FIR into the incident and file a status report before January 10, the next date of hearing.

Advocate R D Rana, appearing for the mother, alleged the girl had told her friends she would commit suicide and not meet them again. The counsel sought protection for the students, studying at a private school, so they could depose without fear.

He further submitted the Class VII student wrote the teacher's name on her palms and hands and the reason for her extreme step. The ""suicide note"" had said: ""meri suicide ki khabar school tak zarur pahuchana."" She had also written: ""Bye world,"" and ""Jai Shri Krishna I am coming"".

The counsel for Delhi Police told the court, ""We are waiting for the autopsy report and are recording statements of victim's classmates.""

The woman, a single mother, said in her petition that her daughter had complained of relentless humiliation at her teacher's hands. She further alleged her daughter had been insisting on changing schools. ""I (mother) had not realised how extreme it has been and that she would commit suicide,"" the plea said, adding ""her teacher used to rebuke her for trivial issues"".

Besides a CBI enquiry, the plea also called for a probe by an independent agency as the school management was ""trying to cover up the case"".

Soon after the incident, the school in a statement had said, ""... Police are presently conducting an enquiry into the case. We, as a responsible institution, are fully co-operating with the investigating authority and are also conducting an enquiry internally... We stand in solidarity with the family of the student in this difficult time, and assure them our full support in the proper and fair investigation of the case."""

Diwali was toxic, Christmas was too and so was New Year's Eve with the air quality 'severe' on the last day of 2018, in sync perhaps with a year in which there was no getting away from the pollution. As Delhiiites prepared to ring in a New Year with the air quality index (AQI) hovering at hazardous levels, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reported that that 2018 was twice as bad as 2017 in terms of 'severe' air quality days.

In 2018, a total of 18 severe air quality days were recorded in comparison to nine the previous year, CPCB data showed. The year, weary Delhiites said, seemed to pass in a blur of 'severe', 'very poor' and 'poor' air quality days, forcing children and the elderly to stay indoors, morning walkers delaying their daily exercise and schools moving around play times to reduce exposure to the outdoors. Experts said Delhiites breathed over three months of toxic air in 2018. However, the number of 'very poor' days in 2018 were 82, less than the 106 such days in 2017, the CPCB data said.

An AQI between 100 to 200 comes under the 'moderate' category, 201 and 300 is 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', while that between 401 and 500 is 'severe'. There was little escaping the pollution, even in the dying days of 2018 with the last 10 days of the year witnessing intense pollution spells, when the AQI would slip to 'severe' by night and then slightly improve to 'very poor'.

According to officials, the combination of calm wind and colder conditions is elevating pollution levels at night while it gets marginally better during the day with wind speeds picking up slightly and temperatures increasing. The reason for the region's worsening pollution in the summer months can also be attributed to a dust storm in June that resulted in a sudden spike in PM10 (fine particulate matter in the air with a diameter of less than 10 micrometer) level and pushed the overall air quality to 'severe'.

India has witnessed more than 50 storms since February this year. The storm season in 2018 was attributed to western disturbances, low pressure over the Indo-Gangetic plains and intense heating in west and northwest India, an analysis carried out by Delhi-based think-tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) showed.

On June 9, a severe dust storm followed by thunderstorms with wind speed of 96 km per hour hit Delhi. It was the sixth such storm since April, the most number of storms in a season in a decade. On June 12, Rajasthan witnessed a 'ground-level' dust storm that drastically increased coarser particles in the air. The air quality after June showed improvement with the monsoon season but even then there were just three days of good air quality. But the air quality started deteriorating again from October, worsening to 'very poor'.

The first episode of 'severe' air quality of the winter season was registered on October 31. The days around Diwali were the worst -- 'severe' two days earlier and the worst of the year the day after on November 8 when an AQI of 642 was recorded. The pollution after Diwali was 11 times the permissible limit, due to rampant bursting of toxic firecrackers in violation of a Supreme Court order. In 2017, the AQI a day after Diwali was 367. Unfortunately, Christmas was terrible too with unfavourable conditions like a drop in temperature again pushing the national capital's air quality to 'severe'.

A CSE analysis showed marginal improvement in the air quality in autumn and early winter months (October, November and December) of 2018 compared to the same period last year. ""There is a drop in the number of very poor days from 56 per cent in 2017 to 46 per cent in 2018. But there are hardly any good, satisfactory or even moderately polluted days in sight,"" said Vivek Chattopadhyay, senior programme manager, Clean Air Programme, CSE.

The rising pollution levels had their inevitable health consequences. According to a study released in the global health journal Lancel Planet Health 2018, one of every eight deaths in India is attributable to air pollution. Over one lakh children under five years of age died in India in 2016 due to exposure to toxic air, according to a new WHO study which noted that about 98 per cent of children in the same age group in low- and middle-income countries were exposed to air pollution.

Environmental activists believe zero pollution is the solution, not ""less or more"" pollution. ""It must be targeted to become zero. We are at emergency levels of toxicity in the air. I do not believe we have enough political will yet to tackle air pollution at all sources as urgently and cohesively as it needs to be tackled,"" said Ravina Kohli, environmentalist and a member of #MyRightToBreathe campaign. ""Air pollution is a fixable problem.

Awareness of the problem has increased through active citizen action with media support but we are nowhere near making what we can call progress that will save lives and therefore, I believe... government still in denial of this serious problem,"" she added.

Jyoti Pande Lavakare, co-founder, Care for Air NGO, said more people die due to air pollution in India today than war, man-made or natural disasters. ""We need real, measurable progress and a concerted effort to bring air pollution down to acceptable levels,"" she said. As another New Year dawns, millions of people in the city and its suburbs hoped that it would be a cleaner, healthier, less toxic one."

Though 2018, young with expectations and hope for development, began on a slow and steady note with projects like the Kochi Water metro and Smart City receiving a boost, tragedy struck by the middle of the year, after a school van carrying pre-school children of a playschool fell into a temple pond at Ayani in Maradu.

This was to be the first among the many disasters Ernakulam would witness in the coming months.

Hardly a month later, Kerala woke up to another rude shock, the death of SFI member and Maharaja's College student Abhimanyu, which sparked state-wide protest and unravelled a story of political vendetta.

Migrant labourers were brought under the scanner after 22-year-old Nimisha, a native of Malayidamthuruthu, was hacked to death in Perumbavoor.

And even as Kochi prayed for brighter days, bad times came visiting again after Independence Day, when heavy rains led to flooding, rendering many homeless and looking for shelter in relief camps. Homes in Aluva, Paravoor, Varapuzha went underwater spiralling peoples lives out of control.

If that was not enough, the factional feud began rearing its ugly head in municipalities in and around Ernakulam. The nuns' protest demanding the arrest of Jalandhar Bishop Franco Mulakkal gained prominence at Vanchi Square in High Court.

Another nail in the coffin was the death of Ebin Paul an IT professional, a native of Kochi in October, who was killed in a road accident along the pot-hole ridden Kakkanad-Palarivattom route. Yet, despite the tragedies, Kochi did have its share of positive moments.

The Cochin International Terminal attained the one crore passenger benchmark this year while authorities also opened its renovated domestic terminal on a budget of Rs 240 crore. The water metro received a boost while eight small bridges connecting tiny islands under the Goshree Islands Development Authority (GIDA) at an estimated cost of Rs 38.40 crore were thrown open to the public.

The much-anticipated City Gas Pipeline project gathered steam. Adding to Kochi's bag of happiness was the 'conditional permission' granted by the city council to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) for digging up roads to laying optical fibre cable(OFC) and drawing overhead lines for their ambitious project.

The Kochi Muziris Biennale also took off on December 12.

Student politics play spoil sport

The murder of 20-year-old Abhimanyu, a BSc Chemistry student of Maharaja's College, cast a pall of gloom on nearly all college campuses It brought to light the intrusion of fanatics into educational institutions. Debates raged over the validity of campus politics. This was also the year which saw two women vice chancellors stepping down from their offices after a successful and fruitful stint. J Letha of Cusat and Rose Varghese of NUALS, proved to tough nuts when it came to making their institutions premier ones.

The rains, bandhs and hartals wreaked havoc on the academic calendar in 2018. The playschool van accident at Maradu led to the death of three including two children. Guidelines to be followed by the schools with regard to school buses and vans were drawn. However, it was not all that bad for the education sector. The year saw a spike in the number of admissions in government schools. Around 1.85 lakh students had sought admissions in government schools all over the state and the numbers were significant enough in the district too.

Kochi metro gets a push

The Kochi Metro, which is now an integral part of City's transport sector, focused on brand building activities mainly in 2018 along with launching some key steps in connection with Water Metro, the formation of Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) and second phase expansion of the Metro to Kakkanad. It also actively associated the flood relief activities. The KMRL conducted free services thereby helping the rescue workers to reach Aluva and supply relief materials. The agency also The reconstruction of Champakkara bridge was also launched along with the preparatory work at Petta- SN Jn stretch

Sorrow of motorists

City roads turned death traps this year. Ebin Paul's death along the pot-hole ridden Palarivattom-Kakkanad route shocked the collective conscience of the city. Officials, who were till then in a state of apathy, woke up from their slumber. The inaction of the authorities catapulted protests. It was the private bus owners, backed by organisations like the Kerala Private Bus Operators Association, who first threatened to suspend services in the route.

Fall of the football hype

A host of events kept Kochi busy in the year that passed by even though Kerala Blasters, the city's most high-profile team, endured a torrid time. Blasters suffered their worst run in ISL history, with popular coach David James facing the axe last week. It followed the fans' boycott of the last three matches. But the football fans were treated to some quality action earlier in the year when Spanish premier league club Girona and Australian Melbourne City played friendlies with Kerala Blasters.

Year of factional feuds

The Congress party has become synonymous with factional feuds. Local bodies such as Thrikkakara, Kochi Corporation, Kalamassery Municipality and Maradu Municipality witnessed a year of ugly politics too. In Kalamassery municipality, Jessy Peter had to step down after KPCC helped the Congress I faction oust her from the post and appoint Rukiya Jamal, wife of former chairperson Jamal Manakadan, as the new chair. At Thrikkakara municipality, the LDF once again came to the front with the Congress rebel Sheela Charu shifting to the LDF and becoming elected as chairperson. However, the factional feud in the Congress party at Corporation reached nowhere, though a section of Congress workers pushed for Shiny Mathew as the Mayor candidate.

Floods

Aluva, Kalamassery, Paravoor, Angamaly were the constituencies which bore the major brunt of the floods in Ernakulam. Lakhs of people were shifted to relief camps. The Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) at Nedumbassery, was shut down due to flooding for several days. Approximately 2 lakh people were displaced in Paravoor alone, as 60,000 homes were inundated in the aftermath of the floods, said Paravoor MLA V D Satheeshan. The livelihood of agricultural and dairy farmers weavers, fishermen went for a toss. The Chekutty doll from Chendamangalam rose as the symbol of resilience.

Upbeat health sector

At least 300 cases of leptospirosis resulting in two deaths broke out in the district post-floods. H1N1 cases also reared its ugly head. The silver lining, however, was the introduction of the Ernakulam District Comprehensive Cancer Control Programme aimed at the early detection of cancer. On the infrastructure front, new blocks are under construction at the General Hospital, Ernakulam Medical College and Cochin Cancer Research Centre. The year also marked the fifth anniversary of the government takeover of Ernakulam Medical College. ""Despite the floods, the quality and availability of health care remained stable. This year, we also received a major boost in the implementation of Ardram project,"" said Dr N K Kuttappan, DMO, Ernakulam."

In the wake of two-wheeler sales plunging across the state, the West Bengal government has now decided to review rules relating to the obtaining of license and sale of two-wheelers. Any further amendments to the policy are likely to be notified post discussion which is scheduled in January.

Notably, the government had issued a ""stringent"" notification in June this year which resulted in the sales of scooter and motor-cycle falling sharply. The subsequent relaxations made given by the State government failed to lift the customer's sentiment as the two-wheeler sales failed to pick up the pace.

BP Gopalika, Principal Secretary in-charge of the West Bengal Transport Department, told The Hindu Business Line that ""we will review the two-wheeler sale policy in January. The date of the meeting is yet to be decided.""

Interestingly, the policy change introduced in June barred sale and registration of two-wheelers in the name of people without driving licences. As per the rules, two-wheeler buyers had to get their identity verified as well.

The state government officials argued that the objective of the move was to bring down the accidents. But, the doubts over how a person would obtain a licence without owning a bike remained.

Notably, West Bengal does not have any two-wheelers only driving schools. The policy change came as a shock for the two-wheeler industry as the sales slumped by more than 60 per cent, especially during the festive season. Prior to the policy, West Bengal has registered a sale of one lakh two-wheelers on monthly basis.

The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) challenged the advisory in a petition to the Calcutta High Court after which Justice Harish Tandon partially stayed the government notification that prohibited sale (of two-wheelers) without a driving licence. Post that the state government relaxed the norms twice which resulted in ""some improvement"" in sales.

One of the two-wheeler dealers said that ""People have delayed purchases and are waiting for more clarity on the rules. Compared to the August-September period when sales dropped drastically, numbers are now picking up."""

Dear Rani Mukherji,

First, thanks for trying to ruin all the conversations on women empowerment in 2018 India. Despite the several conversations around #MeToo, despite your old and young colleagues accusing your male colleagues of sexual harassment, despite the fact that it took them so long to speak up, you just proved that patriarchy is ingrained in men and women alike. You just explained why the Oxford Dictionary chose 'toxic' as the word of the year.

Like every year, Rajeev Masand called for a round-table conference of Bollywood's biggest female stars: Deepika Padukone, Anushka Sharma, Alia Bhatt, Tabu, Rani Mukerji and Tapsee Pannu. Big names, and much celebrated. But we are doubting the 'celebrated' part now.

When the topic of sexual harassment within Bollywood came up, Rani had a perspective so twisted and illogical that we can bet she must have had chowmein before the show. The Hichhki star was pretty adamant that it is women who need to change. ""If they don't want it to happen it will not happen,"" she screamed. Then, instead of pointing the finger at men, she said women should ""take responsibility for themselves"". She became the champion of martial arts and said all schools must make it compulsory for girls to take defense classes. In her own words, the women who are getting harassed ""those are the women we need to talk to and say yaar you need to change"".

The expressions of actors at that roundtable pretty much summarised all our emotions.

But Rani didn't stop. Even when Deepika and Alia tried to intervene and explain to her that women are often not in a position to do martial arts, she kept throwing her hands around (Apparently they were martial art moves) and made karate chop sounds.

If you are a woman, you must already be exhausted explaining colleagues, relatives, strangers on the road, Tinder dates, a man who came to your party uninvited and several other folks why it is not okay to victim blame women. I, for one, thought that at least the #MeToo conversation would instill some sense in people. Alas, I was hoping for too much. So it's exhausting to explain why Rani's logic is plain stupid. So, I decided to make a list for Rani and all the people who believe women are to be blamed for sexual harassment.

Here are some of the horrific news stories from 2018 where women were sexually assaulted.

1. In January, an eight-year-old girl from a minority nomadic community was allegedly kidnapped, drugged, tortured, gang-raped and eventually killed in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district. According to the charge sheet, eight people including a minor raped this eight-year-old.

2. A three-year-old is in critical condition after she was allegedly raped by her neighbour in the capital city of Delhi. The accused, a 40-year-old security guard who worked in the building the child lived in, has been arrested. the sixth anniversary of the brutal gang-rape of a student on a Delhi bus.

3. A case was registered against a 40-year-old man for allegedly raping his 13-year-old daughter in Rajasthan's Jhalawar district.

4. An 11-year-old girl from Chidimbu village under Dainadubi outpost in North Garo Hills was allegedly raped on multiple occasions by her stepfather. The rape was discovered by the mother of the victim who, upon questioning the girl, learned of the truth and informed authorities on the matter, leading to the arrest of the step-father.

5. In June this year, a senior nun alleged rape by Bishop Franco Mulakkal, the head of the Latin diocese of Jalandhar. What followed was a vortex of the worst crisis that the church had encountered in recent times. The nun alleged that she was sexually assaulted multiple times since May 2014 at the church's guest house in Kuruvilangad. She further said that she had approached the church hierarchy but her repeated pleas were ignored, after which she decided to go the police. The Mulakkal case goes to trial next year. And so does the faith.

6. A man was awarded death sentence by a special court earlier this month for raping and killing his six-year-old daughter. The 42-year-old accused suspected his wife's character and believed the victim was not his biological child. He raped the girl and later hanged her with the help of a stole.

7. A five-year-old girl was raped by five persons in Assam's Karbi Anglong district. After committing the crime, they threatened the girl of dire consequences if she informed anyone. They were arrested later.

8. Five men were arrested in Kerala's northern district of Kannur for raping and sexually abusing a 16-year-old girl. The father of the minor was also among those under custody after police registered a case of gang-rape on a complaint filed by the girl's mother.

9. Four Army jawans were booked in October for allegedly raping a speech and hearing impaired 30-year-old woman over a span of four years at the military hospital in Khadki near Pune.

10. At least thirty rape survivors of a government-sponsored children's home in Bihar's Muzaffarpur are suffering from severe trauma and tried to inflict injuries and kill themselves. In all, 42 inmates were residing in Muzaffarpur based 'Balika Grih' run by NGO Seva Sankalp Evam Vikas Samiti, owned by a small-time journalist and local strongman Brajesh Thakur, who along with nine others were arrested after a Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) social audit report blew the lid off the organized sexual exploitation of inmates. The medical investigation has confirmed at least 24 girls, all minors and one as young as seven, were raped and physically tortured. Apart from revealing the grave sexual exploitation, the medical examination of the girls also showed they had burn and cut marks all over their bodies. The reports said they were regularly tortured.

11. A 100-year-old woman was brutally raped allegedly by a 20-year-old youth in the middle of the night in West Bengal's Nadia district. The culprit from the Gangaprasadpur area has been arrested and has reportedly confessed, saying he committed the crime under the influence of alcohol.

12. Two minor sisters, aged one and four years, respectively, were allegedly abducted and raped in Indore city of Madhya Pradesh. The two girls were abducted Friday night when they were asleep with their parents inside a make-shift hut at a construction site in MG Road area. The girls' father works as a watchman at the construction site. The girls were found near the hut in a brutalised condition the next morning.

The list is endless. But here's a question for Rani Mukherji-- Were any of them in a situation to show off their karate moves?"

It is not disputed that security of the country is of prime concern. But the government's new order does not lay down the conditions under which such surveillance of private information can be accessed and safeguards to avoid the order's misuse. Though the old order was introduced in 2009, the feeling of being threatened did not exist. As a parallel example, when Aadhaar was introduced, it had a narrower scope. But this government extended it to so many services that that the Supreme Court had to take up the matter and guarantee fundamental rights under the Constitution. - SN Iyer

Naseeruddin Shah's comment over growing intolerance is genuine (""The Daily Fix: The vicious reaction to Naseeruddin Shah underscores shrinking space for minorities""). There's consensus among the well-wishers of this country that this growing intolerance will harm national integrity and trust in the rule of law in this great nation. However the treatment Shah has received from the ruling BJP suggests that the party and its affiliates are only interested in the electoral politics and not in the diversity and integrity of the nation. - Rehan Ansar

There is no mention of the Ayyappa Jyothi Event that is being planned by those who oppose the Women's Wall Movement. There is an interview with the leader of the organisation who tried to enter the Sabarimala Shrine, but no comments from anyone who opposes the organisation's efforts. They have all put under a blanket label of ""mob"".

While this article raises some valid points, there is one aspect that it totally ignores - the near-complete absence of Muslim faculty members at the IIMs (""IIMs have used autonomy for self-aggrandisement, says professor pushing for faculty diversity""). After reading this article, I went through the listed faculty directories of all IIMs (except Rohtak and Hamirpur, as the websites weren't working) and saw that only five core faculty memebers were Muslim. This dearth of Muslims can also be seen even the visiting faculty and teachers for elective courses are offered by the institutes. If we are talking about diversity, then why is there no discussion on religion? - Ahmed Ashhar

***

The interview with the IIM Bangalore professor is an eye opener. His views on being responsible corporate citizens are much needed. We do not want to go the American way, where chasing money at any cost, even family, is legitimate.

The IIMs look at themselves as the Indian equivalent of Western business schools. The difference, not acknowledged by them, is that the Indian taxpayer funds the IIMs. Hence, IIMs have a holistic responsibility towards Indian citizens and not just to enriching themselves.

Indian citizens, therefore, have concerns that need to be addressed within the business models taught at IIMs.

His concern about environmental pollution and social diversity are a reality of the Indian citizens and should be adopted wholeheartedly with a responsibility. This, along with other concerns, like environmental destruction due to industrial activity and others, will make Indian IIMs global leaders in progressive and responsible business models. By not addressing these realities, IIMs are wasting an opportunity to lead the world in a new kind of business model. - Rajratna Jadhav

I could not agree more with Deepak Malghan. The IIMs have failed the nation by deliberately trying to create islands of engineer-dominated institutions without making any contribution to faculty development in small private institutions or state universities. There are consulting assignments because company boards want brand name credibility to endorse decisions. - Sudhakar GP

I read Nayanjot Lahiri's article with a lot of interest for two reasons (""The forgotten story of how Chipko Andolan pioneer Chandi Prasad Bhatt saved Badrinath temple"").

I am worried by news of India's $1.4 billion aid package for the Maldives (""India declares $1.4 billion aid to Maldives""). I cannot understand the rationale behind giving so much money to another nation when our own country is struggling with financial insecurity.

When so many vital things are pending in our country for want of funds, how can people at the helm of governance act like this, that too to a country that has acted in a bitter way towards our nation, by sending back Indian workers and refusing to issue visas to them?

Who is accountable for this act of giving away such a huge sum when farmers are dying of indebtedness and victims of natural calamities are only given peanuts? - R Kanagasabai"

2018 was a year of many firsts and records in Indian sport. While MC Mary Kom went on to win her sixth world title on home soil, teenagers like Sourabh Choudhary, Manu Bhaker, Anish Bhanwala and others took the shooting world by storm, winning medals at the Commonwealth and Asian Games and also at the ISSF World Cups.

On the cricket field, the Virat Kohli-led Indian side is on the brink of registering their first series win in Australia and the rise of Hima Das on the athletic track has made the world stand up and take notice of the talent that stormed to a World Under-20 Championship gold in what was her first full year on the international circuit.

Not to forget the exploits of Neeraj Chopra in Javelin Throw, success of Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat on the wrestling mat and the consistent performances of PV Sindhu which culminated in her winning the BWF World Tour Finals to sign off the year in style.

And the success of the Indian Table Tennis contingent at the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games. While India has been winning medals at the Commonwealth Games, the two bronze medals in Jakarta was one of the biggest success stories in Indian sports given the level of competition.

But none of the successes in sports come overnight and the seeds of the results -- positive or negative -- are always sown in the decisions or incidents that take place in the past.

For example, the rise of Das can be trailed back to two coaches in Assam identifying the raw talent of a girl in the local meets and India's sprint coach Galina Bukharina making her shift from the 100 and 200 metre events to the 400 after she joined the national camp.

Similarly, the seeds of success for the Indian teenage shooters were sown about three years back when the National Rifle Association of India launched its junior program under Indian coaches Jaspal Rana and Deepali Deshpande and their efforts finally bore fruit in 2018.

Here is a look at a few decisions or incidents which could shape the direction Indian sports could take in the coming years.

Opinions are clearly divided on the need for the Khelo India School Games (KISG) given that the School Games Federation of India (SGFI) and the National Sports Federations have been conducting age group events for years now to identify and nurture talent. The idea behind KISG stems from the Gujarat Government's Khel Mahakumbh experiment which over the years has managed to broaden the base of children taking up sport and nurturing sporting culture in the state.

The KISG, however, did not follow that model in the strictest sense and made it an event for elite athletes, raising questions about whether spending crores of rupees on yet another inter-school tournament was worth it.

The implementation and approach towards the program can be debated at length but there is no doubt that this is high time, the focus of Indian sports ministry and all stake holders shifted towards grassroot sports and nurturing talent from schools and junior colleges.

This year over 1500 students were selected under the talent identification scheme for support with almost two dozen academies identified for training of these selected athletes. The government also plans to support a few universities to create sports infrastructure in the coming years and hopefully build a robust school and college sports program that can consistently produce talent.

Ask any yesteryear's sports star about their journey to the top and they would credit the Inter-University tournaments as their stomping ground. But over the years, the All India Universities -- the parent body to conduct Inter University tournaments -- has been in doldrums and the haphazard ways in which the SGFI and AIU have been conducting their meets, the structure definitely needs a overhaul.

One can only hope that KISG evolves over the years and actually contributes to talent development and nurturing sports culture at the school or college level, failing which a lot of money would just go down the drain.

One of the major criticism about the National Sports Federations have been their reluctance to turn professional and over-dependence on the sports ministry for funding. There is a long way to go for this to change and sports federations to be self sufficient, but the NRAI and Wrestling Federation of India have shown the way with their strategic partnerships.

The Wrestling Federation has signed a long term deal with the Tata group while the JSW Group has pledged support to the shooting federation till the 2024 Paris Olympics.

The direct financial support in these deals may not be exponential but the Wrestling Federation has already introduced a Central Contract system on the lines of the Indian Cricket Board while the shooting federation plans to utilise the money to pay the Indian coaches better remuneration, a move that they believe can help end India's dependency on foreign experts in the next few years.

The Wrestling Federation which has been struggling to convince the Sports Ministry about the need for hiring foreign coaches for over a year now, has decided to hire a few experts on their own thanks to the support from their corporate partners and the players believe that such a move could actually give them and the federation more freedom to choose coaches and support staff of their choice.

In all the muddle created by infighting between two Committee of Administrators appointed to implement the Lodha Committee reforms, the fact that BCCI's new constitution has been made and cleared by the Supreme Court has been lost. According to the time line submitted by the CoA to the court, elections under the new constitution have to be held by March 2019 and though many state associations are resisting the change, they will sooner or later have to fall in line and implement the reforms if not in toto.

A similar exercise was undertaken in the Archery Association of India where Administrator S Y Quraishi conducted elections under the new constitution which he has drafted. The new constitution debars public servants from being part of the federation and gives a lot more representation to players.

The Indian Olympic Association and even the federation has decided to oppose the new constitution but if the Court puts its weight behind Quraishi's draft, then it could change the face of Indian sports administration.

There are many in other federations who are waiting with baited breath to move the courts seeking change and over throw the incumbents, who have run the federations as their fiefdom for decades.

The popular theme in all these proposed reforms is a bigger role for former players in administration. The argument that players are best placed to run sports federations efficiently is flawed given the fact that administration is a completely different ball game and not all players are competent enough to handle the job.

Most of them who are currently in administration have little or no formal education in administration and are basically functioning at the whims and fancies of their political masters or are merely surviving on their stature as elite sportspersons.

Internationally, many sports federations are run by former athletes but almost all of them have gone back to academics at the end of their playing careers to complete management degrees and rise through the ranks. May be, the amended constitutions will inspire more sports persons in India to take that route.

Age fraud has been an open secret in Indian sports but most federation would prefer to bury their head in the sand and pretend that the problem doesn't exist rather than take the bull by the horns and curb the menace.

Thanks to the sports ministry forcing their hand a few years ago, most of these federations have taken a few cosmetics steps like conducting random age verification tests but the results of which are hardly made public and the federations avoid taking any action against those found over age, hiding behind the argument that the results of the medical tests are not 100% correct.

But the social media outrage over Gourav Mukhi becoming the ""youngest goalscorer"" in the Indian Super League at 16 and the cognisance taken by the international media and hopefully by the international federations should be enough to wake the federations up from their slumber.

Over the last few years, as India has started performing on the international stage in age group tournaments, the chatter around the over age menace has been on the rise even internationally and the Mukhi controversy should be an indicator that in the age of social media and legally aware parents, they can't just ignore the problem.

If the Mukhi case actually leads to a proper system of investigating age fraud and curbing the menace, Indian sports would be indebted to the Jamshedpur FC striker, who is difficult to miss with his trademark moustache that belies his registered age with the AIFF.

The Indian anti-doping program came under scrutiny when the World Anti-Doping Agency decided to pick a considerable chunk of samples that were reported ""negative"" by the National Dope Testing Laboratory and over half a dozen of them came positive in retesting, including those of quartermile Nirmala Sheoran, middle distance runner Sanjivani Jadhav and others.

While the world body has the right to ask for any sample for retesting, what has surprised many is the number of samples WADA took for re-testing to their Montreal lab, clearly indicating lack of faith in the methods employed by the Indian lab.

There is a growing feeling that the National Anti Doping Agency has been far more lenient on top athletes in the past few years as they want to prove that doping incidents have reduced in India and a RTI by the Indian Express shows how the agency hardly tested the big names in the run up to the Asian Games.

But with WADA watching, NDTL runs the risk of losing its accreditation if it doesn't get its house in order. Hopefully that would be a good enough incentive for NADA to get the anti-doping program back on track and for the federations and Sports Authority of India to educate the medical staff attached with the teams on how to tackle the menace."

This was a year for consolidating the gains that have accrued from major policy decisions taken in the previous four years, a time for monitoring of ongoing projects, tackling road blocks and adding to the already impressive pace of work achieved last year. The Ministry took a decision to complete all ongoing projects that had been awarded upto 2015-16, and placed the highest ever target of constructing at least 12,000 kms of national highways as against 9829 kms achieved during 2017-18, and make special efforts to take this length to 16000 km. Overall, more than about 61,300 km length of road projects, costing more than Rs. 6.48 lakh crore, are in progress at present. The balance ongoing works (which have been awarded, appointed dates declared and works going on at sites) are more than 30,200 kms during the year. In the first nine months of FY 2018-19, 5,759 km has been completed in 18-19 against 4,942 km up to same period in last year.

The portal BIMS and BhoomiRashi portals have further been linked with Public Financial Management System(PFMS) to facilitate real time payment to beneficiaries.

1.3 On the finance front too, National Highways Authority of India did a successful financial closure of its first project under Toll- Operate -Transfer this year andoffered 586 km of national highways under the second bundle. The first TOT bundle of 9 projects, totaling approximately 681 KM of roads in two states of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, was awarded earlier during the year for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the Authority's estimate. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) also got an unsecured loan of Rs 25,000 crore from State Bank of India for 10 years with 3 years of moratorium on repayments. This is the largest amount of loan to have been sanctioned to NHAI in one stroke by any institution. This is also the largest long term unsecured loan sanctioned by SBI at a time to any entity.

A two days long exercise was conducted to review of over 700 ongoing National Highway projects in the country, and over 300 projects were identified to be completed by 2019 achieving the highest ever construction in financial year 2018-19.

The table below details the trends of NH construction over the years.

This is the umbrella program for the highways sector unrolled in 2017-18, that aims to optimize the efficiency of road traffic movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. 34,800 km of National Highways are to be constructed under the Phase-I of the programme between 2017-18 to 2021-22 in a phased manner at a cost of Rs. 5,35,000 crore.

A network of 35 Multimodal Logistics Parks had been identified for development in the Phase - 1 of BharatmalaPariyojana. The availability of the land parcels for development of Multimodal Logistics Parks has been confirmed at 7 locations and DPRs have been initiated in all the nodes.

This is a project for constructing a 14.150 km long, 2-lane bi-directional Zojila Tunnel in Jammu & Kashmir. This would be India's longest road tunnel and the longest bi-directional tunnel in Asia. The construction of this tunnel will provide all weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil and Leh and will bring about all round economic and socio-cultural integration of these regions.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the construction, operation and maintenance of the 2- Lane, 4.532 Km long Bi-directional Silkyara Bend - Barkot Tunnel on Dharasu-Yamunotri section along NH -134 in the State of Uttarakhand. The project forms part of the Chardham Plan. The construction period of the project is 4 years at an estimated cost of Rs. 1383.78 crore. Once complete, this stretch will reduce the travel distance from Dharasu to Yamunotri by about 20 Km and travel time byaboutanhour.It will also provide all weather connectivity to Yamunotri, encouraging regional socio-economic development, trade and tourism within the country. The project will be implemented by National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. (NHIDCL).

Around Rs. 1,90,000 crore worth of projects have been sanctioned for the construction of road projects for over 12,000 km in the North East region. The projects being executed by NHIDCL are to the tune of Rs. 1, 66,026 crore, covering 10,892 km of roads in all the eight NE states. Projects costing Rs. 17,257 crore have been allotted to the respective state PWDs. Further, projects costing Rs. 7,000 crore are entrusted to the NHAI.

The Ministry has focused on completion of on-going projects along with sanction and award of new projects. A total of 73 projects (8,187 km) worth an estimated investment of Rs.1,00,000 crore wereidentified as Languishing Projects. The reasons for delay were identified and policy interventions undertaken to address the same.

The Ministry is monetizing its road assets constructed with public funds through Toll-Operate-Transfer (ToT) scheme. The scheme envisages bidding of bundled national highways for a concession period of 30 years. The first bundle comprised 9 projects, totalling 681 km of roads in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. It was awarded in 2018 to Macquarie for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the NHAI's estimate.The second bundle comprises over 586 kms spread over four states - Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal and Bihar. The offer has 12 toll plazas across four highways.

TheNational Highways Authority of India (NHAI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding(MoU)withtheStateBankofIndiatoreceiveRs.25,000croreasa long-term,unsecuredloanfor10years.Thisisthelargestamountofloantohavebeen sanctioned by the SBl in one go. This is also the largest ever fund that NHAI has ever received in one go.

The Ministry has issued detailed guidelines for determination of proper alignment of NH projects, advising executing agencies to examine the feasibility of a green- field alignment, especially in the case of economic corridors, instead of widening existing highways. This has been done because widening involves acquisition of land for Right of Way (RoW), shifting of utilities and demolition of built up structure, all of which involves a lot of time and cost. Also, earlier highways were largely planned to be serpentine, linking all possible towns in the vicinity. This road geometry has been found to be sub optimal, especially in case of economic corridors. BharatmalaPariyojanaalso calls for a corridor approach for economic corridors. It has also been found in a few test cases that it is feasible to acquire a RoW of 60 to 70 mtrs for a green field road project at the same cost as involved in the expansion of an existing road, especially when the associated costs and time taken in utility shifting, tree felling, additional compensation for demolition of structures coming in the RoW under expansion are taken into account.

AWebUtilityhasbeendevelopedwherebythelandacquisitionprocedureforthe NH projects, including processing of all LA related gazette notifications, are being done through a common platform called ""BhoomiRashi"". The Utility has been linked with the e-gazette platform of the MinistryofUrbanDevelopment,GovernmentofIndia,forpublicationofGazette Notifications.TheuseofBhumi Rashi has helped in cutting down the processing time from 2 to 3 months earlier to one to two weeksnow.

BhoomiRashi has also been integrated with the Public Financial Management System(PFMS)platformoftheMinistryofFinancefordepositofcompensationin theaccountsoflandowners/interestedpersonsonarealtimebasis, instead of being parked with CALA.

The Ministry has developed a Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC mode for all NH works and centrally sponsored works.BIMS acts as a data base for allbasic details of bidders like civil works experience, cash accruals and network, annual turnover etc,. This allows quick pre-qualification assessment of bidders based on evaluation parameters like threshold capacity and bid capacity from already stored data. Technical evaluationcantherefore be carried out faster using this information.

A variety of programmes related to the Road Safety were also organized in several cities across the country to enlighten people on Road Safety, and Driving Rules. Many NGOs participated in the Ministry's efforts to create awareness about the issue.

The Ministry had constituted a group of State Transport Ministers under the Chairmanship of Shri Yunus Khan, Transport Minister of Rajasthan to work out interstate issues and reach a consensus on adoption of uniform rates of taxation, permits and other issues. A Group of Transport Ministers from 13 states met in Guwahati on 18-19 April this year and adopted a 9-Point Guwahati Declaration aimed at harmonization of taxes and permits, road safety measures, policy changes and measures for strengthening State Road Transport Undertakings. The most important decisions taken by during the meeting included the recommendation for One Nation One Tax for the diverse road tax structure, which would ease travel.

In order to help accident victims in getting reasonable and fast compensation from insurance companies, the Ministry revised the relevant rules of the Motor Vehicles Act according to which every accident victim or his next of kin will be entitled to a compensation of Rs 5 lakh in case of death, and uptoRs 5 lakh, proportionate to the extent of injury in case of grievous hurt and disablement. Accident victims can claim higher compensation through court if they are not satisfied, but with this rule even the poorest of the poor will get a fast and reasonable compensation.

A Central Command and Control Centre is being set up at the NHAI HQ for CCTV surveillance and Monitoring of Vehicular Congestion at 210 Fee Plazas of National Highways that have higher traffic volumes. it is proposed to be connected with Regional Offices and the project execution is on service model for a period of five years.

Three short films for generating public awareness for the need to comply with the rules of the road, eventually contributing to the cause of road safety, were launched by Hon'ble Minister for Road Transport & Highways, on 14th' August, 2018. Film actor Shri Akshay Kumar who featured in these films on pro bono basis, has also been appointed as Road Safety Brand Ambassador by the Hon'ble Minister.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has designated the Asian Institute of Transport Development as an apex body for capacity building in the area of road safety. The objective is that this centre would act as a depository of research studies and best practices.Human resource development and exchange of knowledge form an important component of its activities. Up to October 2018, the National Centre for Road Safety has been able to train over 1,400 professionals in road safety and road safety audit by conducting 31 courses pan India.

The Ministry took several initiatives in the transport sector during the year to make road travel more convenient for people. Some of these areas under-

To improve ease in licensing, this Ministry has simplified the driving license application form. Four forms i.e. (a) Learner License, (b) Driving License, (c) Renewal of License, and (d) updation of Address - all have been consolidated into one. The new form will enable Aadhar based verification of the applicant's identity to provide online services for renewal, change of address etc. Another highlight of the new form is that it would capture an applicant's willingness for organ donation.

The permissible safe axle weight of goods vehicles was revised and increased by about 15% to 20 % for different configurations of axles. The decision was taken with a view to help in increasing the carrying capacity of goods transport vehicles and bring down logistics cost. The amendment will increase the carrying capacity of goods vehicles by about 20-25 % and lower logistics costs by about 2%. It will also bring down the incidence of overloading. While automobile technology and road construction quality have improved greatly over the years, the axle loads have remained the same since 1983 when they were last notified. There was a felt need to harmonize the axle load with international standards.

NHAI has developed a matrix-based methodology to rank the Fee Plazas on parameters such as electronic tolling, time taken in clearance of FASTag lanes, display panels, staff behaviour, cleanliness, etc. The data for the matrix is to be collected by the Regional Officers who will use the same to rank the Fee Plazas under their jurisdiction. Meanwhile, a countrywide drive was launched by NHAl on more than 300 toll plazas across the country on 10 February, 2018, to address issues that affect highway users. Officers visited toll plazas and addressed issues of user convenience and took feedback from the people.

6.3 Linkage of PFMS with Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) and BhoomiRashi

The two IT initiatives of this Ministry, which are aimed at expediting pre- construction processes relating to bidding and land acquisition respectively, have now been integrated with the Public Financial management System (PFMS). The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) is aimed at streamlining the process of pre-qualification of bidders for EPC Mode of contracts for National Highway workswithenhanced transparency and objectivity. The BhoomiRashiportal of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways allows for totally digital and paper-less processing of land acquisition cases, and has resulted in transparent, quick, corruption-free and error-free handling of land acquisition cases. It has alsomade the possible real-time tracking of activities and generation of reports relating to land acquisition. Revenue records of about 7 lakh villages across the country have been integrated in the portal. This digital change has drastically reduced the time taken for issuance of land acquisition notifications from 3-6 months to 1-2 weeks. Over 2000 notifications have already been issued by the Ministry in the first eight months of this financial year that while during the past two years, about a thousand land acquisition notifications could be issued every year. The process has also brought transparency in the system. Earlier the approved compensation amount used to be parked with the CALA (Competent Authority for Land Acquisition) but with BhoomiRashi portal this amount directly transferred into the account of the person concerned, through Public Financial Management System which is an integral part of the portal. In addition to this, the process is also environment friendly since there is no physical movement of files - all work is done digitally.

An advisory has been issued by this Ministry wherein the citizen can produce the transport related documents such as registration, insurance, fitness and permit, the driving licence, certificate for pollution under check and any other relevant documents, if required, in physical or electronic form, on demand by any police officer in uniform or any other officer authorized by the State Government in this behalf. This would enable the use of digital platforms for carrying and verification of the documents and is a step towards citizen facilitation and to ensure so that citizen are not harassed/ inconvenienced.

The 5th India-Japan Joint Working Group Meeting in the Roads and Road Transport Sector was held on 12th November, 2018 in New Delhi as provided under the Framework of Cooperation (FoC) between the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), India and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), Japan. In the meeting, information regarding the latest technological developments in ""Operation and Maintenance of Expressway"", ""Development of Mountainous Road in North East Regions"" and ""Countermeasure of Aging Structure"" etc. was shared.

The proposal for a MoU on Bilateral Cooperation in the Road Transport & Road Industry sector, between Ministry of road transport & Highways and the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, has been approved by the Union Cabinet in its meeting on October 3, 2018.

While the procurement process is under way for the development of Wayside Amenities of larger sizes in PPP mode along the National Highways, the NHAI has taken up construction of 314 numbers Highway Nest (mini). These are being developed near Toll Plazas, approximately 200 meters downstream on a 10mX20m paved platform and comprises of facilities like toilets, water, ATR, a small kiosk with Tea / Coffee vending machine and packaged food items for Highway users.

The SwachhtaPakhwada was organised by the Ministry between September 15, 2018 and October 2, across all National Highways. Several activities related to shramdaan and cleaning of schools in villages adjacent to the National Highways were also organized by the NHAI during the period. Construction of toilets, both for men and women, installation of litter-bins and hoardings at NHAI toll plazas have been taken up by the Ministry under Swachh Bharat Mission. The Ministry was conferred with a special award for its implementation of the Swachhta Action Plan for 2017-18 by the nodal Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation."

However, little did he realise that his action will backfire spectacularly as he began to face journalists' ire for confirming the opposition charge on the controversial Rafale deal.

Piyush Goyal had posted a video, seemingly recorded to boost the image of Modi's image as a true patriot in the election year. While posting the video, Goyal wrote, ""Identify those who point fingers at the country's prime minister in the garb of democracy.""

In the video, tweeted by Goyal, Srivastava is seen criticising Modi's detractors and making fun of those, who abuse the prime minister by taking advantage of their 'freedom of expression.' The once popular stand-up comedian also takes a veiled dig at Congress President Rahul Gandhi for calling the prime minister a thief. He then goes on to say, ""Friends, a prime minister's post has its own respect. A prime minister does not belong to one party....We are fortunate that Narendra Modi ji was born in India.""

This line is followed by a huge round of applause, clearly suggesting that the video has been recorded at the behest of the BJP to boost Modi's image, which has taken a serious beating following his inability to prevent his party's defeat in three states that went to polls recently.

Srivastava continues, repeating Modi's famous line that he was a humble man, a faqueer (beggar). He says, ""He's a beggar-like man. In reality, Modi is a God-send person.""

Srivastava then adds that Modi signed the controversial Rafale deal to help Anil Ambani. He says, ""Modi ji knew exactly what the Indian armed forces needed. This resulted in the signing of the Rafale deal so that the Air Force could be strengthened."" Srivastava continues with his inimitable style while mimicking Modi and adds, ""Modi ji then told HAL that 'you finish the work that you've already been given. I will give the Rafale deal to a private company. This is also a truth. Are you happy with all government organisations?""

To justify his claims, Srivastava mentions the public broadcaster, highlighting just how pathetic it was and Indians were forced to watch Doordarshan only because they did not have better alternatives. ""Do you travel in government buses? Only when you are compelled to do so. Who wants to go to a government hospital? Do you want to send your kids to government schools?""

The last night line of Srivastava's promotional video says it all as he signs off, ""Statutory warning, people from Bangladesh and Pakistan living in India illegally can abuse me after watching this video, thank you.""

Journalists were left aghast at the intellect of Piyush Goyal for not detecting that despite some creditworthy statements, passed off as comedy, the supposed comedy video of Srivastava is essentially a source of huge embarrassment for Modi. By promoting his video, not only has Goyal confirmed that Modi had personally favoured Anil Ambani in securing the Rafale deal, but he has also conceded that government institution under Modi were symbol of poor governance.

Journalist Rohini Singh tweeted, ""Wow. So @PiyushGoyal endorses opposition claim that Rafale deal was given to Reliance ADAG because of @narendramodi?"" Journalist Abhisar Sharma wrote sarcastically, ""As @SrBachchan said in Amar Akbar Anthony..."" iska to bad luck kee kharab hai "" . @PiyushGoyal?"" Journalist Poonam Pandey tweeted, ""This (giving contract to Anil Ambani) must be true if the cabinet minister is tweeting this video.""

Columnist Meghnad tweeted, ""It's hard to imagine all the electoral bond money being spent to produce cringe-worthy crap like this. And yet, seems like that is exactly what is happening."" Pawan Khera of the Congress wrote, ""This minister (Goyal) has honestly told everyone what the former French President had told us but the prime minister did not tell the Supreme Court that Modi was responsible for giving the Rafale deal to Anil Ambani.""

The Supreme Court had refused to order a probe in to the Rafale deal earlier this year. However, the top court's judgement had come under sharp scrutiny after it emerged that it was based on false affidavit by the Modi government."

The Pakistan Prime Minister grabbed the headlines with: ""We will show the Modi government how to treat minorities.""

Persecuted in Pakistan for decades, for Ahmadiyyas, Khan's ""grand claim"" was nothing but hypocrisy. Community welfare committee vice president Pervez Ahmed and the missionary-in-charge Arif Khan in Mumbai called it ""a strange paradox"".

Ahmed said Pakistan under Gen Zia-ul-Haq robbed Ahmadiyyas of their religious identity by declaring the community as non-Muslim apostates through the second amendment to the constitution in April 1984. ""Ahmadiyyas have been killed in Pakistan from the 1953 riots. Whether the 1974 anti-Ahmadiyya riots (over 1,000 killed) or the May 2010 attacks on mosques, which killed 84, repeated attempts have been made to wipe out the community,"" he said. ""Daily subjugation and persecution and organised attacks aren't possible without the state's active collusion.""

Arif explained why Sunnis target his community. ""We follow teachings of our sect founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad who follows after the Holy Prophet."" He says, ""The Pak PM must ensure equality if he truly believes Islam.""

The duo cited the handling of Atif Rehman Mian's appointment to the PM's Economic Advisory Council to call the bluff on Khan's doublespeak.

Khan invited Mian, a Pak-American economist (professor of economics at Princeton, director of the Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy & Finance at Woodrow Wilson School, and the first Pakistani among IMF's top 25 economists) to join the EAC, only to quickly rescind the invite following threats of a massive protest.

If fellow-Muslims face such treatment, what about other minorities, they asked. The Jews who helped build Karachi are a case in point. Anti-Semitism in the wake of increasing tensions between the Arab world and Israel has ensured only 748 families are left behind. Even when the Pakistan Cricket Board roped in a German, Jew Dan Kiesel, as a physiotherapist, it led to widespread protests.

Christians, who comprise 1.6 per cent of Pakistan's population, have been attacked in various cities. Most Pakistani Christians are descendants of Dalit Hindus, converts from the British era and are among the poorest. ""Accusations of blasphemy make it easy for Islamist mobs to attack us, while authorities look away,"" said Ashiq Masih, the husband of Asia Bibi, a ""blasphemy convict"" on death row since 2010.

A caste row on June 14, 2009, saw Bibi accused of blasphemy by her Muslim majority village of Ittanwali. She was arrested, tried and sentenced to death under blasphemy laws.

Both then Punjab Governor Salman Taseer and Shahbaz Bhatti, Pakistan's Minister for Minorities, were killed for speaking in her favour in 2011.

Later, the Supreme Court acquitted her. ""We hoped our troubles would end but mobs are baying for our blood,"" wept Masih.

Right-wing groups such as JUD, Jamaat-Ulema-e-Islam, Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan want a public killing of Bibi. Khan's government has said Bibi (who's sought asylum) cannot leave the country.

Bibi's is not the only one. An attack on a Quetta church (December 2017) killed nine and injured 57; a suicide attack on Easter at a Lahore playground (March 2016) left 70 dead and more than 340 wounded; twin bomb blasts at churches in Lahore (March 2015) killed 14 and hurt more than 70; twin suicide bomb attacks at a Peshawar church in 2013 left 80 dead; nearly 40 houses and a church were burnt by a mob in Punjab's Gojra town (2009), with eight burnt alive and churches and Christian schools were set ablaze by a mob, in Faislabad (2005).

""If fellow Abrahamic faiths aren't spared, imagine what happens to Hindus,"" said a prominent Karachi Zoroastrian academic who requested anonymity. ""Hindus are accused of working for India and dragged into any condemnation of our neighbour. Atrocities in Kashmir or anti-Muslim riots in India are used to justify such attacks. Since the very identity of this country is based on opposition to a 'Hindu India out to annexe Pakistan,' this plays out as socio-cultural/political oppression and subjugation.""

It seems difficult to believe but the increasingly Islamicised and homogenous Pakistan was once diverse, she says. ""Minorities who were 15 per cent of the population during Partition now account for less than 4 per cent now. Unless Imran Khan demonstrably takes steps to address their concerns, there might be no minorities to speak of.""

Pakistan under Gen Zia-ul-Haq robbed Ahmadiyyas of their religious identities by declaring the community as non-Muslim apostates through the second amendment to the Constitution in April 1984, said Ahmadiyya welfare community vice-prez Pervez Ahmed."

A CIVIL court in Thane last week dismissed a plea by the second wife of a deceased policeman to seek an equal share in his estate. Though she was assisted in her effort by the man's first wife, the court ruled that as both women were governed by the Islamic Law, they were both entitled to only one-eighth of the estate.

The suit was filed in February by Mumbra resident Nazma Deshmukh, the second wife of Inspector Bashir Deshmukh, who died intestate in July 2017.

In September 2017, Nazma announced, in an advertisement, her intention to be named in a succession certificate and claim 50 per cent of Rs 9.12 lakh. The money is presently in custody of Navi Mumbai police.

She then initiated a civil suit against Bashir's first wife, Pareen, under the Indian Succession Act, who did not object to her claim. However, Judge G D Nirmale noted that as both women were governed by Islamic Law, they were jointly entitled to only one-eighth of the estate, under the Hanifi School of Thought. It is one of four religious schools of Sunni Muslim jurisprudence.

The judge also issued an order to grant a succession certificate in which both wives will be granted one-eighth of the property."

While all NCR cities except Manesar recorded high pollution levels, the highest AQI in the country was clocked in Gurugram. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting (SAFAR), though the AQI was recorded at 450 on Sunday morning, it went up to 475 in the evening, ringing alarm bells. This is the first time the city's AQI has slipped to the 'severe' category in December.

While Delhi recorded the AQI at 415, it was logged at 406 in Faridabad, 426 in Noida, 441 in Ghaziabad and 427 in Greater Noida. In Manesar, the AQI was recoded at 263 (poor) on Sunday. The 24-hour average of PM2.5 in Gwalpahari was recorded at 184.87 micrograms per cubic metre.

On Sunday, the capital recorded a minimum of 3 degrees Celsius on Sunday while Gurugram shivered at 0.4 degreesCelsius. Met officials have forecast cold wave conditions to continue for the next two days. On Saturday, the minimum temperature in Gurugram was recorded at 2 degrees Celsius.

The SAFAR also revealed the day-night trend of the past one week. ""During the night, a combination of calm wind and colder conditions are elevating the pollution level, where in many locations, the 24-hour AQI average is touching the 'severe' category for a few hours, whereas during the day, the wind speed is picking up slightly and the temperature is soaring. This keeps the pollution level in the 'very poor' range,"" a SAFAR report said.

As per the forecast, the situation is expected to worsen in the next two days. ""Currently, the wind speed is very low and likely to go down further. The meteorological factors are already unfavourable as cold wave conditions are expected to continue for the next two days. The city, therefore, may not get any respite from pollution at least till Tuesday,"" said a Met official.

According to the SAFAR forecast, the city's AQI is expected to be between 460 and 523 (severe levels).

According to experts, there's an urgent need to implement all emergency measures. ""The situation is probably the worst this season. Also, the forecast states that it is going to be worse in the city. The authorities should, therefore, immediately put in place emergency measures so that the situation doesn't deteriorate,"" said Niranjan Raje, former member of EPCA and a resident of Gurugram. An official of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), ""As per the norms, the graded response action plan (GRAP) measures under the 'severe' category will be implemented if the air quality remains in the category continuously for 48 hours. However, all the measures under 'very poor' level are already in place."" He also said the schools were already shut for winter vacation.

Meanwhile, the deteriorating air quality in the capital reached the ""severe"" category on Sunday even as yet another cold day was recorded with the minimum temperature plunging to three degrees Celsius, four notches below normal. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 415 and IMD has forecast that air will remain ""severe"" till January 2 owing to unfavourable conditions like high moisture content and low temperatures.

CPCB's task force, which held an emergency meeting on Sunday, asked agencies to be wary of firecrackers being burst on New Year's ordering strict action against violators. The emergency meeting was convened on the Graded Response Action

Plan (GRAP) after the average PM2.5 level crossed the 300 micrograms per cubic metre ""danger"" mark after 9am on Sunday. While measures already in force must continue, enforcement agencies need to step up action, particularly in hotspots in Delhi NCR, CPCB officials said.

Agencies in Delhi and the four neighbouring towns of Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Gurugram have been asked to be on high alert and carry out night patrolling. ""We have also asked them to take action on waste burning and construction activities. There must be strict compliance to the Supreme Court order regarding bursting firecrackers on New Year's Eve,"" said a CPCB official.

While the appropriateness of four sitting judges of the Supreme Court holding a press conference is still being debated, it has brought in greater transparency in the functioning of the top court.

Decisions of the Supreme Court Collegium, a system in which judges appoint judges, are now uploaded on the official website more promptly. Earlier, the public had no excess to it. It also decided to broadcast live-streaming of certain Supreme Court proceedings in the larger public interest.

1. BEING GAY NOT A CRIME

The year also saw the Supreme Court ruling that homosexuality was not a crime, a progressive decision which brought tears of joy to lakhs of individual who had till then lived in fear of persecution. A Constitution bench of the Supreme Court unanimously decriminalised part of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which criminalised consensual unnatural sex. The top court was of the view that any discrimination on the basis of sexuality amounts to the violation of fundamental rights.

""Consensual carnal intercourse among adults be it homosexual or heterosexual, in private space, does not in any way harm the public decency or morality,"" the apex court said.

2. AADHAAR VALID BUT NOT FOR EVERYTHING

Another Constitutional bench of the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Aadhaar scheme but pointed out a host of services for which linking of Aadhaar was not mandatory. While Aadhaar was made necessary for PAN card, income tax returns and for availing welfare schemes and subsidies given by the government, the public were spared of the trouble of requiring it for opening a bank account, getting a new SIM card or admission in schools and to appear in CBSE, UGC and NEET examinations.

3. SABARIMALA TEMPLE FOR ALL

The top court allowed women's entry in Sabarimala temple, a break from age-old practice. The apex court held that ""devotion cannot be subjected to gender discrimination.""

4. ADULTERY NOT A CRIME

The Supreme Court also struck down a 158-year-old law under Section 497 of IPC which criminalised adultery. The provision punished a married man for the offence of adultery if he had sexual relations with a married woman ""without the consent or connivance of her husband.""

Striking down the colonial-era law, the top court said, ""Making adultery a crime is retrograde and would mean punishing unhappy people."" ""Adultery cannot and should not be a crime,"" the top court said but clarified that adultery could continue to be a ground for divorce.

5. NO LAND FOR VIGILANTISM

During the course of the year, the Supreme Court issued a slew of guidelines to deal with mob violence and cow vigilantism. It directed the Centre and the states to start fast-tracked trials in such cases, victim compensation, deterrent punishment and disciplinary action against lax law-enforcing officials. ""The horrendous acts of mobocracy cannot be permitted to inundate the law of the land,"" the top court observed.

6. LAWMAKERS CAN PRACTISE LAW

The Supreme Court dismissed a plea seeking to ban lawmakers from practicing as advocates. The top court ruled that there was no bar on a Member of Parliament, State Assembly or Legislative Council, from practicing as an advocate. The decision cleared the path for several eminent lawyers elected to Parliament and Assemblies to continue in the legal profession.

7. ALLOWED PASSIVE EUTHANASIA AND LIVING WILL

In yet another landmark judgment, the Supreme Court made passive euthanasia and a ""living will"" legally valid. The top court permitted ""living will"" by patients on withdrawing medical support if they slip into an irreversible coma. It was of the view that right to die with dignity is a fundamental right. It laid down some guidelines to be followed in such cases and said its directive shall remain in force till legislation is brought on the issue.

8. TWO-HOUR WINDOW TO BURST CRACKERS DURING FESTIVALS

Concerned over the rising pollution, the Supreme Court brought in a law giving a two-hour window to burst firecrackers on festive days while refusing to impose a complete ban on the sale of firecrackers. The top court conditionally allowed the sale of fireworks that met the standards of low emission and decibel. It allowed the sale of environment-friendly or green crackers only through licensed traders. E-commerce websites were banned from carrying out firecrackers' sale.

9. NO MISUSE OF SC/ST ACT

The Supreme Court removed a provision for automatic arrests and registration of cases for alleged harassment of SCs and STs under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The top court made it mandatory for the police to conduct preliminary inquiries within seven days of a complaint before filing an FIR and said the public servants can be arrested under this law only with the written permission of their public authority.

A dedicated Congress party worker for the last three decades, he started his political career under the guardianship of former Karnataka chief minister Ramkrishna Hegde. It was while working on agrarian issues as in-charge of All India Kisan Congress that Kakade came across several issues related to farm and diary produce, leading to this latest socio-political movement.

Kakade, a commerce graduate with BEd degree, did not have to look far for guidance in his political journey as his uncle Sambhaji Kakade was a two-time parliamentarian and also won the state assembly election a numbers of times.

Q. What is 'Vishmukta Anna, Rog Mukta Sharir' (toxin-free food, disease-free body) all about?

A. I came across issues of crop production, pricing, sales and related policies and problems as in-charge of All-India Farmers Cell of the Congress over a considerable period. The motto of my current movement is to ensure consumers are made aware about the grave issues of food adulteration, toxic elements, and related health complications. World Health Organization (WHO) studies point out that 60-70 crore of the global population would be affected by various diseases. In Delhi alone, around 12 lakhs population is suffering from chronic diseases like cancer and diarrhoea.

Q. What motivated you to take up the movement?

A. Food adulteration is set to unleash havoc if citizens are not woken up with education, advocacy and awareness. Everyone projects that tobacco causes cancer but the threat from toxicity in food and adulteration is much more lethal. Some 17 crore litre of milk is produced in India every day but 67 crore litre is consumed in different forms, whether in sweets and other eatables. From where does the excess milk come? It is being produced using harmful chemicals, which poison the body, inducing diseases.

Q. How adulterated and toxic is our food?

A. The ""protein-rich"" milk may often mean it contains nitrogen-based chemical melamine, which can cause diseases like kidney stones. Unscrupulous traders also blend starch, shampoo, caustic soda and such chemicals to make milk look fresh and thick. They also use corrosive materials in milk to ensure it can be stored for long. Similarly, cows and buffaloes are fed BT cotton seeds and cakes to increase milk production, which is banned in most developed countries. Edible oil too is blended with other substances to increase it's quantity. Government policy allows such adulteration or blending up to 40% for packed products.

Q. How will you direct your movement towards toxin-free farm produce?

A. We are trying to spread awareness among citizens about toxicity in the food, and harmful effects of genetically modified seeds. Most bright and shining brinjals in the market may have originated from genetically seed varieties produced with the help of worms. The genetically modified seeds of tomato are being produced with the help of the genes of 'Bangda' fish. Several other harmful chemicals are used to genetically produce vegetables in more quantity, which also appears 'farm fresh' for a considerable time. There is a no mechanism in place to check and test genetically produced seed varieties. These issues need to brought in the public forum for debate, and create mass mobilization through a dedicated movement.

Q. How has the government faltered in proliferation of such adulterated and toxic foods and farm produce in the market?

A. Government has mostly failed to address farmer issues and agrarian crisis, which has increased malpractices like adulteration and use of genetically modified seeds without checks and balances. There are no laboratories to test foods and farm produces coming to the market. The government needs to put in place a proper mechanism so consumers can decide what food or farm produce they want to consume. Similarly, there is no system to ensure justice for farmers. The sector is plagued with chaotic mismatch.

Q. What are the legal norms on food adulterations, are they being enforced?

A. The Supreme Court has interpreted Article 21 for Right to Life as inclusive of right to pure food and health while deciding a landmark case. The laws and regulations are in place but there is dearth of political will to enforce them to protect interest of consumers, which is our basic area of thrust. As per Article 47, it's one of the duties of the state to raise level of nutrition and standard of living. Food adulteration is also a crime as per the Indian Penal Code (IPC 272 and 273), but the punishments should be enhanced as the existing six months imprisonment and fine of Rs1,000 may not be deterrent enough.

Q. How are you going about the goal of making the society free of adulterated and toxic food?

A. We began the journey from Wardha three months ago through public meetings, lectures and awareness sessions at schools and colleges. We are trying to motivate students to join the movement as volunteers to conduct surveys and understand public opinion on adulteration related issues, and their demands. A mobile app is also being developed to enrol members and supporters. Our aim is to raise awareness and fight the evil with right information and knowledge through sustained campaigns. Also, we want to create pressure on the government to formulate policies and enforce laws so the society can enjoy cleaner food and our future generations can live a healthier life.

The Supreme Court removed a provision for automatic arrests and registration of cases for alleged harassment of SCs and STs under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The top court made it mandatory for the police to conduct preliminary inquiries within seven days of a complaint before filing an FIR and said the public servants can be arrested under this law only with the written permission of their public authority.

The West Bengal government plans to review rules relating to the obtaining of licence and sale of two-wheelers. The policy will come up for consideration in January.

The 'stringent' rules -- which came into effect since June -- have seen scooter and motor-cycle sales tank. Subsequent relaxations were also made by the State government to help push sales.

""We will review the two-wheeler sale policy in January. The date of the meeting is yet to be decided,"" BP Gopalika, Principal Secretary in-charge of the West Bengal Transport department, told BusinessLine.

The policy change, brought in June, issued an advisory barring sale and registration of two-wheelers in the name of people without driving licences. Two-wheeler buyers had to get their identity verified as well.

The State government officials reasoned that the move was aimed at bringing down accidents. But, the question of how a person was to obtain a licence without their own bike remained unanswered. West Bengal does not have any two-wheelers only driving schools.

The immediate effect of this advisory was a drop in sales, which unofficial estimates suggest slid by 60-70 per cent initially, especially during the festive season. Approximately, one lakh two-wheelers were previously being sold in West Bengal on a monthly basis.

In September, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) moved a petition in the Calcutta High Court challenging the advisory. Justice Harish Tandon partially stayed the government notification that prohibited sale (of two-wheelers) without a driving licence.

Later, in October, norms were relaxed. One could buy a two-wheeler without a driving licence, but had to apply for a learner's licence from the store and give an undertaking that no one without a licence will ride the vehicle. Dealers, on the other hand, were ""advised"" to sell bikes after verifying the buyer's 'profile', age, and other documents. They were also asked to upload self-attested copies of these documents, along with online application for registration, on the government database. Earlier, an RTO would profile the buyer.

Norms were further relaxed in November, when the State government said: ""Payment of fees for a learner's licence shall not be a pre-condition for allowing registration,"" and that dealers need not upload documents in ""e-Vahan"".

Although these relaxations have led to ""some improvement"" in sales, the numbers are yet to reach the level seen in previous years.

""People have delayed purchases and are awaiting for more clarity on the rules. Compared to the August-September period when sales dropped drastically, numbers are now picking up,"" a two-wheeler dealer said on conditions of anonymity.

The State government, according to Gopalika, was yet to collect data on sales numbers of two-wheelers post relaxation of rules in November.

State Transport Minister Suvendu Adhikari remained unavailable for comment."

The Kerala Students Union (KSU) has condemned the alleged attempt to forcibly involve girl students in higher secondary schools and colleges in the proposed women's wall on January 1.

KSU president K.M. Abhijith told the media here on Sunday that they would seek legal recourse against officials and teachers who forced students to participate in the programme. He said that some of the teachers and non-teachers in higher secondary schools and some colleges were found to be actively campaigning for the event and persuading students.

""Head of the departments have been sent letters seeking students' participation. In a college in Kozhikode district, teachers were found to be going from one classroom to another to talk about it,"" he said.

Mr. Abhijith said this was against an order of the Kerala High Court which had said girls aged above 18 should not be forced to participate in the event.

He criticised Mahatma Gandhi University, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technological University, and Calicut University for postponing the examinations scheduled on the day. Mr. Abhijith pointed out that this would lead to a lot of troubles for the students as the results would get delayed further.

The KSU leader sought action against university authorities who took the decision to defer the examinations. The KSU had sought an appointment with the Governor, who is also the Chancellor of universities to bring this issue to his attention, he added."

He told PTI that although in 1993, Delhi got a legislative assembly, 2018 saw ""another milestone"" in terms of governance and democracy.

Also, 2018 saw less of rabble-rousing between the AAP government and the Lt Governor's office as compared to the past after the July 4 Supreme Court order.

The apex court had ruled that the lieutenant governor of Delhi is bound by the ""aid and advice"" of the Delhi government. Earlier, both the AAP government and the LG had been on loggerhead over administrative issues.

""In 1993, Delhi got the power to elect government, but Delhi's democratically-elected government got full power to work in 2018 after the SC verdict.

""It was a major breakthrough to strengthen democracy... 2018 will be remembered as a 'landmark year' in the history of Delhi,"" Sisodia said.

2018 also saw passing of several ambitious projects of the AAP government, including doorstep delivery of ration, installation of CCTVs across the city among others.

However, the deputy chief minister rued that as services do not come under the Delhi government, the AAP dispensation cannot create new posts.

A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court reserved its order on services and other issues and an order in this regard can come anytime.

""As the Delhi government does not have power of services, we cannot create new posts. We can open news schools, but when it comes to hiring teachers, it will be done by the LG. We can open new hospitals, but hiring of doctors will be executed by the lieutenant governor,"" he said.

Sisodia hoped that in 2019, services will come under the Delhi government.

In 2019, the Aam Aadmi Party government plans to conclude its ongoing or pending projects such as free Wi-Fi, setting up of 1,000 mohalla clinics and doorstep delivery of ration among others.

Giving details about the government's upcoming projects, Sisodia said that the AAP dispensation will start entrepreneurship curriculum for students of class 9 to 12 for 2019, a move aimed at giving an opportunity to youths to become job providers instead of job seekers.

Also, the government will open teacher-training university and sports university in 2019, he said, adding that the process of executing these projects is in the final stage.

According to Sisodia, the proposed teachers' university is aimed at giving quality training to teachers. Sports university will offer various curriculum to youths, intended to encourage youths towards sports.

Another project which will be executed in 2019 is free Wi-Fi. The government is considering two-three modules to provide free-Wi-Fi, a pre-poll promise of the Aam Aadmi Party.

""We are currently considering two-three modules. The Delhi government is on it. Technologies with regard to Wi-Fi are getting changed day-by-day. I can say that in 2019, Delhi will get free Wi-Fi,"" Sisodia said.

Talking about AAP government's doorstep delivery of services, Sisodia said that as of now, 40 services, including driving licence, certificates of birth, death, income and marriage, are being provided to Delhiites at their doorstep.

""We will start providing a total of 100 government services by the end of current financial year,"" he said.

Looking back at 2018, the tussle between the AAP government and former chief secretary Anshu Prakash was a major issue.

In February, Prakash had alleged assault by some AAP legislators in front of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Sisodia at the CM's residence.

The incident triggered a political storm, with the BJP and the Congress seeking to attack the AAP which vehemently rejected Prakash's allegations.

Following the alleged assault, IAS and DANICS officers boycotted attending meetings with cabinet ministers, including the chief minister, to register their protest demanding an apology over the issue.

In June, Kejriwal, Sisodia and cabinet ministers Gopal Rai and Satyendar Jain staged a sit-in at the LG's office, demanding that the lieutenant governor direct IAS officers to end their ""strike"" and order action against those who had struck work for ""four months"".

The ministers had also demanded the LG's approval for the doorstep delivery of rations. Following the sit-in, Lt Governor Anil Baijal started working from home."

What is it about Ludo King that has made it beat Temple Run, Candy Crush and Pokemon Go, to become the No. 1 free game on both Google Play Store and App Store? We dug deep to find out how this trend has seamlessly penetrated the lower rungs of the socio-economic segment, galvanising a strata that hadn't warmed up to digital games. Raamesh Gowri Raghavan, an ancient Indian games researcher and professor of archaeology at Mumbai University, believes the game has an innately competitive element which makes it addictive.

Makarand Deshpande, the maverick playwright, finished his 50th original script, Epic Gadbad, marking a milestone in a glorious journey onstage. A farce, it is a conclusion to his previous play, Shakespearecha Mhatara, which was a hilarious take on King Lear. While it was first staged at Prithvi Theatre in July 2018, the playwright has plans to bring it back to the city in 2019 as well.

In 2018, the iconic theatre group Awishkar Theatre brought Aranya Kiran directed by Ajit Bhagat. The play, staged 10 years after the death of its late director-playwright Chetan Datar, is set in the Mahabharata. It revolves around a self-questioning Lord Krishna (played by Sushil Inamdar) in Dwarka. The string of monologues with various lead characters -- wife Rukmini, brother Balaram, foster parents Nand and Yashoda and lastly, mother-like Gandhari -- interrogate Krishna's trickery, political moves and worldview. The play is still being staged and the next show is in January itself.

When Aneesh Bhasin, co-founder at Svami, told us his tonic water has 50 per cent fewer calories than Schweppes, its main competitor, we knew the way we had our gin and tonic was going to change forever. Made from quinine sourced from Congo, cucumber and lime from India, and grapefruit from the US, Bhasin has increased the carbonation over the months because ""Indians like their fizz"". Svami is getting ready to launch more flavours, and a ginger ale by February.

The backstory behind booze

What and Where: White Lady cocktail at The Bombay Canteen; Chanel No. 6 at House of Nomads; Sherlock In A Pickle at London Taxi; and Red Monsoon at Hakkasan

This year, Yash Bhanage, co-owner at The Bombay Canteen, and his research team soaked themselves in the history of single screen theatres as inspiration for cocktails. Not just them, several other bartenders tried to create a story out of their cocktails. For instance, Jiaan Kris J Lam, House of Nomads, created Chanel No. 6 (in pic) as an ode to the fashion house, and Ami Shroff at London Taxi, whipped up a Sherlock-inspired drink which stood out for its prominent notes of gherkin, tea and rose. Order a glass.

At, Harajuku, on Chapel Road, co-owner Saleha Bawazir wanted to bring the street food of Harajuku to Mumbai. So, the restaurant offers a wide range of sweet and savoury crepes; Dorayakis, palm-sized treats comprising a sweet filling sandwiched between two round cakes, among other things. Vikram Khatri, executive chef at Hello Guppy, also overhauled the menu to introduce a range of new items including caramelised popcorn with crispy bacon, beetroot rice cracker and tuna nachos pizza. ""Everybody knows about sushi and ramen. It was time to educate people that there's a lot more that comes from Japan,"" he says.

Inspired by the legendary wrestler, Mini Punjab introduced The Dara Singh thali on its menu this year. Not for the weak-hearted, it packs in the best of unlimited eating. It features 33 items, and includes aloo paratha, chur chur de naan, makki di roti, murg mussalam rice, lamb yoghurt curry, chicken Amritsari and more. If you're in for a man-versus-food contest, here's your best bet.

Development consultant Ragini Kashyap, who started Third Culture Cooks -- a multinational supper club -- likes to tell a story with a bite. Her venture, Bordered dinner, explores border conflict by pairing food with peoples' stories and history. We sampled the Tamil-Sinhala conflict in Sri Lanka, and returned knowing a lot more about our neighbour's culinary diversity.

If you are severely intolerant to gluten, there is a chance you have stayed away from vodka, which is made from wheat, barley, or rye. Well, Tito's Handmade Vodka that is produced in Austin at Texas's oldest legal distillery is now available in Mumbai. The drink is made using corn. Tito Beveridge, who came up with the recipe, distilled the corn mash six times, because it was believed that corn retains some of its smoothness even after distillation. The process of making the corn-based vodka is similar to that of the making of single malts and high-end French cognacs.

It's not every day that you come across pepper in your pannacota, which is why pastry chef Husna Jumani's timut-infused creamy Italian dessert is noteworthy. It's the pronounced flavour of the Nepalese pepper -- spicy with hints of grapefruit -- that propelled her to pick this as the hero ingredient. However, it is an acquired taste, she warns.

The ingredients of Du Rhone might be a well-kept secret, but not its stellar reputation. So when the 140-year-old gourmet chocolate brand opened their first store in May this year, we were the first to rush for a blind tasting evening. Our favourite was the Coline which is a dark ganache with 70 per cent cocoa beans from Brazil and Papua New Guinea.

The last one year saw a rise in the number of gourmet delivery joints in the city. The menu at these kitchens range from Bento Buddha bowls to coconut-panko crusted shrimps with orange and ginger dips. The food, then, is the biggest selling point. We'd recommend the Mis Malaysian Seafood Bisque from Hello Green.

The wandering Maharaj is invited for weddings and funerals, casual get-togethers and Diwali dos, any affair in which the party size is too significant for a regular cook, and when guests need to be impressed. Om Maharaj specialises in sweets, such as rasgulla and ghevar; and Lallan Maharaj, who has also trained in restaurants and five-stars for 13 years, can be trusted to pull off Italian and Chinese dishes convincingly. Lallan says, ""In this line of work, the person who knows his job, doesn't need the title. I have not kept my name maharaj. It's all of you who call me maharajji. So, now, it has become a surname.""

From kombucha to vegetable broth, mixologists discuss what you can replace your calorie-laden mixer with. The almond milk soda cocktail at Colaba's Bombay Vintage has an interesting backstory. Here, Sean Pereira, bar operations manager, uses doodh soda consumed by farmers in Peshawar to keep themselves hydrated.

A food service in Bandra has been made special by autistic students, who have donned chefs' hats to make the lunch break worthwhile. The students belong to the Support for Autistic Individuals (SAI), a charitable trust set up by Kamini Lakhani and her husband, Anil. The young autistic cooks need a fair amount of support. ""It will take them anywhere between one and eight months for them to understand all the steps,"" says Lakhani.

What can you expect when the power couple behind The Table teams up with the boys behind The Woodside Inn? Miss T, a gastro Asian cocktail bar and restaurant. Every cocktail we sampled was characterised by an adventurous, refreshing and comforting tag. The Quixotic (R850) came with peanut butter-infused Jim Beam bourbon, hints of saffron and orange bitters. In the food menu, we liked the chicken and tender coconut curry (R900) that came with pandan rice. The curry was light without lacking depth. We liked the food for its simple execution of flavours and lack of pretentiousness, which is just what an Asian meal should be.

One of Goa's most loved restaurants, House of Lloyd, made its Mumbai debut this year. We met the chef for a taste of the Goa-inspired menu. He has selected the choicest of dishes including rassa omelette, pork chops and clams masala. Now you know where to head for a susegad experience.

Chef Scott Linquist (who runs the Miami favourite Coyo Taco) and Jason Hudanish introduced chapulines or grasshoppers as an off-the-menu dish at Mexican restaurant Xico. The grasshoppers don't have a distinct taste and the texture is close to crunchy prawns. A rich source of protein, you can either eat the dried grasshoppers directly, or on tortilla.

Shunned by society, trans-women have found jobs sans judgment at Third Eye Café. We visited the restaurant to find a place that serves decent food, and the opportunity to the third gender to lead a respectable life. Spread over eleven pages, the menu offers Italian, Oriental and Indian cuisine.

A hoppumm is a marriage between Sri Lanka's hoppers, a type of fermented pancakes, and South Indian appams, and three school friends from Bombay Scottish brought it to Bandra this year. Hoppumm is a 15-seater restaurant, exuding architectural influences from Sri Lanka. The highlight is the bowl-shaped Sri Lankan pancakes filled with a range of fragrant curries. To make it flexible, they offer combinations where you can pair a base staple -- hopper, string hopper (idiyappam), neer dosa, paratha or kothu roti -- with a flavourful filling.

Mastani is a milkshake that comes topped with a dollop of hand-churned ice cream. Some people also add fresh cut fruits, dry fruits and whipped cream. It is believed that when guests tried it for the first time, they would exclaim 'masta'. It has become a part of Pune's food heritage, and you can now try it at a tiny dessert parlour in Vile Parle called Karandikar Mastani House. A simple store with a couple of chairs, this Mastani house offers eight flavours starting from mango to the interesting Irish pudding Mastani.

Chembur, the eastern suburb which last made headlines for a culinary reason in November 2016 when Matunga's iconic eatery Mani's Lunch Home moved here, is now in the midst of a hospitality boom. Want to spend a day indulging your cravings? Do it with as few steps as possible as you start off with Pot Pourri, Theobroma, then 99 Pancakes, Keventers, London Bubble Co, The Koffee Works, Wok Hei and then China Villa.

Did you know that the hair dryer, apart from blowing hair, can be used to relight charcoals on the grill, soften chocolate and frost cake? Chefs across Mumbai are putting non-kitchen items to good use. The stand out was Empresa Hotel chef Ajay Chopra's ingenious hack of using a coal iron to press a quesadilla. Book a table to see for yourself."

Santhose Reddy has said that in a democracy, every citizen is supposed to have equal justice and if anyone feels that his or her rights enshrined in the Constitution are violated, they can approach courts or legal services authorities at all levels.

Addressing the legal empowerment camp (New Module) organised on child-friendly legal services to children and their protection scheme-2015 here on Saturday, he said legal service authorities were formed from national level down to mandals through an Act made in Parliament in 1987.

This Act would help protect the legal rights of women and children and ensure equal justice to them. It would also ensure that all the schemes meant for the two categories were strictly implemented, he said.

About 2,000 children, including differently abled, from various government schools attended the camp. Skits on child marriage and ""beti bachao beti padao"" made by children were displayed on the occasion. Sports skits and dictionaries provided by advocates P. Hanmanth Reddy, Prakash Reddy and Tulasi Das were given to the children.

"59","1029161785","2018-12-30","https://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-quest-for-mental-wellness-2701914","Quest for mental wellness","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE,"depression Statistics from the National Mental Health Survey of India, 2015-16, indicate that 150 million need support for mental disorders , Istock

Every year in December, Altmetric (a data science company, which tracks published research online and provides insights related to institutions, publishers, researchers and funders), comes out with a list of the top 100 scientific papers. This year 3 out of the 100 are on mental health and depression, with one being in the top 10 examining the relationship between exercising and mental health in US. The other two are on the side effects of consumption of anti-depressants and on prevalence of mental health issues in graduate education.

This is more than mildly alarming. As 2018 comes to an end, events like Elon Musk's breakdown on Twitter, the suicide of Stanford University physicist and entrepreneur Zhang Shoucheng (who was apparently in line for the Nobel Prize), and closer home, depression hitting IIT aspirants in Kota, or suicides of farmers make one point clear: The ogre of mental illness is staring at societies rich and poor, in many ugly ways.

The World Health Organization in March 2018 noted that globally some 300 million suffer from depression and in October 2018, perhaps in recognition, the United Kingdom appointed formally a minister for suicide prevention. Around the world, depression is now affecting the young, the married, the working professionals and entrepreneurs, farmers in rural landscapes and also the aged. Unfortunately, social stigma, delayed detection and an understaffed supply side with psychiatrists, counsellors, and therapists make the matter worse not just in India but in many developing countries. To complicate the story, given the big medical challenge of the blood-brain barrier, innovation, and efficacy in the performance of anti-depressant medicines have been underwhelming. A recent study in the UK reported that even toddlers may not be exempt, the defiant ones potentially showing symptoms tomorrow. Additionally, other findings here point to the gender element.

Even more concerning is that in India alone, statistics from the National Mental Health Survey of India, 2015-16 indicate that 150 million need support for mental disorders and this has been now repeatedly featured even in recent speeches of the country's political leaders, including the Prime Minister's and the President's. Some other studies have noted that some 20 per cent of the Indian population will be suffering from at least one mental health problem by 2020 and the lay of the land is complicated by the fact that therapy is not commonly embraced in India. In addition, as answered in Lok Sabha by the minister of state of health and family welfare, there are just 3,827 psychiatrists and 898 clinical psychologists in the country. Further the distribution of this limited mental health workforce is also geographically heterogeneous. While frank discussions here, especially by prominent members of the society like Deepika Padukone help, given that there are currently evolving deep changes in the social structure, mere recognition and awareness may not be able to bridge the gap between supply and demand, leave alone handle issues around financing costs for therapy and treating mental health in a market dominantly out of pocket in the broader healthcare context.

One way to potentially solve this problem may be to take advantage of entrepreneurship and technology leapfrogging the supply barrier. A technology-enabled multi-sided platform that guarantees confidentiality, gauge moods using natural language processing and artificial intelligence and matches therapists to unwell citizens could be a way forward, especially keeping in mind affordability and access. While international start-ups like Talkspace, 7 Cups and Better Help are already operating in this space, even here in India, platforms like TickTalkTo and YourDost are gaining prominence. Several organisations, in fact, are also using such platforms along with chat bots to promote employee wellness and thereby trying to improve productivity and reduce attrition.

In addition, policy interventions are also needed. For example, treatment of mental health should be added to India's national and statewide universal healthcare coverage programmes on a priority basis (encouraging here is to see that the Insurance and Regulatory Development Authority recently asked private insurers to include mental health in their packages) and brick and mortar investments need to happen to bridge the supply gap in professional psychiatrists, not just in urban but also in rural areas. In addition, the government could do well to turn to traditional medicines and wellness initiatives that promote healthy living. Finally, there is also an urgent need to attend to air pollution across India since recent research has found with postmortem brain samples from people exposed to high levels of air pollution (living in Mexico City and UK), the higher likelihood of brain disorders like Alzheimer's.

Also, in recent times, the Mental Health Policy, the new Mental Health Act, recommendations from National Human Rights Commission, directives from the Supreme Court of India, advocacy actions and the introduction of 'Happiness Curriculum' in Delhi government schools are all undoubtedly steps in the right direction.

This is precisely the mission driven multifarious approach required in a country where issues like farm productivity, joblessness, a pressure to perform and compete, societal transformations in the urban and rural landscapes are denting the overall quotient for happiness. One can also draw inspiration and learning from the much successful polio mission here, facilitate healthcare entrepreneurship in this area, spur public and private investment in structural transformation of the supply side and further augment financing of mental health treatment. As the Dalai Lama said, happiness is not something readymade, it comes from your own actions, it is time for the country to recognise that and bolster its quest for mental wellness going forward."

Addressing a press conference, KCR also stressed rising demands of Backward Class reservations. ""The Opposition parties are making unnecessary demands on BC reservations. BJP has lost their deposits in 103 constituencies out of 118 constituencies in Telangana for giving useless statements in their election campaigns. Congress leaders went to court to demand reservation for BCs, however, both High Court and the Supreme Court have dismissed the case. Congress is the party, who wants more than 50 per cent reservation for BCs just to come into the power. It was under Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government that 69.19 per cent reservation was issued on the basis of the notification.

Appreciating his government for playing a key role in Telangana's development, the Chief Minister said, ""There were only 192 schools in the state and when TRS formed the government here the number of schools touched 261. It is the government's credentials that have given the reservation to BCs in market committees. 74 lakh sheep were distributed to shepherds to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore. Telangana is the first government to give reservations for the BCs in the country.""

KCR further launched a scathing attack on Chandra Babu Naidu stating that ""he is one of the dirtiest politicians in the country. Babu is not a leader but a manager of Telugu Desam Party (TDP). He grabbed the TDP party from Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (NTR). Naidu has copied Telangana schemes. He can't even speak proper English and Hindi and can he enter into national politics.

Rubbishing the actions of the opposition parties on the issue as mere political gimmicks, he said the Congress leaders, who filed cases against the enhanced reservations for BCs, were now blaming the TRS for following the court orders and reverting the reservations.

He stated that the State government was left with no option but to follow the court verdicts and conduct the polls within a stipulated time. He felt that the opposition parties had failed to learn lessons from their failure in the recent Assembly elections.

""We passed the new Panchayat Raj Act in the Assembly enhancing total reservations to 61.9 per cent, but Congress leaders Swapna Reddy and Bhupal Reddy filed petitions in the High Court against it. The High Court directed the government to maintain the 50 per cent cap on total reservations. We challenged the verdict in the Supreme Court but in vain. Now that we are following the court orders, the Congress and other opposition parties are trying to win the sympathy of backward classes. But people are aware of the lies that the opposition parties are spreading,"" he said.

Speaking to the media at Pragati Bhavan here, Rao said even the BJP was playing double games with regard to BC reservations. He pointed out that despite repeated representations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking amendments to the Constitution to implement enhanced reservations, there was no response from the Centre. ""But BJP State president K Laxman continues to blame the TRS,"" he alleged. He demanded the BJP leaders to convince their national leadership to constitute separate Ministry for BCs in the Union government for a special focus on issues of backward classes.

The Chief Minister pointed out that Telangana was the first State to implement BC reservations in market committees and also establish Most Backward Classes (MBC) Corporation. While only 19 BC residential schools were set up in Telangana region before the formation of separate State, the TRS government established 261 BC residential schools within four years. He stated the Overseas Scholarship Scheme was also being implemented for meritorious BC students. ""The opposition parties destroyed traditional occupations during their regime in power. We are trying to revive them and empower them financially through schemes such as sheep and fish distribution, Bathukamma sarees among others,"" he added.

While declaring that the TRS implemented more than 50 per cent reservation for weaker sections within the party, Rao stated that his government nominated BC leaders to head about 15 corporations and 50 market committees in the State. He felt that the Congress and other opposition parties were creating a ruckus over the BC reservations as they fear to face the PR elections following their recent defeat in the State."

Chandrasekhar Rao has stated that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government does not need to learn lessons from the Opposition parties on the welfare and development of Backward Classes (BCs) as it is way ahead of other States in working for the communities.

Criticising the Congress, BJP and TDP on the issue of reservation to BCs in gram panchayat elections, Mr. Rao said it was with a view to provide higher quota to the communities the government had made a new Panchayat Raj legislation with total reservations of 61.19%. However, two Congress sarpanches moved the High Court against higher quota to BCs and the High Court had set aside the government move. When the government appealed in the Supreme Court, it upheld the lower court decision stating that total reservation could not cross 50%, he stated.

He asked people to examine the facts as the government had no other go but to hold the gram panchayat elections as directed by the High Court by January 10. The Chief Minister claimed that it was TRS government which had recognised BCs better than others by introducing quota for BCs in Agriculture Market Committees besides giving them chairpersons' posts of 15 Corporation apart from a slew of measures such as increasing the BC residential schools from 19 to 261 and others.

Responding to a question on formation of his Cabinet, the Chief Minister said ""there's no hurry"" and it would happen at an ""appropriate time"" as senior officials, including Chief Secretary S.K. Joshi and former chief secretary Rajiv Sharma and others were engaged in an exercise to clubbing together similar departments. Giving an example, he said departments of agriculture, cooperation, marketing and civil supplies should be under one minister.

He also stated that all the 33 districts, 31 existing and two upcoming, would not have representation in the 18-member Cabinet including the Chief Minister and the unrepresented districts would be compensated with other Cabinet-rank posts. ""We will also have Parliamentary Secretaries this time by moving court and adopting the legislations of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and Karnataka, where such a system is in practice,"" Mr. Rao said adding that it would be a training ground for new legislators.

The Chief Minister also ridiculed the Congress allegation of EVM tampering seeking to know whether same thing was done in three States where Congress had won.

The government is working on a mission to bring down the drop-out rate to zero in the coming years, he said, laying the foundation stone for Anjuman-e-Islam's educational complex expansion project at the Dr. MIJ Girls High School & Junior College, Bandra.

The minister said for the first time since Independence, the NDA government has expanded development programmes for minorities from existing 100 to 308 districts, for providing basic amenities to ensure educational empowerment of girls of minority communities.

The government has launched schools, colleges, polytechnics, girls hostels, skill development centres to ensure employment-oriented development of the minorities, especially the girls, Naqvi said.

On its part, the ministry is committed to '3E' strategy of Education, Employment and Empowerment and in past two years thousands of minority-run educational institutions, including madrasas, have entered the education mainstream by connecting them with '3Ts' - Teacher, Tiffin and Toilet', said Naqvi.

He said in the past four years of the NDA, more than 2.11 crore students of minority communities, including 60 per cent girls, have been provided scholarships.

""This year, a National Scholarship Portal Mobile App has been launched to ensure smooth and hassle-free scholarship system for poor and weaker section students. The scholarship amounts are given directly into the bank accounts,"" Naqvi pointed out.

Besides, he said 5.43 lakh youth and 1.50 lakh artisans have been provided employment opportunities through job-oriented schemes at various levels, indicating the government's efforts for educational empowerment of all weaker sections, including minorities, have shown results on the ground.

Present on the occasion were Anjuman-e-Islam Chairman Jahir Kazi, Maulana Azad Education Foundation Vice-Chairman Ashfaq Saifi and Secretary R. Rehman.

The 144-year-old Anjuman-e-Islam was founded by Dr. Badruddin Tyabji in 1874, who was the third President of Indian National Congress, and the first Indian Barrister to practise law at Bombay High Court, where he rose to become the first Acting Indian Chief Justice.

Starting with a solitary school then, today it has mushroomed into a mega-educational institution running around 90 schools, colleges, professional courses colleges and sports complexes in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra benefitting over 1.10 lakh students of all communities.

The drop-out among Muslim girls, which was as high as 70 per cent, has been reduced to 35-40 per cent due to awareness and educational empowerment programmes of the government, Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said here on Saturday.

The government is working on a mission to bring down the drop-out rate to zero in the coming years, he said, laying the foundation stone for Anjuman-e-Islam's educational complex expansion project at the Dr. MIJ Girls High School & Junior College, Bandra.

The minister said for the first time since Independence, the NDA government has expanded development programmes for minorities from existing 100 to 308 districts, for providing basic amenities to ensure educational empowerment of girls of minority communities.

The government has launched schools, colleges, polytechnics, girls hostels, skill development centres to ensure employment-oriented development of the minorities, especially the girls, Naqvi said.

On its part, the ministry is committed to '3E' strategy of Education, Employment and Empowerment and in past two years thousands of minority-run educational institutions, including madrasas, have entered the education mainstream by connecting them with '3Ts' - Teacher, Tiffin and Toilet', said Naqvi.

He said in the past four years of the NDA, more than 2.11 crore students of minority communities, including 60 per cent girls, have been provided scholarships.

""This year, a National Scholarship Portal Mobile App has been launched to ensure smooth and hassle-free scholarship system for poor and weaker section students. The scholarship amounts are given directly into the bank accounts,"" Naqvi pointed out.

Besides, he said 5.43 lakh youth and 1.50 lakh artisans have been provided employment opportunities through job-oriented schemes at various levels, indicating the government's efforts for educational empowerment of all weaker sections, including minorities, have shown results on the ground.

Present on the occasion were Anjuman-e-Islam Chairman Jahir Kazi, Maulana Azad Education Foundation Vice-Chairman Ashfaq Saifi and Secretary R. Rehman.

The 144-year-old Anjuman-e-Islam was founded by Dr Badruddin Tyabji in 1874, who was the third President of Indian National Congress, and the first Indian Barrister to practise law at Bombay High Court, where he rose to become the first Acting Indian Chief Justice.

""Bullets from all sides have only resulted in death and destruction and nothing else... there should be a ceasefire for at least three months from the first day of the new year,"" Singh told reporters here.

He praised the Army and suggested that soldiers be withdrawn from the populated areas during the ceasefire period and assigned the primary task of defending the borders.

""The military shall do a great job defending our borders which have been disturbed by foreign power,"" he said.

Police are competent to look after the disturbed areas. Thy should deal with the law and order, he added.

The NPP supremo made a fervent appeal to the ""gun-wielding youths"" to deposit the weapons in respective police stations and join the mainstream for reconstruction and prosperity of the state.

Pleading for the setting up of an advisory committee, Singh urged President Ram Nath Kovind to ensure that justice is done to people residing in Ladakh, Kashmir and Jammu regions of the state.

""Fresh approach should be initiated with fresh thinking in order to involve people, particularly the youth, towards progress and development through construction and not destruction.

Bidding adieu to city's most loved single-screens

The article 'Rex in peace' published on November 28 was about the iconic Rex Cinema running its last show on December 31. Bengalureans got sentimental about losing one of the last single screen theatre in the city. Many have decided to catch a show again for 'old time's sake'. The 80-year-old building will be brought down to build a shopping complex with multiplex in the same premises. The old Nilgiris supermarket right next to the theatre, will be refurbished too, and occupy space within the same complex in the upcoming mall. The theatre has staff who's been working there for decades. They recalled how the theatre used to run only English movies back in 1960s after it was bought by Nandlal Kapur, great grandfather of Anil Kapur who currently manages the place. The first film to be screened after it was taken over by Kapur was Sleeping Beauty.

City's garbage creates a stink for traffic police department

On October 4, 2018, CE carried a report on the dismal state of traffic police chowkis in the city. The story shone the spotlight on the officials who brave the sun, wind and rain to ensure Bengalureans stay safe on the road, all while working under unpleasant conditions. These islands are usually meany for policemen to sit in and monitor traffic but come nightfall, either motorists use the chowkis as toilets or pourakarmikas use it to store their cleaning equipment. In response, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) claimed that they are responsible for its cleanliness but assured action. Cleaner, greener Bengaluru in 2019? Yes, please!

Commute in the city is as good as a circus act

'Railway commuters turn gymnasts at Whitefield Station' was published on March 14. The story highlighted how despite high patronage by techies and factory workers, Whitefield Railway Station design puts the lives of around 30,000 commuters at risk. People are forced to duck under stationary goods trains, jump over the couplers connecting freight coaches, run across railway tracks or enter station through broken fences. A small overbridge connects all the four platforms, but is about 1 km away from the main point of entry. It is also not accessible to physically challenged.

One small step for the LGBTQ+ community,a giant leap for humanity

2018 was a landmark year for the LGBTQ+ community. With the supreme court decriminalising homosexuality on September 6, people from the community could finally live and love freely. In response to the judgment, Tania Thomas from CE gave a first-hand view of how the judgment paves the way to a more inclusive life for her. But while the stepping stone had been laid, the community still has miles to go. Just like Thomas said, ""It's high time we queer women are also visible to our peers at our workspace. To shake them and things up, help them realise that we are not a community that's 'out there somewhere', but one that is right within their midst."" Here's hoping 2019 gives CE a chance to write more stories about positive changes in the LGBTQ+ community.

City couples opt for long distance relationship

The story was published on January 14, when we heard of city residents entering a new kind of long-distance relationships, thanks to Bengaluru's traffic! Torn apart by traffic, these couples lived separately to save on time while commuting and met only on weekends. Not just couples, parents too were tired of seeing their children suffer and chose to enroll them in hostels close to their schools.

#MeToo misses plight of domestic workers

If one social movement took India by storm this year, it was #MeToo. Scores of women across industries came forward and spoke out against perpetrators and harassers. While women across industries spoke up, CE's report titled 'Lack of laws pushes maids outside #MeToo's purview' found that one essential group had been left out of the conversation - domestic workers. The story looks at the various instances of abuse such women face and how the campaign hadn't provided space for their voices to be heard.

And the search is still on...

CE 's Father's Day special story 'Life's purpose to find my son, says Ajitabh's father' was written with a heavy heart. It was about the turmoils that Kumar Ajitabh's family and friends are going through, after the techie went missing on December 18. He had left his home to meet a prospective buyer for his car. After fighting the case for months, the case was finally transferred to the CBI. But there has been no progress in the case yet. His father, 64, says it's the 'worst nightmare of his life that doesn't seem to end'. ""Every day when I sleep, I wish I did not wake up the next day,"" he had said. Pragya, Ajitabh's sister never leaves sight from her phone hoping one day, she would get a call from someone with some information about her brother. When CE contacted the father again, he said, ""I can neither die or live without knowing what happened to my son. We are still waiting for him.""

Home, dusty, home

CE 's November 21st report 'Living on breaths filled with cement dust' was an eye-opener towards how IJM Concrete Products Pvt Ltd had wreaked havoc with the lives of 75 families who moved into Zonasha Paradiso, a posh residential villa project in Ferns Paradise, Doddanekundi. While the families had started moving in sometime around 2016, our report revealed that they are now diagnosed with lung and respiratory issues, skin infections, asthma, wheezing and dermatological problems. The story gave a voice to the plight of these residents who were in a constant push-and-pull situation with IJM. In response, the GM of IJM said the company would shift to land near Budhikere Cross in Mandur by the next financial year.

Giving a voice to women

On June 2, CE 's 'NRI husbands scoot, file for divorce from safe distance' gave a voice to several women suffering in silence. We received calls from across the country, including Punjab, Indore, Chennai and Patna, to share similar stories of women being abandoned by NRI husbands. We also had a reader coming to office to meet the reporter to find a way out for his daughter who has been fighting the same problem. The MEA had proposed to put out a list of these absconding husband's in June, which is yet to see the light of the day. Hopefully, a Bill to check NRI marriage frauds is on the 2019 cards.

Dubbing gets thumbs-up

In our story that appeared on December 12, 'Regional films to be dubbed in Kannada soon?', which mentioned that the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) had held preliminary rounds of discussions to take a call on filmmakers from other states being able to release dubbed versions of their films in Karnataka, sources told us that a dubbed version of superstar Rajinikanth's Petta was being contemplated. This report was carried on December 24, 'In a first, dubbed version of superstar Rajininath's Petta to release in Kannada'.

Tall achievements

Even though dwarf athletes from the city have won golds for India, several still struggle to repay loans they look to participate in the 2017 Dwarf Games held in Canada. To represent the country, some of them have even pawned their spouses' gold. On reading CE's story 'Here's why Bengaluru's Dwarf Athletes feel short-changed', a government organisation came forward to provide financial assistance to each of the athletes.

Easing out situation for apartment residents

Residents of apartments have had an a tough time forming associations and resolving disputes. The long process thanks to outdated laws saw a change with CE's story 'No one to broker peace in city flats' on April 5. Recently, on December 5, the state government issued a circular urging apartment associations to register themselves under The Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act."

On Thursday the police claimed that the girl was hurt due to falling from the bicycle. Girl child has also stated this in the court about falling from the bicycle. The police also claim that after the medical examination of the minor girl, the doctor has not even confirmed the rape.

On the other hand, the questions are being raised on police on being registering the case hastily under serious offences and the action taken by the police with the suspected minor in this case reflects the sensitivity of the police against children. Counselor's help was also not taken in this entire case. ASP Dinesh Kaushal told that on Tuesday evening, when the minor girl was cycling, she fell and was injured.

On Wednesday morning when mother was making her daughter bath, only then she saw signs of injury. When mother asked about the injury from daughter, she took the name of one of her classmates. After this the kin had taken the girl for treatment in AIIMS.

There the doctor also interrogated the child. But the doctor was also surprised by hearing that an 8 year old boy kidnapped her. But when she was asked about someone else's involvement in the incident besides the classmate, the baby girl shook her head.

Finally the case reached the police station. Then police had registered a case under various sections on 10 years old boy and on another. In the night, the girl's classmate was interrogated but he was unaware of the crime.

Doctor did not give clear arguments:

DIG Dharmendra Chaudhary had formed the SIT for the investigation of the incident. The SIT took the statements of the girl and her father and with the suspected minor boy, in which there was no proof of the molestation has come out.

Suspected child denied the crime. In the medical report of the child, the doctor did not give a clear argument about being raped. The doctor had written in the report that there was no injury marks found in the private part of the girl.On this basis the police took again the statements of the girl. In which she informed that she fell down from bicycle. After this, the police have recorded statements under Section 164 in the court on Thursday.

According to ASP Kaushal, this case will not be concluded now. The whole matter will continue to be investigated closely. Since there was talk of involvement of an adult accused in this case, the police had immediately registered an FIR under serious sections.

Counseling was to be done, minor boy felt mental trauma

Archana Sahay, the director of the child line, says that in this case both the children had to be counseled. The big question is how can eight years old girl can allege about molestation, when she was injured after falling from bicycle?

Why did she take the name of her old classmate? At the same time, the 8 years old child also got hurt with mental trauma when he had been brought for brought for the interrogation on allegation of molestation.

Emergency numbers should be written at public places

MP Child Rights Protection Commission has taken cognizance in the case of rape with an eight year old girl on Thursday. The Commission has instructed to write emergency numbers on schools and school buses and public places, in view of the growing molestation of girl child in the state capital. The Commission has written a letter to the State Education Center, School Education Department and Transport Department for this.

These numbers are:

Child Helpline- 1098, Dial 100, Women Helpline- 1090, Child Rights Commission No.- 0755- 2559900."

(HT File)

With some school headmasters (HMs) dragging their feet over paying penalties for allegedly inflating attendance of students, the Bihar government has finally decided to recover fines by deducting the amount from their salary.

The HMs allegedly spiked attendance of students to claim more funds under the mid-day meal(MDM) programme.

Though the government received reports of irregularities long ago and imposed financial penalty on HMs, the fines could not be fully recovered. Many of the HMs moved court for relief citing their unwanted involvement in non-academic work, while others were just indifferent.

The government has ordered the recovery of a Rs8.68-crore penalty from HMs. Of which, Rs 4.21-crore (48%) has been recovered. More than 1,000 HMs have allegedly fudged the data since 2013, when the idea of penalty was first mooted by the state education department.

RK Mahajan, principal secretary of the department of education, recently directed all district programme officers (DPOs) to deduct the penalty amount from headmasters' salary in five instalments over as many months.

""The DPOs must ensure a monthly deduction from all those who have not deposited the penalty amount within a month of the receipt of the letter, except those who have got stay from the court,"" stated a letter by Mahajan.

""During inspections, the attendance of that particular day in the school and the average of the previous week is matched. If the deviation is within 10%, there is no issue. However, if the deviation is above 10%, a penalty equivalent to the amount given in the last three months is imposed on the headmaster,"" said Vinod Kumar Singh, director of the mid-day meal programme, .

Another official said that in several cases, the accused HMs with the help of their association approached the Patna high court or the Lokayukta, claiming that they were overburdened with non-academic work like management of MDM. The court has also asked the government to find an alternative to free teachers from MDM responsibilities.

Though the Bihar government tried to hand over MDM to NGOs or self-help groups (SHGs) and also ran pilot projects, a viable alternative has not been found because of the scale of the programme. In Bihar, despite a drop in enrolment numbers, 1.20 crore students from Class 1 to Class 8 are estimated to avail MDM daily.

In a Niti Ayog meeting a few months ago, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar advocated the direct benefit transfer for the centre's flagship MDM programme to plug leakages. ""Cooking in schools has a direct bearing on education. Instead of centres of learning, schools are viewed as centres of food. Poor quality and unhygienic conditions often lead to unpleasant incidents,"" he had said.

However, to achieve this, the Centre would have to change the policy at the national level, which seems unlikely. Bihar, on its part, has been seriously mulling the option of handing over MDM to women SHGs, which are 8 lakh in the state, the highest in the country. A pilot project has been launched in one block each of Jehanabad and Muzaffarpur to assess the feasibility."

By seeing the seriousness on this matter, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that the vehicle allocating scheme which is popularly known as Odd- Even scheme, may be executed if obligatory. Since Diwali festival, the city is facing its worst pollution disaster.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said to news agency, ""We're taking a number of steps like tree plantation drives and buying 3000 buses etc. We sanctioned one of largest metro phases yesterday day. If the need arises, we'll implement the Odd-Even scheme. Each individual has to play a role in reducing pollution""

In the Odd-Even scheme the cars with licence plates winding up with an odd number and even number are permitted to practice on alternating days. The scheme is also a part of the Supreme Court-enforced Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) and was first implemented in the year 2016. The scheme got into arguments over exemptions settled to various classifications of vehicles.

Under this scheme, extreme actions such odd-even road allocating scheme, ban on entry of trucks and closing of schools are applied when the 'severe plus' level of pollution continues for 48 hours.

The 'severe plus' levels is considered to be a disaster and is an emergency situation. This situation arises when the Air Quality Index (AQI) breaks 500 which is considered to be the highest rate on the scale.

The authorities said that Delhi's air quality continued in the 'severe' level for the fourth successive day on Tuesday as atmospheric situations sustained to be adverse for dispersal of pollutants.

While the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) statistics displayed the complete air quality index (AQI) at 'severe' level of 416, the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting (SAFAR) note down an AQI of 423.

The CPCB statistics showed that around Twenty five areas in Delhi documented severe pollution stages, while on the other hand nine areas recorded very poor air quality,.

In the NCR, places such as Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Noida note down severe pollution while Gurgaon recorded 'very poor' quality air.

The CPCB also said that the complete PM2.5 level was noted at 271 and the PM10 level at 422 here. Further on Saturday, Delhi's air quality had turned to 'severe' condition. Later on Sunday the national capital noted its second maximum pollution level of the year with an AQI of 450."

New Delhi: Shais Khan, a 23-year-old masseur from Delhi, has a dream. He wants to be the next Sunny Leone, an unabashed porn star not confined to the seedy underbelly that is the world of Indian adult cinema today.

""I'm crazy about my dream,"" Shais, now a regular in Indian porn productions, told ThePrint. ""I don't have words to explain how crazy I am.""

Shais' introduction to porn came five years ago, when he took up a job at a spa owned by French nationals. ""I have been working here for five years, so my owners used to show me French (porn) videos..."" he said.

The idea of performing porn instantly intrigued Shais, who began filming adult videos with the help of friends.

""There's a profession for everything. There are schools for teachers and parlours for beauticians, but there isn't a porn industry in India, so those who want to pursue this profession have to find a way around it,"" Shais said.

While he has become a recognisable face in the Indian gay porn industry, Shais is waiting for porn to be legalised in the country, when he would be able to show off his ""diverse skill set"".

Studies show the Indian market is big enough to make porn a viable career option for the likes of Shais.

The sixth annual review conducted by Pornhub, released recently, showed that Indians love to watch porn, with the country accounting for the third highest daily traffic to the adult video site in 2018, behind only the US and the UK.

The same report suggested that nothing gets Indians quite as excited as seeing other Indians having sex: For the second year in a row, top searches for Indians contained the words 'Indian' or 'Hindi'.

Pari Tomar, a YouTube star, made big bucks off soft-porn videos (a less sexually explicit variant) until March 2016, when significant changes to the portal's monetisation and content policies rendered cleavage shots and heavy panting unprofitable.

""I used to work about 20-25 days a month, sometimes acting in up to eight short films a day,"" she told ThePrint. While it was allowed, Pari charged Rs 15,000 for a day of work. ""But now those films don't get produced anymore, [as] they tell me they were getting too vulgar for the internet. So I do mostly comedy.""

Richa Kaul Padte, author of Cyber Sexy: Rethinking Pornography, said Indians were looking for sexual content featuring Indians online. ""And because we don't have a porn industry in India, this demand is being fulfilled either by brown actors in American/Western porn, and by homemade porn -- which is made, either consensually or non-consensually -- by regular people in India,"" she added.

However, Indian policy, experts say, has often been out of step with this reality.

Despite the fact that the demand for well-produced Indian porn is growing every year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) banned over 800 websites offering adult content in October, the censor board sanitises sexuality in Bollywood movies, and Section 67 of the IT Act criminalises ""publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form"" with imprisonment of up to five years and a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh.

The reasons span from moral objections, to the belief that porn is a major driver of sexual crime, as evidenced in the Uttarakhand High Court order that led to the TRAI directive.

But experts and industry insiders say such bans deprive the country of a vast revenue source, while potentially turning a willing audience to portals offering illegal content.

""All the money is basically going into the pockets of international companies,"" said Yash Juneja, a Jharkhand-based music store owner who also makes semi-porn films for private clients.

""They come shoot here, or Indians upload porn on their sites, and they earn all the advertisement and subscriber-based revenue,"" he added.

The true potential of porn in India remains unexplored: Some estimates peg the global porn industry's worth at $97 billion. The US, where porn is legal and users accounted for the highest daily traffic to Pornhub in 2018, is said to alone have a porn industry worth $10-12 billion.

Goutham Shivshankar, an advocate-on-record in the Supreme Court, told ThePrint that the ""the primary target in Indian law is 'obscenity' and not 'pornography', except child pornography, which is specifically and separately dealt with under section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000"".

While Section 67 of the Act rules ""publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form"" a punishable offence, viewing or storing pornography in India is not illegal.

This means that you can make a sex tape and store it on your phone, and you are clear legally as long as you don't upload it on a website or distribute it via email, WhatsApp or any other digital platform.

""If India legalises porn, we would stand out as the largest consumers of porn in the world,"" Vaibhav, an IT-consultant-turned-director who has worked on porn films, told ThePrint.

Legalising porn, he said, will ensure that India matches international standards, with the ensuing influx of capital and investment likely to bring Indian porn and its local purveyors out of the shadows and help them carve their own niche.

""The actors there (in the West) are doing it out of their own will. There is no desperation for money attached to it,"" he said.

""Jisko bhook lagi hui hai na, voh dhoondhta rahega jab tak uski bhook nahi mitti hai (A person hungering for something will continue to look for it till his desire is not satiated),"" said Vaibhav.

He said legalisation will also help throttle exploitative sex. ""Porn should be legalised... at least in the name of craft and art, because someone will not get molested,"" he added.

One of the most substantial arguments in favour of legalisation rests on consent. At least in perception, the porn industry has been globally linked with human trafficking, rape and assault, and the dehumanisation of women as sex objects.

But Padte argues that decriminalisation will prevent such exploitation.

""There are so many reasons why decriminalisation is a good idea,"" she told ThePrint, ""From distinguishing between consensual and non-consensual content to creating safe spaces for sexuality to developing a range of sexual expressions -- but I guess I would boil it down to the fact that criminalising sexual expression is a really bad idea.""

""It doesn't 'protect' anyone,"" she added. ""All it does is push the whole thing underground, which means that where violence does take place, we don't have mechanisms in place to address it.""

As it stands today, the porn industry in India largely works under the disguise of various ""legitimate"" professions - Several photographers, modelling agencies, massage parlours and smaller production houses supplement their day jobs with the recession-proof padding that porn provides.

Aungshita Chatterjee, 43, has dreams of becoming an international boudoir photographer, and while her aim may be a legal one, she tells ThePrint that ""at some point, a lot of the other photographers discovered that their DSLRs come with an in-built video option"".

""So yes, porn is being made -- in bedrooms and guest houses and studios, and it's uploaded on international servers or sold to clients from Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Russia, and the United Kingdom through brokers,"" she said.

According to Aungshita, who says she was also once offered $75,000 by an American producer named Cedric to shoot a porn film with Indian models, the porn industry is pan-India, with behind-the-scenes producers operating from Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, and ""especially the south"".

But TRAI bans websites with pornographic content that are hosted on Indian domains -- so where does one upload these films?

According to Sameer, a Chennai-based filmographer who acts as the logistical matchmaker between a porn producer and a model in south India, Indians have found a way to circumvent even that obstacle. ""Everything is uploaded on Twitter, Tumblr and xvideos,"" he told ThePrint. When asked what happens in these movies, he said, ""Direct sex.""

South India is where the money is, added Juneja, because actors are easier to source, more willing to take risk on screen, and ""less likely to throw tantrums or be afraid of backlash from society"".

Sameer said at least a hundred such movies are produced monthly in the south, with actors getting paid up to Rs 50,000 per movie. The films are usually 50 minutes long and the whole production costs between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh.

However, much of Indian porn is defined by hand-held cameras, mobile phones balanced against a wall, mirrors, and low resolution, which doesn't seem to be satisfying viewers increasingly seeking out high-definition content.

According to the Pornhub report, 'HD' or 'high-definition' emerged as a popular keyword in searches keyed in by Indians.

In response to a report on ThePrint about the Pornhub review, a Reddit user claimed he had been ""looking for Desi HD for about ten years. It's just not there"".

""The best you get is a guy/gal with a good mobile phone,"" he wrote.

Everything apart, experts and insiders say the consequences of an underground industry can be severe. Informal productions don't entitle actors to health check-ups, salary standards, or protection from exploitation.

Even someone like Shais, who says that his years in the sex industry had forced him to develop a thick skin, knows everyone cannot be trusted.

He recalls paying a friend Rs 30,000 for a film he was told would be shot with good equipment.

But a few days after the payment, the friend disappeared. His phone was switched off and the money was gone.

Chief minister H D Kumaraswamy has already announced in the budget speech that English will be introduced as a medium of instruction in 1000 schools from the next academic year. His decision has led to a huge backlash from Kannada activists, who have expressed fears that it will deprive the children knowledge of the local language.

After several prominent Kannada activists and other public personalities met him and requested that he reconsider, Kumaraswamy reluctantly agreed to put the decision on hold till a wider consultation is over.

Now former chief minister and Congress legislative party leader Siddaramaiah has reopened the debate by wading into the sensitive and controversial issue.

On Thursday, he attacked Kumaraswamy for his inflexible attitude towards Kannada and demanded that the proposal to make English the medium of instruction be dropped immediately.

Speaking to News18, he said, ""The primacy of Kannada in Karnataka is non-negotiable. Kannada is everything in Karnataka. I won't allow English medium primary schools run by the government. I will speak to the chief minister"".

A day later on Friday, the chief minister's elder brother and PWD minister HD Revanna hit back at Siddaramaiah, and defending the introduction of English in government-run schools.

Revanna said that English was the need of the hour and a global necessity. ""The knowledge of English is important. It helps our rural and poor children to compete with city children. They can get better jobs, can go abroad and it will be good for all in the long run. If the government introduces English medium in schools, poor parents don't need to pay exorbitant fees at private schools,"" he said.

He also lashed out at the Kannada activists for their hypocrisy. ""The same people send their children and grandchildren to English medium schools. They oppose when the government introduces English as a medium for the benefit of the poor and village children"".

Some Kannada activists clarified that they are not against teaching English as one of the subjects from the first standard and their opposition is only to introducing English as a medium of instruction. In their defence, they cite the Supreme Court judgment in favour of primary education in the mother tongue of the child.

Siddaramaiah, who is a fierce defendant of Kannada language and culture, is unlikely to change his stand and it may worsen the already strained relationship between him and Kumaraswamy.

According to JDS leaders, Kumaraswamy has taken it as a matter of prestige and not willing to drop the proposal.

The main opposition BJP is also opposing the move. Former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa told News18 that he was for teaching English as one of the subjects in primary schools and not in favour of English medium government schools."

While its order was recently modified, police in Uttar Pradesh's Noida deserves a pat on the back for its bold step in preventing Friday prayers held at public parks without proper permissions. As expected, the order to industrial units in Sector 58, Noida sparked a debate, but one hoped that the move would lead to a course correction - and curb many of the ills arising from such anomalies.

Noida police's notice to industrial units within its jurisdiction said they must inform employees that they must avoid using public parks in their vicinity for religious purposes. It specifically referred to Friday prayers. The notice created a stir, with political parties and leaders promptly jumping on the bandwagon and effectively turning it into a controversy. The district magistrate and police later said that firms were not liable for public namaz by staff after the backlash.

Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ajay Pal Sharma had supported the order to disallow Friday prayers in the park as not being discriminatory against any particular community. He clarified that the permission to hold namaz was not granted by the district magistrate and that the police officials were merely conveying the decision to those who had congregated at the park: ""As per the Supreme Court order in 2009, to hold any religious ceremony in public place, it is essential to seek permission from the police and administration. There was no mala fide intention in the notice and the police officers were doing their duty, following the orders of the SC.""

Also read: The namaz and its significance to the Muslim community

Gautam Buddh Nagar district magistrate BN Singh while upholding the order concurred with the action of the police saying they were doing their duty.

While the order prohibited any religious activity at public parks, it did not discriminate among religions nor did it favour one religious activity over another. The order further stated that the Friday prayers are being offered without permission, in spite of the SHO specifically objecting to such activity.

All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi lashed out at Noida police and accused them of hypocrisy. Now, if the police issues a letter in the course of performing its duty in maintaining law and order, is it hypocrisy?

India is probably the only non-Islamic country where not only Muslims but also any other religious denomination can carry out their respective religious activity anywhere with, or many a time without, permission. Many instances of Friday namaz being offered on railway platforms, busy streets, airports and public parks have been reported. Such congregations greatly obstruct ordinary activities, and the free movement of people and vehicles. But owing to the secular nature of the majority of citizens, such congregations have been tolerated and, many a time, facilitated.

It is nobody's argument that there should be a blanket ban on Friday prayers. It cannot be sanctioned by the government, the courts or any other authority. It is a fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution. But all communities should remember that their religious rituals -- a part of their rights -- come with a corresponding duty.

Unfortunately, we have practically no institution that teaches civic duties and courtesies to citizens. The civics class in schools is generally dismissed as unnecessary and considered expendable. Many of our cities do not even have a provision for open parks where children can play or senior citizens can move around.

Our city planners pass building plans but seem to be lacking knowledge about free spaces and footpaths. Many of our footpaths are either illegally occupied by vendors or unusable. The same is true for places of worship. If the authorities do not want citizens to construct illegal structures as per their convenience, they must provide such avenues.

Also read: Politics over namaz inside historic Taj mosque likely to survive beyond 2019

The issue of using (or misusing) public places for religious activity is not limited to just one community or to the Friday prayers. Overnight jagrans or the construction of shamianas also require police permission -- usually accompanied by a fee, however nominal.

Industrial parks and units should follow international norms and provide separate areas for prayer along the lines of airports, which have segregated areas for smoking et al.

Given the tendency among a section of the business community to look at these facilities as a drain on investments, the government can consider tax rebates on such provisions and make them mandatory in building laws.

In any case, accusing the police of discriminating against a particular community and functioning with mala fide intention will only result in lowering its morale and directly interfere in its duties. While political parties should strictly desist from using this as an electoral issue to reach out to their vote banks, community leaders should also educate the faithful that religious freedom and duties as citizens are two sides of the same coin.

The civil supplies department, set up in 1918 when thousands of people fell victim to frequent episodes of famine, completed 100 years in August. The landmark event, though, went completely unnoticed. There were occasions when several pockets of princely Hyderabad state ran out of food stocks. Rice supplies, then, were rationed at 50 grams per head per day and it was increased to 100 grams only in 1950.

The pandemic flu of 1918 resulted in the decline of Hyderabad city population by 9.4% -- the population of Hyderabad state in the 1921 census was lower than that of 1911. There were more deaths than births and the decadal population dropped from 1.33 crore in 1911 to 1.24 crore in 1921. The flu which struck in September 1918 killed 46.5 people per 1000 that month and the death toll increased rapidly to 464 deaths per 1000 by Octoberend. Two per cent (3.50 lakh) of Hyderabad's population had been wiped out within a month.

2018 was also the year when the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), set up as Beri-Beri Enquiry Unit at Coonoor in Tamil Nadu, turned

100. It was shifted to Hyderabad in 1958.

Also completing a century was the Hyderabad Currency Act 1918 which introduced paper money for the first time. Earlier, only coins were in use. The Act came into force on June 4, 1918.

The Osmania University was also set up in 1918 though the institute celebrated the centenary in 2017.

While exams went online, campuses erupted with unrest and agitation

From reforms to resentment, 2018 was a mixed bag for students and parents. After almost two decades since its inception, common entrance tests such as Eamcet, ICET among others went online for those seeking admission to various professional courses.

In a major development, Telangana joined the national pool for medical courses by earmarking 15% of MBBS seats and 50% of postgraduate medical seats to students from other states.

What rocked Hyderabad this year was a string of student protests reported from top institutions such as Birla Institute of Technology Science, Tata Institute of Social Science, apart from other engineering colleges such as Vasavi College of Engineering, Chaitanya Bharati Institute of Technology etc. Their demands ranged from fee regulation to continuation of courses.

Those in school found no respite from the spiralling fee structure as the state government for the first time ordered school managements to maintain status-quo on the fee hike and issued an admission notification. Subsequently, on January 22, the Hyderabad High Court issued an interim order allowing schools to hike fee, leaving parents fuming. It was only closer to the end of year that the Delhi Public School, Mahendra Hills, decision to slash fee by 50% brought them some hope.

Apart from fees, two alleged cases of sexual abuse of primary students reported from a private school in Tolichowki, added to the angst of parents who demanded better surveillance in educational institutions.

City set to get an AIIMS, but will H1N1 deaths stop?

Right at the beginning, the government found itself in a spot with maternal deaths showing a three-fold jump since 2016-2017.

The core Hyderabad district itself reported as many as 105 maternal deaths compared to just 31 in 2017.

A worried healthcare department put all heads together and managed to bring things under control by strengthening government hospitals and introducing several health schemes, including KCR Kits, where pregnant women were given financial assistance in instalments towards the end of the year.

Fee regulation among several other issues triggered protests from students at top institutes such as TISS, BITS and many others

The maternal mortality rate (MMR) now stands at 70 female deaths per 100,000 live births. But right through the year, the government struggled to contain the deadly swine flu (H1N1) virus, with 154 deaths officially recorded till October this year and with 90% cases reported in Hyderabad city itself. If the battle to control the mutated virus was an uphill task, the dengue virus with 2,700 deaths and malaria with 1,500 deaths, underscored the government's failure to tackle diseases in Hyderabad. The health department also struggled to create more jobs and depute doctors and other necessary staff to rural areas, forcing patients to flock to Hyderabad's hospitals.

On a positive note, the decision to renovate the heritage block of the iconic Osmania General Hospital and build a new hospital premises, came as a welcome move. On December 20, Telangana received happy tidings, when the Union cabinet finally clearing the decks for the establishment of a new All India Institute for Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bibinagar, at a cost of Rs 1,028 crore. The new prestigious facility spread over 200 acres will also have 100 MBBS seats.

Just last week, Ajit Ranade, noted economist, went on record stating, ""A global slowdown might be inevitable.""

Part of the reason could be the United States. As Ranade points out, the trade wars triggered by that country has made markets nervous. In February, there was a huge selloff and sharply increased volatility. The Morgan Stanley Capital Index (MSCI) dropped by US$ 3 trillion dollars.

That caused currencies to take a big hit. Currencies of Argentina, Turkey, Indonesia and South Africa (even India) were badly affected.

Bright and the dark sides

But India still may not be so badly hurt because of two reasons. The price of oil, unexpectedly, has started to slip. That gives India some breathing space.

Moreover, as Ranade rightly states, the monthly inflow of domestic investors into the stock market, thanks to schemes like monthly Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are now close to a healthy Rs 10,000 crore. They can now offset the sudden exit of foreign money.

But there are some nasty clouds that India will have to reckon with in the coming year.

First, the desperate need to create jobs. India has failed miserably on this front.

Second, the urgent need to bring in foreign direct investments (FDI). Without it, fresh investments in infrastructure might not take place. Already some of the bids for roadways had to be recast, and offered for rebidding, because there weren't any takers. Without such investments, job formation will continue to remain grim.

Many countries have slowed down their fresh FDI into India because of the government's refusal to give a clear response on dispute redressal. It does not want investors to take recourse to arbitration outside India (because the Supreme Court has already decreed that awards by arbitration tribunals from seats outside India cannot be reopened by Indian courts. But it is equally unwilling to give the same guarantee for the Indian arbitration centres. This is bad because the government itself is the biggest litigant in courts.

Third, expect government spending to slow down in the months following the elections. This has been the pattern for most general elections (see chart). Governments splurge money before the elections to woo an electorate. After elections, spending slows down. Except, this time, the expenditure slowdown will occur even as the global economy will slow down.

With little FDI, and the possibility of exports slowing down because of trade wars, India could face exceedingly painful times.

Unless. . . . .

Solution 1 - India should learn from Iran

There is a key lesson that India could learn from Iran. When Iran was in trouble, with little job formation, US sanctions, and little education, it needed to ensure that it could create jobs. One of its strategies was to build affordable houses - minimum area 800 square feet). After all, cement, land and steel were available domestically. Labour was homegrown. This activity needed little foreign exchange. India should do the same thing.

But to make it succeed, two things must happen. First, zero tolerance for any slums. That will make potential slum dwellers purchase houses rather than angling for free politically-backed housing on usurped land.

Second, the government must build at least 2 million houses (or more) each year. The demand exceeds 20 million homes (see chart). These figures were compiled in 2012. They should have increased by 25 percent at least since then.

If you build just merely 50,000 houses, you will get a black market. That is what happens when demand outstrips supply. That is bad for the country, bad for values, bad for people. Large numbers will create jobs; will create hopes for countless millions in India. The demand for housing will create jobs; that will create purchasing power; that will create more investments and more jobs. The virtuous cycle could get kick-started.

India can escape the paucity of foreign capital. It can create jobs for those not well skilled. The new roads built by the ministry of Nitin Gadkari will make commutes easier.

Solution 2 - there's nothing like the sun

As this author has pointed out earlier, India is blessed with lots of people and lots of sunshine. The government should make use of that. To understand its potential, one should look at Germany.

When the late Hermann Scheer, then energy minister of Germany, introduced rooftop solar in his country, he knew that most people would not bother to put up solar panels even though they were environmentally friendly. So he offered them the opportunity of letting the state put it up. Moreover, people could use the solar power generated free of cost. Whatever power was not used, they could sell it to an agency which would pay them for it. Thus the house owner would get some free electricity, and also payment for the electricity he did not use. The plan worked, and many houses opted for rooftop solar.

To make this work, Scheer created a layer of people who would install the solar, maintain it, set up bidirectional meters that would measure the amount of electricity sold to the agency. The agency, which was part of the layer that Scheer created, would clean the intermittent power from solar rooftops, aggregate it from hundreds of houses, and then sell it to the national grid for a price. The government subsidised the price.

Today, if solar prices have fallen, it is because of the market Germany created and showed the world how to create it. The Chinese saw a business opportunity and built capacities to meet this soaring demand. Together, they ensured that the price of solar panels fell from $3.50 per peak Watt in 2006 to under 30 cents currently (and the price keeps falling).

But what Scheer had not reckoned with, and what he discovered was that in eight years' time the middle layer employed more and more people - installers, cleaners, engineers, and more. By 2008, this middle layer accounted for more jobs than the legendary German auto industry.

This is a big lesson for India. India has more sunlight than Germany, and many more people - hence many more houses and rooftops. What India should be focussing on is the creation of middle layers in the form of decentralised cluster power generation and distribution centres. If huts don't have a good roof, just use a pole and put a solar panel atop it. But it must be done by the private sector, which will ensure that assets don't get misused or stolen.

Our reckoning is that this could create over 80 million jobs within two years (see table). But to make this work, the power to villages must go through he decentralised cluster mode run by private entrepreneurs. Each entrepreneur, in order to boost power consumption, would encourage rural folk to consume more power for business or lifestyle or both. That would create jobs, boost economic activity in rural areas, and generate wealth.

It would also reduce India's fuel import bills. It would provide electricity to the remotest village, and it would prevent energy theft that state grids are notorious for.

Other options

There are other things that the government could do. Promote tourism - but that also means reducing bureaucracy, sharp practices by agents, better hotels and toilets, and promoting a sense of security.

India could harness its methane potential, that could almost entirely eliminate the country's fuel import bill.

India needs to de-licence education, and focus only on the quality of output, instead of licensing schools and medical colleges. If India does not provide for a good education, the country's future is blighted.

It needs to focus on healthcare. Ayushman Bharat is only the first step. It will be painful for the middle class, as resources get diverted to the economically poor. But expanding effectively and reasonably priced medicare is crucially important. Remember, India's score on the World Bank's Human Capital Index is terrible.

India could focus on encouraging investments from China which has shown a huge investment appetite in the country - disregardful of the arbitration imbroglio or other irritants. India should carefully structure deals so that both countries benefit.

The centre of gravity for economic activity is shifting to Russia, China and India. If harnessed well, these trends could help India ride the tide.

Maybe, it will be a wonderful new year. But will the government (whichever one it might be) be willing to embrace this vision?

""The concerned school administration shall be held responsible for non-compliance of directions by the school vans/cabs being used to ferry students of their schools, especially in cases where such vehicles (owned by schools or hired by parents) meet with accidents resulting in injury or death of the school children. The necessary action shall also be taken against the defaulting schools in case such an unfortunate accident happens,"" Goel said in the circular.

The move comes a month after an eight-year-old student of a private school was killed and nine other children were injured when a speeding goods carrier hit an overloaded private school van in north Delhi's Dheerpur. The incident had prompted the Delhi government to ask the transport department to formulate a fresh school cab policy by January 2019.

As per the Supreme Court guidelines, school vehicles should follow several norms -- such as having 'on school duty' written prominently on the back and the front, horizontal grilles on windows, first-aid boxes, fire extinguishers, reliable locks, experienced drivers and at least one conductor. The speed of the vehicle should not exceed 50km/h.

Meanwhile, the committee of private recognised and unaided schools in Delhi termed the government's order as 'impractical'.

""How is it even possible for the schools to monitor thousands of private vehicles ferrying students across the city. We take complete responsibility of children at the school campuses. But how can we keep a tab on all the modes of transport parents are choosing over school vans. We are going to oppose this rule and demand the government to withdraw it immediately,"" said SK Bhattacharya, president of the committee. He demanded similar order be issued for government schools as well."

The high court has posted further hearing in the second week of January.

The PIL has claimed that the state government did not spend a single paise from over Rs 47-crore fund disbursed by the Centre for the setting up such shelters since March 2017.

On the other hand, for the urban homeless, the state has 101 night shelters that can house only 6,430 people, whereas the Justice Kailash Gambhir committee report revealed that there were 84,822 homeless people in urban Gujarat. The petitioner also placed reports about night shelters which revealed poor quality of infrastructure.

Petitioner's advocate K R Koshti demanded that the government be directed to create enough number of night shelters for all homeless.

He submitted that in absence of adequate space in night shelters, the government should be asked to make suitable arrangements for the homeless for stay in various public buildings such as government and corporation-run schools, community halls during winter.

The authorities should be asked to make efforts to provide existing shelters with facilities of ventilated rooms, water arrangements, sanitation, standard lighting, fire protection measures, first aid kit, regular cleaning of blankets and mattresses, cooking space and linking such shelters with the nearest anganwadi centres.

To make the government more accountable, the PIL has demanded creation of web portal displaying information about all night shelters, whether they are covered under the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM)."

(Image for representation only). From fuelling domestic violence and poverty to lining the pockets of criminals, Albania's love of gambling has spawned a scourge of social ills in one of Europe's poorest countries.

But at the start of 2019, the Balkan state is taking a nationwide resolution to break the addiction in hopes of curbing suffering that has consumed many families.

On January 1 a law will go into effect shuttering the 4,300 betting venues that have cropped up on nearly every street corner in the country of 2.8 million people.

It is an ""extremely high"" ratio of one shop per 670 people, far above that seen in both neighbouring Balkan states and more developed Western European countries, says economist Klodian Tomorri.

The betting blackout will also outlaw online gambling and restrict casinos -- some of which are currently near schools -- to five-star hotels in licensed tourist resorts.

For people like Arta, a 31-year-old mother of two, the move is welcome although it comes too late to shield her own family from a devastating loss.

Last July her husband leapt off a building after betting for the losing team in Belgium-France football match, she recalls with tears and trembling hands.

""He bet on Belgium, but in fact, what he got was misery,"" said Arta, who is now relying on around 100 euros of monthly state aid to raise her young kids.

According to a study by the University of Tirana, one out of four gamblers have attempted suicide at least once.

Another 70 percent have struggled with stress and psychological problems.

""We also found a close link between domestic violence and gambling, which has led many families to experience very serious crises,"" said Iris Luarasi, who runs a counselling line for victims of violence.

Ilir Musta, a heavyset 35-year-old man, experienced that type of family catastrophe first hand.

""I don't know how to get out of this, please help me,"" he recently told a doctor in Tirana, where he was seeking help for anxiety.

""The game was good at first, but now it's a cancer. I lost my life, my wife, my daughter, I'm a living dead,"" added Ilir, speaking in a shaky voice as his eyes darted around the room.

He started betting on sports just two years ago, convinced he was on the verge of making a fortune.

But instead he found himself drowning in debt and ended up in prison for violently beating his wife after she asked for a divorce.

There are scores of other families who have been ruptured by the destructive addiction.

According to Tirana lawyer Vjollca Pustina, some 70 percent of divorce cases brought to court in the capital this year have been linked to gambling.

The government says rehabilitation centres will be opened to help gamblers who will be forced to quit cold turkey.

But there is concern that the centres will not be ready soon enough.

""Gambling addiction is a disease and must be managed once the betting rooms are closed for players, but for the moment rehabilitation centres are completely missing,"" said Menada Petro, professor of social sciences at the University of Durres.

The industry has also been criticised for draining money from families in a country where the average monthly salary is below 300 euros ($342).

According to official figures, Albanians spend some 140 to 150 million euros ($170 million) on sports betting annually, which amounts to 70 percent of what the average family spends on healthcare.

But when accounting for illegal betting, the real figure is estimated to be around 700 million euros ($798 million), according to the government.

For Socialist Prime Minister Edi Rama, another core goal is cutting off a cash flow for organised crime groups who profit from the industry and use it to launder money.

But he admits that the new law will not end the fight against gangs, a key task for a government that wants to kickstart EU accession talks.

""The war will continue as criminals change their skin and strategy,"" Rama said in a recent TV interview.

Some betting shops already closed in December while others are trying to profit from a final year-end rush, said Artan Shyti, president of the Federation of Albanian Betting Companies.

The next battle will be controlling illegal venues, especially online.

Betting firms ""have started to move to Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo where they already have their subsidiaries and can operate quietly (online),"" Shyti told AFP.

Albania tried to reduce the number of betting clubs in 2013, but politics and special interests got in the way.

Now the new law, passed in October, will put some 8,000 people out of work.

""The authorities have allowed (this industry to grow) and now they are forcing us to suddenly close our business without distinguishing between clean and dirty (operations),"" says Arjan Gumi, 47, who has run small betting club in Tirana for 16 years.

He says he doesn't yet know what to do next and is hoping the government follows through on a promise to assist the unemployed.

""It is tragic for our families too,"" he added."

The Gujarat High Court on Thursday sought a reply from the state government and municipal commissioners of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vado-dara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Junagadh, Jamnagar, and Gandhinagar, after public interest litigation (PIL) questioning the poor infrastructure in the state for the urban homeless came up for hearing.

A PIL, filed by Vishwas Bhamburkar, was taken up by the division bench of Acting Chief Justice AS Dave and Justice Biren Vaishnav. The bench directed the authorities to file their reply by January 8. Citing the report submitted by Justice Kailash Gambhir committee to the Supreme Court, the petitioner claimed that the population of urban homeless in the state is around 84,822 out of the total population of 6.25 crore.

He argued that despite the considerably high number of urban homeless in the state, there are only 101 urban shelters for the homeless having a capacity to accommodate just 6,430 persons.

He claimed that the remaining 78,392 urban homeless persons are forced to live on streets and footpaths and are in great danger of losing their lives in this extremely cold weather.

Bhamburkar has also argued before the court that despite there being a clear shortage of shelter homes, the state government is sitting idle on Rs 47.85 crore available for the purpose under central schemes. He also claimed that many of the municipal corporations in the state are devoid of any infrastructure for urban homeless in clear violation of central guidelines.

While providing details of each city, the petitioner claimed that the population of urban homeless in the city of Ahmedabad is around 12,318 and the number of shelters in the city is around 46, having a capacity to accommodate just 2,840 persons. Similarly, the population of urban homeless in Surat is around 36,144 and the number of shelters in the city is around 27, having a capacity to accommodate mere 1,278 persons. The petitioner has also claimed that many of the shelter homes in cities across the state have been shut down, but are still shown on the record.

Bhamburkar has prayed to the court to direct the state government to construct adequate facilities for the urban homeless; carry out an independent survey for their identification; and allow them to stay in public buildings such as government schools and community halls during winter, among others."

""This year, we have decided to scale up police presence at least 10 times than what it was. So far, additional police personnel from Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur have been brought in to help Pune rural police. Apart from that, police from other districts will also be deployed at the site on January 1. We will also be deploying quick response teams and rapid action force to deal with emergency situations,"" said an officer from Pune rural police.

In the backdrop of the January 1 clashes around the memorial Victory Pillar at Koregaon-Bhima which claimed one life and sparked statewide protests, the police have decided to oversee every tiny arrangement, right from deciding parking areas and planning visitor movement till setting up of refreshment stalls.

""We will not be allowing any vehicle to come near the victory pillar. Parking for all vehicles will be made at least five kilometre from the pillar. We will not allow anyone to hold a public rally anywhere near the pillar,"" Superintendent of Police (Pune Rural) Sandip Patil told DNA.

""We will ply government buses from parking areas to the victory pillar to transport visitors. We are also seeking cooperation from local villagers who have allowed use of their open areas as parking bays,"" Patil added.

The authorities have taken adequate precautions to ensure normal life continues in villages around the pillar. But considering that thousands of visitors gather at the site annually in remembrance of the lives lost, the police are not taking chances and are closely monitoring activities at ground zero and its surrounds.

Officials from Pune district administration told DNA that the district collector had approached the Bombay High Court with a request to take control of the area around the pillar, which is disputed land. After the court granted the permission, the police and administrative officials have begun preparation for the event.

The Pune rural police and the district administration have also been working hard to bring harmony between the two communities who were at loggerheads on January 1.

""We realised the best way to bring peace was through harmony between the villagers and visitors. Therefore, we held a number of meetings with the villagers and convinced them to keep their shops open on January 1 so visitors do not face inconvenience,"" SP Patil said.

The police also met village heads such as sarpanch and deputy sarpanch and convinced them to welcome visitors with roses and arrange for drinking water. ""We have shot small videos of prominent personalities from nearby villages who are appealing visitors to visit the victory pillar. They are assuring them of safety,"" SP Patil said.

Ravindra Kandh, deputy Sarpanch of the neighbouring Loni Kand village, said, ""We have also made food arrangements for nearly 5,000 people.

The year began on a positive note with the government promising to draft non-governmental organisations and corporate houses into helping upgrade facilities in its schools. It maintained the momentum with a promise to enable 381 schools with wi-fi in March.

The introduction of QR codes in textbooks under the new syllabus was a hit with students who enjoyed the freedom of learning at their own pace.

The low point was when School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan announced at a meeting in December that the government was considering curtailing the syllabus as teachers were finding it difficult to complete. Incidentally, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has also suggested a reduction in the NCERT syllabus for Central Board of Secondary Education schools.

Though no final decision has been made yet, educationists wonder if all the good work done over the last two years will come undone if the State and Centre decide against the continuation of the present syllabus. It was not a great year though for higher education. Vice-chancellor appointments in State universities generated a lot of controversy with political parties venting their displeasure.

Corruption, allegations of favours to students in exchange for being pliant, searches by the Directorate of Anti-Vigilance and Corruption officials in houses and offices of V-Cs made headlines.

In February, the DVAC trapped Bharathiar University V-C A. Ganapathy, rendering the institute headless. In March, Anna University's former V-C M. Rajaram faced charges of corruption in the recruitment of teachers. The University was in the eye of the storm with several officials being accused of taking money and helping students pass exams.

In April, a scandal rocked the State with the leak of audio tapes of a college teacher urging students to do as expected by ""higher officials of the Madurai Kamaraj University"" in return for higher marks in their semester examinations, money and admission to higher-level courses in the university.

Political parties continued to target Governor-Chancellor Banwarilal Purohit and alleged that he had received favours in return for appointments. They objected to the appointment of candidates from other States as Vice-Chancellors to Dr. Ambedkar Law University and Anna University.

The situation became tense with MKU V-C P.P. Chellathurai seeking legal intervention. In June, the court threw out his appointment, leaving the University without a V-C, in less than a year since his appointment.

The situation has improved with the V-C search committee finalising a list of 10 persons for the post. In a couple of days the Governor is expected to announce a new V-C for MKU."

A High Court bench issued a show cause notice to the managing societies of three schools asking why it should not order appropriate action against them, following a petition challenging their change of name mid-year from Presidium to Prudence.

In mid-November, The Indian Express had reported that three schools under the prominent Presidium franchise informed parents that they had chosen to disassociate from it due to financial irregularities. They stated that they would be known as 'Prudence' schools under the chairmanship of G S Matharoo, who was part of the management team of Presidium group.

The plea alleged the name change was done without following due process and that it jeopardised the future of students by running the risk of de-recognition by CBSE.

The parents have petitioned against the management societies of all three schools -- in Ashok Vihar, Dwarka Sector 16 and Dwarka Sector 22 -- stating that the name change had been affected in the middle of the academic year without prior notification or consultation with them.

In November, Education Minister Manish Sisodia had told The Indian Express that while a school cannot be compelled to remain part of a franchise, it requires government approval to do so and that no prior application had been received from the three schools.

The Prudence schools are now operating with a new logo, signboards, ID cards and uniforms. According to Matharoo, the change was instituted keeping the best interests of students in mind. He said the schools would file their response in court: ""Only the name has been changed, which was done through unanimous resolutions of all three managing societies due to financial malpractices by Presidium. Everything else remains the same... We submitted our proposal for name change to the Directorate of Education soon after the circular was sent to parents, and the proposal is currently being processed.""

The press conference by the four judges set the wheels of change in motion, according to Justice Joseph.

Aashish Aryan reports.

On the bright sunny morning of January 12, four senior Supreme Court judges held an unprecedented press conference and expressed their concerns about the professional conduct of the then Chief Justice of India, Justice Dipak Misra, over the assignment of cases.

In the virtual revolt against the CJI, Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur, and Kurien Joseph questioned the system and said that a skewed allocation of cases was impacting justice delivery adversely.

The four judges had then repeatedly said that despite their best efforts to reach out to Justice Misra, there had been no response from him, which left them with no option but to come face to face with the nation (via the press).

Of the four, Justice Chelameswar and Justice Joseph have already retired since, Justice Lokur will relinquish his post by the month end.

Justice Gogoi is the incumbent CJI.

The press conference by the four judges set the wheels of change in motion, according to Justice Joseph.

Addressing reporters after his retirement, Justice Joseph said he had no regrets about the press conference.

He also expected Justice Gogoi to steer the ship more effectively.

Some legislators thought the judicial rebels had done the right thing, raising issues that were critical to functioning of this vital institution of democracy.

How far the political dispensation will respect the spirit of that revolt is another question.

#2 The landmark Aadhaar verdict Illustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com

But the Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar will continue to be mandatory for State-sponsored welfare schemes and will need to be linked to the permanent account numbers for income tax purposes.

Udit Misra reports.

After a nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in 2017 that the Right to Privacy was indeed a Fundamental Right under the Indian Constitution, all eyes were on the five-judge Bench of the apex court adjudicating on not only the legal validity of Aadhaar but also its usage.

Indeed, it was the Aadhaar case that required clarity on the Right to Privacy in the first place.

The apex court delivered an interim order in March and a full one in September.

While the court upheld the validity of the Aadhaar Act, albeit by a four-to-one majority, it severely restricted the parameters for its use.

Thus, starkly in contrast to the coercive annoyance that Aadhaar had become over the years -- with it becoming a pre-condition for everything from mobile services to banking to health care to monthly food rations -- its use has now become voluntary.

But the court ruled that Aadhaar will continue to be mandatory for State-sponsored welfare schemes and will need to be linked to the permanent account numbers for income tax purposes.

#3 IIMs and the autonomy mirage IMAGE: The Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad. Photograph: Kind courtesy IIM-A

2018 was a landmark year for the premier B-schools even as it ushered in a new era with the promulgation of the IIM Act.

Vinay Umarji reports.

Not since Infosys co-founder and former Indian Institute of Management- Ahmedabad board chairman N R Narayana Murthy took on then Union minister of human resource development Murli Manohar Joshi over the latter's decision to slash fees have IIMs seen such a prolonged fight for autonomy.

In that sense, 2018 was a landmark year for the premier B-schools even as it ushered in a new era with the promulgation of the IIM Act.

At first, IIMs welcomed the freedom to appoint chairpersons and directors in place of the earlier cumbersome process that required government approval.

However, the year saw IIMs raising other issues that not only threatened their autonomy but also increased administrative woes for them.

For instance, under the Act, IIMs can offer PhD as against the previous fellow doctoral programmes.

However, the government narrowed eligibility criteria by increasing the cut-off to 80 per cent from the 60 per cent for four-year undergraduate applicants.

IIMs say this would reduce the available pool of candidates, apart from reducing course work in doctoral programmes from two years to six months.

Further, the one-year post graduate programmes for executives with prior work experience of at least 5 to 7 years are set to be converted into two-year MBAs under the Act.

This too, IIMs believe, would lower standards and defeat the purpose of conducting one-year MBAs for working professionals.

The year ended with directors of all IIMs and the ministry discussing these issues via video conference in the second week of December 2018.

The ball now rests in the ministry's court.

#4 Volatile year for Indian currency Photograph: Francis Mascarenhas/Reuters

The rupee has now strengthened back to below 72 a dollar as oil eased to less than $60 a barrel.

Anup Roy reports.

2018 was a volatile one for the rupee as oil prices started rising and trade war concerns between US and China kept emerging market currencies on tenterhooks.

The partially convertible currency started the year at 63.7 a dollar, but trade war tensions, leading to currency war concerns, started pulling it down rapidly in the first half of the year.

The central bank tried to defend the currency till its previous record low of 68.85 a dollar.

However, once the currency crossed 70, the central bank maintained a hands-off approach to protect its reserves.

The movement accelerated in August when oil prices also started climbing up to cross $70 a barrel on concerns about US sanctions.

It was pretty evident after that that the central bank won't protect a level.

Two back-to-back rate hikes by the RBI by August, seen as a measure to protect the currency, were unable to stabilise the rupee, and by September, it had closed at its life-time low of 74.4 a dollar as oil crossed $85 a barrel.

The rupee has now strengthened back to below 72 a dollar, as oil eased to less than $60 a barrel.

But observers say the local currency's new level would continue to be 70 a dollar-plus.

#5 India's exports grow in 2018 Photograph: Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters

Despite reports of crippling capital inadequacy in the wake of the new Goods and Services Tax regime, double-digit export growth continued for half of the year.

Subhayan Chakraborty reports.

Despite a global trade war, India managed to grow its exports in 2018 but high crude prices and rising domestic demand continued to inflate the trade deficit at a faster rate.

The year started with monthly trade deficit soaring to a 56-month high.

By October, it had risen to more than $153 billion.

Despite reports of crippling capital inadequacy in the wake of the new Goods and Services Tax regime, double-digit export growth continued for half of the year.

On the other hand, imports also shot up as volatile crude prices made a comeback to haunt policymakers after a year of relative ease.

India's current account deficit is expected to triple to $19 billion to $21 billion in Q2 of FY19, or about 3 per cent of the GDP, from the modest $7 billion in Q2 last fiscal year, economists predict.

As a result, the government placed import restrictions and raised inbound duties on six separate occasions for hundreds of products including textile inputs, steel, mobile phones and solar panels, among others.

The move was strongly criticised for raising protectionist barriers at a time when economic growth was tepid.

But India managed to navigate through a field of tariff landmines as a trade war between the United States and China heated up throughout the year.

New Delhi countered threats by the Donald J Trump administration to cut market access for Indian goods by entering protracted negotiations with the US, that continue at the time of writing.

#6 GST and the problems aplenty Illustration: Dominic Xavier/Rediff.com

While monthly collections have crossed the Rs 1 trillion mark twice in the current year, they remain well below the desired monthly run rate.

Ishan Bakshi reports.

Even a year-and-a-half after its launch, the goods and service tax regime continues to pose grave problems for the central government's fiscal maths.

While monthly collections have crossed the Rs 1 trillion mark twice in the current year, they remain well below the desired monthly run rate.

This is despite the number of returns filed rising to 6.96 million in October, up from 6.75 million in September.

On its part, the government had hoped that compliance under the new indirect tax regime would improve with the introduction of the e-way bill.

However, data on Integrated GST domestic collections does not suggest a sustained increase in tax collections.

For the government to meet the budgeted indirect tax target, collections would have to rise to Rs 1.33 trillion per month for the rest of the current financial year, says a report by Kotak Institutional Equities.

Part of the shortfall could be plugged by distributing the unallocated portion of the GST compensation cess between the central and state governments.

Or, the Centre could hold onto IGST collections.

Despite this, the Centre is staring at a huge gap in indirect tax collections, which the report pegs at Rs 800 billion to Rs 900 billion.

#7 India's targets on climate change, Katowice and Paris Agreement IMAGE: Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi with French President Emmanuel Macron. Photograph: @MEAIndia/Twitter

It took collective pressure from all developing countries, including India, to ensure the rulebook adheres to the letter of the agreement even if it did not stay entirely loyal to its spirit.

Nitin Sethi reports.

India finalised a report noting that it was well on the way to meeting two of its three targets under the first phase of the Paris Agreement.

Soon after, the Katowice climate change negotiations ended with a rulebook to the Paris Agreement.

It took collective pressure from all developing countries, including India, to ensure the rulebook adheres to the letter of the agreement even if it did not stay entirely loyal to its spirit.

For instance, the rules eroded the difference between developing and developed countries to a layer deeper than the agreement had rendered.

With the Paris Agreement itself pared down to let countries largely self-determine how much heft they should put behind the collective fight against climate change, the rules were not expected to deliver more.

But Katowice did deliver a set of rules that will monitor countries deeply for their delivery against the nationally-determined actions, particularly on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Countries could not, however, agree to the rules for the operation of the global market for trading in greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement.

Developed countries wanted developing countries not to take credit for the emissions they trade in.

Developing countries wanted the rich nations not to get to harvest the low-hanging cheaper emission reduction targets only to their account, leaving the poorer nations with heavy bills for technology in emission reductions.

The rules for the market mechanism were deferred to 2019, or perhaps 2020, just before the Paris Agreement gets implemented, starting 2021.

Next year will also witness a summit organised by the UN Secretary General, who has put his weight behind pushing countries to enhance their targets even before the agreement kicks off.

#8 Did Modi govt achieve the target in job creation? Illustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com

The controversy over job creation data is becoming as serious an issue as job creation itself.

Somesh Jha reports.

Until last year, official and private estimates painted a grim picture of job creation -- a key election promise of Narendra Damodardas Modi on the campaign trail in 2014.

In January 2018, the government sought to change the narrative.

A study commissioned by its own think-tank showed that seven million jobs were created in 2017-18 -- closer to the government's promise of providing 10 million jobs.

The study by two independent researchers analysed provident fund data held by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation to map job creation in the private formal sector.

The study predictably drew much flak from various economists for lack of transparency in computing the numbers.

Nevertheless, the government decided to halt all the job surveys by the Labour Bureau and began rolling out the EPFO payroll data on a monthly basis instead.

This backfired.

The payroll numbers provided by the EPFO are dynamic in nature so the figures of job creation kept being revised downwards -- bringing to light another reason the January study was considered unreliable.

The controversy over job creation data is becoming as serious an issue as job creation itself.

But as we move on to 2019, the situation could improve with several official data-sets lined up from the NSSO and the Labour Bureau.

In the March 2018 quarter, the gross non-performing assets of Indian banks surged past Rs 10 trillion.

This surprised many observers, if not the bankers, as the true extent of bad debt was not evident before the Reserve Bank of India arm-twisted lenders to disclose whatever was hidden under the carpet.

There are many economic reasons for this NPA pile-up, but the numbers ballooned after the central bank's February 12 circular.

The circular said if a loan is not serviced for 90 days, it is in default and recovery proceedings can be started against it.

Not surprisingly, the gross NPA of all listed banks jumped to Rs 10.25 trillion in the March quarter, from Rs 8.86 trillion in the December 2017 quarter.

The March level was roughly 11.5% of the total loan book.

Adding restructured, and loans suspected to be falling into NPA, the share could be 13% to 14% of the loan book.

RBI's financial stability report says the gross NPA ratios of the banking system could reach 12.2% of the loan book by March 2019.

The good news is that the gross NPAs showed a downward trend in June and then in the September quarter.

This is largely because of the strict Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, or the fear of it.

Bankers now believe the recognition part of NPA is over, and the recovery needs to begin.

Most of the big-ticket companies that were being forced to undergo a change in management as part of the law were part of the RBI-mandated list for debt resolution under IBC.

Ishita Ayan Dutt reports.

2018 was a watershed year for corporate India with some of its tycoons coming close to losing grip on their companies, courtesy the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

Most of the big-ticket companies that were being forced to undergo a change in management as part of the law were part of the RBI-mandated list for debt resolution under IBC.

The RBI's first list comprised 12 large accounts with an outstanding claim of Rs 3.45 trillion.

The highest profile from that prized list is Ruia-owned Essar Steel.

Subsequently, the central bank came out with a second list of 27 NPAs that included the likes of Videocon.

The IBC was rolled out about two years ago with the objective of facilitating debt resolution.

Till September, in terms of recovery, financial creditors have realised Rs 584 billion against admitted claims of Rs 1.3 trillion.

Compared to a pre-IBC regime recovery rate of 26 per cent, the Code hasn't fared badly.

However, less than five per cent of the cases have been resolved so far (52 out of 1,198).

The resolution, which was to have been achieved within a maximum time limit of 270 days, has tripped on time-lines.

Of the 816 corporate insolvency resolution processes (CIRPs) underway, more than 29 per cent of the cases have breached the extended 270-day deadline within which resolutions were to be completed, and 19 per cent have crossed 180 days.

Yet bankers say these are but early problems of a revolutionary law that has changed the creditor-debtor relationship in significant ways.

Govt also pushed for RBI decision-making to be a more consultative process, meaning board members should have more say.

Kanika Datta reports.

After months of speculation RBI Governor Urjit R Patel submitted his resignation on December 10, the first incumbent to do so since economic liberalisation.

Tensions had been building for some time, especially from August, with the government appointing two loyalists to the RBI board -- maverick accountant and Swadeshi Jagran Manch co-convenor S Gurumurthy and cooperative banker and former Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad treasurer Satish Marathe.

Their induction was seen as disturbing the intricate relationship between the central bank and government.

It coincided with the RBI coming under pressure to part with a larger share of its capital reserves to shore up government finances and to ease lending restrictions on public sector banks under the Prompt Corrective Action regime, especially to the ailing small and medium enterprises sector.

The government also pushed for RBI decision-making to be a more consultative process, meaning board members should have more say.

Theb RBI interpreted this as a direct undermining of its central board.

With tensions mounting between Mint Road and Raisina Hill, Deputy Governor Viral Acharya delivered a speech outlining the case for the central bank's autonomy in the interests of long-term financial stability.

It was seen as a pointed message to the government.

There the issue rested in a miasma of rumour that the government would invoke the never-used Section 7 of the RBI Act -- which involves a direct order from the government to the RBI to carry out its wishes.

A day before the results of five state elections were to be declared and two days before a much-anticipated board meeting, Dr Patel officially put in his papers.

Two days later, former economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das, who had been the government's chief spokesman during demonetisation, was appointed as his successor.

The board meeting appeared to have gone off without incident, but this is only the beginning of a new story.

While your child is growing up, you'll make countless decisions and at times be left with more questions than answers, one of the most poignant being how can you continue to make sure your family is taken care of in the event of your own death.

Estate planning should be a part of the conversation long before you're on your death bed. A knowledgeable and professional estate planning attorney can assist in the emotional process of planning for your family's future. Gabriel Katzner, an estate planning attorney with an office in Encinitas, has been helping families bridge the gaps with his comprehensive estate planning practice for nearly a decade.

Himself a father of two, a 7-year-old 1st grader and a 4.5 year old daughter in pre-K, Gabriel knows just how frustrating the process can be. ""When my wife and I were expecting our first child, I felt that the attorneys we met with had their priorities misplaced. The only thing they seemed to care about was money -- how much there was, any tax issues, and how much complexity they could bake into our estate plan to raise their fee,"" he says. ""While my wife and I certainly wanted to protect our assets and minimize taxes what we cared about most was the long-term care of our soon to be born child."" However, he says the experience became a catalyst for ""comprehensive estate planning that cares first and foremost about ensuring that your values as parents, and the priorities and goals you have for your children, are carried on even post your death.""

Estate planning for everyone, but in particular parents of young children, is essential. If something were to happen without a plan in place, state officials -- not your family -- have final say not just over who receives your assets but over who raises your children as well.

There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but options like a revocable living trust allow you to protect what you've worked so hard for. Gabriel says the flexibility, privacy, and overall more ""humane"" dealings afforded by a revocable living trust blows last will and testament-based planning out of the water. With a revocable living trust based plan there's no probate court upon your death, or conservatorship-type proceedings should you become incapacitated during life, whereas a will is essentially a useless piece of paper until you're dead. It's also more efficient to do some of the more complex estate and income tax planning in a revocable living trust if that's what circumstances warrant. ""There's this misconception that revocable living trust-based planning is expensive, that's certainly not the case, and the benefits afforded by it to your family and your own comfort knowing you've done all you can to protect your loves ones can't be overstated,"" he says.

A well-versed, straightforward attorney like Gabriel, who's patient and accessible, can help navigate this space, as well as other areas you might not have considered, like guardianship decisions over minor children and asset protection. ""As parents we're each responsible for the life of another. We have a responsibility to them each and every day. Part of that responsibility is making sure they're cared for in the way we want, by who we want, with the values we want in the event something unfortunate happens to us. The way to accomplish each of these goals and then some is by putting in place a comprehensive estate plan -- one that goes far beyond just protecting your money, but rather protects your loved ones and values and ensures they're carried on post your death.""

When you embark on estate planning, you want to know that you're in the capable hands of someone who has experience working on behalf of other people in similar situations. Gabriel personally meets with each and every one of his clients. He not only provides your family with a modern and sophisticated take on estate planning, something beyond fill in the blank wills that too many lawyers pass off as estate planning, but also, and most importantly, peace of mind that your family is in good hands. ""It's a fact of life that bad things sometimes happen to good people. As parents it's our responsibility to protect our children from what the world may throw at them, and when it comes to caring for our children in the event of our own passing, putting in place a comprehensive estate plan is simply the responsible thing to do.""

Sudershan Reddy sheds light on former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's vision, erudition and multi-faceted personality in this address delivered on PV's death anniversary. It gives us a peek into the man hailed as the architect of economic reforms in India....

Ladies and Gentlemen.

Let me, at the very outset, welcome you to the 2018 PV Memorial Lecture. I also wish to state emphatically that it is with a great deal of trepidation and humility that I accepted this invitation to preside over this memorial Lecture. And I believe that diffidence is justified in as much as we seek to deliberate about our times and the inflection points of our progress as a constitutional democracy in honour of a man whose life was marked with many great successes, and many reasonable people would also say some poignant and even puzzling failures.

The sweep of forces and events, and the multitude of dimensions we would have to take into account to develop a holistic picture, in order to comprehend the life of a person like P.V., would not be something that one could even hope to do any justice to in the 15 to 20 minutes or so that I have here. For example, if we were to start with his first elections in 1951 -- that he lost to a candidate of the Communist Party -- when the fledgling nation-state was trying to recover from the horrors of communal passions and traverse all the way to his last stint as a constitutional functionary in the 1990s, when the nation-state was arguably being pushed back into a cauldron, in which communal passions were again becoming the fuel to the fire of discontent, it would not be unreasonable to think of it as the completion of one cycle and the start of another cycle in the history of this nation itself. Add to that, just one more dimension -- -- of the changes in the political economy that he wrought as the Prime Minister, and evolution of P.V.'s thoughts -- -- and one begins to grasp the enormity of task of locating P.V. Narasimha Rao -- -- the man, his ideas, his achievements and failures and what lessons he might hold for us today.

As a person who interacted only to a limited extent with Narasimha Rao -- -- P.V., as he is affectionately called -- -- I will not deign to speak at length about him. I limit my role here to painting a rough, and obviously incomplete, a sketch of a few select areas that P.V., left his mark on. The hope is that this might thematically serve as a bridge between the man in whose honour these annual lectures have been organized and the fraught times we live in.

I had the opportunity -- -- nay honour to meet him on a few occasions. Both when he was in power, and also when he was not in power. He was famous for his erudition and it is only natural that it is talked up. From his mastery of 10 different languages -- that seemed to give him a deeper insight into human nature, of individuals and of collectives -- to his learning COBOL and coding for UNIX machines that seemed to give him insights into forces and processes that might be unleashed well after his lifespan -his thirst for knowledge seemed to know no bounds. I must confess that every single time I met him, I came away feeling enriched, intellectually stimulated and enlightened by the many different dimensions that he could visualize to a problem or an issue. If he weren't an active politician engaged in the task of deepening democracy, he would have been an incredible teacher and a scholar expanding the frontiers of knowledge.

However, he chose not to be an academic, but to be a public representative with a deep inclination to bring about change. In every position that he ever held he initiated and pushed forward reforms. From fixing the managements of temples to forbidding private practice by doctors in government hospitals (a practice that was leading to perverse incentives and practices), P.V.'s record clearly indicates that he had both the vision to see the big picture and also the inclination to work with the minutiae of details to attempt making government departments function better. Of course, the large changes that were initiated, when he was the Prime Minister, in the very manner in which the political economy is to be conceived and structured has been much celebrated. It ought to be a matter of collective shame that the acknowledgment of the pivotal and indeed the pioneering role he played in the reforms of 1991 was belated, and only recently have scholars, historians and biographers begun to tentatively sketch the contours of that story.

For me personally, the fact that P.V., was from the same hardscrabble rural background as I, and yet managed to rise so high on the leadership scale and make such immense contributions to the story of modern India, is what made him fascinating. A very reasonable and plausible argument can be made that Shri. Narasimha Rao's roots in rural India gave him a deep and an intuitive understanding of the structural roots of inequity and the possible avenues for strengthening the capacities of the deprived to assert and protect their innate human dignity. That connectedness and understanding, I believe, informed a lifelong commitment to bring greater dignity to the rural masses -- something that is seldom talked about today as part of the many successes in his career as a politician and a constitutional functionary. I would like to briefly mention three changes, amongst the many, he brought about that had the potential to transform the lives of rural masses.

The first, of course, are the land reforms he initiated in the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh. What was remarkable of course, was that the reforms he initiated were going to adversely affect him personally. As many in the audience may know, P.V. was adopted by a rich but childless Brahmin family in his native village, Vangara. He inherited 1200 acres of agricultural land of which he gave up 1000 acres to comply with the reforms he had initiated. The capacity to sacrifice for what he perceived to be the larger good must itself be treated as worthy of great respect and admiration -- -- especially by those of us who live in these times when personal aggrandizement seems to have become the lure for many in the political sphere. To that, we can add another dimension: that he conceived this reform as being necessary for deepening of democracy in rural Andhra Pradesh.

However much we may quibble that his land reforms did not really achieve the economic results that he had hoped for, we cannot but reflect on the impact it had on the minds of the intended beneficiaries of the measures. Even though the measures benefitted a much smaller number than envisaged, the discourse of right to ownership of land they had tilled and toiled over for centuries itself suggested to them a co-equal right to claim ownership of the country, and gave many from the deprived communities much local strength to be able to assert a role in the political processes and aspire to positions of leadership. Given the lengthy history of graded inequalities and consequent denial of inherent human dignity of vast swathes of the populace, the land reform measures he initiated, and the normative discourse that he unleashed have to be understood as significant milestones in our core constitutional project of social justice.

The second initiative that I would like to highlight relates to his exemplary work as the Union Minister for HRD in the Rajiv Gandhi cabinet in the mid-1980s. He was, of course, the creator of the HRD ministry, that combined various departments -- -- of culture, youth affairs etc, with education. Far more important was the New Education Policy of 1986 that he authored. Going past mere vision statements, he was the one who gave shape to the concept and implementation of Navodaya residential schools project. These schools were designed to identify the more talented of the rural students and provide them access to education of a quality that was comparable to what urban children were getting. While Rajiv Gandhi is credited with conceiving the idea, P.V., it has been widely argued was the one who threw himself, heart and soul, into designing and implementing this program. I would like to believe that the fact that his formal education was accidental -- -- in a rural and backward village of Telangana -- inspired him. It yet again reveals his insight that education was a vital and essential avenue for acknowledging and protecting the human dignity of individuals -- -- cutting across socio-economic and communal backgrounds.

The third initiative I would like to highlight is that his Government pushed through the 73 and 74 Amendments to the Constitution of India in 1992-93. These amendments substantially eliminated the discretionary powers of State governments and legislatures in conducting elections to local bodies in rural and urban areas. One remarkable change was the reservation of a third of the positions for women. Before you go rolling your eyes, let me summarize empirical research-based assessment by Professor Rohini Pande, of Harvard University, and her team. They studied 495 randomly selected villages in West Bengal and found that:

(i) Having female leaders dramatically changed voters' perceptions of the effectiveness of women, albeit it occurred only after repeated exposure;

(ii) That notwithstanding biased perceptions about men being more efficient, upon repeated exposure to women being in leadership positions changed voters perceptions that women could be as, and in fact more, efficient than even men; and

(iii) Most importantly, in villages which had women pradhans a couple of times, the aspirations of parents for their daughters, as well as aspirations of teenage girls were raised.

Let me hasten to add, at this point, that I am not implying that an urban background would have been an obstacle to his conceiving the urgency of the needs to initiate structural changes in rural societies. However, I do believe that in all the excitement about his role in initiating 1991 reforms we forget the much wider canvas on which he worked; and that insufficient work has been done by academicians, scholars, and biographers to repeatedly engage with the life of this remarkable man, to uncover his motivations and their sources.

While Vinay Sitapati's ""Half Lion"" is a substantial contribution in this direction, it is still only a first step.

More than most, in modern India, Shri. Narasimha Rao has been at the receiving end of the curse that afflicts the memory of leaders who have served in difficult times -- -- achieved much, and also claimed to have failed much. As Shakespeare's Antony intoned: ""The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones."" It is good that many are now seeking to excavate the life and times of this son of India.

At the very beginning of my speech, I had asserted that I was humbled that I was asked to preside over this Memorial Lecture and that I was even a trifle scared. How could I not be After all these lectures are organized in memory of a man who wielded power throughout his life and yet seemed to be so capable of being detached when out of power, and go back to his romance with letters and knowledge.

In contrast to that, we live in times when leaders proclaim that they will rule for the next fifty years. Such braggadocio, a hallmark of authoritarian politics, which takes its roots in deep seated anti-intellectualism, is deeply disrespectful of the citizens and the democratic processes they sustain, and is essentially disconnected with the ethos of this nation. It is said that the world is a dangerous place where it is lead by demagogues who manipulate the truth. They lie, they know they are lying and they know that we know they are lying.

As institutions and all foundations of political discourse and polity, are assaulted by the vulgar and the violent, the memory of Shri. Narasimha Rao needs to be used to reinforce another set of beliefs: (i) that scholarship and capacity to deeply reflect and analyze the consequences of policy decisions is not a handicap for leaders but a shield against overweening arrogance when in power -- -- an arrogance that results in certitudes of ignorance and disdain for the poor and the weakest who will suffer the most; and (ii) that dignified and civil bearing, whether in power or out of power, are not signs of weakness but of a belief in the strengths of democracy and innate human dignity of our citizens.

So, I take leave with this thought. He may have been named ""Half Lion, Half Human"", but the boy from Vangara village grew up to be human. Fully, and all too human. But thank God for that. We should hope to see more of the likes of him."

President JKJCCPS Showkat M Chowdhary said the Fee Fixation Committee, as per the High Court Directions, approves the fee for a full calendar year and not on monthly basis.

He said the schools submit all the documents, income and expenses attested by Chartered Accountant, undertakings and declarations to the Fee Fixation Committee on the basis of which the fee is fixed.

""The private schools hire staff on yearly basis who are provided salary and provident funds for full year. No school hires staff as daily wagers. Accordingly, the schools charge tuition for full calendar year. The schools also make it sure that the teachers and other staff are paid properly. They also upgrade its infrastructure and other facilities on regular basis in an effort to impart quality education to the students so that they can compete not only at state or national level but at international level.""

About the transportation charges, JKJCCPS said the private schools charge for only 10 months even though they provide salary to the drivers and conductors for full year.

""Besides other charges including road tax, insurances are also borne by the schools for 12 months and there is no exemption from any authority or company to schools for the school buses during winter months. The schools only save fuel during the winter months on the basis of which only 10 months transportation fee is charged from the parents.""

JKJCCPS said transport facilities are provided to the students on no profit no loss basis.

""This facility is for the smooth transportation of the students so that they reach the schools and return back home on fixed times. It is neither prudent to say that schools will ply buses on losses.""

JKJCCPS said it is not mandatory for the parents to avail transport facility. ""If parents feel the transport is not viable, they can opt out of this facility and drop the students at schools on their own.""

It said the Coordination Committee has already given clear-cut instructions to the schools not to charge arbitrarily or make unnecessarily charges.

""We have also urged parents to register their complaints with the Coordination Committee for its prompt redressal.""

JKJCCPS urged parents no to resort to media trails instead seek better education for the wards.

""In today's modern world when competition is very high for the students, parents should exhort upon the school management to further upgrade infrastructure in terms of latest teaching aids and other facilities which should be integral part of class room.""

JKJCCPS further urged parents' association to sit with coordination committee over the issue and clear doubts, if any, regarding the fee charged from the students.

""We believe that media trials will serve no purpose but only hamper the school functioning and derail our effort to impart quality education. We will also like to invite media for open discussion and clear any doubts on the matter so that we focus on providing quality education to the students and help parents lay a strong foundation of their children."""

After the gang was busted in December last year, the police said it had cheating more than 20,000 students across India and jeopardised the careers of many unsuspecting candidates who bagged government jobs using fake certificates issued by them.

On Wednesday, Rajesh Deo, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch), said at least one such candidate -- who had bagged a UP Police job using a fake degree -- had been dismissed from his job after his documents were found to be fake.

The gang ran a fake education board in the name of 'Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi' and operated from west Delhi's Vikaspuri, said the DCP..

Police said the gang was busted for a second time on December 12 after the crime branch received a tip-off about the 'Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi' , said Rajeev Ranjan, additional commissioner of police (crime branch). ""We were already working on a similar recent complaint from the Directorate of Education,"" Ranjan said.

The first person to be arrested was 23-year-old Altaf Raza, who was one of the six persons nabbed last year as well. The police said he was ""one of the masterminds"" of the racket. ""We arrested him on a day he was to appear at a court hearing in the previous case,"" said DCP Deo.

Raza had allegedly learnt the trade from one Shiv Prasad Pandey a few years ago. Pandey was arrested with Raza last year. After coming out on bail, he has gone underground, said the DCP.

The other two men arrested in the latest case are Shambhu Nath Mishra and Manoj Kumar, who run a school in Uttar Pradesh's Deoria and were allegedly involved in scouting for potential candidates as well as schools in desperate need for recognition certificates.

""The gang promised to provide marksheets and degrees of Class 10 and 12 in two-three months without any tests or requirements. The documents provided were fake,"" said DCP Deo.

Each time their website was busted, the gang would allegedly come up with a new portal with a different name.

The police claimed to have recovered a large number of fake marksheets, provisional certificates and migration certificates. ""In their last few months of operation, the gang had cheated more than 10,000 students from Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar,"" said the DCP.

The gang allegedly charged anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000 for fake certificates and marksheets. That, investigators said, allowed them to operate easily as their victims rarely approached the police because of the relatively small sum of money involved."

Meanwhile, few class 12 students are unhappy with the timetable as there us the only two-day gap between Biology and Physics examination and requested the board to revise the same. CBSE has not stated anything related to the concern raised by the students. As of now, the board exam dates for both the classes stand official, and any changes would be intimated through the official site of CBSE."

India's top intellectuals nominate the next generation. Here is their list of some of the brightest minds on the horizon.

Intellectuals are an essential component of an open society -- they bring their unique analytical insights to not only scrutinise the society in its immediate form but also help shape the ideas and ideologies of the future. They conduct research, deploy critical thinking, reason, teach, author books, challenge dogma and equip us with cognitive tools to engage with the world we inhabit -- just for the love of knowledge, or for the greater human good.

India has a rich and ancient tradition of producing such thinkers, teachers and philosophers who have contributed to the creation of new schools of thought that have travelled and established themselves far beyond Indian shores too. They have also passed on their learnings and discoveries to successive generations to preserve, innovate upon and further.

But who are the next generation of Indian intellectuals in the modern times we inhabit? The next Ramachandra Guha, the next Arvind Panagariya, the next Ashok Gulati, the next Raghuram Rajan, the next Makarand Paranjape, or the next Shashi Tharoor?

Over the last few months, ThePrint spoke to some of the biggest names in Indian intelligentsia and asked them who, in their opinion, are the brightest minds on the horizon -- in history, economics, sociology, political studies, law, strategic affairs, philosophy, public affairs, and inter-disciplinary studies, among others.

What follows is a long and impressive list of next-gen intellectuals who have begun to make a mark and given notice of their coming brilliance. Some of the nominees were directly mentored by the veterans who named them while the others are those whose work they track closely. This is by no means an exhaustive list and will be updated when more intellectuals respond to our requests.

Here's the list, in alphabetical order of the names of the nominators:

A trained sociologist and clinical psychologist, Nandy's area of expertise is the psychology of violence, the psychology of genocide and the future of ideas.

On his choices, Nandy said: ""All three have special relevance in the 150th year of Gandhi's birth.""

But he adds: Two warnings first. I am in my 80s now; I have seen four generations pass by. Those who look young to me do not look that young to others. Also, those in their 20s and 30s have not often got the chance to find themselves and to display their talent or promise. My own first book was published when I was in my 40s.""

His picks are:

Devji is professor of Indian history at St Antony's College, Oxford. He is an expert on modern Islamic studies and ethics, and violence in a globalised world.

Muralidharan, professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, is a doctorate from Harvard University. His research focuses on health and education in developing countries.

Varshney said of him: ""His work is very technically economic, so in the larger public sphere, his presence is limited, unlike the economics profession, where he towers in his cohort. He has started writing a book for the larger audiences on India's economy. We might know more soon.""

Sagar is Global Network Associate Professor of political science at NYU, Abu Dhabi. Raja Mohan is impressed with ""his pioneering work on putting together modern India's thinking on world affairs over the last two centuries"".

Mehta, now vice-chancellor of the Ashoka University, was president of CPR. He also taught political theory at Harvard and at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.

GST refund glitches, refusal of the state to refund 42 per cent share of the Central incentives pertaining to the pre-GST period, stalemate in the land acquisition for major infrastructure development projects like four-laning of the Baddi-Nalagarh highway and rail connectivity has left the investors disappointed.

The only silver-lining is that the state gets top ranking nationally in the ease of doing business initiative in the fast-moving category. Its overall ranking has improved to 16th as against 17th attained last year. No new industrial unit has been set up due to the locational disadvantage and little has been done to break the monopoly of transport unions whose freight is among the highest in the country. The Pandoga industrial area in Una district has found no takers and little could be done to revive the case of seeking environmental clearance of 515 bigha land at Dhabota in Nalagarh where new industrial area is proposed.

The much-awaited bulk drug park, announced by the Union Chemical and Fertilisers Minister in April 2016, is yet to receive funds for developing the 663.11 bigha site at Aduwal village in Nalagarh. Efforts to set up a cement plant at Churah subdivision of Chamba district have failed to yield results. The government has again announced an investor meet, albeit with a difference, where the Chief Minister is slated to lead a host of senior officials within the country and abroad to attract investment.

The Mukhya Mantri Swavlamban Yojana, which fetches 25 per cent investment subsidy with a ceiling of Rs 40 lakh in plant and machinery and an interest subsidy of 5 per cent for three years, was introduced in May to promote employment. As many as 793 proposals were forwarded to the banks but barely 36 were sanctioned and funds worth Rs 7.88 crore were disbursed which speak volumes about its lack of popularity. Limited success is received under the ambitious 'Start-Up Himachal' scheme with barely 40 start-ups having received financial assistance.

The state was,however, rated as ""Hill State leader and an aspiring leader in developing an enabling start-up ecosystem"" nationally. The 5-year Central Capital Investment Incentive for access to credit at 30 per cent for plant and machinery announced for the micro, small and medium enterprises is the lone new Central scheme which brought some cheer to the existing units.

Students without uniform, scholarship

It was a challenging year for the government in the education sector as it grappled with downtrend in enrollment and filling of vacancies while facing stiff resistance from teacher unions in its bid to bring qualitative improvement in education.

The scholarship scam of Rs 250 crore was unearthed in the Education Department and preliminary investigations revealed that the tentacles of the scam spread to other states also. The government has now handed over the investigations to the CBI. The department remained under the scanner of the High Court which monitored the measures taken by government to fill vacant posts.

The regularisation of teacher has not been done since 2008 and resentment was brewing among teachers as a large number of teachers retired without getting promotion. The government closed 100 elementary schools with less than 10 students and proposed the merger or closure of more than 400 elementary schools.

Efforts were made to get the best from teachers as annual increment of 38 PGTs were stopped for less than 25 per cent results in Class XII board examinations. To arrest the flight of students to private schools, the government introduced pre-primary (Nursery) classes in 3,391 schools on a pilot basis from the coming session and so far, 30,000 students have been registered. The enrollment in government schools has dropped by 23.7 per cent in past 10 years.

Under pressure from student unions, the government took a retrograde step to revert to annual system from semester system under RUSA while the cluster university, which was set up at Mandi, is yet to be functional.

The government failed to provide free uniforms to students of government schools from Class I to Class XII under the Atal Vardi Yojana.

The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti.

Even as there was marginal increase in revenue from power to Rs 1,100 crore as compared to Rs 950 crore last year, yet the state failed to add even a single megawatt to its existing capacity. The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti. There was complete lack of interest in the 1000 MW solar energy projects in Spiti as the HP State Transmission Corporation failed to lay the transmission line to evacuate power from the region.

The Directorate of Energy allotted just two projects - the jinxed 780 MW Jangi Thopan to the SJVNL and the 447 MW Dugar in 2018.

No effort was made to store over rain water in the monsoon on the Giri, Dharampur khud, both tributaries of the Yamuna, that goes waste every year as Shimla and Solan continue to face water shortage.

Private power producers cited high cost of power generation and lack of infrastructure like roads and transmission lines as the main reasons for not showing interest in the projects.The existing power companies had to resort to shutdown of powerhouses owing to the high level of silt. As a result, power companies and state suffered losses due to the frequent shutdown, while the consumers faced power cuts and water problems for hours during the shutdown.

Caught in debt trap

With the debt mounting to almost Rs 50,000 crore, the poor financial health of the state remained the biggest challenge before the BJP regime in its first year in office.

The absence of major revenue generation and limited Central funding under various schemes prevented the Jai Ram government from undertaking any major schemes. Most big projects and schemes are being implemented through Central funding.

Even as the Congress cried hoarse about the poor fiscal management, the BJP regime raised loans to the tune of Rs 2,500 crore against a limit of Rs 7,600 crore. The salary component of almost 2 lakh government employees is Rs 11,000 crore while the pensionary burden is to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore annually. A sum of Rs 4,300 crore will have to be paid as interest on loans during the financial year 2018-19.

The biggest area of concern is the extra spending on recruitment, besides upgrade and opening of new health and educational institutions. The only silver-lining is the hike in revenue from the power sector from Rs 750 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 10,500 crore.

The biggest challenge before the CM, who holds the Finance Department, is generating resources for which the government is eying power, tourism, industry and mining."

The Associa­tion said that the fee was charged after examining and scrutinizing its income and expenses. President JKJCCPS Showkat M Chowdhary said the Fee Fixation Committee, as per the High Court directions, approves the fee for a full calen­dar year and not on monthly basis. He said the schools submit all the documents, income and expenses attested by Chartered Accountant, undertakings and declarations to the Fee Fixation Committee on the basis of which the fee is fixed.

""The private schools hire staff on yearly basis who are provided salary and provident funds for full year. No school hires staff as daily wagers. Accordingly, the schools charge tuition for full calendar year. The schools also make it sure that the teachers and other staff are paid properly.

About the trans­portation charges, JKJCCPS said the private schools charge for only 10 months even though they provide salary to the drivers and conductors for full year. ""Besides other charges including road tax, insurances are also borne by the schools for 12 months and there is no exemption from any authority or company to schools for the school buses dur­ing winter months. The schools only save fuel during the winter months on the basis of which only 10 months transportation fee is charged from the parents."" JKJCCPS said transport facilities are provided to the students on no profit no loss basis. ""This facility is for the smooth transportation of the students so that they reach the schools and re­turn back home on fixed times. It is neither prudent to say that schools will ply buses on losses.""

JKJCCPS said it is not mandatory for the parents to avail transport facility. ""If parents feel the trans­port is not viable, they can opt out of this facility and drop the students at schools on their own."" It said the Coordination Committee has al­ready given clear-cut instructions to the schools not to charge arbitrarily or make unnecessarily charges.

""We have also urged parents to register their complaints with the Coordination Committee for its prompt redressal."" JKJCCPS urged parents no to resort to media trails instead seek better education for the wards. ""In today's modern world when competition is very high for the students, parents should ex­hort upon the school management to further upgrade infrastructure in terms of latest teaching aids and other facilities which should be in­tegral part of class room.""

JKJCCPS further urged parents' association to sit with coordination committee over the issue and clear doubts, if any, regarding the fee charged from the students.

""We believe that media trials will serve no purpose but only hamper the school functioning and derail our effort to impart quality educa­tion. We will also like to invite me­dia for open discussion and clear any doubts on the matter so that we focus on providing quality education to the students and help parents lay a strong foundation of their children."""

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Naresh Patil and Justice M.S. Karnik was hearing a public interest litigation that sought for rehabilitation schemes by the BMC and the State for street children.

The court was informed that the Centre funds BMC through authenticated NGOs under the National Urban Livelihood Missions for the welfare of street children and the committee headed by the secretary of the Maharashtra Government Nagar Palika Sanchalan regulates the distribution of funds to the NGOs and audits their functioning for ensuring that the money is ultimately utilised for the benefit of the street children.

Vijay Raghavan, the amicus curiae pointed out that the BMC approximately receives ₹8 crore in a year.

The BMC's counsel Hiten Venegavkar told the court that out of 214 Marathi-medium schools, 67 have been shut down from 2014 and 23 have been converted into English.

He also said that the BMC has issued letters to Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority and Airport authority to give the BMC funds for construction of shelter homes and shoulder the responsibility.

As of 2013, a head count had revealed that there are approximately 37,000 children found on the street.

The court inquired if the State in coordination with the BMC is considering a survey of street children, area-wise night shelters, whether the grants distributed under the Central Mission is utilised properly and accounts are audited.

The court said, ""undoubtedly, the needs and problems of such children have to be addressed in a humane manner. We have no manner of doubt that the Task Force headed by chief secretary would deal with all these issues of priority in the meeting, which shall be convened at the earliest.""

The Delhi government Wednesday approved a proposal to beautify five entry points to the national capital, a move aimed at giving an attractive and pleasing look to the commuters entering the city.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia approved the beautification proposal for the entry points of the city after he reviewed a plan of the Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC). The national capital has 13 entry points.

""Five entry points have been identified for taking up beautification and makeover in phase-I at Gurgaon Border, Tikri Kalan Border, Gazipur Border, Apsara Border and Anand Vihar border near Kaushambi,"" the government said in a statement.

It stated that the government will also re-develop Dilli Haat at INA, adding that to make the Haat user-friendly and give it a pleasant environment, up-gradation of the same is need of the time.

""The DTTDC has prepared an up-gradation plan for revamping the Haat and same was also reviewed by the deputy chief minister.

""It was desired that food court of Dilli Haat will also be up-graded to the extent of the present user requirement and make the food court hygienic. It was desired the work will be taken up in a phased manner so that it does not affect the visitors,"" the statement said.

Dilli Haat was constructed in 1994. Since its inception, a lot of changes in its surrounding have taken place due to infrastructure developments like entry of INA metro station and extension of Barapula Flyover up to Ring Road, and hence it was decided to redevelop the Haat.

This comes after the recent Supreme Court (SC) verdict which ruled that Aadhaar cannot be demanded for school admissions, bank accounts and new mobile connections.

UIDAI chief executive officer (CEO) Ajay Bhushan Pandey has clarified that making Aadhaar mandatory for school admissions is against the law and no student should be denied admission on that basis.

Under trial for sedition, the man who gave India its first indigenous shipping company was sentenced to life imprisonment. So widespread was the outrage that, on appeal, his jail time was reduced to four years, right here in the Madras High Court.

It's difficult to imagine the atmosphere in the High Court at the time. But at the Madras High Court Museum, which houses a replica of the original courtroom, you might have a semblance.

The museum was inaugurated last year, post the court's 125th anniversary celebrations. (The Madras High Court, though established in 1862, was relocated to its current building complex in 1892.) City-based theatre group Madras Players re-enacted the handing over of the keys by the then-Governor to the Chief Justice. Today, life-size replicas of these men stand guard at the doors of the museum, accessible to the public through Gate No 5 of the High Court building on Esplande Road.

The pride of place, however, is held by the replica of the courtroom. On an elevated panel with steps on both sides, sit three stately chairs, overlooking the courtroom: these are the judges' chairs. In front of the podium is a seat and desk for the court stenographer. A semi-circular table and seven chairs face the podium: this would have been where the jury sat. On one side, is the witness stand.

""All this furniture has been preserved from the 1890s,"" says Nalini Radhakrishnan, of InterScape, who designed and executed the interiors of the museum with inputs from NL Rajah, senior advocate and part of the Madras High Court Heritage Committee. ""The judges' chairs were in excellent condition, but we varnished and refurbished, the other furniture,"" says Nalini, adding, ""We had less than two months to put everything together."" She points our attention to the black-and-white chequered floor, where an eight-petalled flower design rests in the middle. ""They were very particular that we get this flower design correct,"" she says.

As I take in the scene from the witness box, Nalini stands opposite to me, five feet away. ""Right where I stand, is where the prisoner would have been standing for trail,"" she says. Explains Rajah, ""Back in those days, the prisoner was jailed in an area beneath the courtroom. He was brought up to the courtroom through a spiral staircase."" These were the days when trails would be on a day-to-day basis, says Rajah. ""The prisoners would be housed under the court to reduce chances of them escaping,"" he adds.

In one section of the museum is the replica of the Chief Justice's room, with his chair, desk, and diwan, where he used to rest during the afternoon breaks. ""We have also preserved the box in which the Chief Justice would take his court case bundles home, and the water dispenser used at the time,"" he says, crediting curator T Krishnamoorthy for his help in sourcing some of the artefacts.

Outside the room is a mace. ""It is a colonial tradition that is followed in the chartered courts. The judges are preceded by mace-bearers as they walk towards the courtroom,"" he says. The wooden chairs from 1800s, on which the judges sat, and are on display. Intricate flower patterns and lion heads adorn their armrests.

""We wanted the museum to serve as an educational tool for understanding the history of law and order in Madras,"" says Rajah. Along the walls of the museum hang illustrative charts that narrate how Madras' judicial system was born and developed. Right from its origins in 1600s to the 1800s, when the Supreme Court of Madras was created. Also on display are the corresponding charters for it, including the Charter of 1753 that created the judicial establishments in the three Presidencies. Despite the frayed yellowing pages, the Victorian calligraphy and illustrations along the margins still demand attention.

""A charter is equal to a Government order,"" explains Rajah, ""Until 1857, the judicial system was run by East India Company, only supervised by the Crown. Before the Crown took on governance completely, the Company had to take permission from the Crown for judicial reforms, and that was done through charters and regulations.""

The museum also houses a replica of the High Court seal, a miniature of the entire court complex, an enlarged photograph of the day the court was inaugurated, and photographs of the court from various angles.

Rajah wants to ensure that colleges or schools bring students to the museum every month. ""We want to show a small documentary on the Rule of Law at the preview room, or the auditorium above. It is necessary for students to understand why laws exists,"" he says.

The museum is open to the public from 10 am to 5 pm, on all days except Fridays and Sundays. Entry is free.

In the 1944 Lakshmikanthan murder case, two leading stars of the Tamil cinema industry -- Thyagaraja Baghavathar and NS Krishnan -- were charged with complicity in the murder of Lakshmikanthan, who ran a yellow journal and published damaging articles against the stars.

The 1912 child custody case involved the adoption of philosopher J Krishnamurthi by Dr Annie Besant.

The 1930 Gandhi Cap case saw the court overturn a ruling that people could not wear Gandhi caps in public, saying not everyone who wore a Gandhi cap could be considered supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement."

The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which has been making rounds of canteens in private schools to check if they are providing nutritious food, found that in all the 10 cases so far, students are being given food high in fat, salt and sugar content, something that is strictly prohibited.

DCPCR has been inspecting the schools to ensure effective implementation of Food Safety and Standard Authority of India guidelines, which are prepared by the central advisory committee of the body as advised by the Delhi high court in 2015. Recently, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had asked states to ensure an effective implementation of the norms.

Ranjana Prasad, member DCPCR, said: ""NCPCR had decided to check if these guidelines were being followed and we are doing that in Delhi. We have so far covered 10 private schools in south Delhi. In most schools we saw that the canteens were selling HFSS food and gave whatever the students asked for. The children do not know what is good for them and what they should eat."" The canteens were serving burgers, chowmein and beverages -- all strictly prohibited in the guidelines.

A research recently published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that there is a link between consumption of HFSS food and obesity. Numerous studies done among schoolchildren of Delhi, Amritsar and southern India show that the prevalence of overweight/obesity is high and on the rise. In urban post-pubertal children of Delhi, it increased from 16% in 2002 to about 24% in 2006. It is high among the affluent class and children of private schools compared to low and middle-income groups.

Apart from selling food that's high in sugar and fat content, none of these schools had a canteen policy in place.

""It is most surprising that none of the schools knew about the canteen policy. As per guidelines, the canteens are required to provide different kinds of food. They are supposed to have 80% of the menu as green food, which includes vegetables, fruits and others. It is important to raise awareness about it among schools, children and parents so that the children grow up healthy,"" said Prasad.

The inspection will be carried out in all the schools of the city and the Directorate of Education has recommended that the guidelines are strictly implemented."

He contended that a number of institutions running under the trust are either in possession of strangers or under illegal occupation. This problem was brought under the control to some extent with an appointment of an administrator earlier, he said.

The case came up for hearing before a bench comprising justices Pradip Deshmukh and Swapna Joshi who directed that Shaikh's tenure would continue till December 31, 2019. He was directed to submit bimonthly report to HC, regarding the administrative functions.

It has warned that those schools insisting on Aadhaar will be doing so against the recent order of the Supreme Court.

The warning came at a time when admissions to nursery and entry-level classes have just begun. There were reports that certain school in the National capital were insisting that parents produce Aadhaar cards as one of the documents required for admission.

""This is not right. This is not as per the provisions of law...school admission and other facility to children cannot be made conditional to production of Aadhaar,"" said UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey. The authority also asked the school authorities and their managements to ensure that no child is denied admission for lack of Aadhaar. ""In fact, schools should admit children without Aadhaar and ensure that children are given Aadhaar once they are in schools by arranging special camps for them,"" he said.

Asked what action schools might face if they continued to insist on Aadhaar, Pandey said that it will clearly be seen as ""contempt of court"".

In September this year, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar but clipped the scope of the biometric identity project, ruling it was not mandatory for bank accounts, mobile connections or school admissions.

While an all-India judicial service with an exam-based intake at the entry level has been proposed in the past and Prasad has spoken on the need for the judiciary to be more representative, the minister referred to SC/ST quotas at the entry level in judicial services at a function organised by the All India Lawyers Board in Lucknow on Monday.

The minister told TOI on Tuesday, ""The judicial services examination, if conducted by the Union Public Service Commission, can be on the lines of the intake for the civil services where there is reservation for SCs and STs. Those selected can be allotted states to serve in and reservation will create opportunities for well-trained judicial officers from deprived sections who will, over time, rise to higher positions.""

The minister did not mention reservation for other backward classes, but going by the UPSC model for all-India civil services, there would be provision for OBCs as well in keeping with the Supreme Court-mandated implementation of the Mandal Commission's recommendations.

""A well organised judicial service can attract talent from our law schools and young, well-informed judicial officers at the level of additional district judge will make a difference. As ADJs and district judges, they can help make the judicial system move faster and more efficiently,"" Prasad said.

Food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the move to introduce a judicial service with provision for reservations for weaker sections was welcome and would meet a long-pending demand.

Though Prasad has brought up the need for an all-India judicial service to address the vacancies and expansion of lower courts, the judicial and legal fraternity has been lukewarm to the proposal. The minister's fresh push comes at a time when the Centre has been seeking a breakthrough on the memorandum of procedure (MoP) for appointment of judges to constitutional courts. The MoP has been stuck over the higher judiciary's reluctance to accept a screening committee for candidates and the inclusion of 'national security' as a ground for the Centre to reject a candidate proposed by the collegiums.

The government has also been unhappy with the Supreme Court's decision not to take up cases like the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi title suit expeditiously while disposing of contentious issues like entry of women of a certain age to the Sabarimala shrine, de-criminalising gay sex and making triple talaq illegal."

Gaps in infrastructure and lack of awareness are among the primary reasons why the Directorate of Education (DoE) has failed to draw applicants to seats reserved for differently abled children in the city's private schools.

For the first time this year, a three per cent quota for children with special needs was introduced within the 25 per cent EWS/DG category. Despite inviting applications thrice for about 1,300 seats in the category, 1,268 seats are still lying vacant with no applicants. The fourth draw of lots for these seats, to allot schools to applicants, will be conducted on Wednesday.

The Indian Express looked at reports of inspections carried out by the DoE across popular private schools in the city in 2015, to find that most lack the adequate number of special educators, disabled-friendly washrooms and even signage.

The DoE had inspected schools which were identified as having infrastructure to cater to differently abled children.

Of the 162 schools that were inspected to check for facilities for visually impaired students, 156 did not have Braille books, 132 did not have large print books and 143 did not have embossed maps and globes. Only five had Braille signage and 158 lacked tactile pathways. Special educators were missing in 114 schools and 110 did not have disabled-friendly washrooms.

Advertising ExplainedNot enough special educators in MCD, govt schools

Schools in Delhi -- government and private -- are unequipped to cater to students with special needs. In South and North Municipal Corporation schools, there are only 63 special educators against 1,084 sanctioned posts. Even in the city's government schools, the number of special educators is much lower than the requirement. Despite court orders and studies that make a case for integration of children in the same classroom, those with special needs are mostly sent to specialised schools. While specialised attention for differently abled children is required in many cases, there is barely any regulatory mechanism to monitor the functioning of these schools.

Of 169 schools inspected for facilities for those with hearing impairment, 160 did not have a speech therapist and 112 did not have visual and digital signage. Most schools out of 145 schools inspected for facilities for children with autism did not have tools of educational functional, language and communication, social behaviour and motor skills assessment.

According to disability rights activist Dr Satender Singh, one of the main reasons that such few applications come to schools is the lack of inclusive and accessible infrastructure and tools in schools. ""How many schools in Delhi are even accessible for persons with disabilities and how many have qualified special educators to help these students? There are also a number of learning disorders such as dyslexia, which require special teaching and learning tools. Given the gap, parents will prefer to send their children to specialised schools,"" he said.

The government also sees the lack of awareness as a challenge. Director of Education Sanjay Goel said that the department aims to step up publicity for these seats in the coming academic year. ""We will try to increase awareness about these seats. This is also the first time that this quota is being operationalised; once more students start taking admission through it, hopefully awareness will increase and we will also be able to encourage schools to improve their infrastructure,"" he said.

The process for nursery admissions for the 2019-20 session is already underway for applicants under the general category. The directorate, meanwhile, is yet to release the admission schedule for the EWS/DG category."

Not since Infosys co-founder and former Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A) board chairman NR Narayana Murthy took on then Union minister of human resource development Murli Manohar Joshi over the latter's decision to slash fees have IIMs seen such a prolonged fight for autonomy.

In that sense, 2018 was a landmark year for the premier B-schools even as it ushered in a new era with the promulgation of the IIM Act. At first, IIMs welcomed the freedom to appoint chairpersons and directors in place of the earlier cumbersome process that required government approval. However, the year saw IIMs raising other issues that not only threatened their autonomy but also increased administrative woes for them.

For instance, under the Act, IIMs can offer PhD as against the previous fellow doctoral programmes. However, the government narrowed eligibility criteria by increasing the cut-off to 80 per cent from the 60 per cent for four-year undergraduate applicants. IIMs say this would reduce the available pool of candidates, apart from reducing course work in doctoral programmes from two years to six months.

Further, the one-year post graduate programmes for executives with prior work experience of at least 5-7 years are set to be converted into two-year MBAs under the Act. This too, IIMs believe, would lower standards and defeat the purpose of conducting one-year MBAs for working professionals.

The year ended with directors of all IIMs and the ministry discussing these issues via video conference in the second week of December 2018. The ball now rests in the ministry's court."
"127","1026412752","2018-12-25","http://risingkashmir.com/news/muslim-women-in-contemporary-times","Muslim women in contemporary times","RisingKashmir",FALSE,"The book begins with an introduction and followed by twelve chapters of different dimensions regarding the position of women in Islam. The first chapter entitled 'Roles of Quran and Hadith in Islamic Law' is an exploration of the respective roles of the Quran and the Hadith in Islamic law, emphasizing the Quran's role as the supreme authority followed by a discussion of these two primary sources (Quran and Hadith) of Islamic law.

The author had emphasized the fact that these two sources supersede all claims by all authorities including the founders of the four schools of Sunni law. The author in the second chapter deliberates an extensive discussion on the reward and punishment of men and women as prescribed by the Quran pointing out clearly that both the sexes are treated equally by God in the life hereafter.

The third chapter of the book is focused on the Quran's dealing with the origin of men and women. The chapter also explores how the Quran prescribes complete equality of men and women regarding their origin. The author subsequently had tried to simplify Quran's attitude towards women in the preceding three chapters but the fourth chapter is totally contradictory to the ideas presented by some 'alleged' sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).

The author in this chapter questions the authenticity of these 'alleged sayings' and shows why they cannot be accepted as genuine. However, the author seems misrepresenting various things and didn't owe any explanations to them.

The fifth chapter entitled as ""Rules of Marriage in Islam"" starts with various forms of marriage in pre-Islamic Arabia. As the background of Islamic rules on this subject, the author had raised few important questions why muta (temporary) marriage, concubinage, and the rules of akfa are contrary to the rules of marriage in Islam.

The chapter then turns to discuss specific aspects of Islamic marriage including the independence of Muslim women to marry without a marriage guardian; child marriages; polygamous marriages; and marriages of Muslims with non-Muslims. The author however in this chapter is very much inconsistent while discussing the inter-community marriages.

The author in the sixth chapter had explored the respective positions of the husband and wife as prescribed by Islam and have endeavored to explain whether equality exists within this relationship or not. The seventh chapter's subject matter is on the rules of dissolution of marriage in Islam where the author had subdivided it into three topics, namely, unilateral dissolution of the marriage by the husband; the wife's right to divorce her husband; and the roles of the court and of the arbitrators in the dissolution of marriage.

While discussing the unilateral dissolution of the marriage by the husband, the author had tried to remain engrossed on the current practice of talaq (divorce) in one sitting and dispensing with the intervention of arbitrators in talaq. The eighth chapter directly addresses the rights of men and women in custody and access to children.

The ninth chapter deals with the financial and economic provisions for women in Islam. This chapter is divided into three subtopics, namely, women's rights of inheritance; women's rights of maintenance from her husband or from her husband's estate; and women's right of mahr (dower). The author claims that the inferior rights of women in inheritance have traditionally been controversial.

When addressing this issue he had tried to show that the lesser rights of women can be remedied by the wills of a testator. The tenth chapter is revolved around the Islamic rules regarding the women as witnesses. The author had tried to dissect the discourse about women's equality with men in this sphere but there are some arguments which are not convincing enough for the reader.

The author in the last two chapters (eleventh and twelfth) had dealt with two of the most controversial topics relating to women. In discussing Islamic rules regarding the seclusion of women in chapter eleven, the author points out that the current Islamic practice in many parts of the world is far from the rules laid down by the Quran and the Hadith. The questionable practice of seclusion of Muslim women in some societies is challenged, and a woman's right to participate in all activities of society is affirmed.

The twelfth chapter which is more controversial explores the woman's right to participate in politics and to become a head of state. The author demonstrates that this subject has invited a great deal of interest among both Muslims and non-Muslims, especially since the election of three Muslim women to the position of prime minister namely Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan, Khaleda Zia and HasinaWajed in Bangladesh and Sukornoputri in Indonesia.

The author calls this alleged saying and refutes the fact that the Prophet (PBUH) had opposed women's promotion to the position of head of state. Ironically, the author (though misleadingly) stresses upon the fact that there is nothing wrong or un-Islamic for a Muslim woman to be elevated to this position.

The book over all is a good read and may introduce the reader to the basis for calling for a reform of the position of Muslim women in contemporary times. However, the problematic part of it is that the author had miserably failed to comprehend the subsequent backlashes if these so called 'reforms' are reinforced in the present day Muslim world.

Not only this, the author had put sweeping arguments at various points of instances to demonstrate his line of thinking. The meager and less explained argument(s) on the part of the author leaves his account wanting in integrity and sincerity. Toeing the feministic line by the author also makes this book more contested in terms of its objectivity."

On the sidewalks of Shanghai and Beijing, once bright-yellow Ofo bicycles lie in varying states of disrepair - chains unhooked, wheels buckled and paint starting to fade - reflecting the quick rise and sharp fall of the Chinese bike-sharing startup.

Millions of Ofo users are clamoring for their deposits to be returned and the firm's founder has admitted considering bankruptcy.

Ofo's plight is a warning for China's tech investors, who have plowed tens of billions of dollars into loss-making businesses such as bike sharing, ride hailing and food delivery. Not long ago, Ofo was racing into markets overseas and raising billions from backers including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and Didi Chuxing.

""It now appears bike sharing is the stupidest business, but the smartest brains of China all tried to get in,"" Wu Shenghua, founder of now bankrupted bike-sharing company 3Vbike, told Reuters. ""It really now seems ridiculous.""

Ofo was a phenomenon. Its dock-less bicycles, which could be picked up by scanning a QR code and left anywhere, grew from Beijing campuses to become an icon of young, urban cool. The firm garnered a valuation of $2 billion.

Its bicycles - and those of main rival Mobike - could be found on almost every city street corner, often in staggering numbers. Ofo's advertisements featured major Chinese popstars and showed trendy youngsters pedaling around the hippest areas of town.

Dozens of smaller rivals emerged in China over the last two years, only to go out of business, leaving Ofo, fellow Alibaba-backed Hellobike, and Mobike, backed by Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings (0700.HK), as the major players.

But costly battles for market share have meant Ofo and its rivals have struggled to turn popularity into profit. Ofo's very survival is now at risk as debts to suppliers have come due and user demands for deposits have mounted.

""It's a very tricky business, all the profits are eaten away by competition. It's something that really needs to be part of a bigger business,"" said Maxwell Zhou, founder of tech startup metaapp.cn and a former employee of Mobike in China.

""It's very similar to email in that way. It has a lot of benefits for society, but none of the email providers were able to create a barrier to entry, so anybody could host emails, and eventually nobody could make any money.""

Global Expansion

At its peak, Ofo had bike fleets in more than 20 countries, from France to Australia and the United States. Company insiders, however, said it tried to grow too fast, and found itself facing a wide array of hurdles, from traffic regulations to vandalism, as well as spiraling costs.

""In retrospect of course there was problem with management, and we were expanding too rapidly,"" said a former Ofo executive who worked on international expansion, asking not to be named.

The firm has pulled back from markets like Israel, Germany and the United States, and has been forced to sell assets, including some bikes for as little as $2, the person said.

Ofo and Alibaba did not respond to requests for comment.

The former executive pointed to an unsuccessful push into Japan, where the firm had looked to expand in a partnership with SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T). That plan went sour after a breakdown in takeover talks with SoftBank-backed Didi Chuxing, said the executive.

With bikes sitting in storage, fees piled up. ""We lost a lot of money, and now the bikes are still stuck in warehouses,"" said the executive.

Didi declined to comment but pointed to earlier statements saying it had never intended to buy Ofo and promised to keep supporting its ""independent development"" in the future.

Credit Blacklist

In China, once-loyal users have turned on Ofo, lining up at its offices in Beijing to demand the return of deposits paid up-front to use the service. Over 12 million people have so far requested repayment online.

Jiang Zhe, 21, a university student in Beijing, said he usually bought a month pass for Ofo bikes, but has lately struggled because so many are broken. ""I haven't used Ofo recently because I can't find any working bikes,"" he said.

He is now one of the many seeking a refund.

In a letter to employees last week, Ofo CEO Dai Wei said the company was struggling to resolve a cash shortage, in part because of user refunds as well as payments to suppliers. He said the firm was battling on amid ""pain and hopelessness"".

A court in Beijing has placed Dai on a credit blacklist that restricts him from going to fancy hotels, traveling first class or sending his children to expensive schools, according to the court's Dec. 4 order seen by Reuters.

The rare near-implosion of a wildly popular and innovative firm in China has spooked some authorities. The transportation ministry said on Friday it was asking Ofo to optimize its refund procedure, but also called on the public to be more ""tolerant"" to allow domestic innovation to thrive.

Many weren't convinced, including the former Ofo executive.

""It would be tough for the company to get back to its golden days, I don't think it can be like before. I think most people are really just waiting for the final days,"" he said."

""Schools should admit children without Aadhaar and ensure that children are given Aadhaar once they are in schools by arranging special camps for them,"" he added.

UIDAI has asked the school authorities and their management to ensure that no child is denied admission for lack of Aadhaar. Pandey added, doing so would be considered as ""contempt of court"".

The word of caution from UIDAI comes at a time when admissions to nursery and entry-level classes have just begun in over 1,500 private schools in Delhi.

In September this year, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar but clipped the scope of the biometric identity project, ruling it was not mandatory for bank accounts, mobile connections or school admissions.

The apex court held that Aadhaar would remain compulsory for filing of Income Tax (IT) returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN), as well as welfare schemes.

The SC verdict emphasised that it would not be mandatory for school admissions, as also for the examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for medical entrance and the University Grants Commission."

We weren't even a single mass of land. Mumbai, or Bombay -- I'm not getting political here, but the city has had over 20 names since its inception -- started off as an archipelago of seven islands, which were just part of one ruling empire or another. Not till the seven islands were gifted as a dowry to the King of England in 1661, and eventually handed over to the British East India company in 1667 for a princely sum total of 10 Pounds per annum, did the development of Mumbai as the trading hub we know it as today, began.

While the Portuguese arrived in Mumbai much before the British, ruling the seven islands from the northern bastion on Bassein (current day Vasai), part of their key responsibilities was missionary work. Till the 1660s, the islands of Bombay were dotted with Catholic Churches, with St Michael's Church in Mahim dating back to 1534, St Andrews in Bandra established in 1575, followed by other churches in Dadar (Church of Our Lady of Salvation aka Portuguese Church), Byculla (Gloria Church) and so on.

Well, the English settlers weren't Catholics and in effect, only had makeshift chapels to worship in.

The first place of public worship for the followers of the Anglican Church came up on Christmas day, 300 years ago, in the form of St Thomas' Church.

But first, some history

Back when Mumbai was still an archipelago, the first thing that was done on the main H-shaped island of Bombay, was fortification. Be mindful that the East India Company was a trading company and India was not under the British Crown yet. So like any trading organisation at the time, they had to protect their land. The reason that the area around the current day CST station is called Fort is that there actually stood a fort surrounded by a moat -- protecting the island of Bombay and its natural deep-water harbour (the reason the East India Company was interested in Bombay in the first place) from marauders and pirates.

To enter this fortified city, there were three gates which led the way in. The gate at the northern-most end was called the Bazaar Gate -- that's where the Crawford Market exists now. The southern-most gate which was called the Apollo Gate is where current day Gateway of India stands currently. The gate in between was called the Church Gate -- the location of Flora Fountain. And no, that naming convention had nothing to do with the railway station of the same name nearby. In fact, it was the other way round.

Why it was called the Church Gate, you ask? Well, imagine you are standing outside this Church Gate before the 1860s, what you would then see in front of you was an archway, and through this archway you could see the spire of the St Thomas' Church.

Erstwhile Church Gate with St Thomas in the background. Archival image

St Thomas' Church is what gave the name to the gate, and eventually to the station beside it.

St Thomas' Church was the first Anglican Church in Mumbai, named after St Thomas, one of the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ and among the only ones to have had come to India. The foundation stone was laid in 1674 after the then Governor of Bombay Presidency, Gerald Aungier wrote to the Court of Directors for assistance ""to erect a small church for public worship in the centre of town"" according to Dr V Gupchup's St Thomas Cathedral Bombay: A Witness to History. But from 1675 to 1715, barely any work took place. The funds collected for the construction of the cathedral mysteriously disappeared. What we had, instead of a fully constructed church, was five metre high walls.

After 40 year slumber, church work begins

From 21 September 1714 to 19 June 1715, the then East India Company Chaplain, Richard Cobbe, carried out the service inside two rooms in a building in Fort. Cobbe wasn't too pleased with the unsuitable nature of these services which were carried out in such a private manner. In 1715, Cobbe took over the second part of the construction of this church with a resolve to finish it.

""I ventured to propose the building of a Church for God's honour and service, according to the rule of the Church of England, that all island might feel we had some religion among us,"" writes Cobbe in his book, Bombay Church: Or, a True Account of the Building and Finishing the English Church at Bombay in the East Indies.

19 June 1715, being the first Sunday after Trinity, is when Cobbe recommended a Sermon to preach about building a proper church to have a more public celebration of God. After that, work on the incomplete church began in all earnestness. Cobbe wrote to a whole bunch on probable financiers, requesting them to donate funds for the building of this church. Everyone from the East India Company to businessmen operating out of Surat to Persian businessmen were approached and they donated. The exchange of letters between Cobbe and the benefactors went on from July 1715 to 1720. A sum total of Rs 43,992 was collected in all.

On Christmas Day in 1718, 300 years ago, is when the first service was held in this church.

But it wasn't until July 1837 that the Church was consecrated as a Cathedral, which coincided with the appointment of the first Bishop of Bombay Thomas Carr -- a life-size memorial to whom lies just on the right side of the altar.

A work in progress, reflecting the growing city

The St Thomas' Cathedral as it exists today, was not how it looked in 1718 when it began its public services. In fact, the neo-gothic style of architecture whose interiors are inspired by St Thomas Cathedral in Ireland, got additional elements as the decades passed and funds were easier to come by. Thanks in part to the cotton and opium traders of the time. Many portions of the church were added in the following years. For instance, the tower and clock were added in 1838. The inner chancel was renovated and enlarged in 1860 along with the external buttresses.

It was almost like the church was growing along with the city. From a non-important back of the beyond, to a powerful financial hub during the British era -- the seeds for making Mumbai the financial hub that it is today were planted back in those days.

More than a church

St Thomas' Cathedral is unlike most other churches in Mumbai. The walls of the cathedral are decorated with beautiful poignant sculptures and bas-reliefs of soldiers lost to war, memorials to prominent personalities who have left their stamp in Mumbai's history, such as JA Ballard (after whom the Ballard Estate is named), and much more. The marble plaques remembering fallen soldiers have been financed mostly by their comrades or family members. Unlike the Afghan Church in Colaba, which was built in memoriam of Indian and British soldiers who died in the Anglo-Afghan War, the St Thomas Cathedral has more Anglican memorials.

The altar windows were designed in the 1800s by Victorian stained glass designer and manufacturer, Charles Kempe. There's an interesting bit of anecdote behind that as well. Kempe had hoped to become a priest of the Cathedral, but was prevented by his stammer. However, he said, ""If I was not permitted to minister in the Sanctuary, I would use my talents to adorn it."" And his artwork is there for all to see. The Cathedral is blessed with some impressive stained glass work. Enter the church and look right and you have a stained glass work showcasing St Thomas with the Holy Bible flanked by St Gabriel and St Michael. As you walk down towards the apse, the semi-circular wall also has fine stained glass work, some of which had to be restored over the years.

Back in those days, every church was associated with a school and St Thomas' Cathedral was instrumental in the creation of one of the most popular schools in Mumbai, the Cathedral and John Connon School in 1860.

The Cathedral also saw almost all the baptisms that took place among all the Anglican churches in Bombay back in the 1800s and early 1900s. It kept records of not just baptisms but also marriages and death in all of Bombay Presidency (an area encompassing Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, and parts of Sindh region). A register of these records has an entry of a very prominent person's baptism on 22 January 1866. The son of John Lockwood and Alice Kipling -- Joseph Rudyard Kipling -- was baptised in this very Cathedral. Yes, the author of books such as The Jungle Book and Kim, was a Bombay boy.

It was also considered to be the 'Zero Point' or the centre of the city. The 16 milestones laid across erstwhile Bombay used the Cathedral as the starting point. Come to think of it, the towering spires of the Cathedral back in the day made it the most prominent landmark on the Bombay island.

For probably the first time in the Cathedral's history, some of its artefacts -- around 41 in all -- have been showcased at the ongoing exhibition The Living Cathedral at the Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vaastu Sangrahalay. These artefacts include the Holy Bible that was used to read out from 1870, silver chalices and flagons, a Bishop's staff which has carvings of Jesus as a shepherd, fading black and white portraits of Bishops from years ago and much more. The exhibit is a good journey of the cathedral along with the city in which it existed.

But I'd say, visit the Cathedral instead if you haven't already. Even if you have, visit again, especially now that it has been decorated like a shining star. Walk around its premises, admire the supporting buttresses behind the chancel.

If there was one underrated gem in Mumbai, this is it.

A proposal for 20 such schools with low enrolment was cleared by the north corporation's House meeting on Monday. These will give rise to 10 new schools.

Located mostly in the Karol Bagh, Narela and Rohini zones, these schools are currently running at places like Inderpuri, Pyare Lal Road, Shahbad Daulatpur, Nimari Colony, Shiv Nagar, Pratap Kunj, Avantika, Sangam Park, Molar Basti, Old Ranjeet Nagar, Azadpur Colony and Auchandi.

A senior corporation official attributed the decision to low enrolment, poor finances, and proper utilisation of resources. He gave the example of the proposal to merge Municipal Corporation Primary School (MCPS) Pyare Lal Road 2 and MCPS New Dev Nagar Co-ed School. ""Keeping in view better management, saving of posts and the poor economic condition of north corporation, it would be feasible to merge schools in case of availability of accommodation,"" he said.

The proposal also argues that more and more parents want to educate their wards in morning-shift schools. ""MCPS Pyarelal Road has 202 kids while the Dev Nagar school has 265. After merger, a school with 467 kids and 12 sections will be formed,"" the official said.

He added: ""There are many vacancies in other schools and the staff from the schools being closed down can be sent there. At the same time, we will be able to use the buildings and other infrastructure for purposes such as sports academies.""

The merger of the two schools alone would lead to a surplus of a principal, five teachers and two Class IV employees who could be reassigned. The official also said that 29 schools with low enrolment had been similarly shut down two years ago. But education experts have been criticising the corporations for their failure to enrol more children.

Khagesh Jha, a Supreme Court lawyer and education activist, remarked, ""If the corporation has extra land, why not add to the capital's school infrastructure so that more kids can be brought in the school system? There are more than 20 lakh kids outside the school system in the city. Besides, children from unrecognised schools too need to be brought to government schools.""

The north civic body runs 714 municipal primary schools, in which children, mostly from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, study. Enrolment in all corporation-run schools, however, has been declining steadily. Around 70,000 students have opted out of north schools since the 2012 trifurcation. It then had 3,70,648 students in its primary schools. This figure slid to 3,50,611 in 2013-14 and 3,14,022 in 2016-17. At present, around three lakh students are on the rolls."

One of parents got suspicious and applied a Right to Information (RTI). The reply revealed that the school didn't have CBSE board affiliation.

After removing the signboard from the main gate of the school, the school has conducted a meeting with the Parent Teacher Association. But not all parents are aware of the status about CBSE affiliation as the school has decided to inform about the same in January month next year.

One of the parents, said, ""The school represented themselves in front of child rights commission and also in Bombay high court as CBSE board affiliated school despite not getting any affiliation from the board which is illegal. We took admission for our children thinking its CBSE affiliated school and now school says they have not yet received affiliation. This amounts to cheating the parents.

It's BSP (Bijli, Sadak and Pani) for a common man. In a city like Nagpur, it means Metro rail, cement roads, international schools and institutions like IIM, AIIMS and VNIT. Even for the Centre and state governments, the definition more or less remains the same.

Just 40km from the city, this definition, however, has gone for a toss. A visit to a couple of villages under Kuhi tehsil in Nagpur district, which have been affected by Gosikhurd dam, would shatter anything imagined under the name of development.

These remote villages, Sonarwahi and Pipri Munje, which lack even basic amenities, were partially submerged by the rising dam waters when the diarist visited them.

It all started when the aggrieved villagers, who had approached the high court with their grievances, bumped into the diarist. None believed them till they showed us actual photographs of how their everyday life is nothing short of a struggle.

Prodded by a colleague, we decided to visit ground zero. On reaching close to Sonarwahi, we were told to park our taxi near an Anganwadi, as road didn't exist beyond that point. The village was over 3km away from there and we had to walk through a marshy land. Thankfully, there was no rain, else we would have to wade through knee-deep water, something which the villagers are accustomed to.

On reaching the destination after a long trek, the situation seemed grimmer than we expected. About 16-odd families lived there under constant fear of submergence as the dam water had reached just half km from their huts and had already submerged their farms. With this they had lost their only source of income.

The kids weren't attending school for a year as the nearest Anganwadi is over 3km away. The power supply is erratic and available only in the night hours. Degree-holder youths work as farm labourers in nearby villages due to lack of jobs.

Pipri Munje was nothing short of a nightmare. We travelled on a small boat for about six kms, without any life jackets or safety gear. We waded through uneven surfaces, our boat got stuck in soil at some places while the water was very deep in other parts. At some places, top of big trees were at handshake distance, while at some places even the grass could be touched.

About 400 persons are unwilling to move to their rehabilitated place which lacked any facilities. Many of them were forced to buy boats after dam water turned their village into an island. The villagers somehow survive on crops grown on their partially submerged farms, and face problems like lack of water and erratic power supply. Most of the youths in both the villages weren't getting brides to marry them due to these issues.

Our tour was nothing short of an adventure. But the villagers there still live in dark ages and in constant fear of death. It's very unlikely the situation will change.

"149","1025864958","2018-12-24","https://thewire.in/urban/cold-pollution-delhi-homeless-shelters","Biting Cold and Pollution Force Delhi's Homeless into Shelters","The Wire",FALSE,"New Delhi: The onset of extremely cold conditions in northwestern plains of India has resulted in a deadly cocktail of chilly weather and pollution in New Delhi and surrounding areas. While the chill has got the poor and the homeless scrambling to shelter homes for cover, the general populace is left exposed to dangerously high particulate levels in the air.

Pre-Christmas cold catches many off-guard

The pre-Christmas cold this year has been surprising. Delhi on Sunday recorded its lowest morning temperature in four years at 3.7 degrees celsius. While for the weatherman this may not be out of the ordinary, over the past few years Delhites got used to experiencing such cold late in December or early January.

It is for this reasons that most of the schools in Delhi NCR have still not taken their winter recess. Most of them are scheduled to reopen after the Christmas break. In both adjoining Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, most of the schools are only scheduled to break for winter from next week.

SC monitoring has helped improve facilities for homeless

The worst hit by the cold are the homeless. Under the supervision of a Supreme Court-monitored committee, the Delhi government has developed an organised system of night shelters over the last five years. The death of around 164 people due to cold conditions in 2015-16 led to a lot of improvements in the night shelter scheme.

There are now 248 night shelters in the national capital. Of these, 83 operate out of permanent buildings, 115 from porta-cabins while 50 run from European style fireproof tents. These are managed by the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board in association with non-governmental organisations and are being prepared to take in 19,000 people this year.

The shelters have been planned to cater to the poor across the city. The general benchmark is having one for every 10,000 people. Despite the spread, it is believed that they accessible to all the homeless and poor.

Snacks and hot water facilities being added

Last year, as against a capacity of over 17,000 beds, these shelters received only about 14,000 people. So this year, it was even decided to provide snacks in the form of tea and toasts to those coming in. But while that program was to kick in from the new year, the cold set in early.

All the shelters are providing a sheet, pillow, mattress and blankets to the visitors. Television sets have also been provided to keep the sojourners engaged. Arrangements for hot water have also been made in over 70 shelters this year. Constant vigil is also kept by caretakers and government staff to ensure that unwanted elements are kept out.

Those availing these shelters are usually the homeless or the casual workers, who normally sleep in the open or in covered spaces near their place of work.

As per a 2014 survey, Delhi has about 16,760 homeless. The United Nations Development Program put their numbers at 55,955. Unofficial estimates, however, suggest there are over 1.5 lakh people who live on the streets.

Strict rules make many still prefer sleeping in the open

While statistics dictate there should be a greater demand for these shelters (as there is no charge in winters), it has not been the case. Many poor and destitute still prefer sleeping in the open. The primary reason being that there are restrictions in place on entering shelter homes for those who are inebriated or under the influence of drugs. Also, many poor people believe they would get clothes, blankets and even money in alms if they would stay put in the open.

Low wind speed, burning of wood and waste take pollution to alarming levels

The cold conditions also lead to burning of a lot of bonfires as people adopt different means to stay warm. From wood to plastics and rubber tyres, every thing that can give heat is set alight. This along with low wind speeds has contributed to higher particulate matter levels in Delhi.

According to Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) data, pollution levels have again reached alarming levels in many parts of the city.

At the book release programme organized by the Mangaluru Bar Association here on Monday, Nazeer said the book is deeply insightful and scholarly.

""Moily writes in the first chapter what is plaguing the Indian judiciary. He also has suggested us to adopt Singapore model. He says the three biggest impediments to ensuring excess of justice are huge backlog of cases, lack of awareness about legal rights and the financial inability to seek effective representation. Moily opines that lower judiciary can significantly contribute towards the removal of these impediments. In my own observation, the backlog of cases is the most important reason that is plaguing the Indian judiciary,"" Nazeer said.

The book can be introduced into the curriculum in national law schools and each chapter in the book needs to be topic of debates, he added.

In his review, senior advocate M K Vijayakumar said Moily has not touched upon even a single aspect of politics in his book.

""Moily recommends reformation, modernisation and drastic changes in judiciary to speed up the process of justice. He refers to the Law Commission's recommendation that the Supreme Court will have to be split up or a part of the Supreme Court should be constituted only for the disposal of Constitutional matters. It is suggested in his book that there should be four appellate courts from the Constitution court in four cities to deal with all the rest of the cases.

He emphasized on the need for setting up an Indian Judicial Service so that the judiciary will get most talented judges in the nation. ""Let there be a National Judicial Service.

When Myanmar security forces launched its now notorious ""clearance operations"" in western Rakhine state in August 2017, it was not the first time the country's Rohingya Muslim minority had fled en masse into neighboring Bangladesh.

But a failed attempt to repatriate a first group to Myanmar in November and the construction of solid, concrete buildings on an island off the Bangladeshi coast signal an entirely new situation is emerging: a Palestine-like scenario with a permanent, stateless and impoverished refugee population ripe for exploitation by extremist groups in South and Southeast Asia.The dailyReport Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox

More than 720,000 Rohingyas fled Myanmar's brutal security force crackdown, adding to another few hundred thousand that were already in Bangladesh. The United Nations has indicated the forced expulsion represented crimes against humanity and may have been driven by ""genocidal intent.""

A first batch of 2,200 refugees was supposed to have been repatriated on November 15, but none agreed to return if their demands for citizenship and justice for the atrocities they had been subjected to were met.

That, of course, was a non-starter as the government in Naypyitaw is highly unlikely to grant the Rohingya, who they consider illegal migrants from Bangladesh, citizenship or accept responsibility for an offensive security officials say was a legitimate response to Rohingya insurgent attacks on border guard posts.

Myanmar's military leaders, now struggling to stay out of the reach of The Hague's International Criminal Court, where they could potentially face genocide charges for their 2017 crackdown, have not faced any moves domestically to seek justice for the widespread death and destruction.

Plans to relocate as many as 100,000 Rohingya refugees to Bangladesh's Bhasan Char Island would ease pressure on the overcrowded camps on the Myanmar border, but it is unclear how refugees with few skills and no resources would survive on a small, isolated and barren island located in one of the world's most cyclone-prone areas.

Construction on the island is reportedly proceeding apace, although no relocation is expected to take place before Bangladesh's general election on December 30. Rohingya refugees are already reportedly reluctant to move to the island.

The election will also decide whether the more secular Awami League remains in power, or if the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which includes among its top allies Islamic groups such as the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, will take over.

The situation today is in sharp contrast to 1978 and 1991-1992, when hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas similarly fled persecution to Bangladesh. In 1978, the Myanmar government launched an operation code-named Naga Min, or King of Dragons, which aimed at identifying illegal immigrants across the country.

The campaign began in Kachin and Shan states, where many Chinese were believed to have taken shelter, but it quickly turned into a massive violent crackdown on the Rohingyas when the military reached Rakhine state.

Despite reports of rape, arson and murder, the then ruling military got support from even its most vocal domestic critics, who shared the view that the Rohingyas are not indigenous but rather ""Bengali settlers"" from Bangladesh.

An estimated 200,000 Rohingyas fled across the border, but were allowed to return when Myanmar and Bangladesh, after a stream of protests mainly from Islamic countries leading to intervention by the United Nations, reached an agreement in July 1978.

Many, however, filtered back into Bangladesh when they found that their old homes in Myanmar had been razed and their land had been taken over by new ethnic Burman or Rakhine settlers. In early 1991, thousands of Rohingyas once again began streaming across the border, bringing with them tales of forcible eviction from their homes, and the destruction of mosques and Islamic schools.

By 1992, more than 200,000 refugees were living in makeshift camps across the border in Bangladesh until a repatriation agreement was reached under the auspices of the United Nations. During the 1992 crisis, Prince Khaled Sultan Abdul Aziz, commander of the Saudi contingent in the 1991 Gulf War, visited Dhaka and lashed out against the Myanmar government for its persecution of the Rohingyas.

Then, he publicly recommended a ""Desert Storm-like"" action against Myanmar, similar to the US military intervention that liberated Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. No such action was taken against Myanmar, but it was a clear sign of the wider Muslim world's interest in the Rohingyas plight.

The first was in 1978, when the immensely wealthy Saudi Arabian charity Rabitat-al-Alam-al-Islami sent aid to the refugees and built a hospital, mosque and madrasa for them at Ukhia, south of Cox's Bazar in southeastern Bangladesh.

Saudi religious teachers were sent to Ukhia, and the radicalization of some Rohingya leaders and activists began. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Rohingya Solidarity Organization (RSO), the main militant group among them, forged links with the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and, especially, its even more radical youth wing, the Islami Chhatra Shibir.

With those new connections, the RSO also contacted Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hizb-e-Islami in Afghanistan and likeminded organizations in Pakistan, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Afghan instructors were even sent to RSO's camp near Ukhia, while about a hundred RSO militants went to Afghanistan to undergo military training with Hizb-e-Islami in the province of Khost.

Today's main political and military organization among the Rohingyas, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) or, as it is better known locally, Harakah al-Yaqin -- the Faith Movement -- has its roots in radical milieus in Karachi, Pakistan.

There, several hundred thousand first, second and third generation Rohingyas, many descendants of Muslims who left Myanmar after World War II, live in impoverished suburbs. Nearly all of them are stateless, although they have lived in Pakistan for generations, with most of them born in the country.

The areas where the Rohingya live in Karachi have long served as hotbeds for extremist activities; many were among those recruited to fight in the wars in Afghanistan. ARSA's leader, Ataullah abu Ammar Junjuni, also known as Hafiz Tohar, was born in Karachi and received madrasa education in Saudi Arabia.

According to recent reports from the camps in Bangladesh, the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen (JMB), an Islamic organization operating in Bangladesh which is listed as a terror group in the United Kingdom, is bidding to cultivate links with the Rohingyas.

JMB is believed to have been involved in several bomb attacks in Bangladesh and its stated aim is to replace the country's democracy with an Islamic state based on Sharia law.

It is uncertain to what extent the group has been able to link up with militants among the Rohingyas, but the Bangladesh Daily Star reported on December 13 that the country's Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit had arrested three JMB members who were ""providing training to Rohingya refugees.""

A CTTC official was quoted as saying that the JMB has ""been working in the Rohingya camps"" with its military chief ""providing training to refugees since 2016."" Those accusations could augur a militant response when Myanmar's civil and military authorities refuse to yield to the demands of the refugees, including their calls for citizenship and justice.

The radicalization of Rohingyas, which began in the late 1970s, is bound to continue in the current Palestine-like situation. Analysts say that could lead to more ARSA cross-border raids, similar to the ones in August last year that prompted the Myanmar military to unleash its campaign of terror in Rohingya-inhabited areas of northern Rakhine state.

A permanent refugee population in Bangladesh, and possible alliances between various groups of militants, could also have grave implications for the domestic security situation in that country, similar to the volatility seen in Lebanon and other Middle Eastern countries where Palestinian refugees have been languishing for more than half a century.

The Modi-led government started the Swadhar Greh scheme for homeless women in 2015. The Ministry of Women and Child Development released funds to the tune of nearly Rs 200 crore to 559 shelter homes. What is all that money meant to do?

The funds are supposed to be used to house homeless women in need of shelter, and to provide skills training so that they can look for work and become financially independent. They are supposed to shelter women between the age group of 18-60 years.

But the National Commission For Women (NCW) submitted a report to the ministry in December revealing the 'poor and deplorable' condition in 25 out of 26 homes in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal.

According to the Chairperson of NCW, Rekha Sharma, the licences of the NGO running these homes should be cancelled immediately.

""They (Ministry for Women and Children) have a mechanism to check on shelter homes immediately. If we (Central government) are providing money to the shelter homes, then it should go into the right hands, it shouldn't be misused. Before giving out the next budgets, a proper check should be carried out on each and every NGO that is running a shelter house. Or else their licences should be cancelled, or we should invite new NGOs.""Rekha Sharma, Chairperson, National Commission for Women

The government is yet to take any action based on the report.

Major Findings

Some of the major findings of the NCW mentioned inadequate facilities and unclean, even dangerous conditions in the shelter homes: ""Unkempt mentally ill-women with no medical aid,"" ""dirty and unhygienic kitchens,"" ""cramped rooms, no beds or mattresses to sleep on"".

The report says some women complained of being forced to live in the shelter home rather than just stay to gain skills, while others detailed accounts of physical torture and a lack of counselling facilities. Some NGOs were even running these government shelters as hostels, illegally charging these destitute women fees for their stay.

The NCW has made strong recommendations to the Ministry of Women and Child Development to try and address these problems. They include measures like only employing women to run the homes, ensuring these homes aren't located in isolated, remote areas, and insisting that proper records of all these homes are maintained across the country.

According to the report, the PML-N leader is expected to be transported to Adiala Jail shortly.

It said the verdict was announced almost immediately after Sharif arrived in the courtroom.

""There are only three main political parties in Delhi. Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi have told so many lies that no other person can surpass them,"" he said.

""But I want to ask: why did the Congress protect the guilty person and why it did not take action at the right time?""

""On the other hand, you must have seen a drama in Delhi Assembly which is like rubbing salt in the wounds of Sikhs by Aam Aadmi Party. Today the AAP and Congress have been exposed,"" he said.

Arguing that easy availability of several mobile applications that act as a breeding ground for the sexual abuse of children online were fast growing, Chandrasekhar rued that the IT ministry that Prasad heads has done little to curb the menace and requested shutting down of apps that threaten children's safety.

""There is an exponential growth in a few short video mobile apps due to their simple-to-navigate interface, and free availability on Google Play or App Store.

On the sidewalks of Shanghai and Beijing, once bright-yellow Ofo bicycles lie in varying states of disrepair - chains unhooked, wheels buckled and paint starting to fade - reflecting the quick rise and sharp fall of the Chinese bike-sharing startup.

Millions of Ofo users are clamouring for their deposits to be returned and the firm's founder has admitted considering bankruptcy.

Ofo's plight is a warning for China's tech investors, who have ploughed tens of billions of dollars into loss-making businesses such as bike sharing, ride hailing and food delivery. Not long ago, Ofo was racing into markets overseas and raising billions from backers including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Didi Chuxing.

""It now appears bike sharing is the stupidest business, but the smartest brains of China all tried to get in,"" Wu Shenghua, founder of now bankrupted bike-sharing company 3Vbike, told Reuters. ""It really now seems ridiculous.""

Advertising

Ofo was a phenomenon. Its dock-less bicycles, which could be picked up by scanning a QR code and left anywhere, grew from Beijing campuses to become an icon of young, urban cool. The firm garnered a valuation of $2 billion.

Its bicycles - and those of main rival Mobike - could be found on almost every city street corner, often in staggering numbers. Ofo's advertisements featured major Chinese popstars and showed trendy youngsters pedalling around the hippest areas of town.

Dozens of smaller rivals emerged in China over the last two years, only to go out of business, leaving Ofo, fellow Alibaba-backed Hellobike, and Mobike, backed by Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings, as the major players.

But costly battles for market share have meant Ofo and its rivals have struggled to turn popularity into profit. Ofo's very survival is now at risk as debts to suppliers have come due and user demands for deposits have mounted.

""It's a very tricky business, all the profits are eaten away by competition. It's something that really needs to be part of a bigger business,"" said Maxwell Zhou, founder of tech startup metaapp.cn and a former employee of Mobike in China.

""It's very similar to email in that way. It has a lot of benefits for society, but none of the email providers were able to create a barrier to entry, so anybody could host emails, and eventually nobody could make any money.""

GLOBAL EXPANSION

At its peak, Ofo had bike fleets in more than 20 countries, from France to Australia and the United States. Company insiders, however, said it tried to grow too fast, and found itself facing a wide array of hurdles, from traffic regulations to vandalism, as well as spiralling costs.

""In retrospect of course there was problem with management, and we were expanding too rapidly,"" said a former Ofo executive who worked on international expansion, asking not to be named.

The firm has pulled back from markets like Israel, Germany and the United States, and has been forced to sell assets, including some bikes for as little as $2, the person said.

Ofo and Alibaba did not respond to requests for comment.

The former executive pointed to an unsuccessful push into Japan, where the firm had looked to expand in a partnership with SoftBank Group Corp. That plan went sour after a breakdown in takeover talks with SoftBank-backed Didi Chuxing, said the executive.

With bikes sitting in storage, fees piled up. ""We lost a lot of money, and now the bikes are still stuck in warehouses,"" said the executive.

Didi declined to comment but pointed to earlier statements saying it had never intended to buy Ofo and promised to keep supporting its ""independent development"" in the future.

CREDIT BLACKLIST

In China, once-loyal users have turned on Ofo, lining up at its offices in Beijing to demand the return of deposits paid up-front to use the service. Over 12 million people have so far requested repayment online.

Jiang Zhe, 21, a university student in Beijing, said he usually bought a month pass for Ofo bikes, but has lately struggled because so many are broken.

""I haven't used Ofo recently because I can't find any working bikes,"" he said.

He is now one of the many seeking a refund.

In a letter to employees last week, Ofo CEO Dai Wei said the company was struggling to resolve a cash shortage, in part because of user refunds as well as payments to suppliers. He said the firm was battling on amid ""pain and hopelessness"".

A court in Beijing has placed Dai on a credit blacklist that restricts him from going to fancy hotels, travelling first class or sending his children to expensive schools, according to the court's Dec. 4 order seen by Reuters.

The rare near-implosion of a wildly popular and innovative firm in China has spooked some authorities. The transportation ministry said on Friday it was asking Ofo to optimise its refund procedure, but also called on the public to be more ""tolerant"" to allow domestic innovation to thrive.

Many weren't convinced, including the former Ofo executive.

On December 20, DoE had issued the fourth circular to invite applications for such seats from December 22.

In the meanwhile, admissions for entry-level classes for the 2019-20 session for general category seats have already begun and the process for reserved seats is set to start by the first week of January.

Following a Delhi high court order, DoE had in July notified 3% reservation for CWSN within the 25% seats reserved for the economically weaker sections in compliance with provisions of Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016.

When the first online application was invited, DoE received just 46 applications (3%) for the vacant CWSN seats. The draw of lots was subsequently postponed on account of such low applications. In the second round held in September, DoE finally conducted the draw of lots and admitted 17 students. A fourth circular was finally issued on December 20 to call for fresh applications.

""Despite inviting online applications, 1,268 seats are still vacant. Hence, the department has decided to call for fresh applications from aspirants with disabilities as defined in RPWD Act, 2016 against these reserved available seats,"" said the DoE order.

The details of the schools where seats are vacant were notified by DoE on December 22 and the applications can be filled till December 24. The draw of lots is likely to be held on December 26.

The official document accessed by TOI mentions that skewed admissions have taken place because ""schools are hesitant in accepting"" such students. The district deputy education (DDE) officers have been asked to ensure that no children with special needs are turned away.

Disability rights activists said that schools have been denying admissions as they don't have the requisite facilities to make CWSN students inclusive.

Abha Khetarpal, a counsellor and disability rights activist, said, ""The 3% quota is complete eyewash as the authorities don't check on the schools. The CBSE checklist for schools to become inclusive includes facilities like accessible washrooms, smart boards, etc, but schools don't abide by the norms. There is no mechanism to take action on violations. Moreover, the special educators are not qualified. They are not even equipped to handle a child with epilepsy.""

The PIL for reservation of CWSN was filed in 2014 by the father of a child with special needs. In his plea, he had claimed that the guidelines under Right to Education (RTE) Act completely ignore the interests of children with special needs and disabilities."

""NDA seals deal for Lok Sabha seat-sharing in Bihar"" reads a headline in The Hindu. Hindustan Times leads with it too, reporting the alliance's reformation after Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) left to join the Congress. In the latest development, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (United) will take 17 seats each, while the Lok Janshakti Party -- the newest entrant into the seat sharing deal -- will field candidates for the remaining six. That makes 40 in total.

""The Bharatiya Janata Party's pact with Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) has cemented the wider National Democratic Alliance equation in Bihar"", HT writes in its editorial, ""Only an inclusive NDA -- which has the BJP in senior role as the anchor but not as a hegemonic partner -- can help the party deal with the Opposition challenge.""

In its 'Explained' box, the Indian Express says, ""Ram Vilas Paswan is an important Dalit leader, and his exit would have sent a wrong signal. With the other prominent Dalit leader, Mayawati, firmly against the BJP, the ruling alliance needs a counter balance. Conceding a Rajya Sabha seat to the LJP is not a big ask for the political optics.""

The Express leads with an investigation that finds that the suicide rate in government sponsored Navodaya schools is higher than the national average, at 5.5. Of the 49 students who have committed suicide in the last 5 years, half are Dalit and tribal.

""For every one lakh students studying in these schools, almost six students committed suicide in 2017. This is slightly higher than the national suicide rate for a similar age group in 2015 -- roughly 3 suicides per lakh population aged 6 to 17 years,"" says the report.

""The causes of suicides in JNVs are disparate and range from unrequited love, family problems, corporal punishment or humiliation by teachers, academic pressure, depression, and fight between friends. Of these, the first three are cited most often as reasons behind suicides,"" adds the report.

The Times of India's biggest story of the day is the government's ""last mile push for Ayodhya resolution in SC"". Within, it writes, ""The forceful stance will reflect the state government's, as also the Modi government's, empathy for the urgency with which VHP with the strong backing of RSS -- has taken up its long pending demand for a Ram temple in Ayodhya in recent weeks.""

The BJP hasn't conceded to demands for an ordinance on the matter, ""but the anticipated thrust in the Supreme Court can well be the last opportunity to get a verdict ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,"" writes TOI.

Also making headlines is the government's decision to monitor online content more closely. In ""Govt moves to access and trace all 'unlawful' content online"", The Indian Express reports that amendments to the Information Technology Act could ""make it mandatory for online platforms to ""proactively"" deploy technology, which would enable a ferreting of content seen as ""unlawful"". They also require end-to-end encryption to be broken so that the origin of messages can be traced.""

The report follows orders by the Union government last week, giving ten intelligence agencies the green signal to ""intercept, monitor and decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer.""

TOI is not pleased and says so in its editorial. ""This needs to be tested against the recent nine-judge bench judgment of the Supreme Court, which ruled the right to privacy was integral to the fundamental right to life,"" it writes. ""At the very least, circumstances permitting such surveillance must be very clearly and narrowly defined. Moreover, a measure of judicial oversight can be brought in as well. In the US, security agencies require a court order to read unopened emails. India should consider similar safeguards,"" it said.

The acquittal of all those accused in the Sohrabuddin encounter case finds place in The Hindu's lengthy editorial, calling it the ""failure of justice"". ""It is the prosecution's duty to ensure the safety of witnesses and give them the confidence and courage to speak the truth under oath. While it is perhaps not surprising that witnesses in the police did not support the prosecution, it is disappointing that others could not be encouraged to do so.""

India Today

India Today anchor Pooja Shali discussed whether the BJP-led Union government is targeting Congress-ruled states. Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are believed to be facing issues on the agriculture front in the middle of the rabi season due to shortage of urea in several districts.

Congress spokesperson Vinayak Dalmiya said that BJP is trying to punish the farmers while party spokesperson Aman Sinha commented that charges made against BJP government is baseless.

Dalmiya said, ""This is completely against the principle of cooperative federalism, as BJP has lost in these states due to agrarian crisis they want to punish the farmers.""

Sinha said, ""Why are only the Congress governed states facing money shortage? They are making baseless acquisitions.""

Republic TV

On his show, Republic TV anchor Arnab Goswami asked who has a bigger role in saving democracy -- the government or the opposition.

Goswami said, ""The pseudo-liberal media remained completely kept quiet when Calcutta High Court did not allow BJP to carry out rath yatra in West Bengal.""

Writer Saira Shah Halim pointed out that there is terrorism taking place in the name of cow in the country, while BJP spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam said that pseudo-liberal media does not want to talk about development work done in the last four and a half years.

Halim said, ""It's about time we rephrase our verbiage. There's no such thing as cow vigilantism, it's cow terrorism.""

Islam said, ""You don't want to talk about all the good work we have done in four and a half years. Hence, they talk about cow vigilantism.""

Aaj Tak

Aaj Tak anchor Sweta Singh interviewed Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on the show Seedhi Baat.

Singh asked Pilot if Congress would form a coalition to defeat the BJP-led NDA in the upcoming 2019 general elections.

Pilot replied, ""A rainbow coalition is being made in the country. Very soon you will see all the opposition parties of the country uniting.""

He also pointed out that only Congress can confront BJP at the national stage. As regional parties are also important these days, Congress is willing to ""give and take"".

When asked if Congress would be able to secure majority in the general elections, Pilot replied, ""No matter what, do remember that BJP is not going to form the government.""

Appau, led the judges to seek details on the functioning of the English-medium sections in the State's government-run schools. This initiative has triggered a flurry of questions among stakeholders, such as:

Should spoken English be mandated as an independent subject?

Why are millions of learners unable to acquire even the basic level of competence, although they have been taught English from the first standard?

Are schools equipped to facilitate students' acquisition of oral fluency in English?

What has been the impact of the many training programmes undertaken by various agencies such as the state partnership with the British Council, attempts of DIET, SSA and RSA to transform the pedagogical practices through the year? Nothing seems to explain why despite such well-intentioned efforts, speaking English fluently still remains ""an unachievable goal"".

Not too positive

When asked to describe the images that come to their minds whenever they think of English, Tamil-medium students in Anna University (which gets a huge chunk of students from rural areas who are high scorers in English in their class XII exams -- not less than 90%), describe English as a 'ghost', 'pitch black', 'red colour', 'wild beast chasing', and so on -- obviously only negative ones dominating their psyche. And the teachers in Tamil-medium schools are at a loss to teach English effectively due to their lack of sufficient exposure to the second language, lack of role models (for example, their own teachers), lack of genuine need to employ the language in their day-to-day communication, and the ineffective and insufficient training programmes, making them diffident and undoubtedly. Besides this vicious circle, there are certain deep-rooted myths, which have distorted the focus of teaching English in our country, over the years:

Myth 1: Centrality of grammar

Learning one's mother tongue or any other tongue involves the same cognitive process. No mother taught the initial words in Tamil, such as thatha, amma, or appa as nouns. So, in the case of English, why is the skewed approach to teach it based on or through grammar? Strangely, English grammar, to say the least, appears illogical and incoherent even to teachers; besides certain rules, there are more exceptions than rules and the same linguistic item carries varied grammatical roles/labels depending on the contexts. Even a thorough familiarisation does not ensure their automatised, accurate application.

Further, it has now been recognised (unfortunately not among the practising teachers) that the grammar of spoken English is different from that of the written language. In spoken form, a word, a phrase, incomplete sentences, and even ungrammatical constructions can achieve the desired communicative effect, whereas the written form has to strictly adhere to the rules. Despite the leeway the spoken mode enjoys, the tragedy is that the grammar of the written language is thrust upon the spoken form, which impedes learning. Experts maintain that spoken language is not written language spoken out and similarly, the written language is NOT spoken language written down. So, the shift should be towards the grammar of spoken language and not on dishing out grammar rules for the written mode.

Myth 2: Accurate pronunciation

It is familiar to all of us that the pronunciation of our mother tongue varies from person to person, community to community, and place to place. David Crystal, a well-known British expert on pronunciation, states that there are many accents in any language, which depend on the people we speak with. When we converse with children, we adopt one kind of pronunciation which radically differs from when we talk with other family members, colleagues or strangers, determined by the context and purpose. He further observes that English pronunciation is not static or rigid as it is being influenced by other world languages. What matters most is the intelligibility and not the so-called received pronunciation(RP). Instead of mimicking someone else's style, one has to speak in one's natural accent without sacrificing clarity.

Myth 3: High volume of vocabulary

No doubt, English is the richest language embracing more than one million words and each passing year adding more than 1,000 words to its stock. However, it is statistically proven that the spoken form requires only 3,000 high frequency words with ""the, be, to, of, and"" being the top five frequently used words. Against the traditional practice of learning individual words, the shift has moved towards chunks of language, otherwise called, lexical items. Although learners have more than the required number of words, the real problem lies with how they string words together. Thus, the focus of teaching English should hinge upon enhancing the opportunity to practise the spoken skill."

The royal court said prayers for Prince Talal, who died on Saturday, will be held in Riyadh on Sunday.(AP)

Prayers were held Sunday for Prince Talal bin Abdulaziz, a senior member of the royal family who supported women's rights and once led a group of dissident princes, who died at the age of 87.

Prince Talal was an older brother to King Salman and the father of businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. He is the son of the founder and first ruler of modern Saudi Arabia, the late King Abdulaziz, whose sons have ruled since his death, with the throne passing from brother to brother.

Prince Talal's son Prince Abdulaziz bin Talal announced on Twitter that his father passed away on Saturday. The royal court also released a statement about his passing.

Prince Talal served as minister of communications in the 1950s and minister of finance in the early 1960s. In 1957, Prince Talal founded the first school for girls in Riyadh, according to the Saudi newspaper Arab News. The school was founded at a time when females had no access to formal education in the landlocked capital and schools were open to boys only.

Soon after he was appointed finance minister, he struck out and led a group of princes who called for a constitutional monarchy that distributes some of the king's powers. The royals, who became known as the Free Princes Movement, called for a constitution to govern the kingdom, rather than rules based solely on clerical interpretation of the Quran and other religious doctrine.

Prince Talal led the group from Beirut and Cairo, which under then Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser was an adversary of Riyadh. The prince's assets were seized by Riyadh, but he was not stripped of his nationality -- a punishment Gulf monarchies have employed against dissidents.

After rifts emerged between Prince Talal and Cairo, he was allowed to return to Saudi Arabia in 1964 under King Faisal, who had deposed his brother King Saud that same year.

Prince Talal served until 2011 as a member of the Allegiance Council, a body of senior princes who are meant to meet and choose the next king from among themselves. He'd reportedly left the council after questioning its efficacy when a senior prince was appointed to the line of succession without the council being fully consulted."

""There are only three main political parties in Delhi. Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi have told so many lies that no other person can surpass them,"" he said.

The suit alleged that the credit union used the video, which depicted a caricature of a black fast food worker, as an example of ""how not to provide customer service."" Fields-Meaux, who is African-American, left the session because she found the video offensive, and she later reported that another employee, who is also black, had told her that he found the video offensive, as well. Within days, the credit union fired her without warning or explanation.

Such alleged conduct violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it unlawful for an employer to fire - or otherwise retaliate against - an employee because the employee implicitly or explicitly opposed conduct that he or she reasonably believed was unlawful. The EEOC filed its suit (Civil Action No. 18-6673) in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana earlier this year. Under the three-year consent decree settling the suit, signed by U.S. District Judge Lance M. Africk, the credit union will pay Fields-Meaux $110,000 in monetary relief and provide a variety of other, non-monetary relief. For instance, the credit union will provide regular training to its employees on retaliation.

""I'm pleased that we were able to amicably resolve this action with fair and equitable relief,"" said Rudy Sustaita, regional attorney for the EEOC's Houston District Office. ""It is of paramount importance that those who raise concerns about race-based discrimination receive the protections to which they are entitled under the law.""

""It has exposed the two faces of the Aam Aadmi Party,"" Mr. Shah said at a meeting of the BJP's booth-level workers here.

The Assembly on Friday adopted a resolution on the riots, in which it was demanded that the Bharat Ratna awarded to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi be withdrawn. But the ruling AAP distanced itself from the reference to Rajiv Gandhi. Later, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the lines about the former Prime Minister were not part of the original resolution placed before the House. It was a handwritten amendment proposed by a member, he said.

The victims were denied justice for so many years because ""the perpetrators of the riots were also the protectors [of the accused],"" Mr. Shah said in a veiled reference to the Congress. In the four years, the Narendra Modi government at had ""ensured justice"" to the victims by forming a special investigation team and gave the affected families compensation.

Mr. Shah also criticised Congress president Rahul Gandhi over the Rafale deal. ""Despite the Supreme Court's judgement, he is still lying and making allegations,"" Shah said.

He reiterated that the BJP government will identify illegal immigrants and expel the ""infiltrators"" from the country.

He questioned the Congress' stand over the issue.

""The NRC exercise was started in Assam and as soon as it happened Rahul baba and company started crying hoarse. I want to ask Rahul if he has any concern for the countrymen dying in terrorist blasts,"" he said.

""Why do you (Rahul Gandhi) worry about them? Are they your cousins (mausere bhai)?"" he asked.

Exuding confidence about the BJP returning to power after 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Shah said the party's win will mean the victory of nationalism over casteism and nepotism.

He claimed that the BJP will return to power in 2019 with a bigger mandate than 2014.

Targeting the AAP, he said the party's chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who claims to be a common man, is now moving around with security personnel.

""Where are the hospitals, schools, marshals in buses for women's security and CCTV cameras? The condition of Mohalla Clinics is such that filth and dogs have been found in many of them,"" he said.

The Kejriwal government has ""failed"" to keep its promises in Delhi, he alleged.

Shah claimed that the Modi government had fulfilled all its promises for Delhi and the BJP will give an account of its work to the voters in 2019 elections.

He added that it was ""unfortunate"" that the Kejriwal government did not allow implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi fearing Modi will gain popularity.

Shah accused the Congress of ""bungling"" crores of rupees by using the National Herald building as ""private property"". He alleged that the party hid Rs 600 crore to save income tax."

On the controversial resolution in Delhi Assembly Shah said it was ""like rubbing salt on the wounds of the victims and AAP should be ashamed of itself."" The resolution, moved by an AAP MLA, was however not passed.

Shah asserted that the ""when the next BJP government at Centre will identify each and every infiltrator and throw them out of the country."" Shah chose to specifically target Rahul Gandhi and Kejriwal since Congress and AAP are the key rivals of BJP preparing to repeat the victory on all seven Lok Sabha seats of Delhi in 2019.

""The lies of Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi outweigh all the lies spoken since independence in the country. The victims of the 1984 riots did not get the justice till now because the perpetrators of the riots were being protected. Modi government formed a SIT to ensure that the victims get justice and now the victims are getting justice and Congress leaders are getting punished. It has been proved that the riots were carried out under the watch of those in power at that time and the violence was carried out by Congress leaders,"" Shah stated.

AAP which is working hard with an ambition to snatch all seven LS seats from BJP was targeted over the promises it made in the 2015 assembly polls. ""The list of the promises of AAP has turned out to be the list of their failures. Those who moved as common man earlier now move in Z+ security and still continue to make false promises to people,"" Shah said hitting out at Kejriwal.

""Where are the 500 new schools and three new hospitals in every Lok Sabha constituency promised by Kejriwal? The youth are looking for free WiFi and are disappointed. The promise of deploying marshals in buses has also fallen flat and CCTVs are nowhere to be seen. The condition of water supply has deteriorated and 50% people are forced to drink foul-smelling water,"" Shah said.

Elaborating on the work done by the BJP led central government since 2014, claimed that Modi government has fulfilled all its promises and the BJP will go to the voters in 2019 with the account of the work done. ""It is unfortunate Kejriwal government did not allow the implementation of Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi due to fear that the scheme will make PM Narendra Modi more popular. Where will the poor of Delhi go?"" he asked.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari stated that BJP will win all seven LS seats in Delhi and sang a song to motivate party workers to make Narendra Modi PM again.

On Rafael deal, Shah hit out at Rahul Gandhi and stated that despite Supreme Court verdict on Rafale deal, Rahul Gandhi is still ""lying over the deal and is levelling false allegations.""

""Congress and its allies created uproar after 40 lakh infiltrators were identified in Assam. Congress is worried for infiltrators, but they are not worried when infiltrators carry out bomb blasts and our citizens are killed,"" Shah stated.

""The 2019 election will mark an end to the politics of casteism, dynastic politics, and the politics of appeasement and the victory of BJP will end it all,"" he said.

As part of its strategy for 2019 polls, BJP will form a chain of WhatsApp groups to link booth level workers with national leadership to strengthen the communication channels. Shah advised workers to meet each and every voter of Delhi and convince them to vote for BJP. The booth in-charges have been asked to study the causes of defeat in previous years and address them. Ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJP plans to hold conventions of booth presidents in different parts of the country. It began with the meet in Delhi."

The Moyar-Bhavani landscape in Tamil Nadu is flanked by Karnataka in the north and Kerala in the west. It represents a diverse habitat with dense forests, agricultural lands and human settlements. Here, invasive plants like Lantana camara and Prosopis juliflora impact the growth of local species, groundwater, availability of fodder, and thus the rural communities.

The Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), along with Keystone Foundation, a non-governmental organisation in Kotagiri, and World Wildlife Fund embarked on a citizen science approach to map invasive plants with an Android-based application.

Earlier on, ATREE had started off a campaign called ""Spotting Invasive Alien Species"" or SPAIS on India Biodiversity Portal, where anyone could easily record spotting these species. Inspired by South Africa's volunteer-driven invasive mapping tool called South African Plant Invader Atlas, ATREE launched SPAIS to map the occurrences of 20 common and easily identifiable alien invasive species anywhere in India. Almost 473 observations were recorded on this citizen campaign across India.

Ankila Hiremath, fellow, ATREE, said, ""We had two objectives with SPAIS. One, to create a lot of buzz about invasives because that is not something lot of people think about. The other one was to record occurrences.""

She added, ""Though a lot of people joined the campaign, we realised that in terms of information, it would be useful to know which species are more widespread than others. Non-occurrence does not mean that the species is not there. The map had a lot of holes. We thought that our next step would be to become systematic.""

Milind Bunyan, research scientist, ATREE, said, ""The campaign gave great information on invasives; however, what it did not give us was two things. One, it did not give us information on how bad the invasion is. For instance, was there only one lantana or was the area covered in lantana? Secondly, if we have a map where there is no lantana, does it mean that there was no lantana, no one went there, or even if they went there, were they not able to recognise it?""

As the earlier efforts could not capture this specific information, a new grid approach was started to map invasive plants. Called PARDESI (Participatory Assessment of the Regional Distribution of Exotic Species in India), the approach aimed to combine a systematic approach and vegetation sampling with citizen science.

The initial effort of mapping invasives (SPAIS) focused on country-wide mapping whereas the latest approach, PARDESI, looked at working at a more localised landscape and adopting a refined approach.

Bunyan said, ""This has been done in South Africa, one of the global leaders in invasive species mapping. Through SAPIA [South African Plant Invader Atlas], they imposed grids in the entire country. And on these grids, they mapped invasives. We thought why not take this and try on a smaller scale in India at Moyar-Bhavani basin.""

The researchers chose species that were most abundant and widespread.

""We made a list of 87 species and then shortlisted it to 27 with the help of experts,"" said Bunyan.

A 10 by 10 square km grid was created in the Moyar-Bhavani basin. Within each grid, invasive species were recorded using the Open Data Kit app, an open source software used for collecting and managing data. This Android application, which can be used on smartphones and tablets, makes data collection and recording easier for researchers, forest department officials, and school children.

A form was created in this app, where one could record the presence, density, type of invasives and GPS location. Density of invasives was recorded as a percentage cover from 10% as lowest to non-existent to 90%, where an invasive species covered large areas.

Keystone Foundation, an organisation that works in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, trained school and college students by introducing the concept of invasives, why they are a threat and their impacts on the ecosystem and indirectly on human health. For identification, a poster was designed specifically, with images of the 27 invasives shortlisted from the area.

Shiny Rehel, programme coordinator (biodiversity and eco-restoration), Keystone Foundation, said, ""One of the key areas was to involve local skills, like schools. For that, it was important for them to understand how to enter the data. We gave students hands-on training, took them to the field, and were ready to answer their queries. We also gave them devices to record information.""

Bunyan said, ""Lantana looks very different on the poster and very different on the field. We need to know what it actually looks like on field, and that was the actual idea. With Keystone Foundation, the students did an invasive species walk, and collected vegetation and invasives data.""

Rehel added, ""If they found species other than the listed 27 species, they would write notes - for instance, was it mosaic landscape, was it a shrub, and so on.""

As smartphones are equipped with GPS and camera, the data is verifiable. When volunteers are at a particular point, they record the GPS location, and can also take a picture of the species. ""We will know the area, can locate the space, and can check if there is any misidentification,"" said Bunyan.

As it was a volunteer effort, it did not require high investment and could be done part-time. However, volunteers could not be asked to venture into deeper forests for sampling, unlike ecologists. Also, they could not collect data only from one road, as this could sometimes lead to data bias.

""We had to balance this. As people are volunteers, we wanted this to be easy for them,"" said Bunyan. ""We asked teams to pre-identify roads that maximise coverage of the grid. You don't want three roads that are in one corner, you want to spread across the landscape. We tried to get the major land uses, for example, if you have towns, and a tea garden, they sampled a little bit of road, a little bit of tea garden. If there was a tea garden and a forest, the survey was distributed in both the areas than focusing on just one part of the landscape. These were some ways of getting around bias.""

There would be two outputs for PARDESI. One, an idea of how invasives occur across the entire landscape and how dominant they are. The data can also show how bad the invasion is in a certain point. Bunyan said, ""When you overlay the output for 27 species, you can identify 'invasive hotspots'. For instance, this is where five invasive species occur, or this is where lantana is abundant.""

The pilots were carried out over approximately 1,500 square km. The targeted information will be useful for land managers, forest managers, Public Works Department officials and so on.

Bunyan believes that the best place to remove invasives are those areas where they are just coming in, as compared to those where invasives are wide-spread. ""If we push back the area where invasives are just coming in, we could possibly save the landscape,"" said Bunyan.

With High Courts such as the Madurai High Court ordering the removal of invasives like Acacia and Prosopis, there is a serious effort to act on this issue. ""This invasive map will give them the data, and where they can actually target on removing these first,"" added Bunyan.

ATREE trained forest department officials on invasives and using the Open Data Kit app, and hopes to conduct more workshops in future.

Bunyan said, ""Some state forest departments, like the Tamil Nadu forest department, is showing interest. If this works out, we can do this across the entire Western Ghats, and have a similar atlas like South Africa.""

Hiremath added, ""We are in the process of looking at the data, and how we need to refine or tweak to take it further.""

Citizen science is slowly gaining popularity in India with such initiatives. Earlier, scientists had doubt of authenticity regarding data collected by citizen scientists. Hiremath said, ""Studies are showing that with a little bit of training, that is less of an issue. There is a lot of potential in the future. Further, there is indirect impact on conservation as well. It has created a larger population of people interested in conservation."""

He also accused Congress chief Rahul Gandhi of supporting illegal migrants.

The Delhi Assembly on Friday adopted a resolution on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in which it was demanded that the Bharat Ratna awarded to former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi be withdrawn, but the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) swiftly distanced itself from the reference to the Congress leader.

Later, Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia clarified that the lines about the former PM were not part of the original resolution placed before the House. He said it was a handwritten amendment proposed by a member, which and it cannot be passed in such a manner.

""What has happened in the Assembly and later was like rubbing salt on the wounds of the anti-Sikh riot victims,"" Shah said without elaborating. It has exposed the double-faced character of the Aam Aadmi Party,"" he said at a conclave of the BJP's booth level workers here.

The Sikh victims had been denied justice for so many years because ""the perpetrators of the riots were also the protectors (of the accused)"", the BJP chief said in a veiled reference to the Congress.

Shah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre in four years of its rule had not only ""assured justice"" to the victims by formation of a special investigation team but also provided compensation to the affected families.

He also trained his guns at Gandhi over the Rafale deal. ""Despite the Supreme Court's judgement on the Rafale deal, he (Gandhi) is still lying and levelling allegations,"" Shah said.

Speaking about illegal immigrants, he reiterated that the BJP government will identify and expel the ""infiltrators"" from the country. He also questioned the Congress' stand over the issue.

""The NRC exercise was started in Assam and as soon as it happened Rahul baba and company started crying hoarse. I want to ask Rahul if he has any concern for the countrymen dying in terrorist blasts,"" he said. ""Why do you (Rahul Gandhi) worry about them? Are they your cousins (mausere bhai)?"" he asked.

Exuding confidence about the BJP returning to power after 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Shah said the party's win will mean the victory of nationalism over casteism and nepotism. He claimed that the BJP will return to power in 2019 with a bigger mandate than 2014.

Targeting the AAP, he said the party's chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who claims to be a common man, is now moving around with security personnel. ""Where are the hospitals, schools, marshals in buses for women's security and CCTV cameras? The condition of Mohalla Clinics is such that filth and dogs have been found in many of them,"" he said. The Kejriwal government has ""failed"" to keep its promises in Delhi, he alleged.

Shah claimed that the Modi government had fulfilled all its promises for Delhi and the BJP will give an account of its work to the voters in 2019 elections. He added that it was ""unfortunate"" that the Kejriwal government did not allow implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi fearing Modi will gain popularity.

Addressing the booth level party workers and leaders in Delhi, Mr Shah said that there were countless reasons to vote Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power again. He said, the BJP's victory in 2019 polls would ensure that the country's politics was free from these negative practices in politics.

Mr Shah said, in Delhi, the contest would be mainly between three major players - BJP, AAP and Congress. He alleged that till date, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal and Congress Chief Rahul Gandhi spoke the highest number of lies in the history of politics.

Hitting out at Congress over the 1984 riots, Mr Shah asked why did such delay happen in delivering justice to the families of the riot victims. He alleged that the riots took place under the patronage of Congress.

He said when BJP Government came to power it formed Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the anti-Sikh riots cases which led to speedy probe and now justice was being delivered to the victims.

After coming to power, BJP Government announced 5 lakh compensation, formation of SIT and benefits for the riot victims.

Referring to Delhi Assembly resolution over the anti-Sikh riots, Mr Shah said it was like rubbing salt to the wounds of the Sikh community, and AAP should be ashamed of what they did.

He said the AAP Government in Delhi failed to deliver what they promised during elections and the long list of the promises has a list of their failures.

The people in Delhi are drinking dirty water, he said adding that promises of CCTV cameras and marshals in DTC buses, and opening of 500 schools by AAP remained unfulfilled.

He said Delhi citizens were suffering because of failure of AAP Government but Mr Kejriwal is not ready to accept the same.

Hitting out at the Mohalla clinics, Mr Shah said that instead of opening hospitals, AAP Government opened mohalla clinics, most of which were without doctors, pharmacists and basic facilities.

Mr Shah said, the surgical strike had put India into the big league of the US and Israel that were known for hitting back at enemies that attack their security forces.

He said Supreme court has nailed the Congress' lies regarding Rafale deal by giving clean chit to government over the fighter jet purchase contract. (AGENCIES)"

(Written by Norimitsu Onishi and Selam Gebrekida)

India's most influential guru joined thousands of believers four years ago as the temple's first stone was set in the ground.

It was a glorious day for its builders, the Gupta brothers, the sons of a local shopkeeper who had risen, almost magically, to become one of the richest families a world away in South Africa.

The three brothers had flown back on their private jet to start work on the temple, a 125-foot monument of pink sandstone and white marble.

Advertising

But one morning last month, as the sun struggled to break through the smog in Saharanpur, their hometown in India's north, the giant yellow crane raising the temple stood still -- in limbo, like the brothers themselves.

The Guptas are now in self-imposed exile in Dubai, evading arrest in South Africa, where they stand at the centre of a scandal that has already brought down the nation's president and exposed staggering amounts of corruption in the once-legendary party of Nelson Mandela.

Even here in India, the family's legacy -- so large that it has been elevated to myth -- faces collapse. The new temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva in their father's honour, is now being investigated for the same kind of self-dealing and fraud the family is accused of mastering in South Africa.

The rise and fall of the Gupta brothers is so improbable that in Saharanpur their story is told like a parable.

They began by selling shoes in South Africa and swiftly became central figures in the nation's post-apartheid history, outsiders who broke into the very pinnacle of political power. Seemingly overnight, they joined the ranks of South Africa's most influential families, playing a leading role in one of the biggest dramas after the end of apartheid: Who is getting rich, and how?

Mandela's election as president in 1994 set off a scramble by leaders in his party, the African National Congress, to amass wealth. The early ones succeeded through ties with rich white South Africans. Many others turned to the brothers from Saharanpur.

The Guptas found eager partners at all levels of the ANC, from bureaucrats to a sitting president, Jacob Zuma, according to dozens of interviews by The New York Times, as well as government investigators, international auditors, emails from a Gupta company, financial records and court documents.

Seizing on a chance encounter with a South African official in India decades ago, the three brothers cultivated ties to the governing party so expertly that it became difficult to draw the line between their business empire and the president's office.

They made one of Zuma's sons a business partner, enabling them to buy a coal mine through government intervention and set up a media business that the president helped guide himself, according to officials, company emails and people involved in the ventures. The president responded in kind, handing them control over strategic Cabinet selections and the boards of state-owned enterprises.

Now desperate to distance themselves from the brothers, ANC leaders dismiss the family as a legacy of the tainted era of Zuma, who was ousted in February by his own party.

But the story of the Guptas -- who landed in the country a year before the end of apartheid in 1994 and left with Zuma's fall -- is also the story of South Africa under the ANC.

The main agent of corruption was the party itself. ANC leaders have siphoned off tens of billions of dollars meant to improve the lives of their most loyal supporters, poor black South Africans.

They have crippled strong government agencies, like the national tax service, to benefit their own bank accounts. Some of the nation's new leaders -- the ANC officials promising a new chapter for the country now that Zuma is out of office -- have pocketed money intended for basic services, like schools.

The Guptas helped undermine the nation's democratic institutions. And like generations of foreigners before them, they took their windfall out of Africa, moving it to Dubai and India through a maze of dubious, and at times illegal, transactions, officials say.

And they became so powerful that they clashed with the Oppenheimers -- the family that once owned the De Beers diamond company and the mining giant Anglo American -- whose influence in South Africa had been unrivalled for a century.

But as the Guptas brandished their power, they incited a backlash, not only from ordinary South Africans, but also from a far more powerful constituency: the white-led business establishment and its allies, both increasingly worried that the brothers were putting the country's economic health at risk.

The Guptas' intimate role in steering the nation helped set off an electoral revolt that has already cost the ANC control over South Africa's biggest cities and could jeopardize its hold on the presidency.

From his self-imposed exile in Dubai, Ajay Gupta, 53, the oldest brother, denies all wrongdoing. He points out that they face no criminal charges in South Africa, adding that their family empire is now bankrupt.

Humble Beginnings

The father of the Gupta brothers, Shiv Kumar Gupta, owned a tiny shop that sold government rations, or subsidized food, here in Saharanpur. But he nurtured grand ambitions.

One day, Gupta called over his oldest son, Ajay, to recount a newspaper article on the war between Iran and Iraq. The price of rice had skyrocketed there because he told his son, all the traders had left the countries.

""But somebody is going in,"" the father said, Ajay recalled. ""He's getting this advantage because there's no competition.""

So Ajay, who had already set up a computer import business in New Delhi, followed his father's advice and went looking for opportunities in Russia, China and Singapore.

The middle brother, Atul, went to South Africa in 1993, right before it became a democracy. He kept going back, despite his family's misgivings.

""He alone was the bullish one,"" Ajay recalled. ""He loved the place.""

Atul settled in Johannesburg and sold shoes downtown. Then he started a company importing computer parts and assembling them for sale. And by chance, he made a personal connection to the ANC that would prove far more consequential.

During a trip home to India, Atul met a South African of Indian origin in New Delhi: Essop Pahad, the right-hand man of Thabo Mbeki, who was then Mandela's deputy.

Planting New Roots

When Pahad met Ajay, he was immediately impressed. Ajay got the big picture in South Africa, and seemed to understand that there was a place in it for the Guptas. In fact, the opening was vast, and Ajay exploited it masterfully.

In the late 1990s, as Mbeki prepared to become president, the ANC government was worried about the enduring power of white South African businessmen and dependence on Western nations. Forging ties with countries like India and China could lessen their influence, Pahad said.

Black South Africans had gained political power. But the white business elite, led by officials at Anglo American, had protected its own interests in the new South Africa. Long before the end of apartheid, Harry Oppenheimer, the head of the mining company, had led efforts to create -- and co-opt, some historians say -- a black elite.

When Mandela was released from Robben Island in 1990, Anglo American executives visited him at his home in Soweto. Other businessmen followed, to Mandela's delight, according to an authorized biography describing how he stayed at the estates of white tycoons and accepted gifts from them.

Mandela was particularly close to Oppenheimer, who gave him money, said Michael Spicer, a former executive at the company.

Oppenheimer put together a team of economic advisers for Mandela. In meetings, ANC leaders joined the country's top white businessmen to set the nation's post-apartheid economic course, Spicer said.

Soon enough, Mandela, who had supported nationalizing the economy, endorsed pro-business policies. Some historians argue that the policies contributed to South Africa's income inequality, and to an economy still based on cheap black labor.

But after becoming president, Mbeki moved to dampen the power of white businesses. He created his own group, which met at his residence each month, Pahad said. It included Cabinet ministers, top businessmen, rising stars in the ANC and an unknown figure: Ajay Gupta.

Ajay said he enjoyed the meetings. Mbeki sometimes even dropped by for lunch. Only a few years after settling in South Africa, Ajay had forged links to the highest levels of the ANC, thanks to his friendship with Pahad.

In the early 2000s, the brothers got their first big break: They won a large government contract to set up computer laboratories in schools in the nation's richest province.

Then they went on a buying spree, acquiring a struggling information technology company that helped them become one of the biggest computer distributors in South Africa. They later bought a uranium mine, a steel manufacturer and other businesses.

Hedging Their Bets

Even as the Guptas thrived off their ties to Mbeki's allies, they were reaching out to his archrival, Zuma, the No. 2 in the party.

The two leaders fought bitterly. So Pahad, Mbeki's right-hand man, was surprised to learn that the Guptas had cultivated ties with the other side.

""They were having some function at their home, and Ajay said to me, 'Do you mind if we invite Zuma?'"" Pahad recalled.

Money was an unspoken dynamic in the battle between Mbeki and Zuma: Who in the ANC had gotten rich since the end of apartheid? And, perhaps more important, who had not?

Mandela and some others -- including South Africa's current president, Cyril Ramaphosa -- became wealthy, in part through connections to white business leaders.

The Guptas hired or became business partners with the sons of powerful ANC politicians, like Zuma's son Duduzane, and Tshepiso Magashule, the son of Ace Magashule, the party's current secretary-general.

It fell to the youngest of the Gupta brothers -- the friendly and easygoing Rajesh, nicknamed Tony -- to keep the sons happy. They went to nightclubs together and hung out in the family's compound in Johannesburg.

Tony also took the lead in pursuing business in Free State province, where corruption had flourished under Magashule, its leader at the time, ANC officials said.

In an interview, Mxolisi Dukwana, then Magashule's provincial minister of economic development, recalled how he and his boss went to visit Tony in Johannesburg. The president's son, Duduzane, was also there, he said.

Express Opinion Sabarimala: The past and present Out of My Mind: Bankrupt economicsBy Meghnad Desai

Tony asked Dukwana to endorse a large-scale development project in the province, promising him a monthly cut, Dukwana said.

Tony added that he and the other two men in the room had a similar arrangement in a mining project, Dukwana said. He recounted Tony's saying that he ""personally gave"" monthly payments of about $71,000 each to Magashule and to the president's son.

""Then he asked them, 'Have I ever failed you?' And they both said no,"" Dukwana said.

Ties at the Top

The Guptas also gained great influence over the president and his affairs. According to witnesses in the government inquiry into the Zuma years, the Guptas had a say in choosing ministers, or even offered positions to candidates directly.

Duduzane Zuma, the president's son, helped the Guptas expand beyond mining. They started a newspaper and a television news station, ANN7, that thrived on government advertising, which their political connections easily secured.

As in other projects, Duduzane Zuma was the Guptas' Black Economic Empowerment partner in the venture. But it was clear he was simply a proxy for the president, said Rajesh Sundaram, an Indian journalist who worked directly under Atul Gupta to start the channel.

In meetings that Sundaram attended with the Guptas and the president, Zuma was intimately engaged in the network's launch. Seeing how close the Guptas were with Zuma, Sundaram said he once asked Atul, ""What if Zuma goes?""

""'Well, we've got everyone in our pocket,'"" Atul replied, Sundaram recalled.

Ruinous Miscalculations

As the Gupta brothers prospered, they flaunted it. But two events -- both, as it turned out, related to planes -- contributed to their undoing.

In 2013, the brothers chartered a plane with about 200 guests from India to attend the extravagant wedding of a niece in Sun City, South Africa's Las Vegas. They invited relatives, friends, businessmen and politicians, mostly from India.

But the brothers miscalculated. Using their political connections, they landed the plane near Sun City -- at a military base. Its use by a private family set off a government inquiry, turning the Guptas into a favorite target of opposition politicians eager to expose corruption under Zuma.

Soon enough, the Guptas were embroiled in another drama, one that pitted them against the Oppenheimers, the family dynasty that had been South Africa's most powerful for a century.

The Oppenheimers had sold their shares in Anglo American and De Beers for billions. The heirs to the fortune -- Nicky Oppenheimer and his son Jonathan -- opened an ultraluxury private terminal in Johannesburg's main airport in 2014, with fine dining and a gallery with art for sale.

But the Oppenheimers couldn't get permission to handle international flights. Despite countless letters and calls to ANC officials, the Oppenheimers were getting nowhere. Eventually, they sued the government, accusing the Guptas of using their political influence to stall the business. The brothers, the Oppenheimers said, wanted in on the terminal.

According to court documents, the Guptas sent a message to the Oppenheimers that they had ""the wrong BEE partner"" -- referring to the Black Economic Empowerment program. If the Oppenheimers chose a partner endorsed by the Guptas, the documents said, their ""problems would go away.""

The last straw was another appointment: In late 2015, Zuma chose an unknown lawmaker -- considered close to the Guptas -- as finance minister. Alarmed, the business establishment and its ANC allies struck back, forcing Zuma to remove the minister after only four days.

Within weeks, a major South African bank cut ties with the Gupta family. The country's other big banks followed.

Last Flight Out

The Guptas were getting nervous. Their most powerful ally, Zuma, was scheduled to step down as the ANC's leader in late 2017. The brothers would soon find out whether they had eggs in more than one basket.

The race to succeed Zuma was tight. His former wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma appeared to have a slight edge over her rival, Ramaphosa, the favorite candidate of the business establishment.

The Gupta empire was getting squeezed. Locked out of banks, the brothers could not pay their employees or debts. Their only public company was delisted from the Johannesburg stock exchange. South African companies, big and small, refused to do business with them.

Cornered, they sold a mining company and their media empire in quick succession. Many of their remaining companies filed for bankruptcy protection and are now managed by outside supervisors.

Everything might have worked out for them had Zuma's ex-wife won. But one of her supporters, David Mabuza -- who had become a kingmaker by diverting government money to finance his political rise -- flipped his votes at the last minute, handing Ramaphosa a slim victory.

South Africans, predicting the end of the Guptas, began tracking the family's prized Bombardier Global 6000 jet as it travelled to Dubai, Russia, Switzerland and elsewhere.

On Feb. 4, the Guptas turned off the jet's GPS tracking device, according to Canada's export credit agency, which had lent the Guptas $41 million to buy the Bombardier. The agency sued to get the plane back, saying the Guptas might use it ""to escape justice.""

Ten days later -- on the day Zuma finally gave up and resigned as South Africa's president -- law enforcement officials raided the Gupta estate in Johannesburg.

A new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. (Mohit Suneja/HT)

Mass hysteria breaks out in India every few years and is increasingly being fuelled by paranoia about the internet.

To the world, Manish Sarki was the perfect all-rounder.

A strapping boy of 18, Sarki worked hard in school during the day and sent fielders scurrying after his shots at the neighbourhood cricket ground in the evenings. He would never get home later than dinner time even when his friends were out chatting, his mother Chandra Maya remembers, and his closest friends joked about how he would blush talking to girls.

Everyone in the village of St Mary's Hill knew Sarki would grow up to be a policeman or join the army. Maybe because he was so well-behaved, no one noticed when he went quiet. They only noticed on the night of August 20 when he didn't come back home.

The village gathered around the Sarki house around 9pm. A chill was enveloping the small mountain village on the outskirts of Darjeeling in northern Bengal, but a small group of men and women trekked to the local police station a couple of kilometers away. Boys go missing all the time, they were told.

Undeterred, the villagers split into smaller search parties and fanned out into the jungles, determined to find Sarki. Their hopes were dashed around 1.30am when a search team stumbled on Sarki's body hanging from the ceiling of an empty pig warehouse on top of a hill.

Below, in spray paint, were the words ""half blood prince was here"" in what everyone recognised was Sarki's handwriting. On the wall behind was drawn a hangman with two victims, an older boy, and more chillingly, a younger one. Every wall of the building had been scribbled on - the words ""illuminati"", ""last king"", ""savage"", ""doped up"" and the number ""666"" appearing repeatedly.

In the light of day, some of the graffiti might have appeared benign - after all, some the walls displayed banalities like ""be the change you want to see"" or ""the thing you fear the most is fear itself"". But in the eerie quiet of a cold mountain night, the villagers were convinced Sarki's death was the doing of the satan. ""I was heartbroken for my son but also scared out of my wits. We were all scared about who the younger boy could be,"" said Chandra Maya.

By the time police arrived two hours later, a mist of rumours had cloaked the village. Wasn't Sarki always on his phone for the past few weeks? And, wouldn't he go out to the graveyard, barely a kilometer away, every night with his phone? ""I think he was going crazy. That's when I heard about the game,"" added Chandra Maya.

By sunrise, everyone had heard of the game: a shadowy application called the Momo Challenge that had apparently killed Sarki. Several explanations were offered. ""For the past few days, he was very sad and distracted. He would be lost in his phone. He never said anything to me, later I found out that he was playing the Momo game,"" said Sarki's friend Deekchen.

But how did he find out? Villagers say the local police first told them of the game, but the police deny ever saying anything. ""In fact, we have not been able to confirm any role of any Momo Challenge game. We never told the locals about the game. Maybe the graffiti made them think that,"" said Hare Krishna Pai, additional superintendent of police.

The next day, a second death, that of 26-year-old Aditi Goyal in Kurseong town, was also attributed to the Momo Challenge, turning the creeping fear into full-blown panic. By then, local politicians had put out statements about the supposedly lethal game, and everyone in the hills was talking about it.

""The whole area was in trauma and everyone was scared of their phones. We found young boys from Class 7 had started playing it. We started spreading awareness and seized phones from those who seemed vulnerable. Someone even sent a message to my daughter,"" said Raju Gurung, a local from Kurseong.

Hindustan Times spoke to at least 20 people in the area and everyone claimed to know a relative, friend or neighbour who had had a close shave with the game. But everyone had a different notion.

Some described the game, which supposedly sets self-harm challenges that finally end in suicide, as an app, some as a Whatsapp message. Some said they received texts, some described a phone number. Indeed, beyond the ubiquitous image of the oblong faced, bulbous eyed doll that has come to signify the game, every detail was foggy. ""Sometimes people are faking names and photos and sending messages 'Hi, I am momo. Let us play a game.' The fear of the game has hypnotised us,"" said Junita Rana, a schoolteacher in Kurseong.

It began with the braids. In June last year, a girl in Rajasthan claimed someone chopped off her braid while she was asleep. Dozens of women across Rajasthan followed up with similar claims. Over the following months, the pattern spread across north India like an epidemic: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi. By November, over 200 cases of braid chopping had been reported in Kashmir where the trend took its most vicious turn. Many women claimed to have seen Godmen, witches or cats before losing their consciousness. After finding their braids gone, many complained of aches and pains for days after. The police couldn't really find any culprits, so the people took the matter in their hands. In August, a poor woman was killed by a mob in Agra on the suspicion of chopping braids. In October, an old man in Anantnag was killed for the same reason.

Then there was the Blue Whale. In July, a schoolboy's suicide stoked the hysteria around the web-based game created by a Russian tech geek targeting teengers. The 50 challenges begin differently - from shutting yourself in or watching a horror film - proceed incrementally, and end the same way: suicide. Through 2017, more than 150 cases of young suicides across India - West Bengal, Delhi, Indore, Solapur, Dehradun - were blamed on the Blue Whale, often with no more proof that the young person was obsessed with smartphone and videogames. Every case was rife was contradictions and yet, websites were blocked, advisories issued, and in some cases, smartphones banned in schools.

Experts say that underneath the web-fuelled hysteria, something more sinister is going on with the mental health of young people. Samir Parikh, director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, insisted that we cannot dismiss these phenomena, but the focus should be on greater media literacy, on making children understand what is right and wrong content, and on teaching people to seek help if they are feeling vulnerable.

""Is there a component of hysteria in all this? Of course, there are lots of stories in the media and they have an impact. But we cannot deny the fact that there are pressures and problems that young people go through silently. If help and access is not given, they can be misused,"" he added.

Parikh is clear that any approach that aims at shutting down access to the internet is wrong, mainly because it is impossible. ""We need to understand that be it Blue Whale or Momo, if you are vulnerable, you might be pulled towards it. So you give people skills and teach people to not bottle it up, tell parents, block or involve authorities.""

India has had a long history of public panic. From a half-man half-monkey roaming the streets in Delhi, sometimes wearing a helmet, to the Munhnochwa (face ripper) of Mirzapur, claimed to be a flying object emitting beams of green or red light, sending shock waves through anyone who came in its contact, and leaving them with bites and scratches on their faces, to the Rathakaatteri (vampire) of Gundalpatti who allegedly sucked the blood of the village cattle, a new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. Many of these have been analysed as incidents of mass hysteria. The patterns have been revealing. Women are more likely to end up as victims than men, children turn to be more vulnerable than adults. The trends pick up in regions or communities marked by oppression of women, economic uncertainty or social anxiety.

Yet, questions remain about why a particular fear grips a set of people at a given time. Did every woman who complained of braid chopping do it herself? Was every alleged case of Blue Whale suicide made up by the parents or the police to evade responsibility? What do the women whose braids were chopped say now? And, did a year of fear and panic leave us any wiser?

In Kanganhedi, a village of 700 houses on the Delhi-Haryana border, Munesh Devi's hair has grown back just enough to tie it in a ponytail. A lot more has changed in her life since last year besides her hairstyle. ""I can no longer work in our field. I hardly leave the house, except being taken to the doctor by my son every two weeks. Any exertion leaves me tired. Even going to funerals gets up my blood pressure. I lie in bed almost all day. Daughters-in-law press my feet.They also bring me rotis to eat in bed,"" said Devi, sitting on a double bed in the living room. Its doors remain shut and its light dimmed to prevent Devi's recurring headache.

They began in July 2017, immediately after she found her braid chopped at the neck. It was there when she finished feeding the cows in the family's farm, she said, but gone when she got back home and slipped back her pallu. ""Must have gone missing while I was travelling home on the back of my son's motorcycle,"" she added. She remembers fainting after the realisation struck. She continues to feel giddy. ""My head spins. My whole body aches. My feet go numb. My teeth hurt."" She doesn't know what ails her; neither does her doctor. He prescribes her pills for each of her symptoms. She shows off the stash to people asking her how she has been doing since ""the incident.""

Munesh Devi's was one of three braids found missing in the area in the course of one eventful day. The other two women don't know, either, who chopped their braids or why they continue to suffer. Sri Devi said she lost her braid while sitting on a couch in the courtyard of her house. One moment it was hanging down her waist, the next moment it was lying on the floor. She had heard of the braid-chopping phenomenon only hours before. ""My uncle, who was visiting us from Pataudi, had told me about a video he had seen on Facebook. I said, 'Mama, please don't say such things.'"" Her son had called 100 after she fainted at the sight of her severed braid. ""The police are yet to tell us if they found anything,"" she said.

Devi also visited a psychiatrist in Dwarka along with her son, at the urging of the police. ""He asked my son some questions. Gave us no answers,"" she said. Her braid was taken away by a forensics team sent in by the police for further investigations. ""We haven't heard from them."" Perturbed by three incidents in a week, people in the village even consulted a tantrik (mystic). ""He spoke about the presence of a mysterious cat in the village. But no such cat or dog has been found,"" she said.

For many women, the disappearance of braids has been transformative. It has allowed them rightful rest after a lifetime's slog at home and farm, won them the nurturing attention of their families, and given them the chance to talk about themselves for the first time. The third ""victim"" in Kangnahedi, Ombati, a daily-wage labourer who found her braid gone while working around the house, is still waiting for her life to change, however. ""No government compensation, no one has even come to offer me a glass of juice,"" she said, lying on a cot and complaining of a headache.

""We sent a team to that village for a couple of hours after a request from the concerned division of the Delhi police, but we haven't received any formal communication from the top brass,"" explained Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, which had investigated the phenomenon of Delhi's Monkey-man in 2001. ""From the preliminary impressions of our team, in all probability, the incidents in Kanganhedi fit into the pattern of mass hysteria, which tends to subside on its own.""

In Kashmir, the last region to be swept up in the storm, over 100 FIRs were registered over six months. Many women alleged masked men entered their homes when they were alone, sprinkled sedatives in the air, and chopped their braids while they lay unconscious. Separatist leaders accused the Indian government, and armed militants suspected the evil hand of intelligence agencies. As locals flooded the streets in protest, shutting down shops and schools, the police resorted to extreme measures, from announcing an award of Rs 6 lakh for information to unleashing riot-control tactics to disperse the crowds. Several vigilante groups armed with lathis and axes emerged to patrol the streets at night. A 70-year-old man in Anantnag died after being hit by a brick by a group of people who suspected him to be a braid chopper.

But now, police say the paranoia and panic was fuelled by nothing substantive.

""Almost all the cases turned out to be without any substance. There were a few cases where the women had cut their hair themselves. In one case, a maid had cut the hair of a girl,"" said additional director general of police (law and order), Muneer Khan. In Kulgam, where 21 cases had been registered, the state government had formed a special investigation team(SIT). Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Kulgam, Aijaz Ahmad, who was part of the SIT, said that most of the cases have been closed because the allegations had no factual basis.

""In some of the cases, the culprits remain untraced, while maximum cases turned out to be of hysteria,"" Ahmad said. He said the lack of a single eyewitness in all of the cases was particularly baffling.

Across the valley, the police arrested between 70 and 80 people, including members of vigilante groups, for ""raising false alarm about braid chopping and creating disturbances"".

""We felt that this [braid chopping] was being done by agencies. It was a matter of honour of our women. Everybody wanted this should end. Stone pelting was the only option with us. Surprisingly it did end abruptly after that,"" said a villager from north Kashmir who requested anonymity. Some of them are still visiting the courts for hearings.

It was around 5pm on July 29 last year when Manpreet Singh Sahani climbed on the ledge of his fifth-floor apartment. As he teetered on the edge, neighbours and witnesses on the street below called out to him but could only watch helplessly as he jumped. Initial investigations by local police and testimonies of his friends exposed talk of the Blue Whale Challenge. Several of them took to social media to blame the game and link it to Sahani's death.

In 24 hours, reports of the supposedly lethal game had inundated media, and reports of copycat cases were streaming in from all parts of India, ratcheting up paranoia about mobile phone and internet use among teenagers and their parents. Over the next two months, more than 150 deaths or injuries across the country were alleged to be linked to the game.

But while police initially suspected the boy was an avid gamer and could have been influenced by the Blue Whale Challenge, detailed investigation indicated more offline triggers.

""The boy was in love with a girl who had left him for some other boy. We had gone through his email accounts and mobile phone and found a draft on the phone which clarified his intention to commit suicide,"" said Navin Reddy, deputy commissioner of police Zone 10.

This might not be an isolated phenomenon. Earlier this year, Union minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir told Lok Sabha that a committee formed under the chairmanship of the director general of the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) couldn't establish the involvement of the Blue Whale Challenge in any case.

""The committee analysed the internet activities, device activities, call records and other social media activity, other forensic evidences and also interacted with rescued victims associated with these incidents,"" the minister told the lower house.

Of course, by then several other central ministries, a number of state governments, the Central Board of Secondary Education and even the Supreme Court had got involved, with the apex court calling the game a ""national problem"".

But experts say official agencies may have jumped the gun. ""It was definitely a hoax. We need to shift focus from these voyeuristic things and to suicides, which is a big problem that kills a quarter of a million people. Some of these hoaxes have a life of their own because media makes them into a big story. We need long-term institutional solutions,"" said Soumitra Pathare, director of the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy.

Back in St Mary's hill, Chandra Maya Sarki has gone back to her old routine -- wake up at the crack of dawn to draw water, fix food for her husband before he leaves for his daily wage work, and then clean their small wooden house. She likes to keep the television on and stray dialogues from the afternoon soaps animate the living room. She stares not at the screen, however, but at the the small framed photo of Sarki hanging on the blue wall, wondering why the mysterious admins of the Momo Challenge chose her child as their prey.

She doesn't know yet that the cyber cell of the West Bengal police has completed its forensic probe of his phone and found no trace of any Momo Challenge. ""If any application is downloaded, the forensic machine would find a trace, even if it is an unknown application. But we have found no such application, or any message on WhatsApp motivating people to play the game. We have found nothing so far,"" said a senior official of the cyber cell on the condition of anonymity.

She doesn't know that police has ruled out any links between the game and the death of Aditi Goyal and that at least two other cases in the state have been found to be hoaxes traced back to mischief makers sending scary messages through WhatsApp. She doesn't know that Sarki's teacher Sarita Sharma has a simple explanation for why he and his friends would go to the graveyard at night -- the mobile network was the best at that spot.

All she knows is that her beloved younger son will no longer come back home at 8pm every day. That she will never make him his favourite meal of dal-aloo and dum-eggs. The money she had been saving with her husband to send him to Bengaluru for higher studies now seems meaningless. Sometimes she talks to Sarki's sister, now in college, about him and the day that took him away from her. She will probably never know what really happened to Sarki or what troubled him enough to withdraw from his friends. Momo Challenge or not, that is the biggest tragedy of all.

Protests over worsening economic conditions resumed Saturday for a fourth consecutive day, with thousands taking to the streets in a string of Sudanese cities, including the capital Khartoum, as activists reported that authorities rounded up more than a dozen politicians from a leftist opposition coalition.

The continuing unrest is striking in a country where any potentially serious threat to President Omar Bashir's 29-year Islamic rule has been brutally quashed. The ongoing protests have taken on an increasingly political slant, with demonstrators calling on the Sudanese leader to step down and chanting slogans against what they see as rampant corruption under the watch of the general-turned-president.

Saturday's unrest came as Bashir fired the governor of Gadaref, a province in eastern Sudan that is home to six of the nine demonstrators who died Thursday in clashes with police, according to Sudan's state news agency. Meanwhile, Sudanese activists in Khartoum told The Associated Press by phone that authorities on Saturday detained 14 members of a leftist opposition coalition they accuse of fomenting the unrest. Among those detained is Farouk Abu Issa, the 85-year-old leader of the National Consensus Forces, they added. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

There was no word from the government on the arrests.

The agency said schools have been indefinitely closed in a province north of Khartoum and in North Darfur province west of the capital, where classes have also been suspended. Authorities also placed the eastern cities of Kosti and Rabak under curfew following acts of ""sabotage"" targeting government offices there, according to the agency.

The protests are mostly about rising prices and shortages of food and fuel. There has also been a liquidity crunch that forced authorities to limit bank withdrawals and caused long lines at ATMs. A devaluation of the Sudanese pound in October caused a significant spike in inflation, which now stands at around 60 percent, in some cases doubling the price of basic goods.

Bashir came to power in a 1989 military coup backed by Islamists. It overthrew a democratically elected but dysfunctional government led by then prime minister Sadeq al-Mahdi, who triumphantly returned to Sudan earlier this week after a year of self-imposed exile. Thousands of supporters received him.

Saturday's protests took place in several Khartoum suburbs, the railway city of Atbara north of the capital and in northern Kordofan in western Sudan. Activists flooded social media networks with video clips purporting to show protesters running away as the sound of gunfire rings out or of security men beating up detained protesters with canes.

Some photos posted online purported to show protesters apparently shot by police being carried away by fellow demonstrators. Others showed protesters lying on the street in a pool of blood.

Bashir has in the past ordered the use of force against protesters, successfully crushing them while continuing his political survival to become one of the longest serving leaders in the region. Although his time at the helm has seen Sudan plunging into one crisis after another, he is seeking a new term in office. Lawmakers loyal to him are already campaigning to rally support for constitutional amendments that would allow him to run in the 2020 election.

Soon after he seized power in 1989, Bashir sought to militarily end a long-running civil war against guerrillas from the mainly animist and Christian south. His war policy led to more bloodshed, further fatigued the economy and encouraged discontented communities like the African tribes of Darfur in western Sudan to take up arms for a larger share of the country's national resources and put an end to perceived discrimination by the Arabized and Muslim north.

The south seceded in 2011, and with that the Khartoum government lost about three quarters of its oil wealth. A year earlier, Bashir was indicted by the International Criminal Court for genocide in Darfur, but the Sudanese leader continued to be a welcome guest at several Arab and African nations. Last week, he made a surprise visit to Syria, becoming the first Arab leader to visit the strife-torn country since civil war began there in 2011..

Sudan's economy has struggled for most of Bashir's rule, which has failed to unite or keep the peace in the religiously and ethnically diverse nation. In his latest bid to secure economic aid, he has strengthened ties to oil-rich Gulf Arab nations, especially Saudi Arabia. He has sent Sudanese troops to Yemen to fight alongside a Saudi-led coalition backing the government there against Iran-aligned rebels in a civil war that broke out in 2014.

Bashir has also curbed relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional archrival, to win the goodwill of Riyadh and its Gulf Arab allies. He also mended relations with Egypt, his powerful neighbor to the north, after a period of tension mostly because of a long-running dispute over an Egyptian-held border area claimed by Sudan."

Even when State Government has released Rs 8 crore under road safety fund to end traffic accidents and ensure effective traffic management, killer roads of Jammu and Kashmir continue to take toll on innocent lives. It was only some days ago that three children among seven persons died when the car carrying 10 persons rolled down a gorge in Reasi. Onlybe a a fortnight ago 11 people onboard a Superfast bus were killed in Poonch area of Jammu. Negligent driving are stated to be prime reasons for these accidents but how this negligence be allowed to kill people for no fault of theirs is a question that needs answers. The year 2018 had witnessed worst road accidents not only on highways but well within city limits leaving indelible scars on the families of those who have lost their dear ones in fatal road accidents.

While negligent driving that includes driving on wrong sides, driving without helmet, rash driving, drinking and driving besides not following road rules have become prime reasons of deaths on roads, air pollution and potholes - are being cited as two added reasons of deaths in India which are going unnoticed and unplugged. While former reasons attribute to human negligence later ones are man-made and very much within permissible manageable limits. Still, no one is bothered. If these unnatural deaths rather 'killings' are not enough to wake us up then what will remain is a big question to be answered rather explored.

While around 12.4 lakh deaths in India in 2017 have been attributable to air pollution alone about, 14,926 people have been killed on roads due to potholes in last five years which even the Supreme Court has termed as ""unacceptable"". Coming to our own state, just within last two days a bus that has 'SUPERFAST' written on its rear plunged into a deep gorge killing 11 people onboard and leaving many injured in Poonch area of Jammu. Similarly in Kashmir's Baramulla district a newly wedded couple was hit and killed by a vehicle. The couple was on a motorcycle and died on the spot after getting hit.

These incidents might be newspaper reports for many but for those who lose dear ones their whole 'world' gets shattered. Pathetically, we are not sensitive enough to understand how much painful is it to lose a dear one for someone else's faults of rash or negligent driving. While engineers are to be blamed for not designing and constructing safe roads, traffic authorities are to be blamed for not making people follow rules and transport authorities are equally to be blamed for allowing unfit passengers vehicles to stay on roads even when they are not safe in terms of machinery or interiors built of steel and other unsafe materials.

While data of deaths on roads have exceeded deaths of soldiers killed in conflict zones the number of those killed in city areas is more than those killed on highways. This states that while highways have become safe, city roads have become death traps because of pots, dilapidated conditions and rash and negligent driving. Death of Muzaffar Ahmad Khan and his wife in Pattan who were riding a motorcycle when they were hit by a car at Tapper area is an example and a similar shocking data about road accidents gets reported in Jammu almost every day where several precious lives are lost on roads.

Deaths due to Air Pollution

A study, published in the Lancet Planetary Health journal says that more people are dying of air pollution in India than because of tobacco use. Fine dust particles of the size 2.5 Particulate Matter (PM) goes into lungs and cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems besides irritating eyes, throats and skin. Lead, Platinum-group elements, aluminum, zinc and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are found out to be key components of 'road dust' that damage outdoor air quality levels above the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) safe limit.

In Jammu work on flyover that's part of Jammu-Akhnoor road widening is generating enormous 'Road Dust' which is affecting health of those living in the vicinity of construction site and also those working on the project. Those into project constructions like National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) need to use sprinklers so that dust is settled every time excavation or other dust generating works are carried out. The move will not only help those living or working in the vicinity of project but lives of construction workers will also be saved rather enhanced by few years.

The Lancet report has also suggested that average life expectancy could have been 1.7 years higher had pollution levels been less than the minimal level causing health loss in India. Being a developing nation and especially Jammu and Kashmir which is yet to witness mega projects like construction of circular road, flyovers, road widening projects at Janipur and New Plot, barrages, housing colonies and river view fronts has either to be prepared for damages or find remedial measures to cut air pollution in coming days before this development costs us our lives.

Another prime reason for air pollution in our state are stone crushers, generator sets, diesel vehicles, saw mills, paint works of vehicles and buildings that's done without any safety measure, use of fossil fuel in areas where intense cold conditions prevail, emission from unchecked industries and chemicals used in farming. Each and every constituent goes unchecked causing breathing problems in Jammu as well as Srinagar. There are also reports of premature deaths due to rising levels of pollution in air and its high time Pollution Control Board besides other allied agencies crack their whip on and act tough against violators.

Deaths due to Potholes

The Supreme Court of India (SC) while hearing an issue related to road safety across the country observed that probably more people are killed on roads than on borders and described the scenario - deaths due to potholes are 'unacceptable'. The data might have shocked the apex court but not moved engineers in Jammu and Kashmir State. A pothole that once was created due to sinking of road or other reason on any stretch in Jammu or Srinagar continues to stay there for several years till work is again taken up (This happens once in a year).

Those in doubt can visit Ware House in Jammu and several other roads that cite best examples of ""roads in between potholes"" and not ""potholes in between roads"". Death of 14,926 people in road accidents just because of potholes in last five years in India as expressed by apex court are not only ""unacceptable"" but ""shocking"" as well. Not even once the cause of accident is investigated so that remedial measures are taken up to save lives.

Shockingly multiple accidents at same site never shake anyone. About half a dozen pots in Kachi Chawni where children drive two wheelers and millions in Ware House, Narwal besides those in posh localities not only compromise on safely but also pose a threat to people's lives. Unfortunately certain localities have become no-man's land where Jammu Municipal Corporation, JDA, ERA, PWD and Housing Board all carry out works according to their conveniences and availability of funds but no one owns the roads in letter and spirit so that maintenance work in carried out regularly.

A bench headed by Justice Madan B Lokur was of the opinion, ""probably more than those killed on border or by the terrorists"". The bench, also comprising justices Deepak Gupta and Hemant Gupta has categorically said that authorities concerned were not maintaining the roads. The report on road safety was submitted by the Supreme Court Committee headed by former apex court judge K S Radhakrishnan.

The only silver lining visible is that since the bench had said that people who have lost their lives as a result of accidents due to potholes should be entitled to compensation, people now can sue agencies responsible for keeping potholes intact on roads. Anyone dying due to faulty road will be liable for compensation depending upon his or her stature. To shame Governments people in many cities have started planting saplings in potholes on roads and before such a trend catches up with people of Jammu it's advisable if agencies carry out safety audit of all roads and fill up potholes immediately.

Deaths due to negligence

When we talk of deaths due to negligence, it's both on the part of road users as well as agencies. Most of the commuters and drivers in Jammu take wrong sides to reach their destinations from City Chowk to Raghunath Bazar, Flyover to Bus stand near MLA hostel, from Gandhi Nagar to police lines outside Hotel Asia and likewise several other places in the city crucial being one from Super Specialty Hospital to Jewel Chowk. Such shortcuts not only risk lives of drivers but also of those coming from other ends.

Crossings like those at Bikram Chowk, Maheshpura Chowk, outside Police Headqurters, Gandhi Nagar, Gandhi Nagar near Hospital, one connecting Trikuta Nagar and Channi Himmat near Canal head are most violated areas where drivers hardly stop on traffic signals. Such negligent moves become fatal as well. In absence of zebra crossings at several points especially outside schools and where students' tuition hubs are located lives of many have been compromised with.

Still worst are trollies that are towed by tractors which actually are meant for agriculture purposes. Most of these tractor trollies are used by miners. After loading them with sand, stones or crushed stones the same are kept in waiting on highways at Manda, Ram Nagar, Sidhra Chowk or even at Narwal besides on road leading to water works department at Panjtirthi. After dusk, these trollies are then ferried into city streets posing great risk to two-wheelers who can't see trollies towed by tractors.

Despite court orders and orders of traffic authorities, neither the mining has stopped nor brazen misuse of tractor trollies. This is sheer negligence that needs to be tamed. Another worst example of negligence is road crossing by pedestrians who occupy carriage way and leave no space for vehicular traffic.

Both Jammu as well as Srinagar cities don't have required footpaths, sub-ways, zebra crossings and adequate parking spaces that create a virtual mess. While Municipal Corporations of both cities have spent lakhs of rupees on building new, exclusive ad ornamental bus stops the minibuses don't actually stop at designated sites. This also creates a mess thereby leaving no space for others to drive safely. Children especially students don't wear helmets which should be more of a responsibility than obeying law.

In nutshell it's being civilized than being arrogant. Sooner we learn to be safe on roads and give people safe roads better it would be for us all. And as a tribute to lives lost on city roads of Jammu and Kashmir and apathy of those who are waiting for more blood to be spilled on roads before they actually build safe roads here I quote Faiz Ahmad Faiz, ""tujh ko kitnoñ ka lahu chahiye ai arz-e-vatan, jo tire ariz-e-be-rañg ko gulnar kareñ, kitni aahoñ se kaleja tira ThanDa hoga, kitne aañsu tire sahraoñ ko gulzar kareñ (How many sighs will soothe your heart, How many tears will cause your deserts to bloom?)."

According to the PRO speaking on the occasion, Chancellor, Lt. Gen (Retd) Atta Hasnain, said, ""Education plays an important role in restoring, self-esteem, dignity, and confidence among people anywhere. I have always loved the land and people of Kashmir."" He said the poor quality of land coupled with other issues has created impediments in the establishment of the varsity at its designated place. He asked the faculty members to remain more interactive in order to cultivate the benefits of collective wisdom. He said the Central University of Kashmir and Jammu should jointly hold academic and sports activities and invite students and scholars of their varsities to participate in them, adding the faculty members of both the institutions should frequently interact with each other. ""Both the universities should come up as model universities,"" he said. CUK Chancellor also advocated for the promotion of mentorship in the institution and asked the students to conduct a research about the concept of mentorship and how can it make a difference in the functioning of the university. He opined that a competition should be organized to prompt the students to write papers on mentorship for which prizes should be awarded.

The PRO said the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Mehraj ud Din Mir, gave a detailed presentation about the university and said the varsity has nine Schools and 18 PG departments with near about 35 programs including five years integrated courses and skill-based programs. He said the admission to the programs including research degree programs offered by the CUK and other sister universities is jointly conducted by the consortium of 10 Central Universities on the basis of Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET). He said the Examination and Evaluation Wing of the university is always conducting the End Semester Examinations (ESE) and other assessment tests on time and is declaring their results immediately.

""The number of students and scholars receiving education and pursuing research in the university as on date is more than 2300,"" Prof. Mehraj ud Din Mir said.

He said the university has already established an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC), Directorate of Students Welfare, Research Council and other important cells and bodies, adding the university has an efficient student feedback system. Prof. Mehraj ud Din Mir said the varsity, despite facing infrastructural deficiencies, has organized several international and national seminars, workshops, conferences, guest and extension lectures, and other academic activities from time to time. He said the curriculum of all the programs is upgraded to address the needs of different stakeholders including the public and private sector. The university since recent past has been focusing more on skill based technical courses and integrated programs to ensure employability of the graduates and to also make them skilled, he said adding the varsity has recently established a Design and Innovation Centre (DIC) to provide skill-based training."

The division bench of the high court had yesterday quashed a single bench order that had given a go-ahead to the ambitious roadshow of the saffron party.

BJP leaders, who held meetings with legal counsels in New Delhi on Saturday afternoon, are likely to move the court sometime next week.

""Party leaders in Delhi have decided to move the Supreme Court against the division bench order. Yatra schedule has already been postponed a few times, and we cannot delay it further,"" Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.

""Delhi leaders will decide on the date to move the Supreme Court by Monday morning,"" Ghosh added.

Yesterday, the division bench of the high court observed that the trial court's order was not based on the material facts.

Following the order, BJP leaders went into a huddle and started seeking legal opinions.

""In both the cases we will have to file a fresh petition. Examinations will start after February 10 in different schools. Given the time constraint, the case needs to move fast,"" a BJP leader said.

The proposed yatra, which will cover 23 districts over a period of more than 40 days, includes at least 22 meetings in different Lok Sabha constituencies. While it will not be possible to touch each of the 78,000 booths in the state, thousands of upa-rath (smaller yatra) will start from districts and join the main yatra.

Meanwhile, her cousin, whom the police suspected, has committed suicide.

Lalau, Agra: The last thing 15-year-old Sanjali Chanakya asked of her mother was that ""she continue to fight for justice"" for her.

""I couldn't fight in this life ma, but you don't give up,"" her mother remembers her saying, shortly before succumbing to full thickness burns that covered more than 50 per cent of her body.

Sanjali was set on fire by two unidentified men who arrived on a red motorcycle Tuesday afternoon, as the class 10 student walked home from Asharfi Devi Chidda Singh Inter-College in the Naumeel village of Agra district, which is located roughly five kilometres from her home in neighbouring Lalau. One of the attackers poured the petrol, while the other threw a lighter at her. The loose sand by the side of National Highway 39 still carries the mark of scorched earth.

After being rushed to S.N. Medical College and Hospital in Agra, Sanjali was transferred to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi the same evening. She died in the wee hours of Thursday.

At least three schools have been shut in Lalau and surrounding villages -- the girls say they are too scared to walk the streets.

DSP Namrita Srivastava, the circle officer of Agra, says ""the police are very close to arresting the culprits"". But it has now been four days since the crime, and Sanjali's family is beginning to lose hope that justice will be done.

""My daughter is gone, and she's never coming back. Now all I can wish for is that the men responsible for this are behind bars,"" Sanjali's mother, Anita, tells ThePrint.

Sanjali had big dreams. ""I want to grow up to be an IPS officer,"" she had told her father Harendra Singh, who smiles as he relives the memory.

""I told her that I'm not a man with enough means to fulfil that promise, but Sanjali didn't quit easily. She told me that 'one way or the other, we must figure it out',"" he says.

Sanjali's older sister Anjali adds: ""Do you know, she even won a bicycle once... I think it was an inter-college general knowledge competition in her school and she came first.""

Rajendra Singh, a fellow resident of the village, remembers Sanjali as a headstrong, independent and ambitious girl, ""who was an exceptional student"". She would even help her father and sister with sums.

Harendra recalls: ""Sometimes, it felt like she wasn't my daughter but my mother. She'd tell me to keep quiet when I wasn't making sense. She'd set the table and ask us all to come for dinner. She wanted to be so many things when she grew up,"" her father tells ThePrint.

Uttar Pradesh deputy CM Dinesh Sharma reached the grieving household early Friday afternoon, accompanied by an entourage of at least 20 police officers, as well as BJP MLA Hemlata Divakar, and former mayor of Agra Anjula Singh Mahor.

Sharma assured the family that the culprits would be brought to justice swiftly, and ""will not be spared"". Further he promised compensation of Rs 5 lakh, as opposed to the initial sum of Rs 2 lakh.

For Sanjali's father, however, the offer is meaningless. ""The deputy CM basically came to negotiate a payment... He was bargaining with us, saying 'Okay not 2, take 5',"" he says.

Asked if she has faith that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath will take action, mom Anita says: ""Absolutely none.""

Anjali adds: ""If it was his daughter, he'd run barefoot to get this solved.""

Sanjali hailed from a Dalit family, but the police and the family both believe there's no caste angle to her murder. The family, in fact, said Dalit residents of Lalau don't face discrimination.

Members of parties across the spectrum -- the BJP, Congress, BSP, and the women's wing of the CPI(M) -- have made appearances at Lalau to offer their condolences and promise swift justice.

On the other hand, in a tweet Thursday, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad put forth a challenge that ""if these miscreants aren't caught, then I'll shut the whole country down like what happened on April 2nd.""

A few hours later, he arrived with a group of at least 30 Bhim Army members at the family's doorstep.

""I have faith that they will be caught, but if they're not, then the entire Bhim Army is ready to take to the streets and protest. If someone is being protected, then we won't stand by that,"" Azad said as he addressed the locals and the press.

Another Bhim Army leader, Sikandar Boudh, says the Bhim Army demands swift justice, Rs 1 crore as compensation, a job for a family member, a CBI investigation, and death penalty for the perpetrators. He says these demands have been given in writing to the District Magistrate of Agra, Ravi Kumar.

Amid this political heat, one can hear the wails of Sanjali's aunt, 50-year-old Rajan Devi. A woman supports her as she walks, leading her to the congregation of mourners and bystanders outside the family's home Friday. One hour later, the white sheet-wrapped body of her own 25-year-old son, Yogesh Singh, is placed on the floor in front of her and her husband.

Less than a day after his cousin's death, Yogesh committed suicide in his room by ingesting poison. His mother does not know why, except that her son expressed considerable anxiety at having been summoned by the police as a suspect in the death of his paternal cousin.

""The police had taken him to the station for questioning, and when I went to meet him, he asked me if people in the village knew that he has been taken to the police station. I said they did,"" Rajan Devi says.

She adds that Yogesh was taken by the police to Delhi Wednesday, and even met his cousin while she was in critical care. He was released on return, and even made it home for dinner.

""Everything was normal. He woke up in the morning, had tea, and spoke to the family. I went to get ready to go to his uncle's (Sanjali's father) house, and he came out of his room after some time complaining of an unbearable stomach ache,"" she recalls. Yogesh was declared dead by doctors hours later.

He had completed his B.Ed. and hoped to be the principal of a school someday. In the meantime, he provided for his family by working at Torrent Power, the distributor of electricity in Agra city.

He is also not the first son Rajan Devi is mourning -- Pankaj, Yogesh's elder brother had lost his life under the wheels of a train three years ago.

Bhim Army's Boudh says: ""The police wants to frame the cousin brother because they don't have any leads. An effort to sully the nature of their relationship has been made in this regard.""

Rajan Devi adds: ""The things that people are saying aren't true, about Yogesh and Sanjali. He wasn't a boy like that at all. He was kind and good-natured.""

Yogesh's father, meanwhile, weeps in front of his son's body -- the solitary man on the floor amongst a sea of veiled women.

""We were happy,"" Anjali says, ""and now there is nothing."""

On Thursday (December 20), over 35 trade organisations in Kerala came together to announce that 2019 will be 'anti-hartal year'. The Cochin Chamber of Commerce believes that the frequency of hartals - otherwise known as bandhs - in Kerala is cutting Rs 7,200 crore from the state's GDP.

""There were 97 hartals last year. The traders, hoteliers, bus owners and other establishments were facing a loss of crores of rupees due to such flash hartals,"" Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti state president T. Nasarudheen told PTI. """"We want all the political parties to co-operate with us. Even a minister had said the political parties need to find an alternative to such flash strike calls.""

On December 14, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called for a state-wide strike in Kerala, to mourn the death of an activist who allegedly self-immolated at the Sabarimala protest site in Thiruvananthapuram.

Although the commissioner of police said that the deceased had set himself on fire for personal reasons - not because of the Sabarimala issue - the BJP state leadership announced a protest hartal.

Economic loss

According to anti-hartal activists, December 14 was the 97th strike in the state this year, and the sixth shutdown the party has forced in just three months because of the Sabarimala row.

V. Venugopal, the president of Cochin Chamber of Commerce, said that if a hartal is considered '100% successful', it takes away Rs 900 crore from the state's overall Rs 7.76 lakh crore GDP.

""Hundred percent successful means the entire state comes to a standstill,"" Venugopal said. ""State-run public transport system and private vehicles are forced to stop operating in fear of hooliganism. Shops, schools and universities are forced to remain closed and exams are postponed.""

The ripple effects continue through the economy - through delays in shipments and transportation, supply chain interruption, and damage to inventory.

""Even with local hartals, transportation through that area is impacted, with knockdown effects on other parts of the state,"" Venugopal said.

Breaking the habit

Some leaders, however, are ready to free Kerala from the habit. Shashi Tharoor, Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, told The Wire that he has been a consistent opponent of hartals.

""When I entered politics, I pledged to oppose all hartals, even if my own party called one,"" he said. ""While I support the right of workers to strike, I consider it a deeply anti-social act to compel others to do so. Hartals have kept students from exams, patients from hospitals and cost crores in lost economic activity. No one has the right to coerce others into giving up their work or other commitments, whatever the cause.""

""I have kept my office and home office open and worked on all hartal days, on principle. I would be in favour of an all-party consensus against hartals,"" Tharoor added. ""It surprises me that a people as hard-working and industrious abroad as Keralites are so willing to enjoy enforced idleness at home.""

A bandh by any other name

In 1997, a full bench of the Kerala high court banned bandhs. The Supreme Court shot down the then Left government's petition to get the order reversed.

Bandhs were promptly renamed 'hartals' to get around the law.

In 2000, the Kerala high court ruled that the enforcement of a hartal by ""force, intimidation - physical or mental - and coercion"" was unconstitutional. This has not discouraged Kerala's politicians.

In 2015, Venugopal said, ""The previous the Congress-led government introduced the Hartal Regulation Bill. The Bill was sent to a Select Committee for consideration but has not seen the light of day since then.""

Indian National Trade Union Confederation (INTUC) Kerala vice president C. Haridas, an ex-parliamentarian, clarified that hartals are not the same as workers' strikes.

""Hartals announced by the BJP in the state are unnecessary and create loss for the state's revenue and inconvenience for the people,"" he said. ""Workers' strike cannot be seen like that. They are forced to strike for their survival.""

Hinting at the upcoming bank employees' strike on December 21 and 26, the union leader said that such strikes are necessary when the government is privatising and liquidating public sector units, putting workers' futures at risk.

Signs of improvement

According to a document from the State Planning Board, 85,000 person-days were lost due to strikes in Kerala in the financial year 2017 (up to July), as against 2.68 lakh in the year up to July 2013.

A Times of India report indicates that Tamil Nadu fared worse: it lost the most number of days to strikes in 2017 - 5.74 lakh - followed by Kerala (1.37 lakh) and Gujarat (99,883).

Informal workers hit hardest

The tourism sector, a mainstay of the Kerala economy, is bleeding from the impact of frequent hartals.

According to Venugopal, some 50,000 domestic and foreign tourists were trapped indoors due to the state-wide shutdown on December 15.

In Kochi, ""Around 2,500 foreign tourists - mostly from the UK and Germany - who arrived by a chartered flight and four cruise ships were left in the lurch when Kochi shut down.""

As part of the announcement of the 'anti-hartal year', the Kerala Tourism Task Force said the tourism industry will vehemently protest shutdowns, PTI reported.

It is in the informal sector, however, that workers are hurt most.

In general, wages in the formal economy are not cut due to hartal absences; firms often ask for work on weekends or extended working hours to make up for the lost time. Informal workers are forced to stay at home, and lose their day's income.

Rahman M., a fish seller in Kothamangalam, a central Travancore town, said that every hartal is a nightmare for him.

""People like us, who depend on daily business, who do business on the streets, are the ones who are the most affected,"" he said. ""I need Rs 1,000 every day for survival. My parents need medicines worth Rs 600 daily. With the remaining Rs 400, my family survives. It's stressful and painful when we lose even one day's business.""

A division bench of justices Dharam Chand Chaudhary and Chander Bhusan Barowalia Thursday ordered the department's director to file an affidavit detailing the mechanism to check the malady in the state's school.

The bench passed the order while dismissing an appeal by a teacher whose absence from the school had been treated by authorities as ""dies non"".

""Dies non"" means a day which is not treated as a day on duty. While it does not constitute a break in the service, the period does qualify as service for pension benefits or increments.

In its order, the bench asked the director if any mechanism has been enforced by the department to ensure that the teachers attend their schools every day and do not proceed on leave without getting it sanctioned.

The bench also asked as to what was the provision for informing the school in case of a teacher proceeding on an emergency leave. Seeking the affidavit within two weeks, the bench adjourned the matter for next hearing on January 7."

""List of structures constructed in or before 1960 will require to be sent to the state-level committee for final decision,"" sources said.

At present, the process to confirm minutes of the meeting is going on. Members of the committee including commissioner of police BK Upadhyay, NIT chairman Ashwin Mudgal, representatives of state PWD, revenue department etc will sign the minutes.

Later, suggestions and objections will be invited on the list of Category A and B for a period of one month followed by hearing of those who will submit the objections.

The entire process including division of structures in categories is being done as per orders of Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court. The final list will be submitted to the HC. The number of illegal religious structures already demolished has reached 738. The civic body had razed over 400 structures on roads and footpaths. The NIT had demolished 338 such structures.

Meanwhile, NMC town planning department is finalizing a policy to regularize illegal religious structures constructed in open spaces and not obstructing traffic. After approval of general body, the department invited suggestions and objections on the proposed policy. Only three suggestions were received and all of them in favour of the policy.

The department will submit the policy with the state government for final approval. After clearance, NMC can regularize these structures by giving lease of the lands, sanctioning building plans etc."

A new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. (Mohit Suneja/HT)

To the world, Manish Sarki was the perfect all-rounder.

A strapping boy of 18, Sarki worked hard in school during the day and sent fielders scurrying after his shots at the neighbourhood cricket ground in the evenings. He would never get home later than dinner time even when his friends were out chatting, his mother Chandra Maya remembers, and his closest friends joked about how he would blush talking to girls.

Everyone in the village of St Mary's Hill knew Sarki would grow up to be a policeman or join the army. Maybe because he was so well-behaved, no one noticed when he went quiet. They only noticed on the night of August 20 when he didn't come back home.

The village gathered around the Sarki house around 9pm. A chill was enveloping the small mountain village on the outskirts of Darjeeling in northern Bengal, but a small group of men and women trekked to the local police station a couple of kilometers away. Boys go missing all the time, they were told.

Undeterred, the villagers split into smaller search parties and fanned out into the jungles, determined to find Sarki. Their hopes were dashed around 1.30am when a search team stumbled on Sarki's body hanging from the ceiling of an empty pig warehouse on top of a hill.

Below, in spray paint, were the words ""half blood prince was here"" in what everyone recognised was Sarki's handwriting. On the wall behind was drawn a hangman with two victims, an older boy, and more chillingly, a younger one. Every wall of the building had been scribbled on - the words ""illuminati"", ""last king"", ""savage"", ""doped up"" and the number ""666"" appearing repeatedly.

In the light of day, some of the graffiti might have appeared benign - after all, some the walls displayed banalities like ""be the change you want to see"" or ""the thing you fear the most is fear itself"". But in the eerie quiet of a cold mountain night, the villagers were convinced Sarki's death was the doing of the satan. ""I was heartbroken for my son but also scared out of my wits. We were all scared about who the younger boy could be,"" said Chandra Maya.

By the time police arrived two hours later, a mist of rumours had cloaked the village. Wasn't Sarki always on his phone for the past few weeks? And, wouldn't he go out to the graveyard, barely a kilometer away, every night with his phone? ""I think he was going crazy. That's when I heard about the game,"" added Chandra Maya.

By sunrise, everyone had heard of the game: a shadowy application called the Momo Challenge that had apparently killed Sarki. Several explanations were offered. ""For the past few days, he was very sad and distracted. He would be lost in his phone. He never said anything to me, later I found out that he was playing the Momo game,"" said Sarki's friend Deekchen.

But how did he find out? Villagers say the local police first told them of the game, but the police deny ever saying anything. ""In fact, we have not been able to confirm any role of any Momo Challenge game. We never told the locals about the game. Maybe the graffiti made them think that,"" said Hare Krishna Pai, additional superintendent of police.

'HI, I AM MOMO. LET US PLAY A GAME'

The next day, a second death, that of 26-year-old Aditi Goyal in Kurseong town, was also attributed to the Momo Challenge, turning the creeping fear into full-blown panic. By then, local politicians had put out statements about the supposedly lethal game, and everyone in the hills was talking about it.

""The whole area was in trauma and everyone was scared of their phones. We found young boys from Class 7 had started playing it. We started spreading awareness and seized phones from those who seemed vulnerable. Someone even sent a message to my daughter,"" said Raju Gurung, a local from Kurseong.

Hindustan Times spoke to at least 20 people in the area and everyone claimed to know a relative, friend or neighbour who had had a close shave with the game. But everyone had a different notion.

Some described the game, which supposedly sets self-harm challenges that finally end in suicide, as an app, some as a Whatsapp message. Some said they received texts, some described a phone number. Indeed, beyond the ubiquitous image of the oblong faced, bulbous eyed doll that has come to signify the game, every detail was foggy. ""Sometimes people are faking names and photos and sending messages 'Hi, I am momo. Let us play a game.' The fear of the game has hypnotised us,"" said Junita Rana, a schoolteacher in Kurseong.

AN EPIDEMIC OF FEAR

It began with the braids. In June last year, a girl in Rajasthan claimed someone chopped off her braid while she was asleep. Dozens of women across Rajasthan followed up with similar claims. Over the following months, the pattern spread across north India like an epidemic: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi. By November, over 200 cases of braid chopping had been reported in Kashmir where the trend took its most vicious turn. Many women claimed to have seen Godmen, witches or cats before losing their consciousness. After finding their braids gone, many complained of aches and pains for days after. The police couldn't really find any culprits, so the people took the matter in their hands. In August, a poor woman was killed by a mob in Agra on the suspicion of chopping braids. In October, an old man in Anantnag was killed for the same reason.

Then there was the Blue Whale. In July, a schoolboy's suicide stoked the hysteria around the web-based game created by a Russian tech geek targeting teengers. The 50 challenges begin differently-- from shutting yourself in or watching a horror film-- proceed incrementally, and end the same way: suicide. Through 2017, more than 150 cases of young suicides across India -- West Bengal, Delhi, Indore, Solapur, Dehradun-- were blamed on the Blue Whale, often with no more proof that the young person was obsessed with smartphone and videogames. Every case was rife was contradictions and yet, websites were blocked, advisories issued, and in some cases, smartphones banned in schools.

FACE-RIPPERS AND VAMPIRES

Experts say that underneath the web-fuelled hysteria, something more sinister is going on with the mental health of young people. Samir Parikh, director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, insisted that we cannot dismiss these phenomena, but the focus should be on greater media literacy, on making children understand what is right and wrong content, and on teaching people to seek help if they are feeling vulnerable.

""Is there a component of hysteria in all this? Of course, there are lots of stories in the media and they have an impact. But we cannot deny the fact that there are pressures and problems that young people go through silently. If help and access is not given, they can be misused,"" he added.

Parikh is clear that any approach that aims at shutting down access to the internet is wrong, mainly because it is impossible. ""We need to understand that be it Blue Whale or Momo, if you are vulnerable, you might be pulled towards it. So you give people skills and teach people to not bottle it up, tell parents, block or involve authorities.""

India has had a long history of public panic. From a half-man half-monkey roaming the streets in Delhi, sometimes wearing a helmet, to the Munhnochwa (face ripper) of Mirzapur, claimed to be a flying object emitting beams of green or red light, sending shock waves through anyone who came in its contact, and leaving them with bites and scratches on their faces, to the Rathakaatteri (vampire) of Gundalpatti who allegedly sucked the blood of the village cattle, a new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. Many of these have been analysed as incidents of mass hysteria. The patterns have been revealing. Women are more likely to end up as victims than men, children turn to be more vulnerable than adults. The trends pick up in regions or communities marked by oppression of women, economic uncertainty or social anxiety.

Yet, questions remain about why a particular fear grips a set of people at a given time. Did every woman who complained of braid chopping do it herself? Was every alleged case of Blue Whale suicide made up by the parents or the police to evade responsibility? What do the women whose braids were chopped say now? And, did a year of fear and panic leave us any wiser?

LOSING BRAIDS, EARNING REST

In Kanganhedi, a village of 700 houses on the Delhi-Haryana border, Munesh Devi's hair has grown back just enough to tie it in a ponytail. A lot more has changed in her life since last year besides her hairstyle. ""I can no longer work in our field. I hardly leave the house, except being taken to the doctor by my son every two weeks. Any exertion leaves me tired. Even going to funerals gets up my blood pressure. I lie in bed almost all day. Daughters-in-law press my feet.They also bring me rotis to eat in bed,"" said Devi, sitting on a double bed in the living room. Its doors remain shut and its light dimmed to prevent Devi's recurring headache.

They began in July 2017, immediately after she found her braid chopped at the neck. It was there when she finished feeding the cows in the family's farm, she said, but gone when she got back home and slipped back her pallu. ""Must have gone missing while I was travelling home on the back of my son's motorcycle,"" she added. She remembers fainting after the realisation struck. She continues to feel giddy. ""My head spins. My whole body aches. My feet go numb. My teeth hurt."" She doesn't know what ails her; neither does her doctor. He prescribes her pills for each of her symptoms. She shows off the stash to people asking her how she has been doing since ""the incident.""

Munesh Devi's was one of three braids found missing in the area in the course of one eventful day. The other two women don't know, either, who chopped their braids or why they continue to suffer. Sri Devi said she lost her braid while sitting on a couch in the courtyard of her house. One moment it was hanging down her waist, the next moment it was lying on the floor. She had heard of the braid-chopping phenomenon only hours before. ""My uncle, who was visiting us from Pataudi, had told me about a video he had seen on Facebook. I said, 'Mama, please don't say such things.'"" Her son had called 100 after she fainted at the sight of her severed braid. ""The police are yet to tell us if they found anything,"" she said.

Devi also visited a psychiatrist in Dwarka along with her son, at the urging of the police. ""He asked my son some questions. Gave us no answers,"" she said. Her braid was taken away by a forensics team sent in by the police for further investigations. ""We haven't heard from them."" Perturbed by three incidents in a week, people in the village even consulted a tantrik (mystic). ""He spoke about the presence of a mysterious cat in the village. But no such cat or dog has been found,"" she said.

For many women, the disappearance of braids has been transformative. It has allowed them rightful rest after a lifetime's slog at home and farm, won them the nurturing attention of their families, and given them the chance to talk about themselves for the first time. The third ""victim"" in Kangnahedi, Ombati, a daily-wage labourer who found her braid gone while working around the house, is still waiting for her life to change, however. ""No government compensation, no one has even come to offer me a glass of juice,"" she said, lying on a cot and complaining of a headache.

""We sent a team to that village for a couple of hours after a request from the concerned division of the Delhi police, but we haven't received any formal communication from the top brass,"" explained Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, which had investigated the phenomenon of Delhi's Monkey-man in 2001. ""From the preliminary impressions of our team, in all probability, the incidents in Kanganhedi fit into the pattern of mass hysteria, which tends to subside on its own.""

MASKED MEN OR MAIDS?

In Kashmir, the last region to be swept up in the storm, over 100 FIRs were registered over six months. Many women alleged masked men entered their homes when they were alone, sprinkled sedatives in the air, and chopped their braids while they lay unconscious. Separatist leaders accused the Indian government, and armed militants suspected the evil hand of intelligence agencies. As locals flooded the streets in protest, shutting down shops and schools, the police resorted to extreme measures, from announcing an award of Rs 6 lakh for information to unleashing riot-control tactics to disperse the crowds. Several vigilante groups armed with lathis and axes emerged to patrol the streets at night. A 70-year-old man in Anantnag died after being hit by a brick by a group of people who suspected him to be a braid chopper.

But now, police say the paranoia and panic was fuelled by nothing substantive.

""Almost all the cases turned out to be without any substance. There were a few cases where the women had cut their hair themselves. In one case, a maid had cut the hair of a girl,"" said additional director general of police (law and order), Muneer Khan. In Kulgam, where 21 cases had been registered, the state government had formed a special investigation team(SIT). Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Kulgam, Aijaz Ahmad, who was part of the SIT, said that most of the cases have been closed because the allegations had no factual basis.

""In some of the cases, the culprits remain untraced, while maximum cases turned out to be of hysteria,"" Ahmad said. He said the lack of a single eyewitness in all of the cases was particularly baffling.

Across the valley, the police arrested between 70 and 80 people, including members of vigilante groups, for ""raising false alarm about braid chopping and creating disturbances"".

""We felt that this [braid chopping] was being done by agencies. It was a matter of honour of our women. Everybody wanted this should end. Stone pelting was the only option with us. Surprisingly it did end abruptly after that,"" said a villager from north Kashmir who requested anonymity. Some of them are still visiting the courts for hearings.

BLUE WHALES AND PHONE BANS

It was around 5pm on July 29 last year when Manpreet Singh Sahani climbed on the ledge of his fifth-floor apartment. As he teetered on the edge, neighbours and witnesses on the street below called out to him but could only watch helplessly as he jumped. Initial investigations by local police and testimonies of his friends exposed talk of the Blue Whale Challenge. Several of them took to social media to blame the game and link it to Sahani's death.

In 24 hours, reports of the supposedly lethal game had inundated media, and reports of copycat cases were streaming in from all parts of India, ratcheting up paranoia about mobile phone and internet use among teenagers and their parents. Over the next two months, more than 150 deaths or injuries across the country were alleged to be linked to the game.

But while police initially suspected the boy was an avid gamer and could have been influenced by the Blue Whale Challenge, detailed investigation indicated more offline triggers.

""The boy was in love with a girl who had left him for some other boy. We had gone through his email accounts and mobile phone and found a draft on the phone which clarified his intention to commit suicide,"" said Navin Reddy, deputy commissioner of police Zone 10.

This might not be an isolated phenomenon. Earlier this year, Union minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir told Lok Sabha that a committee formed under the chairmanship of the director general of the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) couldn't establish the involvement of the Blue Whale Challenge in any case.

""The committee analysed the internet activities, device activities, call records and other social media activity, other forensic evidences and also interacted with rescued victims associated with these incidents,"" the minister told the lower house.

Of course, by then several other central ministries, a number of state governments, the Central Board of Secondary Education and even the Supreme Court had got involved, with the apex court calling the game a ""national problem"".

But experts say official agencies may have jumped the gun. ""It was definitely a hoax. We need to shift focus from these voyeuristic things and to suicides, which is a big problem that kills a quarter of a million people. Some of these hoaxes have a life of their own because media makes them into a big story. We need long-term institutional solutions,"" said Soumitra Pathare, director of the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy.

THE BIGGEST TRAGEDY

Back in St Mary's hill, Chandra Maya Sarki has gone back to her old routine -- wake up at the crack of dawn to draw water, fix food for her husband before he leaves for his daily wage work, and then clean their small wooden house. She likes to keep the television on and stray dialogues from the afternoon soaps animate the living room. She stares not at the screen, however, but at the the small framed photo of Sarki hanging on the blue wall, wondering why the mysterious admins of the Momo Challenge chose her child as their prey.

She doesn't know yet that the cyber cell of the West Bengal police has completed its forensic probe of his phone and found no trace of any Momo Challenge. ""If any application is downloaded, the forensic machine would find a trace, even if it is an unknown application. But we have found no such application, or any message on WhatsApp motivating people to play the game. We have found nothing so far,"" said a senior official of the cyber cell on the condition of anonymity.

She doesn't know that police has ruled out any links between the game and the death of Aditi Goyal and that at least two other cases in the state have been found to be hoaxes traced back to mischief makers sending scary messages through WhatsApp. She doesn't know that Sarki's teacher Sarita Sharma has a simple explanation for why he and his friends would go to the graveyard at night -- the mobile network was the best at that spot.

All she knows is that her beloved younger son will no longer come back home at 8pm every day. That she will never make him his favourite meal of dal-aloo and dum-eggs. The money she had been saving with her husband to send him to Bengaluru for higher studies now seems meaningless. Sometimes she talks to Sarki's sister, now in college, about him and the day that took him away from her. She will probably never know what really happened to Sarki or what troubled him enough to withdraw from his friends. Momo Challenge or not, that is the biggest tragedy of all.

Despite measures by the management, the KSRTC could operate only 5,899 of the total 6,897 schedules due to the termination of 4,071 empanelled conductors. The demand for seats was high after schools and colleges closed on Friday.

The last mile connectivity and delay of mail and express trains due to ongoing track works make the KSRTC a better travel mode for long distance commuters.

The KSRTC had to cancel 998 schedules on Friday. In the morning, 402 schedules did not ply due to shortage of conductors and another 596 in the evening. In Thiruvananthapuram zone, 350 schedules were cancelled, 484 in Ernakulam and 164 in Kozhikode zone.

The KSRTC was suffering a daily loss of nearly ₹20 lakh due to the cancellation of schedules and this was creating a headache to the management, official sources said.

Curtailment of the schedules is likely to come down only after the newly recruited reserve conductors join duty in the depots allocated to them.

Another 60 more advised by the Kerala Public Service Commission reported at the Transport Bhavan on Friday. With this, the number of reserve conductors who has joined has gone up to 1,532.

There are speculation over how many who got advice memo would join duty. But the ruling of the High Court that the management could take the empanelled conductors and those from employment exchange came as a relief to the KSRTC.

Chairman and Managing Director Tomin J. Thachankary has approached the government to take some persons from the employment exchange for 180 days. The government would seek legal opinion on this, sources said.

Meanwhile, trade unions in the KSRTC, who are backing the empanelled personnel, took out a march to the Secretariat in support of the retrenched empanelled conductors."

He became angry seeing people selling oxen and sheep within the Temple. ""Jesus made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the Temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers' money and overturned the tables,"" reads Chapter 2, Verse 15 of the Gospel of John in the New Testament in the Bible.

The root cause behind the never-ending quarrel between the Jacobite Syrian Church and the Orthodox Syrian Church playing out now in the streets of Kerala is nothing but big business and wealth. Each of the two factions has enormous wealth. And there are scores of schools, colleges, hospitals and other institutions run by individual churches, which add to the wealth. All this besides the real estate value of the properties of the churches. The more than half a century old fight between the two factions of the Malankara Christians has taken a new turn with Thomas Paul Ramban, a priest of the Orthodox faction trying to enter the Marthoma Cheriapally in Kothamangalam, Ernakulam district, belonging to the rival Jacobite faction and hundreds of the church members blocking his way near the church.

The protracted legal fight has culminated in the 1995 Supreme Court verdict which came in favour of the Orthodox faction, giving them authority over all the churches and its properties. The Supreme Court has ordered that 1100 parishes and the churches under the two factions of the Malankara Church should be governed by the Orthodox faction. The rival faction, the Jacobite Church, which has allegiance to the Patriarch of Antioch, doesn't accept this. The Orthodox Church leadership has appointed Thomas Paul Ramban as the vicar of the Marthoma Cheriapally assuming that the church belongs to them as per the Supreme Court verdict, but the members of the church have raised tough resistance blocking the entry of Thomas Paul Ramban. Father Jose Parathuvayalil, the present vicar of the church, says that Paul Ramban has no right to come to this church. ""This parish has thousands of families, but the Ramban has come all alone. He couldn't mobilise even ten members. How can he be the vicar of this church?"" asks Father Jose.

The fight between the two factions took a new turn with the Supreme Court ordering on July 3 this year that the Jacobite Syrian Church cannot be a part of the Malankara group anymore. They will have to become an independent entity or disband the church and join the Orthodox Church.

The rift in the church started way back in 1599, when the Synod of the then church had its meeting in Udayamperoor in Ernakulam district which is known as the Udayamperoor Synod in the annuls of the Christian church history in Kerala. The synod, a high level meeting of the bishops, laid down rules and regulations for the Saint Thomas Christians of the Malabar Coast, that is, the state of Kerala and formally united them with the Catholic Church headed by the Pope in Rome. But the Orthodox Malankara Christians broke away from the Churches under the Pope and declared allegiance to the Patriarch of Antioch.

In 1910, the Malankara Orthodox Church split again into two factions, the JacobitChurchn Chuirch supporting the Patriarch of Antioch and the Kerala Malankara Orthodox Church propping up their own Bishop based out of Kottayam. It was the beginning of a big rift in between the two groups within the Malankara Christians, but both the factions reached a settlement in 1934, when the two groups came together electing a bishop Baselios Geevarghese Catholica in Kottayam.

The agreement, drafted by some leaders of the Orthodox faction, clearly says that the power of Church should rest with the Bishop in Kottayam but added that they will be in support of the Patriarch of Antioch. There was peace in the Church for some time, but in 1974, the Patriarch of Antioch anointed three bishops in Kerala which triggered another conflict. The two factions came alive again and started street fights in their strongholds capturing churches, which belonged to the unified church for centuries. The case reached the Supreme Court, which came out with a verdict in 1995 ruling that the agreement in 1995 will stand. It was a verdict in favour of the Orthodox faction and the Jacobites have never accepted this.

In 2002, the Jacobite faction gathered together in Puthen Cruz in Ernakulam district and named themselves Jacobite Syrian Christians. This unleashed a series of violence in several churches with the two factions fighting for supremacy in individual churches under the Orthodox Church headquartered at Devalokam in Kottayam and the Orthodox Church headquartered in Puthen Cruz. Several churches, including the famous Kolencherry church, were closed down for years. The matter reached the Supreme Court again which ruled that the 1934 agreement will prevail. The apex court made it clear that its verdict is applicable to all parishes and dioceses which simply means that the absolute power of the Church and all the parishes rests in the hands of the Bishops of the Orthodox faction, to the bitter worry of the Jacobite faction.

But the fact remains that there are several churches where the Jocobites are in majority. They say that they cannot part with their church as they are so much attached to them. And each church has a symmetry attached to it where their ancestors are buried, which of course add to the sentiments.

On December 10, the St Mary's Jacobite Syrian Church in Piravam witnessed tense moments when the police reached there to implement the Supreme Court verdict. Some members of the parish went up to the top of the church, poured kerosene on themselves, raising suicide threats while hundreds blocked the entry of police. The police had to retreat. And now the conflict is in Marthoma Cheriapally in Kothamangalam. The tension is likely to spread to other churches as well. A new headache for the state government after the Sabarimala crisis.

After 15 years of repression, misrule and loot of Chhattisgarh's natural resources, the defeat of Raman Singh's BJP government offers a historic opportunity for the state. In voting so decisively for the Congress, the people have not just unseated an incumbent, but signalled the kind of change they want.

Some of these aspirations are presaged in the Congress's manifesto, prepared, we are told, after extensive consultations with different sections of society.Apart from the farm loan waiver, increased minimum support prices and unemployment allowance, an emphasis on quality healthcare and education seem to be priorities for people, and the Congress would be wise to treat these as its priorities too.

But where the Congress has the chance to be really transformative is in how it addresses the Naxalite conflict. This is Rahul Gandhi's litmus test to show if he and his party care about India's adivasis.

If the Congress initiates talks with the Maoists, as they say in point 22 of their manifesto, they will have the full support of the people of Bastar. Far from ""teaching Congress a lesson for supporting urban Maoists"", as Modi repeatedly said on the campaign trail, the people of the region have given the Congress 11 out of 12 seats. There are indications in this win - for instance, the fact that they allowed Congress candidates to campaign in interior villages - that the Maoists too are ready for some kind of talks. They would be colossally foolish to give up an opportunity for a negotiated peace.

But equally important, a foundation must be built for such talks to succeed, and this can only be built on the basis of justice. 'Development' is no substitute for justice; both are rights but in different spheres and cannot be traded off against each other.

It is perhaps divine providence that the Delhi high court judgment on Sajjan Kumar came on the same day as the swearing in of the new Congress governments. Even though the party failed the test of justice in Madhya Pradesh by appointing Kamal Nath as chief minister, it has a chance in Chhattisgarh to redress its own historic wrongs.

Mahendra Karma, the Congress leader who was the local face of the BJP-backed Salwa Judum movement is no longer around to haunt the Congress. But the legacy of entire villages burnt, rape survivors, and children whose parents were brutally killed under the banner of Salwa Judum will continue to dog the footsteps of both the Congress and the BJP.

In a country where violence piles up on violence and every part of the country is torn and bleeding due to its own history of pogroms and massacres, it is easy to forget. Let me therefore quote from just one fact-finding report of December 2007, by Shanta Sinha, then the chairperson of the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, J.M. Lyngdoh (former CEC) and Venkat Reddy:

The public hearing was held in Charla and was attended by more than 200 IDP: men, women and children. The team heard the testimonies of over 35 people. Every testimony included a narrative of extreme violence committed against them, their families and property, by the Naxalites, Salwa Judum and the security forces. Many people shared accounts of family members being killed and women raped by the Salwa Judum. Having faced repeated acts of violence, harassment, arson and pillage the only option for these people was to run away from their villages and seek refuge in another state....Leaving behind their land and livestock they have arrived in Andhra Pradesh in a state of penury and distress.

The current deputy speaker of the Rajya Sabha, Harivansh, then editor of Prabhat Khabar, was a member of another fact-finding report on Bastar, War in the Heart of India, by the Independent Citizens Initiative, which found armed minor SPOs on the prowl, people forced into camps and complete lawlessness.

There has been no shortage of ground reports, media accounts and testimonies submitted to courts at all levels as well as institutions like the NHRC in the past 13 years which indicate human rights violations on a large scale, including mass gang rapes and the killing of unarmed civilian children. Unlike Delhi 1984 and Gujarat 2002, however, these atrocities have lasted for years over a vast area. As recently as September 2018, on a visit to Konta, I found the security forces were still raiding villages, destroying goods and killing individuals randomly on suspicion of being Maoists. Unlike 1984 and 2002, the violence has also not been one-sided: the only political strategy the Maoists appear to know is 'counter violence', whether against security forces or suspected (civilian) informers.

It is not as if the courts have not responded to these pleas - in its 2011 judgment the Supreme Court, apart from directing that SPOs be disbanded and disarmed, also directed the prosecution of all those guilty of human rights violations and compensation to all those affected. The tragedy, however, is that the government of Chhattisgarh wilfully flouted all these directions. A case for contempt has been pending in the Supreme Court since 2012.

In its manifesto, the Congress has promised to raise the prices of forest produce, to implement the Forest Rights Act 2006 and the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation Act (LARR) 2013. All of these are extremely important, and can make a difference to people outside the zone of immediate conflict as well as to lives ravaged by violence and illegal mining.

The Congress has also promised to give each 'Naxal affected panchayat' Rs 10 million, However, money to panchayats will not solve the problem - the brute reality is that in the worst ""Maoist affected Panchayats"", it is the Maoists and not the government who decide whether panchayat funds can be spent.

The Maoist complaint is that the money is spent on paper only, through collusion between district officials and sarpanches who live in Salwa Judum camps. They also argue that the excessive inflow of funds corrupts people, and have implemented a model of self-reliance in their areas, where people work on each other's fields and build ponds collectively.

""The people"", however, want panchayat funds so that they can develop their own villages instead of migrating as coolie labour to Andhra, but in these regions also trust the Maoists more than the government to protect their land and their lives. Villagers want schools and they want health facilities. The government has been saying that teachers can't go back to the villages without security, but the people don't see these as connected - for them it is security camps, which are the greatest source of insecurity.

The only basis on which this complicated narrative can be slowly changed is if the government makes justice its first priority. Fortunately, there are many examples around the world where such long running counter-insurgencies have been addressed - like Peru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, or Guatemala's Commission for Historical Clarification. Closer home, we have already submitted a Rehabilitation Plan to the Supreme Court, which outlines certain procedures. These include a survey of all conflict affected villages in Bastar to map the loss of lives and property; announcement of compensation; fast-track courts to release all those falsely accused in Naxalite cases; and restoration of essential services like schools, anganwadis, public distribution system etc.

For over a decade we have been pleading for an independent monitoring committee or at least a joint committee to oversee this rehabilitative exercise, in which all sides can work together instead of being adversarial.

Unlike its predecessor regime which believed that the way to fight legal battles where the evidence is clearly against you is to imprison your opponents on scurrilously false charges, the new government has a chance to act honourably. It should throw open the state to journalists, researchers, lawyers and activists - who have in the past been threatened, forced out, and vilified, and withdraw all false cases against them. Bastar can no longer be the fiefdom of megalomaniac police officers who threaten to stone human rights activists or run over them in SUVs. To be sure, prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations will be difficult with MLAs like Salwa Judum leader Vikram Mandavi of Bijapur, but not insurmountable.

The Jeeram Ghati incident in which much of the Congress leadership was killed, and in which some Congress quarters suspect BJP complicity, should indeed be investigated. But the government must move beyond justice for the Congress to justice for the people it represents. There is so much work to be done - and so many exciting new beginnings that are possible."

It has been on in the district for a month now owing to a strike called by lawyers who have been demanding a high court bench in western Odisha.

Two fire tenders and 15 fire department officials were pressed into service to douse the flames. Several important documents are said to have been destroyed in the fire.

Wednesday was the last day for filling up forms for matriculation examination through correspondence. Some of the office-bearers were inside the building, located near Jail Chowk in the city, along with some teachers of schools under the Sambalpur zone, who had come to BSE office with students' application forms.

Suryamani Majhi, deputy secretary of BSE Sambalpur zone said, ""At around 2 in the afternoon around eight to 10 people barged into the office and asked us why we have opened it. They shouted at us to leave the office. All the staff, including me, as well as the visiting teachers came out of the office. The men then ransacked the office and set it on fire. They also set fire to two bikes which were under the portico, and fled the spot.""

Since November 19 all central and state government offices have been shut in the district owing to the lawyers' strike.

Majhi said the BSE office too had been closed since November 19. ""But since the filling up of forms for the correspondence exam was required, we had gone to the office on Wednesday. We had informed the Sambalpur Bar Association that we would open the office to complete the form fill-up work. Moreover, I had discussed it with the district collector as well. But some unknown people came to the office and set it on fire,"" Majhi alleged. He said he had never seen the people who carried out this act.

The Sambalpur Bar Association was having its general body meeting when the incident took place. ""We saw smoke coming out of the BSE office building when we came out of the meeting,"" Pradeep Bohidar, chairman of the action committee of Sambalpur Bar Association, said.

He said the incident is no way related to the ongoing strike for a high court bench. ""We strongly condemn the incident. The matter should be investigated properly and strong action should be initiated against those who involved in setting the BSE office on fire."" When asked about the extent of the damage, Majhi said they are yet to enter the office. ""Several official papers, furniture, books as well as certificates were there inside the office,"" Majhi added. Sambalpur superintendent of police Sanjeev Arora, who visited the spot along with collector Samarth Verma, said they have registered the statement of officials."

A division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi clarified that the PILs would be heard only after they deposited the amount. The bench, however, didn't set any deadline for them to complete the formalities. The judges also refused to issue notices to respondents in the six PILs before the petitioners prove their bona fides.

Among them, four were filed by the same petitioner -- Yogeshkumar Prakash Nandeshwar -- through counsel Shankar Malpe. The others were by social workers Datta Rathod through counsel SS Dhengale, and Chandrabhan Kolte through Ashwin Ingole.

One of Nandeshwar's plea was against the state home department, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli collectors, and superintendent of police (SP) of Bhandara and Gadchiroli, and G-Life India Developers and Colonisers.

According to him, the company having its head office at Sewanagar in Gwalior opened its branches in 2012 in Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gadchiroli, and Yavatmal. It collected huge amounts from gullible investors through agents and issued them debenture certificates. The company also issued renewal subscription receipts in order to renew payments in 2014.

The company, however, failed to return the amount even after the maturity mentioned in the debenture certificates, thus cheating the investors. The investors went to various branches and found them closed. The local agents expressed inability to pay as they were out of reach.

Feeling aggrieved by the company's actions, investors approached Nandeshwar. After collecting information through his trust, the petitioner moved the complaint before the collector and SP, and also organized a demonstration with other social workers.

Rathod's plea was for protecting the forests, where he accused deputy conservator in Pusad circle, Arvind Mundhe, of misusing his rights and administrative powers by permitting excavation work by Reliance Jio Infocomm for laying optical fibre lines on forest land.

He also filed an online complaint and moved applications to the chief conservator of forest, who directed Munde to reply within a week. He also moved a representation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A criminal case was filed against Munde later.

Kolte's plea was against state school education and sports department which failed to take any action regarding alleged illegality committed by erring schools. According to him, the schools running Standard VIII and IX for last two academic sessions had no permission from the authority, thus causing loss to students. He even lodged an FIR in this regard against the schools alleging that precious taxpayers' money was being wasted.

"212","1022438424","2018-12-19","https://telanganatoday.com/ts-shows-bjp-its-place-in-polls","Telangana State shows BJP its place in polls","Telangana Today",FALSE,"Hyderabad: T Raja Singh, the rabble-rouser BJP legislator from Goshamahal Assembly constituency, will be the party's lone representative in the 2nd Telangana State Legislative Assembly.

The party, which had five members in the 119-member House in 2014, is down to one, after making a huge noise that it would play a key role in government formation in the State.

Leave alone playing the king-maker, BJP candidates couldn't hold on to their deposits in 105 of the 118 Assembly constituencies they contested! And in the 10 constituencies where the party was in the second position, except for Amberpet and Kalwakurthy seats where the margins of loss were in four figures, the BJP conceded huge margins ranging from 14,000 votes to 80,00 votes in the remaining eight constituencies.

Political analysts believe that even Raja Singh's win is not a positive vote for the BJP, but a combination of various factors including the legislator's penchant to court controversy, mostly on communal lines, which may have found favour from some quarter. So, what went wrong for the national party in Telangana State, which the BJP president Amit Shah had once proclaimed would be the gateway for the party's foray into south India? To start with, the saffron party couldn't find a peg to hang the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) on policy issues or lacunae in governance. Instead, its campaign was mostly limited to a malicious personal attack on Chief Minister

K Chandrashekhar Rao and his kin, painting them as a selfish dynastic family. There were not many buyers for this since each of the Kalvakuntla clan had established themselves and proved beyond any doubt about their capabilities in whatever role they were given.

The BJP leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and the horde of star campaigners repeatedly sought to tarnish the secular credentials of KCR, stating that his handshake with the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) was nothing but minority appeasement aimed at vote bank politics.

Seeking reservation for Muslims proportionate to their population, opening scores of residential schools for a better future or helping poor Muslim families perform the marriage of their daughters can hardly be dubbed as appeasement of minorities. In fact, the BJP leaders even went to the extent of labelling the MIM as the legacy of Razakars, and repeatedly harped on the need to officially mark September 17 as ""Hyderabad Liberation Day.""

The BJP's attempts at polarization through its divisive politics did not cut ice in Telangana as the people, irrespective of their religious sentiments, are by and large tolerant. That there have been no major communal riots in the State since its formation in 2014 speaks volumes of the secular fabric of the State.

Modi and Shah also resorted to spreading canards about the TRS moving towards the Congress, even terming the party as a 'B' team of the opposition. Of course, the Congress also labelled the TRS as the 'B' team of the saffron party and claimed that the ruling party would join the NDA bandwagon after elections. Both were proved wrong, as the TRS annihilated both the parties in the Assembly election. There were accusations that the ruling party had fielded weak candidates in some constituencies where the BJP was perceived to be strong when there was no such intention. Nothing can illustrate this better than Amberpet Assembly constituency where BJP floor leader in the last Assembly G Kishan Reddy was expected to romp home but ended up on the losing side.

KCR, who has made no bones about his quest for a non-BJP, non-Congress alternative at the Centre, proved through action and deed that he intends to carry out his mission. In fact, KCR was surgical in demolishing all the allegations and accusations levelled against him by the BJP leadership. Be it reservation for Muslims and STs, the imaginary Rs 2 lakh crore 'debt trap' the State had fallen into or Telangana not taking up the Centre's Ayusham Bharath scheme, the Chief Minister tore into them with precision and statistical data. The maverick Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath too tried to ruffle feathers when he said Hyderabad and Karimnagar will be renamed as Bhagyanagar and Karipuram. This triggered a torrent of outrage on social media platforms with people asking Yogi to confine himself to UP and not meddle in Telangana affairs.

In the end, it was clear that the BJP just could not connect with the people of Telangana, could not strike a chord with them on any issue and the results reflected it all. In the words of the party's chief spokesperson Krishna Saagar Rao, the poll debacle in Telangana was colossal, massive and historic."

The petitioner said that earlier there was a section under the Kerala Education Act by which the PSC had to select teachers for appointments in government and the aided schools.

However, the original section was suspended through an Ordinance in 1960.

The subsequent sections had empowered the managements to make appointments even while the government paid their emoluments.

As per the sections inserted later, now the government only have to approve the appointments already made by the respective managements.

The petitioners included a man too whose sister's daughter has been taken away, and wife sent to jail.

A total of 26 women were arrested in July this year on the charges of child trafficking, child rape and others, and 33 children in their care were sent to the State-run shelter home in Nalgonda and Prajwala home for the trafficking survivors in Amangal.

In a lengthy petition submitted to the High Court, the petitioners, all from 'Dommera' nomadic caste and represented by Kamsani Rajeswari, explained the circumstances in which they resorted to sex work, and how they came to be the custodians of the said children.

Traditionally performing rope tricks, the Dommera women have been sexually exploited by the upper caste and wealthy men in the temple town, which has led to sex work becoming their mainstay for generations, the petition said. Subsequently, they became the target of exploitation by pilgrims to the temple town, and others.

During the last 20 years, many women and men have fallen victim to HIV/AIDS, leaving many orphaned children in the custody of relatives and occasionally, in custody of any concerned friend/stranger. Flesh trade has come down owing to HIV scare and the women have made transition to other occupations, yet are being subject to the social stigma associated with the caste, the petition said.

During the police swoop down in July this year, the petitioners said they pleaded with the police trying to explain, but all in vain. They were made to sign the confession statements and the children, all of whom were at schools, were shifted to shelters. Their houses were seized sending their families helter skelter.

Four months later, the women obtained bail and sought to visit the children at Shishu Vihar of Nalgonda, and Prajwala shelter home at Amangal.

While the visits were allowed at the former, the petitioners alleged, they had not been allowed at Prajwala home.

Detailing case by case about how the children came to be in their custody, the petitioners said even where biological motherhood was proven, the police refused to hand over the child, asking the mother to seek permission from court. Even birth certificates, wherever produced, were torn by the police, they alleged. According to the petition, in most cases where the child in question was not the custodian's own, she belonged to a relative who died of or suffered from HIV/AIDS. In some cases, the children were reportedly handed over to them by other sex workers also suffering from the disease.

The petitioners also sought to implead them in the ongoing case. Photographs and Aadhar details of the children were appended to the petition."

The helping hands and hearts of thousands of local H&R Block volunteers served nearly 300 cities, from New York City to Los Angeles and everywhere in between.

In Kansas City, Missouri where H&R Block is headquartered, associates from 16 area offices took a group of over two dozen children from Banneker Elementary School, which serves a large concentration of low-income students, shopping for school supplies and holiday gifts. Each child shopped for several needed and wanted items. They also went out for lunch at Chick-fil-A.

""At Banneker Elementary and Kansas City Public Schools, we are focused on meeting the needs of every student, every day. We are extremely grateful to the entire team at H&R Block for having given us this amazing opportunity to provide these students with a great holiday experience that they might not have enjoyed otherwise,"" said Harrison Neal, principal of Banneker Elementary School. ""This is an excellent example of the kind of community and business partnerships we are developing as a school and school system in order to offer wrap-around support services for our students and their families.""

At the same time, another group of associates from nearby H&R Block offices in Kansas City, Missouri were helping Cameron Veterans Home Assistance League, NourishKC and Newhouse Shelter by signing and delivering holiday cards to veterans, preparing and serving meals to the homeless and wrapping Christmas presents for children.

In Janesville, Wisconsin, located approximately 40 miles from Madison, H&R Block associates had learned the Salvation Army of Dane County and the Salvation Army of Rockford & Winnebago County had a shortfall of bell ringers for their Christmas Kettle Program and stepped in to help. Associates from 15 area offices volunteered at 12 different locations around town greeting potential donors with a warm smile.

""The value of volunteers is more than a number. We truly appreciate each volunteer for the time and expertise they provided when it comes to volunteering and we are humbled that H&R Block chose us to help,"" said Major Mark Martsolf, volunteer coordinator at the Salvation Army of Rockford & Winnebago County.

In Manhattan, New York, associates from 22 area H&R Block offices volunteered to staff seven thrift stores benefiting Housing Works, a nonprofit organization whose mission is tackling the dual crisis of AIDS and homelessness. H&R Block volunteers donned their best Housing Works aprons and greeted shoppers, organized racks and tidied up the store.

""Housing Works volunteers play a vital role in our thrift shops, bookstore cafe, health centers and fundraising events. Each volunteer brings their own unique set of skills which helps us keep our stores stocked, our customers happy, and our shops looking beautiful. Together with our community of volunteers we're able to fuel our mission to end the dual crises AIDS and homelessness,"" said Willa Tsokanis, volunteer program coordinator, Housing Works.

In Worcester, Massachusetts, located about 40 miles from Boston, H&R Block associates from 23 area offices held a toy drive benefiting the Boys & Girls Club of Worcester. Just last month, those same associates pitched in to host one of three Child Safety Fairs in and around the greater Boston area at several Boys & Girls Clubs to educate children and families about fire safety, bike safety, water safety, poison control and much more.

""Our professional staff and our club kids benefited by having volunteers in our community help. Without their involvement, we would serve less kids,"" said Ellin Terrill, director of marketing and special events at the Boys & Girls Club of Worcester. ""Volunteerism sends a message to our kids that they are valuable and that people in the community care about them and want them to be successful."".

Meanwhile, in Sarasota, Florida, H&R Block associates from 15 area offices partnered to help the Suncoast Blood Bank (SCBB) by volunteering at 10 different blood drives around town. Not only did they donate blood themselves, but they also helped check in patients, served drinks and snacks and waved street signs to draw attention to the blood drives and recruit potential donors. This is not the first time H&R Block associates from Sarasota have helped the Suncoast Blood Bank. For the past two years, they have provided the Suncoast Blood Bank with a total of $9,640 in contributions as part of their Nonprofit Referral Program.

""As the community's only local nonprofit blood provider, we strive to keep the cost of maintaining a safe and reliable source of blood products as low as possible and we can only do that with the support of volunteers,"" said Jayne Giroux, director of community development at Suncoast Blood Bank. ""Our partnership with H&R Block has brought a totally new demographic to our blood bank. We have been able to meet and educate individuals about the importance of blood donation that we have never been able to reach."".

Not to be outdone, in New Bern, North Carolina, which recently experienced devastating effects from Hurricane Florence this past September, associates from three area H&R Block offices volunteered at the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina to help pack, sort and organize the donation warehouse. Prior to that, over two dozen H&R Block offices throughout North Carolina participated in a Thanksgiving food drive benefiting victims of Hurricane Florence by donating 450 pounds of nonperishable goods and raising over $3,500 toward the same organization.

""Hurricane Florence had a devastating effect on central and eastern North Carolina. The Food Bank will be there for the long rebuilding process thanks to the impact made by organizations like H&R Block,"" said Elizabeth Moss, food and fund drive coordinator for the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina. ""Community support through virtual food drives, physical food drives, and volunteering enables us to ensure our mission that no one goes hungry in central and eastern North Carolina, and we are so grateful.""

In Thomasville, Georgia, located approximately 30 miles from Tallahassee, Florida, associates from a local H&R Block office volunteered to clean, paint and do lawn work at Hands and Hearts for Horses, an organization that provides animal therapy to special needs children and adults.

""H&R Block's contribution was extremely important to Hands and Hearts for Horses. We are a small staffed non-profit and rely heavily on volunteers to assist with day to day activities as well as maintaining the property,"" said Susie Shin, director at Hands and Hearts for Horses. ""We serve almost 90 riders with special needs and disabilities per week and oftentimes property clean-up and minor repairs get put on the back burner. H&R Block's contribution helped us make minor property improvements and ensure that our facility is operating at the optimal safety and cleanliness level."".

Meanwhile, in Southaven, Mississippi, located about 14 miles from Memphis, Tennessee, H&R Block associates from eight area offices helped St. Jude Children's Research Hospital by assembling Craft Packages for the organization's Happy Carts program, which goes to inpatient rooms several nights a week to offer patients and families a welcome distraction. Just a few months ago, this same group of H&R Block associates walked and ran a 5K race with other associates from around the country, to raise more than $55,000 to help St. Jude Children's Research Hospital end childhood cancer.

""While tremendous strides have been made in research and treatments thanks in large part to St. Jude, we must act with urgency to help end pediatric cancer, which affects nearly 300,000 children worldwide each year and remains the leading cause of death by disease in U.S. kids today,"" said Richard Shadyac Jr., President and CEO of ALSAC, the fundraising and awareness organization for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. ""We are thankful for all of our partners and the multitude of supporters who are making a difference by raising awareness and support for our lifesaving mission: Finding cures. Saving children.""

Additionally, in Agoura Hills, California, located approximately 35 miles from Los Angeles, they recently experienced disaster due to the Woolsey Fire that scorched 96,949 acres of land. H&R Block associates from 54 area offices helped Las Virgenes Fire Relief by volunteering to sort, pack and organize supplies and food donations while others rolled up their sleeves to help with the cleanup and rebuilding process.

""We've had to assemble and move quickly after the Woolsey Fire tore through our community. There were so many people to help and they needed help now. There is power in numbers and the more people who volunteer, the quicker and better we can help our neighbors in need,"" said Kim Prince, director of communications at the Las Virgenes Fire Relief. ""Because of H&R's commitment to service, we knew we could rely on those volunteers to take a task and run with it.""

Even more heartwarming was the effort by local H&R Block associates at two area offices in Albany, Oregon, located about 70 miles from Portland, held a pajama drive to help CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates for Children) of Linn County which supports and advocates for children in foster care.

""As a small non-profit, we rely on traditional community volunteers who give their time and talents to one of our many community projects or fundraisers,"" said Julie Gilman, executive director of CASA. ""Without help from businesses like H&R Block, and the wonderful people working there, we simply couldn't provide as many abused and neglected children in our foster care system with a crucial one-on-one advocate.""

Last but least, in Leander, Texas, located approximately 26 miles from Austin, H&R Block associates from two area offices got into the holiday spirit and partnered with the Leander Police Department Blue Santa Program to help deliver bikes and other holiday gifts to underprivileged children in the community.

""The Leander Blue Santa really depends upon the support we receive from community businesses and organizations such as H&R Block to be able to provide a great Christmas for needy families in the community. Without their support, we would not be able to meet the need for gifts and bikes that we hand out each year,"" said Sgt. Helen Garrett, community services sergeant at the Leander Police Department.

H&R Block has always strived to provide help and hope for its clients, associates and the community. It's a mission that has rung true to the brand since the very beginning when brothers Henry and Richard Bloch founded the company in 1955. Whether it's helping victims of natural disasters rebuild or hosting child safety fairs or providing meals to the homeless, H&R Block associates have always had a passion for giving back and helping the communities where they live and work.

The idea for H&R Block's One Team Day of Giving came from two separate days of giving. This past September in Phoenix, Arizona during H&R Block's annual retail meeting, nearly 500 H&R Block associates worked in 108-degree weather for hours nailing, digging, cleaning and painting; all to improve the learning experience for kids at a local inner-city school. Then, this past October in Nashville, Tennessee during H&R Block's annual franchise convention, more than 2,000 franchisees volunteered to give back to the community by packing meals, gathering gloves and hand warmers for veterans and made a tremendous impact in a very short period of time to a number of organizations.

""That got us excited, so we asked ourselves what could we do that's even bigger than that? And that's when we decided on One Team Day of Giving,"" said Karen Orosco, senior vice president of U.S. retail at H&R Block. ""This day is just one more example of how our franchisees and corporate associates care about the people and communities where we all live and work."""

Pronouncing its verdict, the court held that absence of a Delhi address proof is not a valid ground to deny admission to children into the city's schools.

Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, a government school in Anand Vihar in Delhi had reportedly denied admission to kids who could not produce their permanent residence proof of the national capital.

However, Justice C Hari Sankar on Tuesday (18 December) has directed the school to grant admission to the three children who live in Ghaziabad.

The father of the three children had approached the High Court pleading that the school denied admission to his kids on the ground that they did not have a residence proof of Delhi.

The petition further stated that refusal of admissions is ""arbitrary, discriminatory, illegal, unconstitutional, and violative of fundamental rights"".

""The Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya is at a distance of 2-3 km from their residence and there is no justification not to grant admission to wards of my client merely on the ground that they are not residents of Delhi In case they were not allowed to attend classes in any other government school nearby in the academic year 2018-19, their studies would suffer badly,"" the petition said."

Now CM Kumaraswamy wants the people to help resolve the matter.

Bengaluru: The Karnataka government has been at loggerheads with NGO Akshaya Patra over the question of serving onion and garlic in mid-day meals, and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy is now ready to take the vexed issue to the people's court.

Speaking to ThePrint, Kumaraswamy said he was ready to open the issue for public debate, and let the people decide whether or not they want the ISKCON-run NGO's onion-and-garlic-free food served to their children.

The Akshaya Patra Foundation, a non-profit organisation, is a midday meal partner of the Karnataka government in five districts -- Bengaluru, Mysuru, Ballari, Hubli and Mangaluru.

The Karnataka State Food Commission conducted a survey of government schools, and found that onion and garlic were absent from the meals served at schools where Akshaya Patra was the providing agency. The panel urged for them to be included to make meals tastier and more nutritious.

Akshaya Patra refused, owing to its belief in the Ayurvedic principle of providing 'sattvic' food -- cooked with organic, vegetarian ingredients. Onion and garlic are considered 'tamasic', that is, items that can trigger lethargy and negative emotions.

Naveena Neerada Dasa, ISKCON's head of strategic communication and projects, told ThePrint that it is Akshaya Patra's ""endeavour to promote good health and nutrition"", and that it ""will continue to follow the prescribed norms set by both the state and central government"".

The state government, meanwhile, began facing pressure from civil rights organisations like the Delhi-based Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and the Right to Food Campaign to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra. They insist that Akshaya Patra has no right to decide what food has to be served, and cannot impose ""religious diktats"" on a scheme that embodies one's right to food.

The organisations have also spoken about the question of nutrition, though dieticians say onion and garlic only enhance taste -- their nutritional value can easily be replaced by nuts or fibres of different kinds.

Also read: Karnataka civil society groups want govt to dump ISKCON NGO over onion-garlic row

The Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, which oversees the midday meal scheme, does not specify what items are to be provided to children, be it eggs or onion or garlic.

The ministry's guidelines merely state that a primary school child be served food which has a nutritional value of 450 calories -- 12 grams of protein, 100 grams of food grains, 20 grams of pulses, 50 grams of vegetables, 5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

For upper primary schoolchildren, the intake is supposed to be 700 calories -- 20 grams of protein, 150 grams of food grains, 30 grams of pulses, 75 grams of vegetables , 7.5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

The Karnataka government has been reluctant to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra, since the midday meal scheme has helped increase the number of admissions in government schools.

It seems to have decided that the only way this matter can be resolved is if it is opened to public debate, rather than be coerced to take a decision based on the observations of civil rights organisations.

Kumaraswamy has now decided to seek the opinion of various stakeholders, including school teachers, headmasters, food scientists and dieticians, on whether there is an absolute need to add onion and garlic in the food that is being served.

""The question we are raising is whether it would cause any major deficiencies to children if (onion and garlic) are not added to their midday meals. We will be able to take an informed stand only after we receive adequate information on it,"" said Kumaraswamy.

""We will ask food experts, doctors and nutritionists on these aspects, and then take a decision. Let's not rush into any decision.""

While this controversy rages, officials at the Department of Primary and Secondary Education have come up with a new idea to bypass the onion-garlic question and yet enhance children's diet.

Preliminary discussions are on to add fruits to the menu, so that children can have a well-rounded meal.

Sources in the department also said the Mysuru-based Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) has been asked to analyse the nutritional value of onion and garlic, and find if there are alternative fruits or vegetables that can provide the same nutrition."

Just days ago, you said you would choose a new Parliament and prime minister but not work with Wickremesinghe. You sacked him but he was sworn in as PM again this week by none other than you. Was your chat with him before his swearing-in a reconciliation?

Yes, I did say that I will not reappoint Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister even if he receives the consent of 225 parliamentarians. That is my personal political view and I still maintain that view as a person. But, I respect the parliamentary tradition and decided that the post of prime minister should be given to Mr Wickremesinghe. I see this as a characteristic of a democratic society as well as of a society that values democratic practices.

In October, you swore in former president and erstwhile rival Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister in Wickremesinghe's place. The latter refused to step down and a court decision broke the deadlock. Rajapaksa resigned. Will your relationship with Rajapaksa go back to rivalry? He is a strong contender for the next elections in 2019-2020.

We will continue to work as partners of a democratic, socialist political force. We plan to form a broad alliance and parties will join that front.

In the past turbulent weeks, you accused Wickremesinghe's United National Party of ""buying"" MPs to ensure Rajapaksa loses the two votes of no-confidence. Since the world community watches Sri Lanka closely, how do you explain such a trend to other countries? How is it legally possible to allow such votes allegedly bought with money?

I will continue my crusade against such corrupt practices. My desire is to establish a new political culture where corruption, bribery, political intimidation and violence and such evil practices are either eliminated or at least minimised.

Tourist arrivals are down, people fear instability. Are you certain your partnership with Wickremesinghe will last its full course till the election?

I cannot describe it as a partnership. I, as executive President, will exercise my powers in the interest of the people and the country and I will continue to do so during the entire tenure of my presidency. However, I must clarify few issues. There is no instability. Although there were few cancellations, there is no major drop in tourist arrivals. In fact there was a 16% increase in tourist arrivals in November. I am confident that the growth will continue.

You have come under considerable criticism for the turbulence of the past months. You've been accused of a ""soft coup"". How can you explain all these recent moves?

I have a clear conscience. All my decisions were in the best interest of the country and the people. All what I did was done with utmost good faith. I didn't do any of those acts with malice or with an intention of violating the constitution. The country was in huge political turmoil. The best solution to solve the problem was to go for an election. Hence, I consulted constitution experts and issued the dissolution notification.

What role do you hope the Tamil National Alliance will play in the 're-born' Parliament convened on Monday? The TNA supported Wickremesinghe through this crisis. Will not the pressure from the TNA on the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe coalition to fulfil long-standing demands, including greater autonomy for Tamil-majority areas, intensify now?

We always worked to strengthen reconciliation. My government has taken a number of measures to remove grievances and hardships of the people in the north and east. We have implemented projects to improve infrastructure facilities, roads, schools, hospitals etc. More than 90% of the land acquired by the military during the conflict has been given back to original owners. Before the end of this month, another 2,500 acres of land will be released. Our aim is to ensure that all the regions in the country are developed without neglecting any part. We urge the Tamil and Muslim political parties also to extend fullest cooperation to these Development efforts in the north and east."

Some private schools in Delhi have come up with new criteria for nursery admissions, where-in they give points to children whose parents are are vegetarian, non-alcoholic, freelancers, have done original research among others, reports The New Indian Express.

According to the report, the criteria set up by these schools are in clear violation of the Delhi government's guidelines of nursery admissions. Apart from mandatory reservation of 25 per cent of seats for students of economically weaker sections (EWS) and disadvantaged groups, private schools can admit other students according to a set of criteria.

To discourage schools from selecting any arbitrary criteria, Delhi's Directorate of Education (DoE) had last month issued a list of 50 disallowed points including vegetarianism, social/noble cause, first-come-first-get, non-alcoholic, non-smoker parent and declaration of parents' education among others. The DoE reasoned them as ""unfair, unreasonable and non-transparent"".

However various schools are allocating points on the disallowed parameters, thereby flouting DoE's guidelines. Sumit Vohra, founder of an online forum for parent community told that a high court order bans schools from even screening parents occupation, PAN, income and other details.

One news report suggests Anuskha Sharma and Sonam Kapoor's bridal lehenga's were the market callings last year. In Delhi's Gaffar Market and Linking Road, Mumbai these designs varied the range of Rs,12,000 to 1 lakh. Delhi are not two exceptions but a stroll in Brigade Road, Bangalore and Vardaman Market in Kolkata presents us the same picture. The most coveted brands such as 'Moncler', 'Gucci' , 'Armani' 'Louis Vuitton', 'Versace', 'Hermes' 'Heron Preston', 'Kenzo' and many more might be a big deal for some but the street markets across the country are thriving on first and second copies of these names. The penetration of internet has made accessible the ""duplicate goods"" to consumers from every section of the society. These practices certainly questions the Indian IP enforcement mechanisms but also casts doubt over the competency of present IP laws in fashion industry as a whole. The practices of design piracy and knock off is not merely middle class chase for luxury lifestyle but the practice is prevalent among the designers themselves and thus discourages the fashion industry for 'original works'.

@dietsabya, an Instagram handle inspired by New York based @diet_prada, social media fashion watchdog has been incessantly working to make the public aware about the blatant plagiarism by the designers themselves, sometime from young college students and sometimes foreign designers. As per Diet investigations renowned fashion designer Anita Dhongre copied designs from the students of JD institute.

Indian IP laws, specifically The Copyright Act,1957 and The Designs Act, 2000 gives two kinds of protection in the designer clothes . First is the protection for the drawings on any garment that may not necessarily include the shape/design of the garment itself . @dietsabya highlights this kind of copying by famous designer Nashish Soni onto Alexader Wangny's slogan. The second category includes the design/shape of the garment itself, attributing to its unique fabric and tailoring. Designers are aggressively pushing to protect their design rights of this category. Rohit Bal in 2017 became the first designer in India to get copyright over his entire collection and the spree was followed by number of other designers thereafter.

Kal Raustiala and Christopher Jon Springman in her paper ""The Piracy Paradox : Innovation and Intellectual Property in Fashion Design "" describes this problem as ""Copying enables designs and styles to move quickly from early adopters to the masses. And since no one cool wants to keep wearing something after everybody else is wearing it, the copying of designs helps fuel the incessant demand for something new.""

""Jeans represent democracy in fashion"" - Giorgio Armani

India is world's largest and noisiest democracy. Indian textiles and apparels have always been one of the most sought after globally. Currently, the Indian textile industry is pegged at around US$ 120 billion, and is expected to reach US$ 230 billion by 2020. It contributes approximately 2 percent to the country's GDP and 14 per cent to overall Index of Industrial Production (IIP). The industry has also attracted FDI worth US$ 2.55 billion during April 2000 to June 2017. Just like Indian democracy the fashion industry in India is too diverse. Some have classified the sector as per their purchasing power and social reach namely- ""Premier fashion""; ""luxury segment""; ""Affordable luxury"" and ""Mains stream brands"".

It is thus more relevant today that such a huge sector is not trapped in complex web of laws functioning across domains . Currently it is majorly regulated by Intellectual Property laws - Copyright Act 1957, The Trademarks Act, 1999, Designs Act 2000, and Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999, however none of the them is sufficient to deal with the sector in entirety.

Before the next collection for designers is launched, one question that disturbs the designers the most is how to prevent others from copying their original work which has been produced after rigorous intellectual labour. Whether to seek copyright protection of their original work or get the design registered to ensure its full scale commercial exploitation. This designer's dilemma came to the courtroom in Ritika Private Limited v. Biba Apparels Private Limited. In this case, the plaintiff, a boutique apparel designer brand, brought a suit against the defendants who have been a leading name in ethnic wear, for an injunction to prevent reproduction,printing, publishing, selling or offering the prints or garments for which the plaintiff claimed to be the first owner. The legal issue raised in this case was that once the copyrighted works of the plaintiff are applied for the making of any dress, and production of that dress exceeds 50 in number, whether the plaintiff losses ownership of her copyright works . The court made a distinction between designs eligible for copyright protection under the Copyright Act, 1957 and the Designs Act,2000. It held that copyright protects the original expression of the ""artistic work"" and offers limited protection to the commercial exploitation of the same, whereas the Designs Act is the chief tool to protect industrial application of the design, however the design need not to be always original. The court decided the dispute in favour of the defendants and the suit thus dismissed,relying on the bar under Section 15(2) of the Copyright Act, 1957. It was also held that had the facts been different from the 'application of the designs' to 'direct lifting of the design' the answer would have also differed. Here the 'direct lifting' would mean copy pasting the copyright work from its original form. Ultimately the web of IP laws proved to be counterproductive for Ritika Private Limited.

The need is being recognised globally to sync the laws relating to fashion industry and develop exclusive programs to make fashion lawyers more aware about their duties and responsibilities and bring consumer sensitization about their choices . The infamous Rana Plaza incident which killed over 1,100 garment workers in Bangladesh highlights the poor labour enforcement by the global fashion leaders such as ZARA and H&M. Thus there is a need for everyone to be aware about legal issues facing the fashion industry ranging from merchandising, distribution and franchising agreements to intellectual property and labour laws.

Multiple law schools have designed their curriculum focusing to cater the needs of fashion industry these include Fordham Law School, world's first Fashion Law Institute working with the support of the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Diane von Furstenberg offering JDand LL.M programs to the students. The course includes specialty in Fashion Law and Finance and Fashion Ethics, Sustainability and Development. In India such focused opportunities are quite limited. No full time graduation program is available but IIFD, Chandigarh offers limited opportunities on Fashion Retail Law in India and Diploma in Fashion & Law. Some short term courses are also available to students by leaders in global fashion industry these include coveted program by Milano Fashion institute offering exposure to brand protection ; fashion negotiations and specific agreements for the industry ;supply chain issues ; issues related to counterfeiting & fashion forgery.

One thing is clear the ad-hoc approach would serve no purpose and comprehensive and focused approach needs to be followed that cater all the interest of fashion industry in the country.

While as per official data only 100 of the 388 odd posts are said to be filled, the letter sent to a set of candidates on December 5 said all vacancies were filled.

This created confusion among thousands of aspirants who sat for the test in 2017. General candidates who scored 75 or above of a total 150 (50%) in the test were eligible for recruitment with a 40% to 45% cutoff for reserved community candidates. Accordingly, 92 candidates, who scored above the cutoff scores, were shortlisted and appointed chemistry teachers after verification of certificates.

Following this, six candidates approached the Madurai bench of the Madras high court stating that some answers in the key released by the TRB were incorrect.

The court later directed the TRB to include the six candidates to the selection process but clarified that its direction could not be treated as precedent to other candidates. But aspirants have continued to approach the court challenging the answer key released earlier.

One such candidate, M Lakshmi of Tiruvannamalai, who fell short of the cutoff score by one mark, approached the court in July. The court dismissed her plea, saying the TRB was at liberty to consider her representation if she was denied marks despite giving the right answer and provided there were vacancies.

Referring to both directions, the TRB sent a letter to Lakshmi in December stating that they finalised the selection for 2016-17 and all vacancies were filled. ""Only 100 odd seats were filled. There was no clarity on how TRB filled the remaining seats,"" said Prabu, Lakshmi's husband who had gone to inquire with the TRB.

On the other hand, candidates who could not meet the cutoff score despite being awarded marks after approaching the court received a letter from the TRB about being excluded in the selection procedure as they did not meet the cutoff. There was no mention about vacancies being filled in these letters.

When questioned about the discrepancy, S Jayanthi, chairperson, TRB, said, ""This (vacancies filled) was a typographical error by the clerical staff. The vacancies continue to exist and backlogs will be cleared after a fresh notification is issued."""

Amid the ongoing commotion in the Lok Sabha over several issues, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on Tuesday said she often receives messages that schools function better than parliament and wondered whether these disruptions go on to indicate that the behaviour of the members are worse than school kids.

As the House re-convened at noon for the second time, members of the AIADMK, the TDP and the Congress started protesting again.

The Congress, demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), continued sloganeering on the Rafale issue. The BJP members demanded an apology from Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

The TDP members were demanding special status for Andhra Pradesh while the AIADMK MPs were protesting against a dam on the Cauvery river.

Amid all this, the National Institute of Design (Amendment) Bill, 2018 was introduced in the House.

Upset with the disruption of proceedings, Ms Mahajan said the members were well aware that this was an important session as elections will follow.

She said the government was ready for discussion, but the ruckus continued.

""I receive messages several times saying, madam our schools run better. Please understand, what message are we trying to give: that are we worse than school kids,"" she said addressing the members.

Ms Mahajan said people from other countries were questioning as to ""what was happening in our country"".

She said she will talk to the government to ensure that issues demanded by the opposition are discussed.

""But please, I request you with hands folded. Please maintain a standard in the House. I am sorry, but I am saying this openly. Many a time, people from other countries say, what is happening in India,"" she said.

Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said his party was ready for discussion, but demanded formation of a JPC to probe the Rafale deal so that every file related to the matter can be scrutinised.

To this, Ms Mahajan said that constitution of JPC was not under her purview.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the Supreme Court verdict has made things clear, indicating that there was no need for a JPC on the controversial issue.

Unhappy with the response, Congress members again started raising slogans, following which the House was adjourned for the day.

The lower house has been witnessing daily disruptions since the winter session began last week. It had passed a bill on transgender rights on Monday."

It also asked them to keep the river free of pollution. The judgment has placed a lot of responsibility on the general public to ensure that the river is free of pollution, in addition to holding that it is their Fundamental Right to live in a pollution-free environment.

A division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice A K Menon said, ""River Godavari is the second longest river in India after river Ganges. It is popularly known as 'Dakshin Ganga' (Ganges of the south). Godavari is one of the main sources of water for Nashik. One of the reasons for the river's pollution is the failure of a large number of citizens to perform their fundamental duties under clause (g) of Article 51A. Citizens must fulfil their duties of protecting and improving the environment.""

The authorities have been asked to prepare and implement a comprehensive awareness programme for citizens to perform their fundamental duties. The Nashik Municipal Corporation has been told to take help from NGOs, as well as schools and colleges, for implementing such awareness programmes. The assistance of law colleges and the District Legal Services Authority should be sought to organise seminars or street shows. The bench further suggested that display boards should be put up at strategic locations calling upon the public to not throw garbage into the river.

Relying on the doctrine of public trust, the court held that the state and its agencies, have a duty to protect natural resources such as water bodies, rivers, seashores, for the enjoyment of the general public. Thus, it let the State-appointed committee, under the chairmanship of the divisional commissioner, to monitor the steps taken to reduce river pollution. The police has been asked to continue with its Godavari Protection Police Squad to keep a check on offenders polluting the river.

During festivals like Ganeshotsav, Navaratri and Kumbh Mela, the authorities have been asked to ensure that the river does not get polluted. The court passed the order while hearing a petition filed by one Rajesh Pandit.

The court also directed the setting up of a grievance redressal mechanism for citizens to complain online about alleged violations. Even annoynomus complaints will be entertained and a separate website will be started by the committee to receive the same. The court has also asked the state to consider having a river regulation policy within four months."

Some prominent schools are also giving points to those opting for pick and drop service.

Apart from the mandatory 25 per cent of the total seats reserved for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS)/disadvantaged groups, private schools can select a set of criteria against which they allot specific points to each applicant for admission into nursery or entry level classes.

To ensure that schools don't adopt any arbitrary criteria, the Directorate of Education had last month issued a list of 50 disallowed criteria, including vegetarianism, social/noble cause, parents' education, declaration regarding picking or drop, first-come-first-get, non-alcoholic, non-smoker parent criteria. The DoE said these criteria were ""unfair, unreasonable and non-transparent"".

But several schools are openly allotting points on such criteria, flouting the guidelines. Mahavir Senior Model School for instance, is giving five points each to children of parents who are non-smokers, vegetarian and teetotalers. Darshan Academy in north Delhi has reserved 15 points to ""freelancers or original research/recognition received in the area or contribution, physical or professional work, (both pro-bono) through a registered NGO or freelancers.""

Some popular schools such as Tagore International School, East of Kailash and Vasant Vihar, Apeejay School in Saket and Pitampura, and Bloom Public School have separate points for areas covered by school transport. In its guidelines, the DoE had pointed out that declaration regarding picking or drop is ""illogical"" and it is the choice of the parents to opt for school transport or not. A senior DoE official said the criteria would be reviewed soon and action would be taken against schools flouting the norms.

""Schools are asking parents' designation, organisation name, PAN card details, annual income, etc... As per a high court order, such screening is banned even if points are not being given for these,"" said Sumit Vohra, founder of admissionsnursery.com, an online forum for parent community.

CIDCO has extended the date for Project Affected People (PAP) of Navi Mumbai International Airport to vacate their homes to January 15. CIDCO has said that this will be the last extension given by them. The earlier deadline was November 30.

Till now, 1,700 houses have been vacated out of the 2,786 in the 10 villages meant to be rehabilitated, with approximately 3,500 households located at Chinchpada, Kopar, Kolhi, Ulwe, Upper Owale, Waghivalivada, Vaghivali, Ganeshpuri, Targhar and Kombadbhuje. The Rehabilitation and Resettlement scheme includes the allotment of a developed plot of size equal to triple the roof area with 1.5 FSI. Construction aid cost of ₹1,000 per sq. feet decided by the government will be provided, along with an extra ₹500 per sq. feet provided by CIDCO for those who will be constructing their own homes. Besides, CIDCO will also provide 18 months' rental money. A total of seven pockets are made for rehabilitation and resettlement, among which one, two and three are situated at Vadghar, four, five and six at Vahal and seventh at sector 26, Ulwe.

Meanwhile, PAPs are adamant on getting their demands fulfilled before vacating their homes. ""We want a cremation ground in the place of relocation. The current cremation ground is located at a distance of 4 km. We can't walk any further while carrying the dead. Currently we have a 7 acre pond in our village and none near the new place. Where will we immerse Ganapati idols? The issue of schools is also still unsolved,"" Prashant Bhoir, president of the committee of the four villages -- Ulwe, Kombadbhuje, Targhar and Ganeshpuri, said.

An officer from the rehabilitation department has said that each pocket has six pyres with a burial ground beside it. ""We are moving PAPs to sectors and not villages. The relocated places won't look like villages. Pocket one and two, which has four sectors, has one pond and another pond at Ulwe. We will beautify the existing ponds. We are building a smart city, where people will gradually stop walking to crematoriums. We have asked them to find a suitable place to allocate an extra cremation ground on the condition that the locals should not have an objection,"" he said.

Mr. Bhoir has also claimed that some of the plots to which CIDCO is planning to relocate them are under litigation. However, the officer from CIDCO said, ""Around 12 plots out of 15,975 were under litigation. They had a stay order from the High Court and hence we have changed the plots now and it has been conveyed and showed to them. Now there are no plots under litigation."""

The Ministry of Women and Child Development has placed the draft policy on its website and invited comments from stakeholders until January 4. This will be the first policy dedicated to the protection of children, an area that until now was only a part of the broader National Child Policy, 2013.

The Supreme Court had earlier directed the CBI to investigate allegations involving 17 shelter homes for children, destitute women, beggars and senior citizens in Bihar following the case of sexual abuse of more than 30 girls in a shelter home in Muzaffarpur in the State. The apex court had also asked the Centre to consider framing a national policy on protection of children.

As per the draft, the policy will apply to ""all institutions, and organisations (including corporate and media houses), government or private sector"".

The draft policy recommends that all organisations must have a code of conduct based on ""zero tolerance of child abuse and exploitation"". It requires organisations to lay down that employees don't use language or behaviour that is ""inappropriate, harassing, abusive, sexually provocative, demeaning or culturally inappropriate"".

Institutions should also designate a staff member to ensure that procedures are in place to ensure the protection of children as well as to report any abuse. Any individual who suspects physical, sexual or emotional abuse must report it to the helpline number 1098, police or a child welfare committee.

Unlike the National Child Policy, 2013, the latest document doesn't talk about children who may need additional special protection measures: including those affected by migration, communal or sectarian violence, children forced into begging or in conflict with the law, and those infected with HIV/AIDS. It also doesn't talk about the role of the state for ensuring the protection of child rights or addressing local grievances.

""We welcome the decision to bring a national policy, but its subsequent versions will need to go into a greater detail,"" said Priti Mahara, Director (Policy, Advocacy and Research) CRY. ""The document needs to define what child protection is as well as what it means by institutions or organisations.""

Ms. Mahara added that the norms should be designed in such a way that organisations can customise their policies according to the nature of their work, thereby, giving them a sense of ownership on safeguarding children's rights.

""A policy has four aspects -- creating awareness, prevention, reporting and responding,"" said Prabhat Kumar, Technical Advisor, Child Protection, Save The Children. ""This document needs to go into all these aspects, especially a reporting structure involving various nodal bodies and a monitoring mechanism for implementation of the guidelines. Moreover, while it talks about organisations laying down a code of conduct, it doesn't explain what is acceptable behaviour such as conduct of teachers in schools,"" he observed.

Mr. Kumar suggested that the government could use the opportunity to go beyond the role of institutions and look at the role of individuals. ""Perhaps the government could look at ensuring that all officials in public service give an undertaking that they will not exploit children,"" Mr. Kumar said."

Exposing Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's seriousness on combating terrorism, his junior interior minister has vowed to ""protect"" Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed and his party in a leaked video.

The leaked video showed Minister of State for Interior Shehryar Afridi talking to the Milli Muslim League (MML) leaders and when his attention was drawn towards non-registration of Saeed's party by the Election Commission (ECP) as a political party due to US pressure, the minister said: ""We will not let this happen.""

Pakistan's Election Commission is planning to declare Milli Muslim League a terrorist organisation.

""As long as we (the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf) are in the government all those including Hafiz Saeed who are raising voice for Pakistan and righteousness, we are with them,"" Afridi said, adding ""this is our belief.""

""I request you to come to the National Assembly and see whether we are supporting those who on the right path or not,"" he told them.

Saeed was declared a global terrorist by the US and the UN after the 2008 Mumbai attack and was put under house arrest in November 2008 but freed by a court some months later. He carries a USD 10 million American bounty on his head for his role in terror activities.

India has been demanding Pakistan not only to arrest the LeT founder and try him in the Mumbai attack case but also punish all those involved in this carnage.

In the leaked video, an MML leader said the high court ordered the ECP to register the MML as a political party but the top election body said that it had come to know that the US had declared MML a terrorist organisation.

On this, the minister assured that ""this will not happen in the Imran Khan's government.""

Saeed launched the MML in August 2017 with a so-called mission to implement the ideology of Pakistan in accordance with the 1973 Constitution.

In April, the US placed the MML on its list of foreign terror organisations for its links with the Lashkar-e-Taiba.

The interior ministry had written to the ECP recommending not to register the MML as it is an off-shoot of Saeed's Jamat-ud Dawah, which has been declared as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US in June 2014.

The JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Taiba which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people.

The MML contested general elections on the platform of the ""dormant"" political entity Allaha-u-Akbar Tehreek (AAT), which was registered with the ECP.

The Supreme Court in September last permitted the JuD and its arm Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation (FIF) to continue their relief and charity work in the country.

JuD's network includes 300 seminaries and schools, hospitals, a publishing house and ambulance services. The JuD and FIF alone have about 50,000 volunteers and hundreds of other paid workers, according to two counter-terrorism officials.

Earlier, the government banned companies and individuals from making donations to the JuD, the FIF, and other organisations on the UN Security Council sanctions list.

We salute our men in uniform for their extreme sacrifice but do we ever think of the broken families they leave behind?

Mohini Giri does. Yes, the government and the Armed Forces are fully behind them but how much does the average Indian know about the difficulties they face when they are suddenly told that the husband they loved, the father of their children is no more. He died defending the country and there are thousands such in all the wars we have fought.

There was hushed silence in the auditorium when Rene Singh did a beautiful rendition of Mere Watan Ke Logo. I cried with the widows. The lady sitting next to me told me that she had grieved for her husband for 47 years! She was 23 with two young children when her husband was killed in 1971. I have tears in my eyes when I write this, as theirs is a lifetime of loneliness and courage, and yet they have resilience and they know they will find help, they will find affection and be embraced by Mohini and taught how to make a living and bring up their children with dignity.

I am proud that the Armed Forces never forgets its martyrs and their families. I am proud I was born and brought up with people who live and die for their country selflessly.

I am humbled that after my father died in 1975, Mohini was there for my mother and they would both went to villages to meet war widows and try and help them. I recall my mother coming back from one of these excursions and telling me: ""Ashi, at least I had 33 wonderful years with your father, but the widows I meet in the villages were left after a few years with small children. My heart bleeds for them.""

Mohini Giri is still there, a bedrock for generations of widows, and the Association she has managed for so many years has grown to have centres all over India that help widows to earn a living and care for them as a family.

After the moving rendition of Mere Watan Ke Logo there was a documentary film made by a brilliant producer, Meera Dewan -- Seeds of War to Flowers of Peace. I think this film should be shown in schools and colleges and should be on YouTube and widely disseminated. It captured, through short interviews, the lives of widows, their struggles and their dreams. It was poignant, moving and so very relevant. The most vivid scene in the film was when two teenagers were interviewed. They had lost their father and their widowed mother was to receive some money. Their father's brother wanted it all and murdered their mother. Young and practically on the road, they were given help to be educated by the Association.

I asked Meera later if the uncle had been put in prison and the money given to the daughters. She told me that, unfortunately, even though Mohini took it up with the court, the uncle was released on there is not enough evidence and the girls never got the money.

In the Keynote address, Maroof Raza spoke about how our armed forces had performed even beyond the call of duty in every theatre of combat- from 1947 to 1962 till today, even when they were badly outnumbered and their ammunition ran out. He reminded us how even in 1962, our soldiers and the officers in command had fought valiantly though they were ill-equipped and ran out of ammunition, they fought to the last man. Raza said that in wartime an army when

told to fight should not have to report to a political high command as they had to do in 1962 for every action when confronting the enemy.

In 1971, General Sam Manekshaw was able to tell Mrs Gandhi exactly what the the army could achieve, and eventually achieved given time and thus we had a great victory.

This is something all politicians all over the world need to remember. And I don't just say this for India. America's invasion in Iraq and Pakistan's innumerable bad decisions are there for the world to see.

But I urge the leaders of nations, before they embark on war, to just remember and reflect on the human cost.

I am proud to say that in the 5000 years and more of Indian History, India was never a hegemonic state. Few major civilizations or Nations, today, can say that. India is an ancient civilization that had a vast maritime empire not through might but through culture and ancient wisdom. It never conquered but convinced through wisdom and spirituality."

Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said his party was ready for discussion, but demanded formation of a JPC to probe the Rafale deal so that every file related to the matter can be scrutinised.

To this Mahajan said that constitution of JPC was not under her purview.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the Supreme Court verdict has made things clear, indicating that there was no need for a JPC on the controversial issue.

Unhappy with the response, Congress members again started raising slogans, following which the House was adjourned for the day.

The lower house has been witnessing daily disruptions since the winter session began last week. It had passed a bill on transgender rights on Monday.

His lawyers had asked for a plea bargain after his arraignment on November 19 but the request was rejected by the judge.

""This kind of issue is too rampant in our tertiary institutions. We send children to school, they come home telling us that lecturers want to sleep with them,"" judge Onyetenu said.

Akindele was found guilty on all four charges and sentenced to two years in jail.

""We cannot continue like this. Somebody has to be used as example. Even primary schools pupils are complaining,"" Onyetenu said.

""It is time for the court to start upholding the right of the children, especially female students. The case is endemic,"" she added.

Both Houses were adjourned within minutes of convening -- the Lok Sabha for an hour till noon and the Rajya Sabha till 2 pm -- only to be adjourned for the day within minutes of reconvening, with no discussions over any of the pending bills.

The primary demand of Congress MPs was an investigation by a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) into the Rafale deal.

Amid the din in the Lok Sabha, party leader Mallikarjun Kharge demanded a JPC investigation into the fight jet agreement and also questioned whether the government was indeed ready for a discussion or debate on the Rafale controversy. To support his argument, he pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi rarely comes to Parliament and ""doesn't say two words in the House"". Khadge also raised questions about the CAG and PAC reports that the Centre made claims about to the Supreme Court.

Besides the Rafale deal, MPs of the AIDMK and DMK, too, disrupted proceedings as they have been demanding that the Centre revoke the permission granted to Karnataka to construct a reservoir-cum-drinking water project at Mekedatu across the Cauvery river. MPs of the Telugu Desam Party also shouted slogans in the House, demanding special category status for Andhra Pradesh.

Congress versus BJP

The Lok Sabha turned into a battlegound for sloganeering by members of the rival party, with both coming up with their own versions of ""gali, gali mein shor hai...""

The session began with BJP leaders holding up placards that read ""Rahul Gandhi maafi maango"" (Rahul Gandhi apologise), referring to his comments on the Rafale deal. Leaders of both parties then tried to out-shout each other -- with the BJP crying ""Gali, gali mein shor hai, Rahul Gandhi chor hai"" and ""Gali, gali mein shor hai, Rahul Gandhi chor hai"", and the Congress adopting its favourite ""Gali, gali mein shor hai, chowkidaar chor hai"" slogan.

More than 30 members from the AIADMK, the TDP and the Congress trooped into the Well during the Question Hour, despite appeals by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan to return to their seats and allow discussions in the Lok Sabha.

Along with the Speaker, a few ministers made a valiant effort to discuss agrarian issues, and a minister even succeeded in introducing the National Institute of Design (Amendment) Bill. But attempts at a discussion were futile, and Mahajan adjourned the House soon after.

Speaker schools MPs

Parliament is for discussion and debate, the Lok Sabha Speaker said after MPs continued to disrupt proceedings and didn't allow any issues to be discussed.

""The government is ready to discuss anything you want, but this is not the way. It is not sending a good message. We have to face the public,"" she said. ""I'm requesting you again and again. Whatever discussions you want will be done as per the rules.""

""People abroad also ask what is happening in the Indian Parliament?... We must show some responsibility. I'll request the government myself to hold a discussion. We must maintain a standard in Parliament.""

After her appeals fell on deaf ears, Mahajan adjourned the House for the day.

Exasperated Naidu adjourns Rajya Sabha with no debate

Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha Venkaiah Naidu began the day's session with an appeal to MPs to allow the House to hold discussions, promising to list subjects for discussion as per priority, but to no avail.

Like the Lok Sabha, the Upper House, too, was adjourned till 2 pm within minutes of convening after several MPs stood near the chair's podium and began to shout slogans. Among them were leaders of the AIADMK and DMK, who held placards and protested with slogans against Karnataka's proposed dam on the Cauvery river.

Before the House was adjourned, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said the most important issue was that of the breach of privilege of the House by the government in the Rafale deal. ""The government has misled Parliament and the Supreme Court through a wrong affidavit, and thus it misled the country on the Rafale deal,"" Azad said.

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel said the government was ready to discuss all issues, including Rafale, in the Rajya Sabha, accusing the Opposition of ""running away from discussion"". As the ruckus continued, Naidu adjourned the House till 2 pm.

After the House reconvened, Congress leader Anand Sharma objected to BJP leaders demanding an apology from Rahul Gandhi for his statements on the Rafale deal. But BJP leaders shouted down his statements, forcing Naidu to adjourn the House for the day within four minutes of reconvening.

In a public statement, Marriott explained it received an alert from an internal security tool about an attempt to access the Starwood database on September 8, 2018. This prompted an investigation that exposed a history of unauthorized access to the Starwood network dating back to 2014. It is the second largest known data breach of consumer data on record and stands as a stark reminder of the importance of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that is not only reactive, but also proactive and preventative.

The Marriott data breach affects approximately 500 million guests who are in the Starwood database because they made a reservation on or before September 10, 2018 at a Starwood property in any of the 129 countries and territories in which the company operates. For 327 million of those guests, the information accessed includes their name, passport number, date of birth, gender, phone number, mailing address and email address. For some, the information also includes payment card numbers and payment card expiration dates. While the payment card numbers were encrypted using an algorithm known as Advanced Encryption Standard encryption (AES-128), Marriott did not rule out the possibility they were decrypted by the hackers. For the remaining 173 million guests, the information accessed is limited to their name and, in some cases, other data such as mailing and email addresses.

Marriott has been widely criticized for the delay in detecting the security issues that led to the data breach and notifying consumers whose data was compromised. The company is now working with security experts to improve its security and phase out Starwood systems. While Marriott believes it is ""premature to estimate the financial impact"" to the company, many commentators believe there will be significant financial cost and reputational harm. By comparison, the Equifax Inc. cybersecurity breach in 2017, which affected 148 million people, caused a reported $400 million in recovery costs and Equifax ranked sixth on the Most Controversial Companies Report from RepRisk that year.

In the U.S., the offices of the Illinois, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania attorneys general opened investigations into the breach and Marriott may also be subject to a number of other state attorney general investigations. These can lead to state enforcement actions resulting in significant fines under consumer protection statues, data breach notification standards and/or data security obligations. A class action lawsuit was also filed in the U.S. alleging Marriott failed to take appropriate measures to protect and secure the confidential and personal information of its consumers, which violated consumer protection statutes, constituted a breach of confidence and was reckless and grossly negligent. In Canada, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner contacted Marriott, but has not yet opened an investigation.

The Marriott data breach highlights the importance of a proactive and preventative approach to understanding a company's security risk profile and implementing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, especially as consumers are calling for increased levels of digital security. On October 25, 2018, Ankura Consulting Group published a report, Information Security Trends that Maximize Competitive Advantage, which recommends the following:

1. Businesses need to be aware of and be honest about vulnerabilities and proactively monitor and enhance their information security.

2. Consider creating a program of continuous investment in information security and ensure a plan is in place to cope with unexpected data breaches.

3. New cybersecurity tools, many of which utilize machine learning, deep learning, and other forms of AI and ""info-safe"" cultures, are necessary to protect information held by companies. Utilizing information security measures that are free is a minimum safeguard.

4. Robust cyber risk insurance and a proactive crisis communications strategy help a business to cope in the event of a data breach.

5. Effective cybersecurity involves adopting an enterprise risk management methodology that encompasses not only technology but also the equally important people and policy aspects of cybersecurity.

While some of these recommendations require significant expenditure, others, such as employee cybersecurity awareness training are relatively inexpensive and easy to implement. Regardless, it is not enough to react to a cybersecurity threat, as this approach can result in increased exposure, greater recovery costs and reputational harm. A proactive and preventative approach is necessary, which includes evaluating business- and industry-specific threats and risk indicators, and creating a cybersecurity program that corresponds to a business's unique risk profile. This may include a combination of risk assessment, predictive analytics, risk mitigation and business continuity planning. Working with counsel who can highlight the relevant issues to be aware of and assist in preventing and addressing cybersecurity attacks in a highly efficient manner is very important.

Saeed launched the MML in August 2017 with a so-called mission to implement the ideology of Pakistan in accordance with the 1973 Constitution.

The JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Taiba which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people.

The MML contested general elections on the platform of the ""dormant"" political entity Allaha-u-Akbar Tehreek (AAT), which was registered with the ECP.

The Supreme Court in September last permitted the JuD and its arm Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation (FIF) to continue their relief and charity work in the country.

JuD's network includes 300 seminaries and schools, hospitals, a publishing house and ambulance services. The JuD and FIF alone have about 50,000 volunteers and hundreds of other paid workers, according to two counter-terrorism officials.

2. Fresh BJP Plea On Bengal March

Calcutta High Court on Monday gave the BJP the liberty to move a fresh petition against the Bengal government for disallowing its proposed ganatantro banchao yatra (save democracy march) even as a public interest litigation was filed seeking a high court order to the administration against such programmes.

Justice Tapabrata Chakraborty allowed the BJP to file the petition when its lawyer Saptangshu Basu sought the court's nod to challenge the administration's denial of permission for the march.

The court also assured the BJP that it would hear the plea on Tuesday.

The BJP had initially called the procession rathyatra and later named it 'Save Democracy March'.

At least a dozen bikers were injured and four cars piled up after a stretch of EM Bypass near Tagore Park turned slippery when oil and tar used to repair the stretch got mixed with the rainwater.

The oil and tar was applied on the road on Sunday as a base layer after portions of the road had disintegrated because of the ongoing Metro construction work. However, it had started raining within hours of the repair work on a section of the six-lane road. The oil mixed with water and turned a large stretch of the slippery.

6. Users Lose Money To E-Wallet Fraud

The city has seen a sudden spurt in e-wallet and banking app frauds, with the police in Kolkata and Bidhannagar receiving six such complaints in the past two weeks.

Most of the e-wallet and banking app frauds took place in the brief gap between payments being made and the money transferred to an account, said the police. Sometimes, after a payment has been made on the app, the money doesn't get transferred immediately due to technical reasons. But scared of losing their money to fraudsters, the users try to call up the customer care numbers. ""Many of these numbers they find online either lead them to fraudsters, or had been hacked into. A few minutes later, the victims usually receive calls and the accused pump out their banking details and siphon off money from their accounts,"" said an officer, adding Jharkhand gangs could be involved.

""If it is found that the said schools are taking admissions despite being prevented to do so, necessary action as per norms will be taken without any further notice,"" the official added.

The distance of student's residence from school, sibling quota, parents being alumni of the school, single child, first child are some of the criteria listed by schools for admissions to the entry-level classes. According to the schedule released by the DoE, the application window will be open from Saturday and the last date of submitting application forms for nursery class admission for 2019-20 session is January 7.

The first list of selected children, along with marks secured by them, will be out on February 4.

The second list will be out on February 21 and the nursery admission process will conclude on March 31.

Twenty-five per cent seats in pre-school, pre-primary and class 1 will be reserved for economically weaker sections EWS)/disadvantaged groups under the Right To Education Act. The directorate had instructed all private schools to upload their criteria -- with points for each criterion -- for admission in open seats, on its official website by December 14. There is, however, no clarity yet on the schedule of the EWS admissions.

The government has also set an upper age limit of less than four years to be eligible for nursery, less than five years for kindergarten, and less than six years for admission to class 1. The proposal for an upper age limit was challenged in the court last year. Though a Delhi High Court order last year had allowed the imposition of the upper age limit, the DoE had decided that the order will be applicable only from 2019 academic session. Apart from the abolished criteria, the schools have been given autonomy to come up with their own points system.

Directorate rules

According to new rules issued by the directorate of education, schools are required to publish their admission criteria for various classes by December 14 in the interest of transparency"

Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani here on Monday alleged that his Odisha countepart Naveen Patnaik visited Surat, where more than seven lakh migrant Odias live, for the first time in 19 years with an eye on the 2019 elections.

Mr. Rupani, who was here to talk on the Rafale deal in the wake of the recent Supreme Court verdict, said Mr. Patnaik's visit to Gujarat and his coming to Odisha on the same day was a mere coincidence.

""The fate of the yatra will be decided by the courts. Meanwhile, we'll be holding our Ganatantra Bachao Andolan (movement to save democracy) in every block. And if a block denies us permission, we will organise protests and law violation programs"", BJP Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh said on Monday.

The law violation will consist mainly of gheraos of offices of district officials and police chiefs, said Ghosh, who led the first such agitation in Arambag in Hooghly district on Monday.

On Tuesday, similar protests will take place in Jhargram town in Jhargram district, and Barasat and Bongaon in North 24-Parganas district. On Wednesday, protests will be held in Balurghat of South Dinajpur district and on Friday, in Rampurhat of Birbhum district.

To take stock of the situation after uncertainty clouded the rath yatra's fate, five state leaders including Ghosh and management committee in-charge Mukul Roy will meet the party's national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and others in New Delhi on Tuesday.

On Monday the BJP filed a writ petition in a single bench of the Calcutta high court against Saturday's decision of the Mamata Banerjee government not to allow the yatra.

In the petition, the party said it would launch its three rath yatras from Cooch Behar, Gangasagar and Tarapeeth on December 22, 24 and 26, respectively. The matter is slated to be heard on Tuesday.

However, political analysts pointed out that BJP's programme has become uncertain as the high court will remain closed for Christmas vacation between December 24 and 31 and the state government looks to be in no mood to give in without fighting it out in the division bench and the Supreme Court.

While this is likely to take the whole of January, a ban on microphones will come into effect from February 9 to March 13, due to state board exams in schools.

""The yatra looks very unlikely before end-March. BJP underestimated Mamata Banerjee's shrewdness and are paying for it. Without the yatra, the BJP will never be able to whip up as much enthusiasm as they would have with it,"" said psephologist Biswanath Chakraborty, professor of political science at Rabindra Bharati University.

Chakraborty argued that with this one move, the Trinamool Congress has ensured that it gets Muslims votes in bulk and further corner the Left and the Congress, that have traditionally been the recipients of Muslim votes in various parts of the state. Muslims are believed to make up about 30% of Bengal's electorate (about 27% in 2011).

While Congress veteran and Leader of Opposition in the state assembly, Abdul Mannan, supported the state government's denial of permission, CPI(M) central committee member Rabin Deb criticised the government for paving the way for publicity for BJP.

""The government should have given permission to the yatra but not allowed it in certain sensitive pockets. Instead, the government offered some lame excuses, giving the BJP the chance to polarise opinion,"" said Rabin Deb.

Political analyst Amal Mukhopadhyay, former principal of Presidency College, echoed Deb. ""The government should have ignored the BJP's yatra. By denying permission, the government has given the BJP the chance to launch a wider campaign against the lack of democratic space and to even gain public sympathy,"" he said."

The Gilgit Baltistan government has tasked a 30-member jirga, a tribal council sorts, to negotiate with those who set fire to more than a dozen schools in the province's Diamer district, half of which were for girls, in August this year, reported Dawn.

Faizullah Faraq, spokesperson for the Gilgit Baltistan government, said Sunday that the jirga was working with the aim to get the militants to surrender. He added that the jirga has been given the directive to hold these talks which are being organised high up in the mountains where families of the militants also live with them.

The spokesperson remarked that the government does not want to use force on these miscreants as their wives and children are also living with them.

An initial report on the incident gave suggestions that the work was of some foreigners and few local facilitators who first vandalised the school buildings and then burnt them down.

Around 40 people suspected of planning the attacks have been arrested so far while search for 15 are underway.

Online petition demands ban be lifted on Nandita Das's Manto in Pakistan

An online petition started by Pakistani journalist Saeed Ahmed has been launched on change.org to urge the country's Prime Minister Imran Khan to lift the ban on the release of the film Manto, directed by Nandita Das, in Pakistan, reported Dawn.

The film stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Saadat Hasan Manto, a prolific yet controversial Urdu writer, and focuses on some of his most tumultuous phases of his life, especially after Partition.

""The audiences and critics worldwide have appreciated the film. However, it is a matter of huge concern that the Pakistan Censor Board has recently decided to debar the film,"" the online petition reads. ""The disappointing decision to ban the film has created a hue and cry among writers, poets, and intellectuals in the literary circles of Pakistan... It is therefore, appealed that the ban is dismissed with immediate effect.""

The plea also questioned if Manto would face the same fate of torture and court trials in 'Naya Pakistan' as he had to undergo during 'Purana Pakistan'.

The petition has been signed by high-profile personalities and public figures including Manto's daughters Nighat, Nusrat and Nuzhat, human rights advocates I.A. Rehman and Hussain Naqi, artist Salima Hashmi, Urdu writer Mirza Hamid Baig and journalist Saleem Asmi.

Nandita Das on Twitter thanked people for launching this initiative and demanding the release of the film in Pakistan.

The fencing of the 2,611-km long Pakistan-Afghanistan border is set to be completed by next December, Pakistan army spokesperson Asif Ghafoor said Saturday, reported The News International.

Ghafoor on Twitter announced that ""work on forts and fence continues on the Pak-Afghan border"" as 233 of the 843 forts and fencing of 802 out of 1,200 km priority one areas has been completed.

He also said that this will benefit ""people of Pakistan and Afghanistan while restricting terrorists"".

Pak Army releases song to honour Peshawar school attack victims

The Pakistan army's media spokesperson, Major General Asif Ghafoor, released on Twitter a four-minute song, Hamey agay hee jana hai (we have to move forward), as a tribute to those who lost their lives in the terror attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar four years ago, reported Geo TV.

According to a report in Dawn, nine militants massacred over 131 schoolchildren and 10 others during the attack on 16 December, 2014. It remains the deadliest attack in Pakistan's history.

The incident gave rise to a number of national policies, including a National Action Plan to curb terrorism and militancy in the country and setting up of military courts so that terrorists could be tried.

""We are a resilient nation, our enemies shall never succeed...We are succeeding, united and steadfast and we shall attain our objectives of enduring peace and prosperity,"" Ghafoor tweeted Sunday.

A wreath-laying ceremony was organised Sunday in Peshawar to commemorate the martyrs in the attack.

""What is the name of the Chief Minister"", I asked a group of tribal women in Mahasamund. It was my first field trip to Chhattisgarh and I was a rookie with one year of experience in the development sector. With all the scepticism that new idealists could gather, I felt that women not knowing the name of the Chief Minister of the state would reflect on their agency, and hence would give me a starting point to discuss decentralised governance with them!

""I do not know his name, but 'chawal waale baba' is what we call him"". Mahasamund has always been a Congress dominated belt and the response came as a shock to me. For the next couple of hours, I went on to talk of a lot of things, but what dominated the discussion was how the women in the village zealously monitor the fair price shops and how this 'chawal waale baba' is doing some good work for them.

Few days back, Dr Raman Singh was about to face a defeat in his constituency of Rajnandgaon from which he has been contesting elections since the early 90s. He somehow managed to scrape through but the government and his party could not be saved. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been reduced to 15 seats in the state and has lost out across all demographies and geographies in the state. But, 15 years is not a small time and Dr Raman Singh has presided over the most significant period of change in the state. So what is his legacy and what is the way ahead for him, politically?

Before the arrival of the Gujarat success story by the fag end of 2014, Chhattisgarh was the state where the issue of development was front and centre in electoral terms. It was a state carved out of Madhya Pradesh to help the tribal and the Scheduled Caste communities and hence, the articulation of development here was also very different. Development in Chhattisgarh in the way Raman Singh articulated meant a turnaround in fortunes and not just a facelift.

As one of the states with the largest tribal population, abject poverty and violent Left wing extremism, Chhattisgarh needed that narrative of transition and Raman Singh was the one who provided it. And this was not the development of mega industries and four-lane highways and metros criss-crossing cities. This was the development of getting people adequate food to eat and putting the first generation of learners in schools and bringing the first pucca roads to a village. It was development from scratch.

If we look at the Chhattisgarh story since the past 15 years, there are two aspects of governance which would stand out as the legacy of Dr Raman Singh.

Social Development Legacy

The biggest success story in Chhattisgarh under Dr Singh was the efficiency of the public distribution system (PDS). Chhattisgarh took an unabashed Left route in approaching food security and increased the PDS coverage to 74 per cent. Moreover, when other states were experiencing major issues of pilferage and looting, the Chhattisgarh government undertook a slew of reforms to address the situation.

The first concern that Raman Singh identified after taking office was that more than 50 per cent of the below poverty line (BPL) population, were unable to access the food grains meant for them. The first reform he brought in was taking away the ownership of PDS shops from private businessmen and handing over control to the local community.

Then came other measures like issuing new ration cards with holograms which weeded out over 3 lakh fake beneficiaries, increased commission and even a seed fund to shop operators for making the business viable, increased monitoring and vigilance including community audits, doorstep delivery of food grains and raids and massive crackdown of corrupt rice millers. Raman Singh without any doubt made PDS the key to his re-election in 2008 and there was no other issue which worked, except 'chawal'.

The victory of 2008 was on the back of the almost transformational change in the supply chain of the PDS and sealed the tag of 'chawal waale baba'. The Chhattisgarh success story was so convincing that even some stalwarts in Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council (NAC) had to use it as a template.

The success of PDS in Chhattisgarh had an expected ripple effect on the nutritional levels in the state. Food scarcity in tribal belts leads to malnutrition and stunting, and Chhattisgarh managed to address this issue thoroughly. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 data shows that the percentage of adult women with body mass index (BMI) less than normal has decreased from 43.4 per cent in 2005-06 to 26.7 in 2015-16. It is less than the figures for MP and Jharkhand and almost the same as Odisha, even though it recorded a higher incidence level than all three states in 2005-06.

Another important change has been the decrease in instances of anaemia in infants which has reduced from 71.2 per cent in 2005-06 to 41.6 per cent in 2015-16. It has now reached below the national average, while the states of MP, Jharkhand and Odisha still register more instances of infant anaemia. The final indicator which directly speaks about malnutrition is the incidences of stunting.

The following figure provides an idea of how Chhattisgarh has progressed on addressing stunting and underweight issues in children. The only state which has fared better than Chhattisgarh is Odisha but it also needs to be seen that Chhattisgarh had a much higher base in 2005-06.

This is no minor feat. With the PDS covering basic food-grains in villages, schools and anganwadi centres, the savings of the poor could be used to widen the basket of nutritious food, thus effectively tackling malnutrition. The single minded focus of Raman Singh on one issue paid off both socially and politically for him.

If Vasundhara Raje has been the most economic right wing chief minister from the BJP, Raman Singh has undoubtedly been the most towards the Left. He is known for a slew of populist welfare schemes in the state. His focus on health and nutrition extended to his CM Health Scheme whereby Rs 30,000 worth of free treatment was provided to citizens. Other welfare schemes ranged from the Saraswati Cycle Yojana for school girls to the Mukhyamantri Teerth Yatra Yojana for elderly citizens.

Combating Left Wing Extremism In The State

Since the day the new state of Chhattisgarh was born, the single biggest problem impeding the development initiatives was the 'red terrorism' plaguing multiple districts of the state.

Raman Singh has been at the centre of a lot of controversy when it comes to combating Left wing extremism and his government has been accused of custodial violence against tribals, harassment of activists like Binayak Sen and most importantly tacit support given to the Salwa Judum. Raman Singh in the past has openly defended the Salwa Judum as being the primary resistance force against the Maoists.

In 2009, just two years before the Salwa Judum was disbanded by the Supreme Court, Dr Singh had credited the members of the vigilante group as being the custodians of the republic. The formation of the Salwa Judum led to one of the bloodiest phases in the state and the tribal communities were divided and displaced like never before. It is a cross that both the Congress and the BJP have to bear. But, as the CM for 15 long years, it can never be dissociated from the legacy of Raman Singh.

While Chhattisgarh continues to be the state, most affected by Maoist violence, through the course of the past 15 years, the Raman Singh government had many big and small successes in addressing the alienation of the tribal communities and ushering in peace. From the construction of state highways to schemes like allowances for pregnant and lactating mothers, a mix of infrastructural and welfare measures had been implemented in tribal areas along with numerous awareness and sensitisation campaigns.

While the districts of Sarguja and Jashpur have now been removed from the list of Maoist affected districts, the most significant transformation has been seen in the district of Bastar. The Dandakaranya belt is the hotbed of Maoist activity in the country and has been the scene of the most dastardly acts of violence against the state. Carrying out development activities in this area and then seeing tangible returns of inclusion is no mean feat.

It is a three-pronged strategy where the security forces and the civic administration work in tandem to ensure that relative peace facilitates rapid infrastructural development and the cycle continues without further incidents. The third prong is ensuring that key entitlements to the local communities and their rights under PESA are respected. This has been a strategy that the Chhattisgarh government under Dr Singh has made moderate success in.

One of the most significant changes in the Maoist areas of the state has been the rapid construction of roads. These roads have not only ended the alienation of remote villages but have pushed the Maoists further into the jungles. Conversely, it has also been the cause behind much of the attacks in the state since 2014.

The two stretches which have seen the most attacks are the Dornapal-Jagargunda stretch and the Injeram-Bhejji stretch which are incidentally the two critical road construction stretches. Bastar, today, is being dotted with educational institutions and health care centres. There are three districts in the region which still can be counted as war zones and the Maoist threat is far from over. But, change has happened right under the barrel of the gun and for that Dr Raman Singh deserves a lot of credit.

My first trip to Mahasamund for a study was in 2013. The last one was in 2017 when I travelled to Ambikapur, Sarguja, another Congress belt. This time I was not working with women but with adolescent girls. Their concerns were different. They needed English classes and computer skills, and well-paying jobs. Some of them told me that the 'sattu' provided by the government under the SABLA scheme is used for feeding cattle, a far cry from conversations of adequate nutrition. Survival and chawal was not the topic of discussion. Aspiration and jobs were.

I again asked them about the CM. All of them knew his name, Dr Raman Singh. For the new generation with new hopes, he was not 'chawal waale baba' anymore. He was just another politician who needed to deliver on new demands. That, perhaps, sums up why the development agenda of Raman Singh did not work. There is a new generation holding the keys to power now and the old guard could not keep up with their aspirations.

While the legacy of Dr Raman Singh has been development, it has mostly been around subsistence. Food security, access to health, even footwear for tired feet! It is perhaps what the need was that point but subsistence will never be enough. With his share of successes and controversies and lost time, Dr Singh needs to be given the due credit he deserves.

It is to his credit to have governed one of the most difficult, conflict ridden states in India and gradually relieve parts of it from the backward status it had been stamped with. While a large number of districts in Chhattisgarh continue to be aspirational while the rest of the country surges forward, it is to his credit that the dreams of Naya Raipur and Naya Bastar have not been pushed to the background.

And importantly, his PDS success story has been the one which exhibits what true political will can achieve even in the face of immense odds. This could very well have been the end of his stint as the CM of the state, but the road from Raipur via Bastar may just lead to New Delhi."

Since then, I am scared of literally everything,"" said 72-year-old V Chithra, a resident of Adyar.

Her fears are not unwarranted nor is she alone in feeling so. Another senior citizen from Ayanavaram, on condition of anonymity, said she moved to a retirement home after her neighbour's jewellery was robbed.

Crimes against the elderly were again brought to the spotlight after the double murder at Avadi in the last week of November.

Sixty-eight-year-old Jegadeesan and sixty-one-year-old Vishalini, both retired from government press in Chennai, were at their house on Ayyappa Main Road at Sekkadu when they were murdered. Though this incident has been classified as a hate crime, it unveiled how vulnerable senior citizens remain in the city.

At least once in two days, a senior citizen in the city falls victim to chain or mobile snatching, according to police sources. According to NCRB data, Tamil Nadu recorded 2,895 crimes in 2016, 2,121 in 2014 and 1,947 in 2015 respectively. The state stood eighth among the 29 states in crime rate against senior citizens in 2016.

The trend is reflected across the country with a total of 21,410 crimes against senior citizens in the country aged 60 or above, recorded in 2016 (the last year such data is available).

""Senior citizens are easy targets, hence they are chosen for the crimes. In the case of murders, the offenders are usually known to the victim. The offenders have watched the victim and clearly plotted the plan,"" said Dr M Srinivasan, professor and head of the department of criminology, University of Madras.

He said that though it is assumed that elderly women are most prone to these crimes, official statistics and studies reveal that the number of elderly male victims is higher.

""We feel very unsafe as most of the senior citizens stay alone, with their children living abroad. The accused closely monitor us and commit the crimes. Also, incidents of land grabbing have increased in the last few years. They realise that senior citizens do not have much power and therefore harass them for their land. Chain and mobile snatchings have been happening for years now,"" said V Chandrasekhar, president, Sr Citizens Group of Besant Nagar.

To tackle issues like this, senior citizens across the city have been conducting regular meetings. Residents, predominantly from Anna Nagar, Besant Nagar and Velachery, invite police and senior citizens for meetings and talk about safety measures to avert such situations.

N Balakrishnan (65), who has been living alone for two years now at Tambaram, said, ""Firstly, I make myself aware of the crimes and make sure my finances are safe. Also, we have to accept the fact that we are easy targets and avoid stepping out of the homes late in the night or letting strangers into the house.""

N Lalitha, senior advocate with the Madras High Court, says the main reason for increase in crimes against senior citizens is that there are no specific laws against such crimes. Though there are different schemes announced by the government in favour of such people, they mainly focus on monetary benefits, food and shelter, safety takes a back seat.

To address this issue, 1.5 lakh cameras have been installed by the Chennai City Police, Traffic Police, apartments, schools and colleges."

India's Silicon Valley in Bengaluru and tech hubs in Mumbai and Delhi, along with much of the NRI community and their cousins, joined the Narendra Modi chorus. India was, they said, on the cusp of radical, neo-liberal transformation. Some wrote that India's 'Thatcher Moment' has come. Others thought Modi could bring the 'Ronald Reagan Revolution' to India. This corporate class had huge support not just from the NRIs but also from the American business establishment.

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel suited Modi's local idea of greatness and historical ignorance. The narrative that poor Patel had missed the opportunity to become the first Gujarati Prime Minister because of the alleged cunningness of Jawaharlal Nehru gained ground. So, Modi and his supporters made it a habit to attack Nehru as if he was still around and ridiculed his great-grandson Rahul Gandhi. So, it became a proxy war between Nehru and Modi. The WhatsApp warriors ferociously attacked the Nehru-Gandhi-led Congress - they excelled in the targeted and systematic maligning of personalities and communities like we have seen in German history.

The corporate brigade, including highly paid IITians and IIM-syllabus trained young soldiers from various business schools, joined the vast army of social media outfits. Thousands of them found jobs with these troll armies. The alleged job was simple and the remuneration high: invent stories, generate calumny, spread slander, circulate fake news and destroy Nehru's legacy.

Interestingly, those who got mesmerised by this media blitz were executives working with big, medium or even small business enterprises. They actually believed that there was an inspiring dawn after a long dark Nehruvian night. This is when the myth of invincibility of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah began to get entrenched. The BJP's majority in 2014 was attributed to Modi's aggressive, imaginative and oratorical campaign.

Therefore, the 2019 election, they thought, would be a repeat of 2014. The so-called semi-finals of assembly polls did not worry them much. Modi's carpet bombing-style rallies would overcome the negative image of the state governments, they were sure. That is why the 3-0 performance of Congress shook them out of their complacency, and after four years, they have visibly lost confidence.

At private gatherings and cocktail parties, in closed-door conference rooms and hush-hush conversations, they have begun to express their frustrations, total disillusionment and their business crises, especially after the chaotic implementation of the GST and the 'mindless' demonetisation. They are even expressing their fears and apprehensions about possible Enforcement Directorate or Income Tax raids. They are seriously concerned about the RBI governor's resignation and the appointment of Shaktikanta Das, who is known neither as an economist, nor as a business-friendly officer.

But the defeat of the BJP was significant in other respects too. Amit Shah's alleged game of creating a fifth column in Chhattisgarh by encouraging Ajit Jogi-Mayawati alliance has miserably bombed. Jogi had already begun to behave as if he was the chief minister-elect. And Mayawati was threatening the grand old party as if she was the chosen candidate for prime ministership. 'Who Rahul and What Congress' was the refrain.

But 11 December proved to be a 'Black Day' for all the anti-Congress parties and Rahul Gandhi detractors. The headlines on TV that night and in next day's morning newspapers echoed: ""Rahul Gandhi halts Modi Vijay Rath"" or ""Rahul halts Shah Juggernaut"" or ""The Son has Finally Risen"". The media loves hyperbole, and the win in the two big states (Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh) was treated like it was a landslide.

There was no Congress face in Chhattisgarh, but there was a landslide. The Telangana and Mizoram losses did not make headlines, because they were not 'test matches' like the ones played in the Hindi Heartland. But for the Supreme Court judgment on the Rafale deal, the BJP had lost face and its spokespersons their speech. (The court, however, has not addressed a single question posed by the Opposition, mainly the Congress. The issue of price and allocation of the Rafale offset project to Anil Ambani's firm, allegedly sidelining the HAL, remains).

The corporate executives and their masters, meanwhile, are in a state of panic now. One can empathise with them or laugh at them. Their oversized egos and delusion have created this Black Comedy-like situation now.

","Sakshipost",FALSE,"Jammu, Srikakulam district: Dark clouds gathered this morning and there was no trace of sun anywhere. It seemed that the cyclone was beginning to have its effect. Despite this fact, people walked alongside me in large numbers.

Representatives of a Srikakulam-based non-profit organisation run by women met me. They described in detail the underlying corruption in APCO with respect to the free school uniforms scheme. ""For years we have been stitching uniforms for school children. This government is out to wreck our lives. How do we survive?"" they asked. They told me that about 100 women worked for the organisation. ""Out of the Rs.40 which is paid to us per uniform, Rs.10 has to be given as bribe to the APCO chairman. If the remaining amount is not paid to us for over one year, how can we get by?"" This was their question describing their plight.

Under the TDP, APCO has turned into a major den of corruption, they pointed out. Among the worst hit by corruption, is the free uniform scheme for school children, they remarked. Even as the academic year is coming to a close on the one hand, the uniforms have still not reached the schools, on the other, they pointed out. The few which have, are of inferior quality, they complained. With proper measurements, the uniforms are unfit to be worn by boys who discard them, they said. Girl students find it even more difficult to wear these uniforms of a smaller size.

""Who is this scheme meant for?"", the members of the women's group questioned, with righteous anger. They pointed a finger at the minister concerned, the APCO chairman and higher-ups in the government who subverted the entire purpose and diluted the free school uniforms scheme for their own selfish ends by looting it indiscriminately.

My father took up the Vamsadhara project to check the flooding of water and to prevent agricultural land from getting submerged. He had also sanctioned funds for this purpose. Narsannapeta farmers who met me complained that this government did not complete the pending works and as a result, thousands of acres of land was getting submerged. They expressed their anguish at the negligence of the TDP government. This was the case again with the works related to the head canals, they pointed out. ""Because of the indifference of this government, thousands of acres get submerged at the time of floods,"" they lamented.

On the other hand, when there was no water to irrigate the fields, agricultural land went dry, they pointed out. While the farmers continued to suffer year after year, the government remained completely insensitive to their plight. What can one say about such an apathetic government?

Arogyamitras complained that they were being harassed and discriminated against only because they were appointed during the tenure of my father, late Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy. Their job insecurity became a day to day matter of unending tension, only after this Telugu Desam government came to power, they remarked. They had to seek justice from the court of law when they were removed from service at one stroke, they said. The government paid no heed to the direction from the court that their salaries should be enhanced. The government is still trying to ease them out of service, they feared. ""What is our fault? Is it that we were appointed in the Arogyasri scheme which won national and international acclaim,"" they asked. What can be more inhuman than to torment these poor employees and to dilute the pioneering healthcare initiative launched by my father, only because he would be remembered and get credit for it! What is this sense of envy which drives people at the highest level in this government and who is it wreaking its vengeance upon? After all, who benefits from this universal healthcare scheme -- lakhs of families across the state!

I have a question for the chief minister -- you claim that students are being supplied free uniforms every year. Handloom societies which supplied cloth complain that their arrears have not been paid. Those who stitched these uniforms say that their dues have still not been paid. Students complain that even as the academic year is coming to a close, they have still not received their uniforms, and where they did, the ones supplied are of a very poor quality. What is happening to the funds sanctioned for this scheme of free uniforms? Whose pockets are being filled with these funds?"

Bhupesh Baghel overcame the challenge from his contemporary T S Singh Deo to become Congress chief minister of Chhattisgarh, capping a week-long party exercise to finalise the leadership of the state as well as of Rajasthan and MP where BJP was swept out of power on 11 December.

TOI had reported in its late editions on Sunday that Baghel was the front runner for the job. He is credited with leading the organisation during the last five years against BJP led by an entrenched three-term CM Raman Singh.

Amid claims of multiple leaders, Rahul Gandhi kept his focus on the primary consideration of Baghel's organisational stewardship, which, coupled with his experience as a minister in MP and Chhattisgarh, added to his profile as administrator.

2. Modi Slams Cong: No Quattrocchi Mama or Michel Uncle in Rafale Deal

In his first public remarks since the Supreme Court rejected judicial intervention in the Rafale deal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday targeted the Congress and said that the party is ""lying"" and is ""frustrated"" as there was no ""Quattrocchi mama"" or ""Christian Michel uncle"" in the NDA government's defence deals.

Addressing a rally in former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi's Lok Sabha constituency of Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh, just days after the BJP lost power to the Congress in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Modi questioned the Congress on why it did not strengthen the Air Force despite demands by the military after the Kargil war.

He said: ""Humare liye dal se bada desh hai...Inhe desh ki parwah nahi hai...Modi ko woh kisi bhi tarah ek daag laga dena chahte hain...Lekin uske liye desh ko taak pe kyon rakh diya gaya hai. (For us, the country is bigger than the party. They (Congress) do not care about the country, they just want to put a blot on Modi...they have put the country at stake for that).""

3. DMK Chief MK Stalin Proposes Rahul Gandhi as PM Face for 2019

DMK president MK Stalin on Sunday, 16 December, made a strong pitch for Rahul Gandhi as the Opposition's prime ministerial candidate for 2019, saying the Congress chief had the ability to oust the ""fascist"" Narendra Modi government.

""I propose Rahul Gandhi as PM. I urge other leaders present here to stand with me on this. We should support Rahul,"" he said. Taking a dig at the PM, Stalin said under the leadership of Modi, the country had gone back 15 years.

""Under Modi's leadership, the country has gone 15 years back. If we give him another chance, the country will surely go back to what it was 50 years ago,"" the DMK chief said at an event to inaugurate a statue of the party's late patriarch and ex-chief minister M Karunanidhi at Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's (DMK) headquarters in Chennai.

5. Army Versus Valley March

The army has vowed to foil a march called by the Hurriyat Conference to the force's Valley headquarters against the latest civilian killings in Kashmir as it braced for a showdown with separatist-backed protesters on Monday.

An army spokesperson said the force would thwart all such ""evil attempts of the terrorist-separatist-Pakistan nexus to pit the civilian population against security forces"".

Sunday's tough talk came a day after seven civilians died and dozens were injured in Sirnoo village in Pulwama, south Kashmir, when security forces fired on an unruly mob that had swarmed the streets to protest the death of three militants in a gunfight that broke out early in the morning. A soldier also died in the encounter.

6. Pak Infiltration Ops Shifting to Jammu Border: NIA

A National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe has revealed that in the last three years over 40 terrorists were pushed by Pakistan into India through the international border in Jammu, and then transported deep into the Kashmir Valley to carry out targeted strikes, said multiple government, intelligence and security officials familiar with the matter.

NIA has drawn its conclusion about the number of infiltrators after interrogating half-a-dozen overground workers (OWGs) - a nomenclature used by the J&K police for civilians who help militants - linked to Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), who were arrested over the past year, the officials added.

The government has revived plans to put e-commerce players on a tight leash, including imposing checks on discounting and unbridled cashbacks and freebies, in a bid to clamp down on ""predatory behaviour"".

Sources told TOI that the commerce and industry ministry is looking at ways to strengthen the e-commerce sector while safeguarding the interests of domestic retailers.

Many of them are complaining about serious loss of business to ""adverse competition"" from e-tailers as well as the impact of demonetisation and goods and services tax. Lobby groups such as CAIT and Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an RSS affiliate, have taken up cudgels on behalf of local kirana and small shop owners.

9. Maharashtra to Give Leave to Male Staff for Childcare

Male employees of the state government are now entitled to childcare leaves in case their spouses are bed-ridden or incapacitated due to mental health problems and are unable to take care of the children.

The State government on 23 July issued directions on sanctioning childcare leave to male employees. As per the government resolution issued on 15 December, a male employee is eligible for leave for the exact period his wife is bedridden or is unable to take care of the children due to mental health problems.

Teaching and non-teaching staff of zilla parishads, government-approved and aided primary, secondary and higher secondary schools, agriculture and non-agriculture universities and full-time teaching and non-teaching staff from the colleges affiliated to those universities also come within its purview.

The application process for admissions to entry level classes in over 1,600 private schools began on Saturday.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has also advised the parents to not approach these schools till the department issues further order to avoid any inconvenience to them in case any penal action is initiated against defaulter schools.

""In order to maintain transparency and uniformity in admission, the admission process of these 105 schools at entry level for session 2019-20 shall be on hold till further orders,"" a senior DoE official said.

""If it is found that the said schools are taking admission despite being prevented to do so, necessary action as per norms will be taken without any further notice,"" the official added.

The distance of student's residence from school, sibling quota, parents being alumni of the school, single child, and first child are some of the criteria listed by schools for admissions to the entry level classes.

According to the schedule released by the DoE, the application window will be open from Saturday and the last date of submitting application forms for admission to nursery for 2019-20 session is January 7.

The first list of selected children, along with marks secured by them, will be out on February 4. The second list will be out on February 21 and the nursery admission process will conclude on March 31.

The directorate had instructed all private schools to upload their criteria -- with points for each criterion -- for admission in open seats, on its official website by December 14.

There is, however, no clarity on the schedule of the EWS admissions yet. The government has also set an upper age limit of less than four years to be eligible for nursery, less than five years for kindergarten, and less than six years for admission to Class 1.

The proposal for an upper age limit was challenged in the court last year. Though a Delhi high court order last year had allowed the imposition of the upper age limit, the DoE had decided that the order will be applicable only from the 2019 academic session.

Apart from the abolished criteria, the schools have been given autonomy to come up with their own points system."
"275","1020007144","2018-12-16","https://www.deccanherald.com/international/jj-knew-decades-asbestos-708326.html","J&J knew for decades about asbestos in talcs","Deccan Herald",FALSE,"Darlene Coker knew she was dying. She just wanted to know why.

She knew that her cancer, mesothelioma, arose in the delicate membrane surrounding her lungs and other organs. She knew it was as rare as it was deadly, a signature of exposure to asbestos. And she knew it afflicted mostly men who inhaled asbestos dust in mines and industries such as shipbuilding that used the carcinogen before its risks were understood.

Coker, 52 years old, had raised two daughters and was running a massage school in Lumberton, a small town in eastern Texas. How had she been exposed to asbestos? ""She wanted answers,"" her daughter Cady Evans said.

Fighting for every breath and in crippling pain, Coker hired Herschel Hobson, a personal-injury lawyer. He homed in on a suspect: the Johnson's Baby Powder that Coker had used on her infant children and sprinkled on herself all her life. Hobson knew that talc and asbestos often occurred together in the earth, and that mined talc could be contaminated with the carcinogen. Coker sued Johnson & Johnson, alleging that ""poisonous talc"" in the company's beloved product was her killer.

J&J denied the claim. Baby Powder was asbestos-free, it said. As the case proceeded, J&J was able to avoid handing over talc test results and other internal company records Hobson had requested to make the case against Baby Powder.

Coker had no choice but to drop her lawsuit, Hobson said. ""When you are the plaintiff, you have the burden of proof,"" he said. ""We didn't have it.""

That was in 1999. Two decades later, the material Coker and her lawyer sought is emerging as J&J has been compelled to share thousands of pages of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents with lawyers for some of the 11,700 plaintiffs now claiming that the company's talc caused their cancers -- including thousands of women with ovarian cancer.

A Reuters examination of many of those documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, shows that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, and that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.

The documents also depict successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators' plans to limit asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on the health effects of talc.

A small portion of the documents have been produced at trial and cited in media reports. Many were shielded from public view by court orders that allowed J&J to turn over thousands of documents it designated as confidential. Much of their contents is reported here for the first time.

""RATHER HIGH""

The earliest mentions of tainted J&J talc that Reuters found come from 1957 and 1958 reports by a consulting lab. They describe contaminants in talc from J&J's Italian supplier as fibrous and ""acicular,"" or needle-like, tremolite. That's one of the six minerals that in their naturally occurring fibrous form are classified as asbestos.

At various times from then into the early 2000s, reports by scientists at J&J, outside labs and J&J's supplier yielded similar findings. The reports identify contaminants in talc and finished powder products as asbestos or describe them in terms typically applied to asbestos, such as ""fiberform"" and ""rods.""

In 1976, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was weighing limits on asbestos in cosmetic talc products, J&J assured the regulator that no asbestos was ""detected in any sample"" of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973. It didn't tell the agency that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc - in one case at levels reported as ""rather high.""

Most internal J&J asbestos test reports Reuters reviewed do not find asbestos. However, while J&J's testing methods improved over time, they have always had limitations that allow trace contaminants to go undetected - and only a tiny fraction of the company's talc is tested.

The World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn't been established. Many plaintiffs allege that the amounts they inhaled when they dusted themselves with tainted talcum powder were enough.

The evidence of what J&J knew has surfaced after people who suspected that talc caused their cancers hired lawyers experienced in the decades-long deluge of litigation involving workers exposed to asbestos. Some of the lawyers knew from those earlier cases that talc producers tested for asbestos, and they began demanding J&J's testing documentation.

What J&J produced in response to those demands has allowed plaintiffs' lawyers to refine their argument: The culprit wasn't necessarily talc itself, but also asbestos in the talc. That assertion, backed by decades of solid science showing that asbestos causes mesothelioma and is associated with ovarian and other cancers, has had mixed success in court.

In two cases earlier this year - in New Jersey and California - juries awarded big sums to plaintiffs who, like Coker, blamed asbestos-tainted J&J talc products for their mesothelioma.

A third verdict, in St. Louis, was a watershed, broadening J&J's potential liability: The 22 plaintiffs were the first to succeed with a claim that asbestos-tainted Baby Powder and Shower to Shower talc, a longtime brand the company sold in 2012, caused ovarian cancer, which is much more common than mesothelioma. The jury awarded them $4.69 billion in damages. Most of the talc cases have been brought by women with ovarian cancer who say they regularly used J&J talc products as a perineal antiperspirant and deodorant.

At the same time, at least three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs' mesothelioma. Others have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.

""JUNK"" SCIENCE

J&J has said it will appeal the recent verdicts against it. It has maintained in public statements that its talc is safe, as shown for years by the best tests available, and that the information it has been required to divulge in recent litigation shows the care the company takes to ensure its products are asbestos-free. It has blamed its losses on juror confusion, ""junk"" science, unfair court rules and overzealous lawyers looking for a fresh pool of asbestos plaintiffs.

""Plaintiffs' attorneys out for personal financial gain are distorting historical documents and intentionally creating confusion in the courtroom and in the media,"" Ernie Knewitz, J&J's vice president of global media relations, wrote in an emailed response to Reuters' findings. ""This is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer. Any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.""

J&J declined to comment further for this article. For more than two months, it turned down repeated requests for an interview with J&J executives. On Dec. 8, the company offered to make an expert available. It had not done so as of Thursday evening.

The company referred all inquiries to its outside litigation counsel, Peter Bicks. In emailed responses, Bicks rejected Reuters' findings as ""false and misleading."" ""The scientific consensus is that the talc used in talc-based body powders does not cause cancer, regardless of what is in that talc,"" Bicks wrote. ""This is true even if - and it does not - Johnson & Johnson's cosmetic talc had ever contained minute, undetectable amounts of asbestos."" He dismissed tests cited in this article as ""outlier"" results.

In court, J&J lawyers have told jurors that company records showing that asbestos was detected in its talc referred to talc intended for industrial use. Other records, they have argued, referred to non-asbestos forms of the same minerals that their experts say are harmless. J&J has also argued that some tests picked up ""background"" asbestos - stray fibers that could have contaminated samples after floating into a mill or lab from a vehicle clutch or fraying insulation.

The company has made some of the same arguments about lab tests conducted by experts hired by plaintiffs. One of those labs found asbestos in Shower to Shower talc from the 1990s, according to an Aug. 11, 2017, court report. Another lab found asbestos in more than half of multiple samples of Baby Powder from past decades - in bottles from plaintiffs' cupboards and acquired from eBay, and even a 1978 bottle held in J&J's corporate museum. The concentrations were great enough that users ""would have, more likely than not, been exposed,"" the plaintiffs' lab report presented in several cases this year concluded.

Matthew Sanchez, a geologist with consultants RJ Lee Group Inc and a frequent expert witness for J&J, dismissed those findings in testimony in the St. Louis trial: ""I have not found asbestos in any of the current or modern, what I consider modern, Johnson & Johnson talc products,"" Sanchez told the jury. Sanchez did not return calls seeking comment. RJ Lee said it does not comment on the work it does for clients.

Since 2003, talc in Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys Talc America, a unit of Paris-based Imerys SA and a co-defendant in most of the talc litigation. Imerys and J&J said the Chinese talc is safe. An Imerys spokesman said the company's tests ""consistently show no asbestos. Talc's safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies.""

J&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, its sales outpacing those of all competitors combined, according to Euromonitor International data. And while talc products contributed just $420 million to J&J's $76.5 billion in revenue last year, Baby Powder is considered an essential facet of the healthcare-products maker's carefully tended image as a caring company - a ""sacred cow,"" as one 2003 internal email put it.

""When people really understand what's going on, I think it increases J&J's exposure a thousand-fold,"" said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers for the women in the St. Louis case.

The mounting controversy surrounding J&J talc hasn't shaken investors. The share price is up about 6 percent so far this year. Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against J&J, based on the company's Aug. 2 quarterly report, in which the company said it believed it had ""strong grounds on appeal.""

J&J Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has pledged to fight on, telling analysts in July: ""We remain confident that our products do not contain asbestos.""

Gorsky's comment, echoed in countless J&J statements, misses a crucial point. Asbestos, like many environmental carcinogens, has a long latency period. Diagnosis usually comes years after initial exposure - 20 years or longer for mesothelioma. J&J talc products today may be safe, but the talc at issue in thousands of lawsuits was sold and used over the past 60 years.

""SAFETY FIRST""

In 1886, Robert Wood Johnson enlisted his younger brothers in an eponymous startup built around the ""Safety First"" motto. Johnson's Baby Powder grew out of a line of medicated plasters, sticky rubber strips loaded with mustard and other home remedies. When customers complained of skin irritation, the brothers sent packets of talc.

Soon, mothers began applying the talc to infants' diaper-chafed skin. The Johnsons took note. They added a fragrance that would become one of the most recognizable in the world, sifted the talc into tin boxes and, in 1893, began selling it as Johnson's Baby Powder.

In the late 1950s, J&J discovered that talc from its chief source mine for the U.S. market in the Italian Alps contained tremolite. That's one of six minerals - along with chrysotile, actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite and crocidolite - that occur in nature as crystalline fibers known as asbestos, a recognized carcinogen. Some of them, including tremolite, also occur as unremarkable ""non-asbestiform"" rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits.

J&J's worry at the time was that contaminants made the company's powder abrasive. It sent tons of its Italian talc to a private lab in Columbus, Ohio, to find ways to improve the appearance, feel and purity of the powder by removing as much ""grit"" as possible. In a pair of reports from 1957 and 1958, the lab said the talc contained ""from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of contaminants,"" described as mostly fibrous and ""acicular"" tremolite.

Most of the authors of these and other J&J records cited in this article are dead. Sanchez, the RJ Lee geologist whose firm has agreed to provide him as a witness in up to 100 J&J talc trials, has testified that tremolite found decades ago in the company's talc, from Italy and later Vermont, was not tremolite asbestos at all. Rather, he has said, it was ""cleavage fragments"" from non-asbestiform tremolite.

J&J's original records don't always make that distinction. In terms of health risk, regulators since the early 1970s have treated small fiber-shaped particles of both forms the same.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for example, ""makes no distinction between fibers and (comparable) cleavage fragments,"" agency officials wrote in a response to an RJ Lee report on an unrelated matter in 2006, the year before the firm hired Sanchez. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), though it dropped the non-fibrous forms of the minerals from its definition of asbestos in 1992, nonetheless recommends that fiber-shaped fragments indistinguishable from asbestos be counted in its exposure tests.

And as the product safety director for J&J's talc supplier acknowledged in a 2008 email to colleagues: ""(I)f a deposit contains 'non-asbestiform' tremolite, there is also asbestiform tremolite naturally present as well.""

""THE LUNGS OF BABIES""

In 1964, J&J's Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary bought a cluster of talc mines in Vermont, with names like Argonaut, Rainbow, Frostbite and Black Bear. By 1966, it was blasting and bulldozing white rock out of the Green Mountain state. J&J used the milled powder in its cosmetic powders and sold a less-refined grade to roofing, flooring and tire companies for use in manufacturing.

Ten years after tremolite turned up in the Italian talc, it showed up in Vermont talc, too. In 1967, J&J found traces of tremolite and another mineral that can occur as asbestos, according to a table attached to a Nov. 1, 1967, memo by William Ashton, the executive in charge of J&J's talc supply for decades.

J&J continued to search for sources of clean talc. But in an April 9, 1969, memo to a company doctor, Ashton said it was ""normal"" to find tremolite in many U.S. talc deposits. He suggested J&J rethink its approach. ""Historically, in our Company, Tremolite has been bad,"" Ashton wrote. ""How bad is Tremolite medically, and how much of it can safely be in a talc base we might develop?""

Since pulmonary disease, including cancer, appeared to be on the rise, ""it would seem to be prudent to limit any possible content of Tremolite ... to an absolute minimum,"" came the reply from another physician executive days later.

The doctor told Ashton that J&J was receiving safety questions from pediatricians. Even Robert Wood Johnson II, the founder's son and then-retired CEO, had expressed ""concern over the possibility of the adverse effects on the lungs of babies or mothers,"" he wrote.

""We have replied,"" the doctor wrote, that ""we would not regard the usage of our powders as presenting any hazard."" Such assurances would be impossible, he added, ""if we do include Tremolite in more than unavoidable trace amounts.""

The memo is the earliest J&J document reviewed by Reuters that discusses tremolite as more than a scratchy nuisance. The doctor urged Ashton to consult with company lawyers because ""it is not inconceivable that we could become involved in litigation.""

NEVER ""100% CLEAN""

By the early 1970s, asbestos was widely recognized as the primary cause of mesothelioma among workers involved in producing it and in industries that used it in their products.

Regulation was in the air. In 1972, President Richard Nixon's newly created OSHA issued its first rule, setting limits on workplace exposure to asbestos dust.

By then, a team at Mount Sinai Medical Center led by pre-eminent asbestos researcher Irving Selikoff had started looking at talcum powders as a possible solution to a puzzle: Why were tests of lung tissue taken post mortem from New Yorkers who never worked with asbestos finding signs of the mineral? Since talc deposits are often laced with asbestos, the scientists reasoned, perhaps talcum powders played a role.

They shared their preliminary findings with New York City's environmental protection chief, Jerome Kretchmer. On June 29, 1971, Kretchmer informed the Nixon administration and called a press conference to announce that two unidentified brands of cosmetic talc appeared to contain asbestos.

The FDA opened an inquiry. J&J issued a statement: ""Our fifty years of research knowledge in this area indicates that there is no asbestos contained in the powder manufactured by Johnson & Johnson.""

Later that year, another Mount Sinai researcher, mineralogist Arthur Langer, told J&J in a letter that the team had found a ""relatively small"" amount of chrysotile asbestos in Baby Powder.

Langer, Selikoff and Kretchmer ended up on a J&J list of ""antagonistic personalities"" in a Nov. 29, 1972, memo, which described Selikoff as the leader of an ""attack on talc.""

""I suppose I was antagonistic,"" Langer told Reuters. Even so, in a subsequent test of J&J powders in 1976, he didn't find asbestos - a result that Mount Sinai announced.

Langer said he told J&J lawyers who visited him last year that he stood by all of his findings. J&J has not called him as a witness.

Selikoff died in 1992. Kretchmer said he recently read that a jury had concluded that Baby Powder was contaminated with asbestos. ""I said to myself, 'How come it took so long?' "" he said.

In July 1971, meanwhile, J&J sent a delegation of scientists to Washington to talk to the FDA officials looking into asbestos in talcum powders. According to an FDA account of the meeting, J&J shared ""evidence that their talc contains less than 1%, if any, asbestos.""

Later that month, Wilson Nashed, one of the J&J scientists who visited the FDA, said in a memo to the company's public relations department that J&J's talc contained trace amounts of ""fibrous minerals (tremolite/actinolite).""

""INCONTROVERTIBLE ASBESTOS""

As the FDA continued to investigate asbestos in talc, J&J sent powder samples to be tested at private and university labs. Though a private lab in Chicago found trace amounts of tremolite, it declared the amount ""insignificant"" and the samples ""substantially free of asbestiform material."" J&J reported that finding to the FDA under a cover letter that said the ""results clearly show"" the samples tested ""contain no chrysotile asbestos."" J&J's lawyer told Reuters the tremolite found in the samples was not asbestos.

But J&J's FDA submission left out University of Minnesota professor Thomas E. Hutchinson's finding of chrysotile in a Shower to Shower sample - ""incontrovertible asbestos,"" as he described it in a lab note.

The FDA's own examinations found no asbestos in J&J powder samples in the 1f970s. Those tests, however, did not use the most sensitive detection methods. An early test, for example, was incapable of detecting chrysotile fibers, as an FDA official recognized in a J&J account of an Aug. 11, 1972, meeting with the agency: ""I understand that some samples will be passed even though they contain such fibers, but we are willing to live with it.""

By 1973, Tom Shelley, director of J&J's Central Research Laboratories in New Jersey, was looking into acquiring patents on a process that a British mineralogist and J&J consultant was developing to separate talc from tremolite.

""It is quite possible that eventually tremolite will be prohibited in all talc,"" Shelley wrote on Feb. 20, 1973, to a British colleague. Therefore, he added, the ""process may well be valuable property to us.""

At the end of March, Shelley recognized the sensitivity of the plan in a memo sent to a J&J lawyer in New Jersey: ""We will want to carefully consider the ... patents re asbestos in talc. It's quite possible that we may wish to keep the whole thing confidential rather than allow it to be published in patent form and thus let the whole world know.""

J&J did not obtain the patents.

While Shelley was looking into the patents, J&J research director DeWitt Petterson visited the company's Vermont mining operation. ""Occasionally, sub-trace quantities of tremolite or actinolite are identifiable,"" he wrote in an April 1973 report on the visit. ""And these might be classified as asbestos fiber.""

J&J should ""protect our powder franchise"" by eliminating as many tiny fibers that can be inhaled in airborn talc dust as possible, Petterson wrote. He warned, however, that ""no final product will ever be made which will be totally free from respirable particles."" Introducing a cornstarch version of Baby Powder, he noted, ""is obviously another answer.""

Bicks told Reuters that J&J believes that the tremolite and actinolite Petterson cited were not asbestos.

Cornstarch came up again in a March 5, 1974, report in which Ashton, the J&J talc supply chief, recommended that the company research that alternative ""for defensive reasons"" because ""the thrust against talc has centered primarily on biological problems alleged to result from the inhalation of talc and related mineral particles.""

""WE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS""

A few months after Petterson's recognition that talc purity was a pipe dream, the FDA proposed a rule that talc used in drugs contain no more than 0.1 percent asbestos. While the agency's cosmetics division was considering similar action on talcum powders, it asked companies to suggest testing methods.

At the time, J&J's Baby Powder franchise was consuming 20,000 tons of Vermont talc a year. J&J pressed the FDA to approve an X-ray scanning technique that a company scientist said in an April 1973 memo allowed for ""an automatic 1% tolerance for asbestos."" That would mean talc with up to 10 times the FDA's proposed limit for asbestos in drugs could pass muster.

The same scientist confided in an Oct. 23, 1973, note to a colleague that, depending on what test the FDA adopted for detecting asbestos in cosmetic talc, ""we may have problems.""

The best way to detect asbestos in talc was to concentrate the sample and then examine it through microscopes, the Colorado School of Mines Research Institute told J&J in a Dec. 27, 1973, report. In a memo, a J&J lab supervisor said the concentration technique, which the company's own researchers had earlier used to identify a ""tremolite-type"" asbestos in Vermont talc, had one limitation: ""It may be too sensitive.""

In his email to Reuters, J&J's lawyer said the lab supervisor's concern was that the test would result in ""false positives,"" showing asbestos where there was none.

J&J also launched research to find out how much powder a baby was exposed to during a diapering and how much asbestos could be in that powder and remain within OSHA's new workplace exposure limits. Its researchers had strapped an air sampling device to a doll to take measurements while it was powdered, according to J&J memos and the minutes of a Feb. 19, 1974, meeting of the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA), an industry group.

""It was calculated that even if talc were pure asbestos the levels of exposure of a baby during a normal powdering are far below the accepted tolerance limits,"" the minutes state.

In a Sept. 6, 1974, letter, J&J told the FDA that since ""a substantial safety factor can be expected"" with talc that contains 1 percent asbestos, ""methods capable of determining less than 1% asbestos in talc are not necessary to assure the safety of cosmetic talc.""

Not everyone at the FDA thought that basing a detection method on such a calculation was a good idea. One official called it ""foolish,"" adding, according to a J&J account of a February 1975 meeting: ""No mother was going to powder her baby with 1% of a known carcinogen irregardless of the large safety factor.""

PUSH FOR SELF-REGULATION

Having failed to persuade the FDA that up to 1 percent asbestos contamination was tolerable, J&J began promoting self-policing as an alternative to regulation. The centerpiece of this approach was a March 15, 1976, package of letters from J&J and other manufacturers that the CTFA gave to the agency to show that they had succeeded at eliminating asbestos from cosmetic talc.

""The attached letters demonstrate responsibility of industry in monitoring its talcs,"" the cover letter said. ""We are certain that the summary will give you assurance as to the freedom from contamination by asbestos for materials of cosmetic talc products.""

In its letter, J&J said samples of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 were tested for asbestos, and none was detected ""in any sample.""

J&J didn't tell the FDA about a 1974 test by a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire that turned up asbestos in talc from J&J - ""fiberform"" actinolite, as he put it. Nor did the company tell the FDA about a 1975 report from its longtime lab that found particles identified as ""asbestos fibers"" in five of 17 samples of talc from the chief source mine for Baby Powder. ""Some of them seem rather high,"" the private lab wrote in its cover letter.

Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said the contract lab's results were irrelevant because the talc was intended for industrial use. He said the company now believes that the actinolite the Dartmouth professor found ""was not asbestiform,"" based on its interpretation of a photo in the original lab report.

Just two months after the Dartmouth professor reported his findings, Windsor Minerals Research and Development Manager Vernon Zeitz wrote that chrysotile, ""fibrous anthophyllite"" and other types of asbestos had been ""found in association with the Hammondsville ore body"" - the Vermont deposit that supplied Baby Powder talc for more than two decades.

Zeitz's May 1974 report on efforts to minimize asbestos in Vermont talc ""strongly urged"" the adoption of ways to protect ""against what are currently considered to be materials presenting a severe health hazard and are potentially present in all talc ores in use at this time.""

Bicks said that Zeitz was not reporting on actual test results.

The following year, Zeitz reported that based on weekly tests of talc samples over six months, ""it can be stated with a greater than 99.9% certainty that the ores and materials produced from the ores at all Windsor Mineral locations are free from asbestos or asbestiform minerals.""

""MISREPRESENTATION BY OMISSION""

J&J's selective use of test results figured in a New Jersey judge's decision this year to affirm the first verdict against the company in a case claiming asbestos in J&J products caused cancer. ""Providing the FDA favorable results showing no asbestos and withholding or failing to provide unfavorable results, which show asbestos, is a form of a misrepresentation by omission,"" Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Ana Viscomi said in her June ruling.

""J&J respectfully disagrees with the Judge's comments,"" Bicks said. ""J&J did not withhold any relevant testing from FDA.""

The FDA declined to comment on the ruling.

Lacking consensus on testing methods, the FDA postponed action to limit asbestos in talc. Years later, it did set limits on asbestos in talc used in drugs. It has never limited asbestos in cosmetic talc or established a preferred method for detecting it.

Instead, in 1976, a CTFA committee chaired by a J&J executive drafted voluntary guidelines, establishing a form of X-ray scanning with a 0.5 percent detection limit as the primary test, the method J&J preferred. The method is not designed to detect the most commonly used type of asbestos, chrysotile, at all. The group said the more sensitive electron microscopy was impractical.

The CTFA, which now does business as the Personal Care Products Council, declined to comment.

X-ray scanning is the primary method J&J has used for decades. The company also periodically requires the more sensitive checks with electron microscopes. J&J's lawyer said the company's tests exceed the trade association standard, and they do. He also said that today, J&J's X-ray scans can detect suspect minerals at levels as low as 0.1 percent of a sample.

But the company never adopted the Colorado lab's 1973 recommendation that samples be concentrated before examination under a microscope. And the talc samples that were subjected to the most sensitive electron microscopy test were a tiny fraction of what was sold. For those and other reasons, J&J couldn't guarantee its Baby Powder was asbestos-free when plaintiffs used it, according to experts, including some who testified for plaintiffs.

As early as 1976, Ashton, J&J's longtime talc overseer, recognized as much in a memo to colleagues. He wrote that talc in general, if subjected to the most sensitive testing method, using concentrated samples, ""will be hard pressed in supporting purity claims."" He described this sort of testing as both ""sophisticated"" and ""disturbing.""

""FREE OF HAZARD""

By 1977, J&J appeared to have tamped down concerns about the safety of talc. An internal August report on J&J's ""Defense of Talc Safety"" campaign noted that independent authorities had deemed cosmetic talc products to be ""free of hazard."" It attributed ""this growing opinion"" to the dissemination to scientific and medical communities in the United States and Britain of ""favorable data from the various J&J sponsored studies.""

In 1984, FDA cosmetics chief and former J&J employee Heinz Eiermann reiterated that view. He told the New York Times that the agency's investigation a decade earlier had prompted the industry to ensure that talc was asbestos-free. ""So in subsequent analyses,"" he told the paper, ""we really could not identify asbestos or only on very rare occasions.""

Two years later, the FDA rejected a citizen request that cosmetic talc carry an asbestos warning label, saying that even if there were trace contamination, the use of talc powder during two years of normal diapering would not increase the risk of cancer.

In 1980, J&J began offering a cornstarch version of Baby Powder - to expand its customer base to people who prefer cornstarch, the company says.

The persistence of the industry's view that cosmetic talc is asbestos-free is why no studies have been conducted on the incidence of mesothelioma among users of the products. It's also partly why regulations that protect people in mines, mills, factories and schools from asbestos-laden talc don't apply to babies and others exposed to cosmetic talc - even though Baby Powder talc has at times come from the same mines as talc sold for industrial use. J&J says cosmetic talc is more thoroughly processed and thus purer than industrial talc.

Until recently, the American Cancer Society (ACS) accepted the industry's position, saying on its website: ""All talcum products used in homes have been asbestos-free since the 1970s.""

After receiving inquiries from Reuters, the ACS in early December revised its website to remove the assurance that cosmetic talcs are free of asbestos. Now, it says, quoting the industry's standards, that all cosmetic talc products in the United States ""should be free from detectable amounts of asbestos.""

The revised ACS web page also notes that the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc that contains asbestos as ""carcinogenic to humans.""

Despite the success of J&J's efforts to promote the safety of its talc, the company's test lab found asbestos fibers in samples taken from the Vermont operation in 1984, 1985 and 1986. Bicks said: ""The samples that we know of during this time period that contained a fiber or two of asbestos were not cosmetic talc samples.""

Then, in 1992, three years after J&J sold its Vermont mines, the new owner, Cyprus Minerals, said in an internal report on ""important environmental issues"" in its talc reserves that there was ""past tremolite"" in the Hammondsville deposit. Hammondsville was the primary source of Baby Powder talc from 1966 until its shutdown in 1990.

Bicks rejected the Cyprus report as hearsay, saying there is no original documentation to confirm it. Hammondsville mine records, according to a 1993 J&J memo, ""were destroyed by the mine management staff just prior to the J&J divestiture.""

Bicks said the destroyed documents did not include talc testing records.

In 2002 and 2003, Vermont mine operators found chrysotile asbestos fibers on several occasions in talc produced for Baby Powder sold in Canada. In each case, a single fiber was recorded - a finding deemed ""BDL"" - below detection limit. Bicks described the finding as ""background asbestos"" that did not come from any talc source.

In 2009, the FDA, responding to growing public concern about talc, commissioned tests on 34 samples, including a bottle of J&J Baby Powder and samples of Imerys talc from China. No asbestos was detected.

FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency continues to receive a lot of questions about talc cosmetics. ""I recognize the concern,"" he told Reuters. He said the agency's policing of cosmetics in general - fewer than 30 people regulating a ""vast"" industry - was ""a place where we think we can be doing more.""

Gottlieb said the FDA planned to host a public forum in early 2019 to ""look at how we would develop standards for evaluating any potential risk."" An agency spokeswoman said that would include examining ""scientific test methods for assessment of asbestos.""

""FISHING EXPEDITION""

Before law school, Herschel Hobson worked at a rubber plant. There, his job included ensuring that asbestos in talc the workers were exposed to didn't exceed OSHA limits.

That's why he zeroed in on Johnson's Baby Powder after he took on Darlene Coker as a client in 1997. The lawsuit Coker and her husband, Roy, filed that year against J&J in Jefferson County District Court in Beaumont, Texas, is the earliest Reuters found alleging Baby Powder caused cancer.

Hobson asked J&J for any research it had into the health of its mine workers; talc production records from the mid-1940s through the 1980s; depositions from managers of three labs that tested talc for J&J; and any documents related to testing for fibrous or asbestiform materials.

J&J objected. Hobson's ""fishing expedition"" would not turn up any relevant evidence, it asserted in a May 6, 1998, motion. In fact, among the thousands of documents Hobson's request could have turned up was a letter J&J lawyers had received only weeks earlier from a Rutgers University geologist confirming that she had found asbestos in the company's Baby Powder, identified in her 1991 published study as tremolite ""asbestos"" needles.

Hobson agreed to postpone his discovery demands until he got the pathology report on Coker's lung tissue. Before it came in, J&J asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that Coker had ""no evidence"" Baby Powder caused mesothelioma.

Ten days later, the pathology report landed: Coker's lung tissue contained tens of thousands of ""long fibers"" of four different types of asbestos. The findings were ""consistent with exposure to talc containing chrysotile and tremolite contamination,"" the report concluded.

""The asbestos fibers found raise a new issue of fact,"" Hobson told the judge in a request for more time to file an opposition to J&J's dismissal motion. The judge gave him more time but turned down his request to resume discovery.

Without evidence from J&J and no hope of ever getting any, Hobson advised Coker to drop the suit.

Hobson is still practicing law in Nederland, Texas. When Reuters told him about the evidence that had emerged in recent litigation, he said: ""They knew what the problems were, and they hid it."" J&J's records would have made a ""100% difference"" in Coker's case.

Had the information about asbestos in J&J's talc come out earlier, he said, ""maybe there would have been 20 years less exposure"" for other people.

Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said Coker dropped her case because ""the discovery established that J&J talc had nothing to do with Plaintiff's disease, and that asbestos exposure from a commercial or occupational setting was the likely cause.""

Coker never learned why she had mesothelioma. She did beat the odds, though. Most patients die within a year of diagnosis. Coker held on long enough to see her two grandchildren. She died in 2009, 12 years after her diagnosis, at age 63.

Coker's daughter Crystal Deckard was 5 when her sister, Cady, was born in 1971. Deckard remembers seeing the white bottle of Johnson's Baby Powder on the changing table where her mother diapered her new sister.

""When Mom was given this death sentence, she was the same age as I am right now,"" Deckard said. ""I have it in the back of my mind all the time. Could it happen to us? Me? My sister?"""

Passing a 43-page order, the tribunal said it is well within its ambit concerning ""merits"" and ""maintainability"" in hearing the appeal, filed by the company challenging the closure of the plant. Earlier, the state government had challenged the 'maintainability' of the appeal before the NGT and the apex court. The SC directed the tribunal to pass necessary orders. The Saturday order of NGT also sought to accept the recommendations of the 3-member panel appointed by it - that suggested measures to be taken and implemented by the company, in case NGT directs Sterlite to recommence operations. In addition to that, NGT also accepted Sterlite's offer to invest Rs100 crore for carrying out social welfare measures including maintaining schools and hospitals and other CSR activities. It directed the company to spend the said amount in three years.

The tribunal also directed Sterlite ""to create a dedicated and interactive website"" with participatory ""Public Forum"" wherein affected stakeholders can lodge their environment related grievance for time bound redressal and disposal by the unit. The website should be widely publicized and have links with the websites of the district administration, TNPCB and CPCB, which shall be the oversight body to monitor such public grievances and their timely disposal.

While directing the company to monitor the ground water quality as mandated by TNPCB and upload the data in comprehensible form without fail on the website, the failure of timely analysis and uploading will result in the company paying an environmental compensation of Rs10 lakh for every default with the District Legal Services, which will maintain a separate account for the same. Sterlite was also directed to deposit Rs2.5 crore as a token amount for liabilities arising out of inappropriate handling of 3.5 lakh tonnes of copper slag."

Chikara, a Class 12 student at Mother Khazani Convent School in Bawana -- from where the question paper was leaked -- rushed to her house and switched on the television.

""It was all over the news. It was my school. They were my teachers. How did this happen?"" recalled Chikara, adding that the incident took place on her first day of Class 12.

Though Chikara's batch has been allowed to appear for the Board exam to be held in 2019 along with the batch currently pursuing Class 10 from the school, the future of around 1,700 students studying in other classes is ""uncertain"". Reason: the school was de-affiliated by the CBSE after the paper leaked from its premises on March 26.

According to the police, the two teachers had opened the sealed question papers, took photos on their mobile phones and shared them with a tutor in a private coaching centre in Bawana. Later, the school principal was also arrested in connection with the case. The school had approached the Delhi high court against the board's decision. However, it has not received any relief from the court as of now and the matter is sub judice. The next hearing is scheduled on Monday.

Dalbeer Singh, the vice-chairperson of the school, said that as many as 660 students have left the school after the incident. ""The strength of our school has come down from 2,375 to 1,715 in the last seven months. There is a mass exodus from Class 11. Around 50% of students have left after Class 10 this year. There is a sense of uncertainty over the

existence of the school among parents of students studying up to Class 8 and those in Class 10 because they will have to shift to some other school if we do not get a stay from the high court,"" he said.

For Deepanshu Dahiya, a Class 10 student, even the idea of switching schools is ""terrifying"". ""I am studying here in since

Class 5. All my friends and teachers are here. My parents have started shortlisting schools for me but I don't think I will be able to adjust anywhere else easily,"" he said.

Similarly, 13-year-old Palak Rana, a class 8 student at the school, said, ""I have been studying in this school since nursery. Why do I need to suffer because of the deeds of two teachers who are no more a part of our school?"" she said.

Amid the paper leaks, the arrests, the de-affiliation and the court case, the students are the ones who have suffered the most, said Sanjay Singh, Economics teacher at the school. Police had said the two teachers had allegedly shared the leaked paper with their students as well. But Singh denied the claim.

""It's not that the result of our students was bad. The highest score in Economics in 2016-17 was 96% and the overall pass percentage was 90. None of our students had seen the paper before their exam. I don't understand who those teachers were trying to help,"" he said.

Officials said that the school is known for sports activities. ""Our Class 12 student Mohit Jhangra plays for the Under 19 India team which recently won the World Cup. Our students are known for contributions in football and kabbadi. The CBSE held its All India Kabaddi Tournament at our campus in 2016. We have grounds and space for every sport here. If the school loses the affiliation, all this would have been in vain,"" said Dalbeer Singh.

While officials of CBSE denied comment saying that the matter is ""sub judice"", those at the Delhi government's Directorate of Education (DoE) said that they are looking into the matter. ""The directorate had issued a show cause notice to which a reply has been received. An inquiry is underway,"" said a DoE official.

Meanwhile, Singh said that if the school gets a stay from the court, it will never apply for the board examination centre again. ""We can't revert whatever has already happened here. Because of two persons, the future of around 1,700 students and 100 teaching and non-teaching staff members are at stake. We, too, are apprehensive about being an examination centre again. I hope that those who did the crime are punished and the students spared,"" he said."

IN PUNE , set up by Capt Anil Gadgil in Pune in memory of his son Flt Lt Abhijit Gadgil, who was killed in a MiG-21 crash in 2001, has won the prestigious Flight Simulation Medal 2018 awarded by the Royal Aeronautical Society, London.

While the news may have been lost in the haze of recent assembly elections and the controversial SC order on Rafale deal, the award is a recognition of a long struggle by Capt Anil Gadgil and his wife Kavita to wake the government up to the dangers posed to pilots' life by the ageing fleet of MiGs that had earned the unfortunate monicker ""flying coffins"" in the late 1990s.

While Kavita Gadgil's relentless campaign against MiGs led the then National Democratic Alliance government to start fixing/phasing out MiGs, Capt Anil Gadgil channeled his grief to set up Jeet Aerospace Institute on a piece of family land near Khadakwasla in 2006. The institute, which has India's only mobile , has since trained more than 460 pilots, a feat recognised by Royal Aeronautical Society.

Capt Gadgil is the first Indian to be honoured with the Flight Simulation Medal and he now stands in some august company -Wright Brothers were one of the earliest recipients of a medal from Royal Aeronautical Society.

The Gadgils, who returned to Pune last week from London, where Capt Gadgil was honoured, remember 2001 like it was yesterday. They could have easily let grief take over their lives. But the fact that those in power tried to portray the MiG crash that killed their son as an error on his part spurred the couple to launch a campaign that has made the skies safer for young pilots.

On an average, eight to ten MiGs crashed every year in the late 90s and early 2000. The Gadgils were not going to let their son take the rap for machines that were not fit to fly.

On July 26, 2003, Kavita famously broke the security cordon in Mumbai to handover a memorandum to the then Defence Minister George Fernandes raising questions over the alarming rate of fatal accidents involving MiG planes. Several newspapers ran the picture of Kavita thrusting the file - which also carried a letter from Air Force blaming Flt Lt Abhijit Gadgil's ""spatial disorientation"" for his MiG-21 crash -- into the hands of Fernandes as he arrived to participate in a programme commemorating the Kargil Vijay Divas. It deeply embarrassed the government. She later also met the then , who promised to look into the issue.

In March 2005, Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal S P Tyagi wrote to the Gadgils stating that while a court of inquiry had established spatial disorientation as the probable cause of the crash, it was triggered by a technical malfunction and that Flt Lt Abhijit Gadgil could not be blamed for it.

Though Tyagi's letter brought a sense of closure to the family and the government began a programme to phase out MiGs, the Gadgils felt their good fight would not be complete if it did not establish something long-term. That is when the couple decided to establish Jeet Aerospace Institute.

Capt Anil Gadgil, a veteran of the Bangladesh liberation war who had joined Air-India after retirement, quit the national carrier in 2006 and began work on setting up Jeet Aerospace Institute. The couple felt it would be a perfect memorial for their son.

While the Indian government is yet to take note of Capt Gadgil's effort, the Royal Aeronautical Society has recognised Jeet Aerospace Institute's ""significant long term contribution, in an international context, in the field of flight simulation.""

The citation says that ""Captain Gadgil's achievement is an inspiring illustration of how effective low-cost simulation can be in outreach and recruitment, particularly in a region where the potential growth of aviation is projected to outstrip the means of providing sufficient trained people to meet the demand.""

India is tipped to become the third largest aviation market in the world behind China and the US by 2020, and the demand for trained pilots far outstrips supply already.

But commercial considerations were never the focus for the Gadgils. ""Anil still had about five years of service to go in Air India, but he decided that if he had to take Jeet Aerospace forward, he will have to do it when he still had the energy,"" says Kavita, whose campaign against MiGs inspired the 2006 block-buster Rang De Basanti.

The Gadgils had a one-acre land parcel about 5 km from Khadakwasla Dam and 16 km from Pune city on Sinhagad Road. They set up a non-profit trust Abhijit Air Safety Foundation with scientist Dr R A Mashelkar and journalist Kumar Ketkar and set up Jeet Aerospace Institute under its aegis. They built a small house, couple of classrooms, and a hangar to station the mobile simulator.

""We approached Tata Motors donation committee with our idea of an indigenously built mobile simulator and they donated a 12-tonne truck chassis. Pune's Arco Engineering built the truck, while the simulator was built by RealiSim company in Bengaluru as per Capt Gadgil's specifications,"" She said. NCP leader and the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel inaugurated the simulator on November 3, 2007. In 2008, the aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation approved the institute and licensed the courses.

Jeet Aerospace Institute offers four different courses for aspiring pilots including a ""bridge"" course which enables pilots to graduate to more advanced courses and airplanes. Capt Gadgil has used his 40 years of flying experience to put together the course material.

The project has cost nearly Rs 2 crore and most of the money has been raised by the Gadgils themselves. ""My elder son Kedar donated Rs 25 lakh. For me, the young pilots who come from all over India are like my own Abhijit and we share strong emotional bonds with them even after they leave,"" she said.

Apart from the regular courses, the Gadgils throw open the facility to anyone curious about flying. Students from nearby schools and colleges visit the institute to experience the simulator.

""The aviation sector in India is growing and trained pilots are in great demand. I wish I had built more such simulators, but our resources are limited. We can only hope that the simulator serves as a model and our government takes this forward by getting manufacturers interested in building indigenous simulators like ours,"" said Capt Gadgil."

When the party cornered the state government over Vyapam scam, took up the cudgels against the Election Commission over fake voters and worked overnight to keep its thin majority intact on the day of counting, it was senior lawyer Vivek Tankha who worked diligently to ensure his party remained at the top of the game.

Tankha was there even when the Congress fulfilled its mission MP while staking claim to form the government on December 12.

Deputed as member of election campaign committee and vice chairman of the manifesto committee, Tankha is among the few Congressmen who have maintained cordial relations with every faction of the party in Madhya Pradesh, including the Gandhis.

Counted among top lawyers of the country, Tankha was instrumental in ensuring Vyapam scam got its due importance in the courtrooms while representing the whistle-blowers related to the case. It was Tankha who ensured that these whistle-blowers, including Ashish Chaturvedi, Dr Aanad Rai and Prashant Pandey, met Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi.

A go-to man for the party this assembly election, the Rajya Sabha member was again at the forefront when Congress took on the Election Commission, alleging there were as many as 60 lakh fake voters in Madhya Pradesh. He also represented MPCC president and now CM designate Kamal Nath and filed petition with the Supreme Court over the bogus voters.

As the chairman of Congress' legal cell, Tankha was again at the forefront when the party hosted senior lawyers of high courts and the Supreme Court for 'Vidhik Vimarsh' in Jabalpur in April. This legal conclave was also the time when the party's top brass came down heavily on the Centre for 'persistent attacks' on democratic institutions.

Meanwhile, the battle of assembly polls had gone down to the wire on December 11 after the BJP and Congress got locked in a seesaw battle, with the latter leading by a margin of five seats only and over two dozen seats facing uncertain results.

During election results too, when the party was locked in a seesaw battle with the BJP and senior leaders Digvijaya Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Kamal Nath had locked themselves in the PCC building for almost seven hours, Tankha was right there, helping them save the day with his overnight vigil that ensured the Congress maintained its thin lead the next morning.

Leading a team of lawyers the same night, Tankha also helped the Congress candidates embattle tough 30 seats with the crucial advices. The collective efforts bore fruits when the MPCC head Kamal Nath appeared before the media at around 3am and announced that the party has secured majority with the help of allies.

With numbers in their favour, party seniors along with Tankha had handed over a letter to MP governor Anandiben Patel on December 12 about the formation of government and the list of MLA and allies.

Not just this, Tankha also kept the pressure mounted on the BJP, both in MP and nationally, with his stinging posts on Twitter over political developments.

The Jabalpur-based senior lawyer was sent to Rajya Sabha by the Congress in 2016 and proved to be an asset on a number of occasions, including in cases of dismissal of Harish Rawat government in Uttarakhand and later in the same instance in Arunachal Pradesh in 2016 when Congress rebels tried to topple incumbent governments and the Centre chose to impose President rule.

Son of RK Tankha, who was a judge in MP high court, Tankhas are Kashmiri pandits who migrated and settled in Jabalpur post independence. Tankhas always were close to Nehru-Gandhi family and those close to them claim they were never asked to seek a meeting appointment with the Gandhis. While his father was close to former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Arjun Singh, Vivek Tankha enjoys proximity with former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh and also maintains cordial relations with other leaders in the party.

After completing his degree from Delhi University's Faculty of Law, Tankha had enrolled as a lawyer in 1979 and became the youngest Advocate General of MP in 1999.

He has also been a votary of state laws to ensure 'distributive justice', including in subjects like medical admission, land allotment and distribution and job quotas. ""He was offered judgeship by the bench of MP High Court in April 1998 but he sought forgiveness for personal reasons. He was also the first lawyer from Madhya Pradesh to have been appointed Additional Solicitor General of India. He had played a major role in resolving disputes between Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh after the latter was created in November 2000,"" his official website states.

According to the website, he also engages in social and humanitarian activities through Rotary Club. ""As chairman of the Rotary Clubs of Jabalpur, he helped villages rebuild 66 homes in Ghana Khamaria following the devastating earthquake that rocked the city and other part of MP in 1991.""

During a super cyclone in Orissa in 2000, Tankha through rotary clubs mobilised 18 railway wagons of food and relief materials to the trouble-torn state.

He has served in various capacities in both national and international institutions and there is also a Justice Tankha Memorial Trust that runs various schools for the mentally ill and disabled kids in MP and Chhattisgarh."

As reported by TOI earlier, excess teachers in Nagpur district have been transferred to different schools, within the district, where vacancies exist. But not all teachers have joined their new postings.

The education department has sent a letter to all such teachers, warning them of salary loss. A separate letter was sent to principals of those schools that have refused to allow these teachers to join their new postings. The principals have been told that their post will be de-recognized which ultimately will lead to stoppage of salary from government coffers.

There are just over 700 excess teachers in Nagpur, who have been now given new postings at least on paper. The department has not yet shared details of how many teachers are yet to join, as it is giving some time to everyone to complete the formalities.

The separate letters to teachers and principals were needed because in some cases it is the teachers who do not want to shift to a new school while at other places it is the school that does not wish to appoint them.

Some of the teachers do not want to join other schools either because of distance or unfamiliarity. In some cases, school management feel the government is infringing on their right to appoint teachers.
