A 13-year-old boy, a student of class 6 of a private school in east Delhi, suffered multiple injuries after he fell down from the third floor of the school building Friday morning. He is battling for life in a city hospital.

The incident took place around 8.30am, soon after the morning assembly prayers. The boy is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a private hospital and is unfit for recording a statement. No case was registered in connection with the incident, the police said.

The boy's family blamed the authorities of the school for the incident. They alleged that no safety measures were in place at the school premises to avoid such an incident. The family also suspected foul play and demanded a probe to ascertain the circumstances under which the student fell off the building.

The school authorities, on the other hand, ruled out foul play and said they were extending their cooperation in the police enquiry. A senior school administration official said the footage of the CCTV cameras was checked.

""The footage shows the boy having an argument with some fellow students after which he ran to the third floor and jumped. A staffer was present on the third floor but by the time she could stop him, the student had jumped. We rushed the student to the hospital,"" the school official said.

Police said they have initiated an enquiry to ascertain whether the boy attempted suicide or accidentally fell off the building. The footage of the CCTV cameras is also being analysed. The statement of some students was also recorded, they added.

""The boy is still under medical observation. Once he is declared fit, we will record his statement to ascertain the exact sequence of events which led to his fall from the building,"" Ved Prakash Surya, additional deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara), said.

The boy lives with his family in northeast Delhi. His family members said they dropped him off at the school around 7am as he had to appear in an internal science exam.

""I got a call from the school and they told me that my son was injured and admitted to a hospital. I rushed to the hospital and learnt that my son had fallen from the school building. He has suffered multiple fractures and head injuries,"" a family member of the boy said."

Please refer to the news item ""Roofless polling station leaves staff shocked"" wherein it has been reported that the school building selected for the polling station in the village ""Lambi Keri""falling under block Khwas was found roofless. In this context, I would like to draw the attention of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir State towards the miserable condition of School Education Department. It is a matter of utter shame and shock that all of the concerned authorities of education and administrative sectors seem to have been sleeping since long and remained quite ignorant about the plight of the said school building till the date of election.

To my knowledge and experience, the concerned school teacher/headmasters have to submit a detailed report about the status of school building to the concerned higher authority every month. And if the concerned school teacher/headmaster was sincere enough to submit the monthly reports, the concerned higher authorities including ZEO,ZEPO,CEO, etc are fully responsible and answerable in the matter. The factual story appearing in this paper reveals that either the school teachers remain absent from the school or they have not reported the matter to the concerned authorities. It also indicates that the concerned administrative authorities are totally negligent towards their duties. Moreover, the concerned authorities of SSA associated with the construction of school buildings are also responsible for the poor quality of school building. There may be so many other school buildings lying unreported leading to suffering of poor students.

One of the main reasons beyond this scenario is that these Government schools are meant only for the students of rural poor parents and none of the concerned authorities including teachers,ZEOs , CEO, legislators and other officers do never even think about sending their own children to the Government schools.

However,it is suggested that the instant case of the roofless school building should be got investigated by a commission headed by the concerned Deputy Commissioner and all those found guilty should be punished under the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code so that justice is done to all concerned and none could dare to deviate from the duty and responsibility in future.

""The undue delay in completing of the project has created difficulties and inconvenience for smooth functioning of the school which is a matter of serious concern"" Syiem said during the inspection while urging the officials concerned and the contractor to take serious steps for early completion of the project for the benefit of the school children of the area.

Nine years on, School Education Department, Kashmir, has failed to construct building for much awaited Primary School in kandi village of South Kashmir's Pulwama district.

Local residents from Banjren, a Gujjar habitation -- around 35 kilometres from district headquarter, informed that in 2009 authorities of school education department established a primary school in their village.

""During the initial phase, government primary school Banjren was accommodated in a rented building and it operated in a dilapidated building sans any ventilation from July 2009,"" Tufail Ahmad , a local from the area said, adding villagers from Banjren pleaded before authorities for constructing a building for the school.

He said that in 2011 when the rented building started collapsing that authorities of school education department approved construction of two additional class rooms(ACR) for government primary school Banjren.

Another resident, Sheeraz Ahmad, said that the contract for construction of ACR was given to a local contractor, Riyaz Ahmad. However Ahmad refused to start construction on ACR on grounds that he saw the contract as less profit making to him. Sheeraz said that he handed over the contract to another contractor, Zubair Ahmad who after construction of plinth too refused to work on the project fearing loss.

The villagers informed that after 2014 great deluge, the walls of the rented building from which primary school Banjren was operating started falling apart.

They said that fearing any causality, the authorities clubbed this primary school with another primary school, which is situated at distance of five kilometres in Kandi-Pathri village.

The villagers said that clubbing of primary school Banjren proved counter-productive as student roll declined from 70 to 16 from 2015 to 2018.

""Most students discharged themselves to get enrolled in nearby private schools,"" teachers at the school said, adding that travelling 5 kilometre long distance through dirt paths is troublesome for primary school kids.

The villagers added that in 2015 a new primary school was constructed in Banjren habitation for students of Poswal Mohalla.

""We request authorities of school education department either started constructed on primary school Banjren, which is pending since 2011 or club it with primary school Poswal Mohalla, which will save our children from travelling 5 kilometres up-hill,"" the villagers said.

The court, however, made it clear that the structure in question should not be used for anything else in its present condition as it could cave in any time according to an affidavit submitted by the Delhi government.

The plea has said though the school is open for all, it mainly caters to the children of servants of military officials who are not in a position to educate their kids in private school.

Following a protest by the head teacher of a government primary school in Ludhiana's Ghulal village and firm support by the secretary school education Punjab has saved the building of the school from being razed. A land acquisition notice was issued by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to vacate the school building within three months.

NHAI had planned to build a toll plaza barrier at the school site after razing it for the ongoing widening of Ludhiana-Chandigarh six-lane highway. Now, as per the latest development, the school building has been excluded from the building plan.

One of the 'smart' government schools in the state with at least Rs 27 lakh spent on it by villagers and NRIs, the head teacher Sanjeev Kalyan refused to vacate the school building and took up the matter with officials from the lowest to the highest level. From writing letters to holding several meetings, Kalyan's efforts finally paid off after secretary school education Krishan Kumar intervened and directed deputy commissioner Ludhiana to save the school and shift the toll plaza site.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Kalyan said, ""Since NHAI officials visited our school in August first week, I was having sleepless nights. Five years of hard work was being razed in a minute. Since 2013, we are working to make it a smart school and better than private schools. At least Rs 27 lakh were spent by NRIs and other donors to revamp the school building, make smart classrooms, install computers, education park and library. It wasn't an option to keep quiet and let NHAI raze our school. I had no other place to make 102 children sit , that too, after seeing a model school being razed. The land of our school is also donated by villagers, it is not owned by the government. So, villagers were also very angry and refused to provide any other piece of land for a new building.""

Speaking on the support he got from the secretary education, Kalyan said, ""From block primary education officer (BPEO) to district education officer (DEO) and then sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) and finally the secretary education, I did not give up. I heaved a sigh of relief after secretary education Krishan Kumar assured me that he will save the school building. He wrote a letter to deputy commissioner Ludhiana in front of me.

""In no way we could have let NHAI raze the school, which is one of the model schools of Punjab. We gave example of this school to other teachers. They are having smart classrooms and other facilities for children. We took matter on priority basis with district administration who further took up with NHAI,"" Kumar said.

Damanjit Singh Mann, SDM west Ludhiana cum land acquisition collector for the project, confirmed that school building has been excluded from the plan. ""Earlier they were issued a notice under section 3(a) of Land Acquisition Act, but after receiving a letter from secretary education, we have filed objections under section 3(d) and now school land won't be acquired.

The Department Of School Education Kashmir is risking lives of students of Government Boys Primary School at Wakherwan in South Kashmir's Pulwama district by conducting their classes in an unsafe and unhygienic building.

The Primary school at Wakherwan village is housed in a three room single storey building.

Ghulam Mohammad Mir, a villager said that the building was constructed in 1980s and over these years it started dilapidating due to lack of maintenance by concerned authorities.

""The walls of the building have wide cracks, windows are broken and without window panes. The ceiling too is broken,"" he said.

""Our village has more than 200 households and has a decent population of school going children but majority of parents have stopped sending their kids to the school,"" Mir said, adding that the building is unsafe and can collapse anytime. He said that around 25 students, mostly from poor families who cannot afford to send their kids to private schools, are enrolled in the said institution.

The villagers said that the school environment is unhygenic. "" A stable can be seen sharing walls with the school building on one side and on other side there is a cowshed; heaps of cow dung, dirt and fallen tree trunks fill the small yard of the school,"" the villagers said.

Another villager, Mohammad Ashraf said that the floor of the class rooms often become dirty after bird poop falls on to them from the attic through wide holes of the broken ceiling.

""Neat and clean environment is a pre-requisite for an institution like a primary school because teachers often start educating tender kids on cleanliness,"" he said , adding that authorities put a bad example before their kids . He said that unhygienic school environment serves as a source of infection and the stink causes distraction in regular class work.

The villagers said that they pleaded with authorities for relocation of the school but to no avail. ""There are more than 800 kanals of state land (chariae) in our village which can be used for the purpose of constructing of the school,"" the villagers said.

Deputy Commissioner Pulwama, Ghulam Mohammad Dar said that he held a meeting with villagers of the residents who informed him about the available land.

""A new building will be constructed at the available land which is very suitable for the said purpose and the school will be relocated to the new building,"" he said."

The Rs 27 crore facelift project started a few months ago, with an October deadline.

A slice of 'modern history' in the capital may have been permanently erased by authorities, with the demolition of a part of the old school building on the Purana Qila premises. The demolition, carried out around 10 days ago, is part of an extensive facelift exercise being undertaken inside the complex by the Archaeological Survey of India, in collaboration with the National Buildings Construction Company.

A public sector enterprise, NBCC had adopted the monument for upgradation and facelift under the Centre's Adopt a Heritage scheme last year, a Ministry of Culture official said. The Rs 27 crore facelift project started a few months ago, with an October deadline.

In June, amid reports about the possible demolition of the Partition-era school building, several archaeologists and heritage experts raised a voice against the move. Former ASI director general BB Lal said, ""The building was built after Partition, when refugees came to Purana Qila, as a school for their children. Even if it's not Mughal or British, the structure has its own importance in modern history.""

Neera Misra, chairperson-trustee of the Delhi-based Draupadi Dream Trust, which promotes arts and culture, sent letters to the ASI, Ministry of Culture and PMO, asking them to intervene and stop the demolition of the ""1947 Partition history-linked building"". Misra said, ""I was assured at the time that the demolition will not happen.""

Even though ASI officials were unavailable for comment, when The Indian Express had contacted them in June, ASI had said in a written reply: ""The earliest reference to imparting education to children of those who migrated to India after Partition relates to the... corridors and gardens of Quila-e-Kuhna mosque inside Purana Qila from August 1948 to December 1949. The said school was just a temporary arrangement for some time after 1949...""

An ASI archaeologist, who did not wish to be named, said, ""The said building was not blocking the view of the fort, nor was it jarring in any other way. The ASI will demolish a building only if it's an encroachment in the protected area or entails any illegal occupation. This wasn't the case here.""

Meanwhile, the National Green Tribunal sought a report from NBCC on the revival of the iconic lake, after a plea alleged the project was being undertaken in a manner that would damage the environment. A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed NBCC to submit the report by September 24, when the matter would be heard next.

The direction came on a plea filed by Delhi-based R K Gupta, who contended that both the NBCC and ASI have put a plastic sheet on the bed of the lake, preventing groundwater recharge.

Also, the use of a JCB machine near the main entrance of the fort by NBCC had raised eyebrows. Experts contend that earth-moving equipment can't be deployed in or close to heritage structures as it may damage them. The ASI said in the statement: ""The elevated road leading to the main entrance of Purana Qila has been made of several layers of concrete in recent times. Removing those layers manually would have taken a lot of time; so we had to employ the equipment.""

""In the ASI guidelines, it's not mentioned whether we can or cannot use the JCB. It has to be decided on site, as per the circumstances,"" said an official, adding that ""a British-era pathway has been revealed at the entrance after the removal of the concrete road, and it will be retained as it is"".

In his report, the chief engineer of CPWD intimated the court that the building was unsafe. During the brief hearing, HC made it clear to the government that it is only concerned with the condition of the building and the safety of children studying there.

The high court's direction came while hearing a PIL, filed by NGO Social Jurist through advocate Ashok Agarwal, highlighting that 2,600 students enrolled in classes VI - X are studying in a dangerous school building and the government needs to shift them temporarily so that it can rebuild a new building, which is much safer.

""The walls and roof of the building have developed cracked and during rain, it leaks severely. Small concrete portions of the roof has been falling on students for months now,"" he said.

""Though school authorities have sealed the cracks on the roof with concrete, water continue to drip on the floor,"" said Muthuraj, a public relations officer with Makkal Viduthalai Katchi. The building is so damaged that steel rods and girders can be seen in some walls and parts of the roof, he added.

Though the students were shifted to another building in the revenue block, that too was leaky, parents said. ""Teachers moved all the students from six classrooms into a new building and crammed them into three rooms. But that building is also leaking,"" said Murugesan, father of a six-year-old. ""The new building is in a low-lying area. So, water enters the classrooms if it rains heavily. We are planning to meet the collector this week to lodge a complaint about the crisis,"" he said.

The school teachers had also lodged complaints about the dangerous situation to the district administration, Muthuraj said. ""The teachers told us that though they sent several representation to the school education department, no action was taken.""

Meanwhile, the chief educational officer said he has not received any official communication or complaint from any quarters. ""We are aware of the bad condition of the government school in Karmakoundanur but not Vadakkipalayam. We will see what can do once we get an official communication.""

Last year, five people were killed and 15 were injured after the roof of a dilapidated bus stand collapsed at Somanur, on the outskirts of the city."

Chennai-based Concrete Quality Concepts, an IIT-Madras-incubated company, which had conducted tests to assess the stability of the Government Higher Secondary School at Thinaikulam in the district, has said the 'stability of the building is good' but found some of the RC columns 'severely distressed.'

In its report submitted before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, the company, which carried out ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), rebound hammer (RH), assessment of carbonation, compressive cell and half cell potential tests in February, said the concrete in the near surface portion was in the range of 'good to very good'.

""The average RH values in RC structural elements of the school building indicate that the quality of concrete in the near surface portion is good to very good, except the RC columns C8 and C10 on the ground floor and C6 on the second floor,"" it said.

The average RH values in these RC columns indicated that the quality of concrete in the near surface portion was satisfactory. The average UPV values in a majority of the structural elements could be considered as good and in certain RC columns doubtful, the report said.

The visual inspection and non-destructive tests revealed that the corrosion was predominant in the RC columns of the ground floor and RC lintel beams of the first and the second floors. ""However, the RC beams and RC slab on all the three floors did not show any distress bearing in RC beam A8 and B8 in the second floor,"" it said.

The severely distressed RC columns on all the three floors should be rehabilitated using micro concrete jacketing, the company suggested. The tile joints in the terrace might be rectified to arrest the leakage with lime grout and repainting, it said.

After the court suo motu took cognisance of media reports that the school building was unsafe for students, the Engineer-in-chief (Buildings) of Public Works Department had ordered the tests.

The building, constructed at a cost of â‚¹ 1.26 crore, was inaugurated in 2016. After plastering in the walls and columns peeled off, exposing corroded steel rods, the Parent-Teachers' Association pulled out the students and the block remained locked for about eight months."

Water seeping through cracked ceilings and walls during rain, broken window panes and roots of old trees peeping out of damaged walls -- this is the scenario inside the government primary school at Jahangirpur village of Ludhiana. However, the education department and Public Works Department (PWD) is unmoved, despite the probability that the school building can collapse anytime, putting lives of around 200 children at risk. It is yet to declare the building unsafe as heavy rainfall has made the condition worse and students have to adjust in four classrooms. The walls, windows and ceiling of the entire building have become very weak.

Since the departments do not have any alternative, they are not declaring classrooms unsafe, putting the lives of more than 200 children at stake, said Manmohan Singh, head teacher of the school, who has written at least four letters in the past week, stating that due to heavy rain, the school building, which is already in a very bad shape, can collapse anytime. So, it should be declared unsafe at the earliest so that they can move kids out, but there has been no action till Saturday.

Singh, who has written to the block primary education officer, local MLA Sanjay Talwar and local PWD officials, said the school has more than 200 kids.

Despite our several letters to various departments, the PWD is not declaring the building unsafe and lives of children are being put at stake,"" he said.

This Shiva temple in Raisinghpur village is not just home to the deity, it has been serving as a school for 23 students for the past 10 years.

The Raisinghpur New Primary School, established in 2008, was to have been set up on a parcel of government land outside the village.

The school and mass education department, under which the school falls, had granted funds to the tune of Rs 6.44 lakh in 2008-2009. As the land was situated far away from Raisinghpur, the authorities decided to shift the school to within the village. A 20-decimal patch of land, also belonging to the government but claimed by the villagers as their own, was chosen for the school by the revenue inspector.

Due to the dispute over the land, the school building was never actually built. Thus, from its inception, the school - which has classes from I to V and comprises 23 students, three teachers and four blackboards - has been working out of its unlikely home from 10 am to 4 pm, six days a week.

""We come to the school regularly and it becomes difficult for the teachers to take classes as there is only one room in the temple here. Had there been a building, we would have read without any problem,"" said Prem Karuna, a Class V student.

Damayanti Barik, the mother of a Class V student, said the future of the children were at stake. ""The biggest problem the kids face is while eating the midday meal. The food has to be prepared in different houses in the village as the school does not have a building of its own. Not only is this a logistical nightmare, it also brings up the question of hygiene,"" she said.

The cook of Raisinghpur New Primary School, Kadambini Mishra, echoes Damayanti. ""It is so difficult to cook in a different house every day. Worse, the children have to eat under the open sky in the temple verandah,"" she said.

""We are trying to do the best we can under the circumstances,"" added headmaster in charge of the school, Pratap Kumar Panda.

The Kalahandi district project coordinator of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Gabakhya Nayak, said a new proposal for the construction of the school building at a cost of Rs 10 lakh had been sent to the government. ""However, construction can only begin when the dispute over land ends,"" he added.

President of the school management committee, Jatindra Singh, explained that the dispute over the 20-decimal land had led to the school building's construction being stalled.

On being asked, he could not specify when the dispute would be resolved. ""The revenue inspector had chosen the land. It is up to the state government to resolve the land issue,"" was all he was willing to say."

A major tragedy was averted as the building, Kothare House, near Central Plaza, was vacant as it was Sunday, said Vishwas Mote, assistant commissioner of D ward, under whose jurisdiction this area falls.

Raunak Global Academy, the nursery school, was located in the building on the first to the third floor.

According to VP Road police station, the man who was killed has been identified as Khadir Alam. He was found by the fire brigade in an unconscious state on the third floor of the building. He was taken to a hospital, but was declared dead.

No other injuries were reported, but the fire brigade continued its search for any unidentified missing persons, late into the night.

The first floor of the building was undergoing renovation work. Mote said, ""There was carpentry work going on the first floor, and it is likely that the dead person was a worker.""

A Level II fire (not a major fire) gutted second and third floors of the four-storey building at 6.08pm on Sunday.

The fire turned into a Level III fire (major fire) by 6.30pm. The exact cause of the fire is not yet known, an official from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said.

The fire brigade pressed eight fire engines and seven water tankers, a turntable ladder and an ambulance to the spot. The fire was brought under control after around three hours of fire fighting, by 9.43pm.

According to reports from the fire brigade, the building did not have the mandatory fire safety systems. P Rahangdale, chief fire officer, said, ""Like every other building in Mumbai, the problem we faced in this building was also of accessibility to the building.

While there is nothing wrong in this, Passah pointed out that one of the conditions in the guidelines issued was that the school should have undisputed and sufficient land for construction of the school building with scope for further expansion.

Passah also said that the SDSEO in its reply to the RTI on November 29, 2017 had informed that the school does not have a land patta of its own. Also, the DSEL in its reply on May 14, this year had further intimated that the building permission for the school is not available and the Tax Receipt copy of the land is also not available.

Passah also said that the guidelines specify that the School Managing Committee (SMC) shall be responsible for maintenance and repairs of the building putting proper boundary fencing and up keep of the building on completion.

Passah however said that if the school does not have land, it is impossible to be responsible for maintenance and repairs and provision of boundary fencing.

""Based on the facts received through RTI, it can be concluded that there has been a misuse of public money, and possibility that the amount sanctioned for construction of the school building was not utilized at all. Various appeals and complaints have been made to the DSEO and DSEL, but no action has been taken till date,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Passah further alleged that the Managing Committee of the school, which was approved by the SDSEO, Shillong, consists of members whose qualification is below matric (tenth) with members having minimum qualification of class III.

""There are also criminal charges against few a members of the Managing Committee. It is saddening to know that the authority approved and entrust the management of school business to people whose qualification is very low besides having criminal charges,"" he stated.

Passah has since sought the intervention of the State Education Minister, Lahkmen Rymbui through a memorandum in which he said that it is not about the size of the amount, but the seriousness of the crime, which needs to be eradicated from the state especially from reputed and important sector as education."

The school has now been demolished. Pics/Datta Kumbhar

In the last seven years, the only thing that Kurla's Nehru Nagar Municipal School has taught its students is how to waste taxpayers' money. After spending Rs 4.12 crore on shoddy repairs of the school, the BMC is now demolishing the same building, which was found to be dilapidated even after the expensive renovation. There is no word on whether there will be an investigation into where all the money went.

The school was closed for repairs way back in 2011, and its 4,000 students in Hindi, Urdu and Marathi medium were moved to other schools. The School Infrastructure Cell (SIC) awarded the contract to Kinjal Construction for the repair and strengthening of the ground-plus-four-storey building. The project were completed in November 2013, at the cost of Rs 4.12 crore, but the school could not be reopened as the repairs were found to be substandard.

Mohammad Jamaluddin Khan

Fresh repairs required

In 2016, a team from BMC's Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) conducted a visit and found that the building's condition was still shoddy and dilapidated. A consultant recommended that fresh repairs be done at the cost of another Rs 4.52 crore. The TAC found this unfeasible, and instead ordered that the building be pulled down. Demolition of the school began in March and is still ongoing.

The racket came to light after activist Mohammad Jamaluddin Khan got hold of the TAC report through an application made under the Right To Information (RTI) Act. Khan has now complained to the Chief Minister, BMC Commissioner, as well as the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB).

Khan said, ""I was shocked to read the TAC report, which stated that the building needs another structural repair. The TAC, in its final observation, stated that the further expenditure of R4.56 crore is not viable, so the building should be demolished.""

Anuradha Pednekar, former local corporator, said, ""The school building had cracks and was also lopsided. I had already told the authorities that instead of repairing it, they should demolish it and construct a new structure. I was told that such a provision does not exist. After spending crores, now they are demolishing the structure anyway.""

Uttam Shorte, deputy chief of the School Infrastructure Cell, said, ""This was special case; an uncertain problem was created in the building pillar. We consulted NIIT too, and they said the building was still dangerous. On the basis of the TAC's decision, it was decided to demolish the building.""

When asked why the officials did not investigate the shoddy repairs, he said, ""You go and find out."" Prakash Kadam, the BMC engineer at the time for the project, said, ""The building was repaired, but due to a natural calamity, cracks began to develop again. This was not just in the school building, but also in nearby residential buildings."""

The senior medical officer's bungalow in the Civil Hospital, Gurugram, was not palatial. It had three rooms, a veranda which would be covered with thick bamboo 'chiks' during the blistering summers, and two outhouses for the kitchen and the toilet. The best part of the house was the expansive, partially paved space between the main building and the outhouses. There were two large neem trees in that space which provided some relief during the summer. The house shared a wall with the Government Higher Secondary School.

That house, where I spent my childhood, ceased to exist in the early 1980s. The Civil Hospital, a conglomeration of old British-era buildings, was woefully small for the city's expanding population. Most of the buildings were pulled down and new multi-storeyed blocks came up. The neem trees were chopped down and the bungalow razed to make way for a car park.

The school, however, was allowed to stay. This red-coloured double-storey structure was as much a landmark in the old city as the ""ship building"" is in the new one. For a long time, it was the only government higher secondary school in Gurugram and catered to not just the city but the surrounding villages and towns too. Generations of students had finished their schooling here.

I have no idea of the exact provenance of the structure, though one can be sure it dates to at least the early 1930s. An uncle of mine, who retired from the Government of India, had finished his matriculation from this school. This was in the early '30s. His father, an employee of the forest department, was posted to the city when it was not much more than a small bazaar and a Civil Lines. Interestingly, the noticeboard in the school, which lists the names of students who excelled academically here, still has my uncle's name for topping the matriculation examination!

Recently, it was reported that the Civil Hospital needs to expand and so the school will be shifted somewhere else, and the buildings demolished.

The school principal is reported as remonstrating feebly that the school caters to many students from nearby, who would then drop out.

What no one seems to be interested in is the historical value of this colonial building. Of course, a growing and increasingly demanding population needs new infrastructure. But is it absolutely necessary for us to build it at the cost of our heritage? That a building which is more than eight decades old, and has seen the Raj, Independence and finally the creation of a new state, can be destroyed by bureaucratic fiat without any public debate and discussion, is a sad reflection of our age.

One sees this happening all the time. A flyover under construction in Old Delhi (after a delay of nearly two decades) knocked down a quaint colonial-era building where a school was running. Never mind that the orientation of the flyover is a bit odd, given that it needed to avoid demolishing some shops which were part of the compound of a religious structure - shops, not the structure itself. Shops that are undoubtedly a sinecure for the cabal which possibly runs the religious monument. These could not be demolished without hurting religious sentiments but a monument to our heritage is easy pickings.

It can be argued that the National Monuments Act gives protection to structures which have true historical value and are part of our heritage. So, those which do not come under its purview are not necessarily important, and since land is needed for new infrastructure, demolishing them might be inevitable. But can we not try and find alternatives to the mindless destruction of these historical monuments?

For instance, in the case of the hospital, there is ample space available on the other sides of the building, with a Police Lines on one side and some government and private residences on the other. Can we not think of using some of that land and sparing this structure, which has so much history associated with it? Is our bureaucratic imagination so sterile that we cannot think of innovative solutions to such problems?

My sharpest memory of the school is of tens of students sitting on the branches of the neem tree or on the dividing wall between our house and the school. This was in the month of April when the annual examinations would take place. They would be there, helping their friends in their exams by throwing chits and books into the classrooms whose windows had possibly last seen glass panes before Independence! The picture of cheating in a Bihar school that went viral last year brought back memories of that remarkable scene from many summers ago.

After the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court suo motu took cognisance of a report in a Tamil daily that the block was unsafe for students, Public Works Department officials inspected it two weeks ago, after which the Engineer-in-Chief (Buildings - PWD) ordered the tests.

Acting on the report submitted by the Superintending Engineer (Planning and Design), the Engineer-in-Chief directed the Chief Engineer (Buildings), Madurai region, to carry out ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), rebound hammer, core drilling and carbonation tests involving the Chennai-based company.

A three-member team from the company, headed by engineer B. Ganesh, started the tests on Monday. ""We have launched the UPV and rebound hammer tests for collecting samples and recording data,"" Mr. Ganesh said.

Besides core drilling and carbonation tests, the team would also carry out a chemical analysis test. It would take two to three days to complete the tests, he said.

The samples and recorded data would be analysed in the company laboratory to assess the stability of the building and the results would be available in 10 to 15 days, he added.

The team was assisted by PWD Executive Engineer Dinakaran, Assistant Executive Engineer T. Kuruthivelmaran and Assistant Engineer Pandiyarajan. Chief Education Officer (CEO) Murugan was also present in the school.

The new block, comprising 11 classrooms, was built at a cost of â‚¹1.26 crore in 2013 and thrown open to students in March 2014, though it was formally inaugurated in 2016, officials said.

Heritage lovers and parents are pitted against each other in a campaign for and against the demolition of a 156-year-old colonial era building belonging to the St. Joseph's Anglo-Indian Girls Higher Secondary School here.

The school management is reportedly planning to pull down the building to replace it with a modern structure with more facilities in tune with the times. Built in 1862, the school is one of the oldest in the city, set up to empower girls in the Malabar region.

Principal Sr. Nidhisha told The Hindu on Sunday that the decision to demolish the building was taken in view of safety concerns. She also claimed that the existing structure lacked facilities to house the increasing number of students. ""There were only around 300 students when the building was constructed. Now, it has gone up to 1,800,"" she said.

The principal added that the equipment meant for making classrooms hi-tech could not be used for lack of facilities. ""There is leakage in many parts. Students complain that the staircase and floors, made of wood, shake when they walk on them,"" she said. According to her, the management had thought of building an extension earlier, but the plan had to be dropped.

Meanwhile, a group of heritage lovers and old students have objected to the move, saying that the possibilities of renovating the structure have not been studied properly. Ayesha Mahmood, an alumna of the school, said that the management was obsessed with razing the building without assessing if it could be revived, restored, and conserved for posterity. She claimed that architects from the National Institute of Technology - Calicut had examined the building and ruled out any immediate danger. Ms. Mahmood said that the history and heritage of the building had not been documented too. She has started an online petition on change.org in favour of restoring the building. The petition has already received nearly 3,000 signatures.

Addressed to the Archaeological Survey of India, the petition claims that the restoration of the building could be more financially viable compared with pulling down the existing structure and constructing a new one.

At the same time, Some parents have jumped on the bandwagon with another campaign supporting the demolition, saying, ""Vested interests taking advantage of the nostalgic vulnerability of our ex-students to scuttle the infrastructure development plans by spreading disinformation is discernible.""

There is division in the parent-teacher association (PTA) too. PTA president Sulthan said that a majority of members were supportive of the demolition proposal, and that a few were opposed to it."

Protesting against the destruction of the British-era building, as part of the renovation plans by the management, social media activists in the coastal town have come up with an online petition against the plan.

The petition claims the school management's concerns can be addressed by restoring and strengthening the buildings with the help of architects, who are specialised in it.

The petition filed on change.org, which has got more than 2500 signatures by now, claims keeping heritage alive is of prime importance as the English medium school contains the collective memory of thousands of students, panning almost six generations. The petition, addressed to Archaeological Survey of India, also suggests that restoration work could be more economical, as compared to that of destructing the existing building and creating a new one.

""The restoration will only add to the historical value and character of the school. A building that is over 150-years-old must be considered a wealth to the city it is in. In a world where characterless and soulless skyscrapers and steel-glass embodiments are dimes a dozen; buildings like these serve as a place of solace and coolness for the soul and sight,"" the petition filed by Aysha Mahmood, a Kozhikode-based social activist says.

An alumnus of the school, Ayshsa says she understands the concerns of the school management but requests them to look into a way where they can restore the building rather than pull it down.

""There are only a few such heritage buildings like St Joseph's left in the city. Bringing down the school would be a huge loss for Kozhikode's heritage. School authorities should give a thought to check if it is possible to preserve the building,"" says Aysha.

It may be recalled that the Berry White Medical School located at Graham Bazar here was established in 1900 by British philanthropist Dr John Berry White. Dr White was a retired Brigadier of the British Army who later served as the Civil Surgeon in the erstwhile Lakhimpur district which had its headquarters in Dibrugarh.

He had spent all his hard earned money to establish the Berry White Medical School, which started the allopathic medical education by awarding LMP (Licentiate Medical Practitioner), besides nursing. The medical school was later upgraded to the full-fledged Assam Medical College (AMC) in 1947.

Considering its historical and archaeological significance for being instrumental in establishing the first medical institute of the Northeast and helping the people of the region in its all-round development, several organisations, NGOs, local citizens, besides medical fraternity and others had placed demands time and again before the authorities concerned for its conservation.

As many as 33 students are enrolled in Classes I to V of the school which lacks a building of its own. As per reports, a building for the school was constructed more than two decades ago. However, the building gradually got damaged due to lack of maintenance and repair and subsequently, collapsed around five years back.

On the other hand, lack of a building has not deterred teachers from discharging their duties. The two teachers of the school use verandas of different houses in the village to take classes. Touched by their sincerity, villagers repaired a cowshed and handed it over to the school authorities for conducting classes. For more than a year, the school has been functioning in the cowshed.
