Stagecraft, the theatre company found by him in 2003 has been consistently feeding city's craving for good quality plays.

Khurana studied theatre under the tutelage of Satyadev Dubey in Mumbai. ""But when I returned to Nagpur in the nineties there was a vacuum,"" he says.

""A few of my friends then began to get together and we rehearsed some scripts and would perform strictly before friends and relatives. And as many of my friends were either Parsees or Christians the plays were mostly in English and were performed at the auditorium of Tata Parsee School,"" he adds.

As the word got around and audience came in, Khurana and his theatre group began to charge a nominal amount of Rs10 as ticket fee. ""That was the time when we began to look at theatre a bit more seriously. Some of the plays produced by us were in demand by schools who wanted to stage them as fund raisers,"" says Khurana.

Around the year 2003, Khurana felt the need to formalize his working structure and stagecraft was formed. Today the 15-year-old theatre group has staged 75 plays in the city and have travelled with many of their productions.

""Way back when we began with Stagecraft, the scene was dismal. Finding actors was difficult and parents were weary of sending their daughters for rehearsals which usually took place in the evenings,"" says the actor and director of many plays.

""But as the audience grew aspiring actors and directors expressed a desire to join us. That was the time I began taking theatre workshops as many parents felt that doing theatre would help in enhancing the personality of their ward and give them the required confidence,"" says Khurana who can rightfully claim credit for training more than 350 boys and girls as actors, writers and directors.

Though Stagecraft was initially known for the English plays but lately quite a few in Hindi too have been coming from the group. ""If you ask me theatre has no language and in this city of which Mahesh Elkunchwar is a resident, Marathi theatre is very evolved. In fact, the first Hindi play done by us was an adaptation of Elkunchwar's Pratibimb. He gave me the Hindi translation done by Vasant Deo and in 1999 we for the first time organized five-day theatre festival in Nagpur where five plays in three languages were staged. That kind of set the tone,"" Khurana adds.

With so much behind him, Khurana says he would now like to set new targets. ""The thinking caps are on. Our Adda has been a success and we have been staging plays very consistently. Now we need to do something different, maybe present ourselves in a new avatar,"" says city's theatre guru."

"3","1030436740","2019-01-01","https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/can-india-defeat-tech-colonisation","Can India Defeat Tech Colonisation?","swarajyamag.com",FALSE,"It is only if Indian tech dominates India that it can dominate the world.

For India's digital future, 10 May 2018 should be seen as a turning point. It was the day Walmart paid $16 billion to buy Flipkart, ending effectively the biggest Indian challenge in e-commerce, globally dominated by Amazon. Sure, there are still some smaller players around like Snapdeal, and niche companies in specific markets, or Chinese and Japanese-backed Paytm Mall, but matsya nyay -- big fish eating the small -- is very much in evidence.

A few months before Flipkart, Alibaba bought into Big Basket, the online groceries chain. Soon Amazon bought up offline retailer More from the Birlas, and is now in talks to acquire a stake in Kishore Biyani's Future Retail (owner of Big Bazaar).

Tech colonisation is now driven by oodles of global capital -- capital that is now in plentiful supply, especially with tech companies from the US and China. Between them, eight major tech companies -- five from the US and three from China -- have a market capitalisation (19 December market quotes) of over $4.158 trillion. Only the US, China and Japan have a gross domestic product (GDP) larger than this number. The five US companies are Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, while the three Chinese companies are Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent.

Now consider two other milestones -- 11 April 2016 and 5 April 2018 -- on the first date, the then Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan announced the launch of an upgraded unified payments interface (UPI) for mobile payments based on unique IDs. At one stroke, UPI yanked the power of payments away from banks and global oligopolies like Visa and MasterCard, enabling peer-to-peer payments and facilitating money movement between bank accounts by anyone owning a mobile smartphone.

As for the second date, the RBI struck a blow against tech colonisation by mandating that all payments companies must maintain their Indian customer data in India, in other words, data localisation. Even as foreign players in the payments space gnashed their teeth in impotent rage, a third government initiative, the Jan Dhan no-frills banking account, in conjunction with UPI, was instrumental in catapulting another home-grown digital initiative, the RuPay card, to the big league.

In November 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley blogged: ""today Visa and MasterCard are losing market share in India to (the) indigenously developed payment systems of UPI and (the) RuPay Card, whose share has reached 65 percent of the payments done through debit and credit cards.""

These may be small successes in a landscape dotted by India's gradual tech colonisation, but they are signs of hope that India can occasionally get its act together. Can it make this a habit?

The road to colonisation, if one were to use the British East India Company's playbook as guide, runs something like this. First, offer to bring in trade and consumer benefits; then, once you have a foot in the door, and as the profits accumulate, use the economic power to build military power to protect the monopoly advantages gained; at a later stage, negotiate with weak rulers, offering them military protection in lieu of some personal lucre and/or other benefits, and expand your trade and military monopoly area; then, as your military and economic control of the country becomes larger and larger, establish the entire territory as a colony.

And yes, during the whole process, it helps if you can 'educate' the people being colonised so that at least the elite begin to see colonisation itself as some kind of boon -- the Macaulay project so to speak.

Cut to the present, where the prospect of India being politically colonised is not on the cards, but tech colonisation is an ever-present possibility, given the sheer money and US political power backing it.

If you were a Google, you will bring free services (email, maps, payment systems, et al) to control Indian cyberspace; if you were a Facebook, you will offer free Internet (Free Basics), free messaging, free social interaction; if you were Amazon, you will offer subsidised products delivered to your home until it becomes a default way of shopping. Unlike the East India Company, Google or Facebook or Amazon doesn't need armies to defend their growing monopoly power in the Indian digital marketplace; control of technology platforms and the ecosystem surrounding it provides them all the defence they need.

As weak Indian players either sell out to them, or compromise with them, they end up strengthening the foreign-owned ecosystems and their control of the playing field. When, occasionally, we manage to give our own home-grown tech a leg-up, the big diplomatic guns will be rolled out to browbeat us.

Thus, when the RuPay payments system rose to market leadership, MasterCard, Visa and American Express used US politicians and the India-US Joint Business Council to bat and browbeat on their behalf. When Aadhaar and UPI enabled breakthroughs in micro-payments and fintech, Google, Amazon and the rest tried hard to prevent it from becoming the default platform for micropayments and microcredit.

When the RBI mandated data localisation, the US tech biggies piled on the pressure. There are significant bureaucrats and ministers in the government who are willing to listen, as they lack any kind of knowledge on how tech colonisation happens. Or, maybe, they are compromised personally in some way.

The British colonisers got weak rulers to play their game by offering them titles and petty privileges; the global tech monopolies, backed by their governments, achieve the same objective by facilitating Indian bureaucrats to send their children to Ivy League colleges, or offer them plum posts in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, or tenured positions in universities.

Apart from being lucrative, these options also colonise the mind to tom-tom the virtues of free trade and globalisation, without realising that this story won't sell in an era where US citizens themselves believe they have been sold a pup. Globalisation and automation have impacted the US middle class more than anybody else, and the election of Donald Trump is proof number one here.

Another technique used to suborn Indian tech entrepreneurs and compromise their independence is by literally throwing cash at them. Hundreds of Indian entrepreneurs will become millionaires, if not billionaires, by selling out, as has been the case with Sachin and Binny Bansal at Flipkart. Big cash brings salvation to the losing entrepreneurial soul.

The Indian citizen, meanwhile, enticed by free this and free that -- mail, maps, messaging, discounted products, and what-have-you -- has been roped into silent complicity in tech colonisation when actually nothing is coming free. She has bartered away her entire data thinking it has no particular value. When data is the new oil, we have presented our new tech colonisers with the equivalent of Saudi Arabia's oil reserves in exchange for little personal conveniences.

In the process, the tech giants essentially own us. Google knows where you go, what you do, what you buy, what news and web content you consume; Amazon knows what you buy, where you live, what your monthly discretionary spend may be, and how you entertain yourself every month; Uber knows where you travel and how frequently, which locality you live and work in, and, increasingly, what you may order online for food. And so on. We don't know what they do with this knowledge they have of us, some of it may not be kosher.

Facebook, as the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal showed, allowed sensitive user data to be accessed by the latter for electoral misuse. If Russian hackers can try to influence a US presidential election, one wonders how weak Indian cyber-security laws and enforcement will prevent any foreign or domestic entity from influencing our electoral outcomes.

Tech colonisation can easily facilitate the use of Indian customer data that is already with the global tech companies for influencing our political destinies. The report that the Congress party may have made initial approaches to Cambridge Analytica, even if wrong, shows where this trend can lead us.

The fightback against tech colonisation thus needs to be fought at several levels: capital inflows and shareholding power, regulation, data security and localisation, and selective support for domestic technology platforms and entrepreneurs.

Even though there are no easy solutions, the questions we need to ask ourselves, and find answers to, include the following:

One, the big advantage the tech biggies have is loads of capital, which means they can invest in or buy out Indian entrepreneurs before they can scale up. This means we need ways to protect our entrepreneurship from premature exits forced by their need for large amounts of capital. Are non-voting shares and the creation of multiple classes of investors the way out? Can we give investors lower capital gains taxes in lieu or lower voting shares?

Two, when new platforms are created, whether by government initiatives (as in the case of Aadhaar unique IDs, UPI and RuPay), or through public-private partnerships, should Indian-owned companies be given first crack at operationalising them and scaling up, before they are thrown open to all comers? This way, while ultimately there is no protectionism, Indian startups and businesses will get a head start. We don't need to pick winners. Those who have good business models, will succeed. Those that don't can fade away. We don't need to create 10 more losers in the name of promoting domestic capabilities and ownership.

Three, should private-public partnerships be promoted to create new open-source technology that will benefit the Indian economy and create jobs? For example, instead of letting Uber take over the ride-hailing services market by sheer use of capital, why not create a not-for-profit app, where all taxi-owners can plug in for a small monthly fee, serve their customers, and keep more of their earnings with themselves.

The rival to Uber need not only be an Ola; it could be a simple not-for-profit app with the same kind of user-friendliness, which anyone can plug into. It will not only widen the shared mobility market, but ultimately facilitate even private car owners, once they convert their cars to dual use, private and commercial, to participate in public transport. Shared mobility is a public good, unlike the use of private vehicles only for limited private use.

Four, given the poor knowledge of tech developments in government and regulatory circles, any decision in these fields, whether for the purpose of writing regulations or for helping Indian tech entrepreneurship hold its own against global big tech, should always be informed by Indian tech expertise.

If decisions on tech and regulation are left to babus, who may either lack the knowledge or be compromised in other ways, it would be a tragedy. In this context, organisations like iSPIRIT can play a huge catalytic role. iSPIRIT, short for Indian Software

Product Industry Round Table -- is a think-tank that hopes to catalyse the transformation of India's software industry from services to products and platforms, apart from helping government formulate policies that can have a big impact on India's growth story.

Five, data security, privacy and regulation. Data localisation, which the RBI is already insisting on, is a must, but at some point India needs to pioneer a new model for the use of data that benefits the public rather than only enriching the tech giants. Vasant Dhar, professor at the Stern School of Business, wrote in The Washington Post last September, there are four models for control of data.

One is the US model, which essentially allows big tech to more or less use the data they acquire legally for commercial purposes, subject only to privacy limitations and consent.

The Chinese model is to allow the state to control data and giving unbridled protection to domestic champs, who play the game the way the Communist party wants them to.

The European Union model, as enunciated in its General Data Protection Regulation, imposes risks on companies for any data they collect, and further burdens them with the need to prove that they are only collecting data that is 'absolutely' essential for a particular kind of service or transaction.

Thus, a company could face a penalty if your location is collected by a taxi app and this information is used for purposes other than what it is intended for. It cannot sell your location data to someone else for his commercial purpose.

The Indian approach, as enunciated in the B N Srikishna report on data protection and privacy, is still to be legislated (beyond the Aadhaar law used for delivering government benefits), but it constitutes a fourth way, as it treats digital data platforms like public goods, says Dhar.

He wrote: ""regardless of how India's data protection bill shapes up as law, the new data fiduciary entity or entities that it creates will ensure that any data transaction is consensual -- getting the individual's consent expressed explicitly in code that specifies how long that data can be used.

Initially, data fiduciaries are expected to oversee transactions in financial services; they're expected to expand to health, employment and education, areas involving authentication and sensitive personal data. If we want control over data, the Indian model offers a path toward individual data empowerment for the Internet age.""

Clearly, we seem to have stumbled on something that is a good way to go, something that could prevent excessive tech colonisation even while empowering our citizens to use their data for their own benefit.

But between the intent and the final form, there could be many a slip. India is famous for succumbing to global pressures when it comes to the crunch. We need to ensure that our fractious and self-defeating nature does not trip us once more.

India can duck, deflect and defeat tech colonisation only if it can create a public-private partnership that marries good policy-making with technology platforms developed and grown for our needs. If Indian tech can dominate India, they will dominate the world."

The increased availability of private consumer data in the hands of technology companies and e-retailers offers immense potential to personalise products and services. Along with this wave comes the next big thing called 'personalised pricing'. Personalised pricing is a significant innovation that takes down the 150-year legacy of standard price tags for a good or a service.

Credit for the use of price tags goes to the retail pioneer John Wanamaker, who, in the 1870s, purchased a former Philadelphia railroad depot and started a clothing retail store. Prior to that, pricing was always individually negotiated between the buyer and seller using various forms of haggling. The price tag revolution has since then shaped consumer shopping behaviour.

If consumers of a product have their maximum willingness to pay (WTP) spread somewhere between Rs 100 and Rs 1,000, then most retailers work out a decent cut-off point of say Rs 250 to price their product, such that a vast majority of the market purchases it at static price. This static pricing regime has withstood the storms of innovation until now; but its future is suddenly looking bleak.

Somewhere in the 1970s, came along dynamic pricing, where different segments paid differently for availing the same product or service. Customers here were segmented based on their time of purchase. Some examples are airline tickets, hotel rooms, happy hours at bars, or discount sales on Wednesdays etc. But the key is customers could still self-select which segment they wanted to be in. For instance, even business-class customers could avail cheap airline tickets if they planned their business trip sufficiently well in advance.

The new kid on the block is personalised pricing, which uses consumer specific data, such as their past shopping habits/behaviours, their private data about life events, or other psychographic traits to determine a price that is unique to that customer at that point in time. The difference between dynamic pricing and personalised pricing is that, dynamic pricing offers the same price to everyone asking for the same product at a particular point in time, while personalised pricing breaches that boundary as well. Personalised pricing has become feasible only due to the data technology revolution, where e-retailers and product companies have access to terabytes of private consumer data, which was hitherto unavailable to them.

Naturally, technology companies such as Amazon and Google are taking the lead when it comes to experimenting with personalised pricing. However benign the term personalised pricing may sound, is it really fair to the consumers, especially when their ability to self-select a purchase is taken away from them? Are there ethical issues in this model, far beyond the economics of trading?

Way back in 2000, when Amazon was the lone big e-retailer in the town, a customer noticed that he could buy a DVD for $4 lesser if he deleted cookies in his browser. This became a national controversy and Jeff Bezos had to personally apologise and gave away thousands of refunds. This was way before the days of social media. Such an outcry today amplified over social media would have sent Amazon's stock prices crashing.

But the world has since moved on, and today, the core shopping base constitutes the 1990s and millennial kids. Tech companies argue that the current generation does not share the same privacy concerns of older generation and are happy to share and let companies use private data, in return for more personalised discounts and offerings.

One of the most systematic live studies on personalised pricing was done by an online human resources staffing firm Ziprecruiter in partnership with professors from Chicago Booth School. This company was charging a flat fee of $99 for any sourcing request.

After a series of experiments, they discovered that they could double the average price to $199 (personalised pricing in the range of $19 to $399) and generate far more revenues than they ever previously earned. They lost a few customers, a few grumbled, but most were satisfied and their revenues grew significantly. Their background algorithm used a significant amount of private customer data to personalise the price.

The success of this experiment and the reluctant acceptance of surge pricing tactic of Uber without much complaints or regulatory hurdles have excited tech companies and e-retailers on the possibility of shifting to personalised pricing. With the amount of private customer data in the hands of tech firms and e-retailers, it is not a matter of if anymore, but just when.

Personalised pricing is as close as one can get to what is called first degree price discrimination in economics. In this concept, every customer receives a personalised price that equals his/her maximum WTP. This model is called efficient in economics because no one is left out and the entire producer/consumer surplus is monetised.

For example, if consumers are spread over their WTP for an ice-cream from Rs 2 to Rs 50, and if the retailer sets the price at Rs 15, then no doubt some portion of the market will be unable to purchase the product, but many customers enjoy consumer surplus to the tune of difference between their true WTP and Rs 15.

This inefficiency goes away with personalised pricing because all customers can enjoy the ice-cream and pay at the level of their true willingness to pay. It is also welfare maximising because the rich pay more and the poor pay less, and finally everyone gets to avail the offering.

But first degree price discrimination has always remained a pipe dream because determining maximum WTP is almost impossible, and no customer in his sane mind would ever want to reveal that. With the power of private customer data and advanced machine learning algorithms, companies are now closer than ever before in determining this crucial piece of information.

Proponents of personalised pricing argue that such a model should be welcomed by the society because it is fair, efficient, and welfare maximising. They dub the naysayers as bigoted cry babies, who have higher WTP and are refusing to give up their consumer surplus for the welfare of the broader society.

But the opponents of personalised pricing have multiple viewpoints. The first is the legal issue involved in using demographic aspects such as race, gender, religion, education, and age to discriminate customers.

Recently, a California court outlawed the practice followed by a dating app of match group that charged older customers higher prices on the grounds of age.

Similarly, race or religion-based discrimination is outlawed in many countries including India. But if you ask the tech companies, they argue that they use these demographic variables only as a proxy for determining the customer's true WTP, but they don't indulge in any discrimination.

For example, the WTP for a Hindu traveller flying over Diwali weekend is likely to be far higher than someone belonging to another faith, but the religion of the passenger is only a proxy for his WTP. It is not clear what stand the courts will take on this issue, but tech companies know that this territory is a legal quagmire.

The second issue is the fairness concern raised by consumer rights protection groups on whether it is fair to indulge in opportunistic behaviour. For example, there was tremendous outcry when the dynamic prices of various essential products like water bottles went up in the affected regions during hurricane Katrina in America. It was a natural calamity leading to a spike in demand for essential products and how fair was it for the companies involved to exploit the situation? Tech companies argue that all they can do under such a shortage situation is to efficiently allocate the goods based on customer's WTP.

However, consumer protection groups don't agree.

The third issue is the ethical concern of unequal bargaining power. Today, tech companies know far more about consumers than consumers can independently research about competing offerings, despite the availability of Internet search engines. The difference lies in computing power and algorithm sophistication. Hence, consumers are far more likely to be exploited in a take-it-or-leave-it offer, especially when they suffer from varying degrees of inertia in brand switching.

The only way to address this issue is to make the market more competitive so that customers do not suffer from monopsony prices. For example, regulators can mandate sharing of private customer data among the players or become the custodian of all such data to create a level-playing field.

But the larger issue is the one involving consumer psyche. Over the past 150 years of the price tag era, we have grown believing that there exists a fair market price for a product or service that is static and is equal to everyone.

No customer can stomach the feeling that he/she paid Rs 100 more over someone else for purchasing the same product. He/she would feel betrayed leading to bitterness against the seller. The hardest part is changing this psyche; no matter what economic theories have to say. Tech and product companies are aware of this issue and they know that consumer loyalty, referrals, customer life-time value etc, would suffer big time if such bitterness is created.

To compound the problem, it is the richer consumers with higher WTP who are short-handed and they often are the most valuable customers to the company. Companies argue that uniform prices do not exist in the market. People pay different prices to avail the same education by a mix of scholarships and funding support. People already pay differently to avail taxi and auto rickshaw services.

But there are two issues with that argument.

Firstly, differential prices are prevalent only in customised services, where it is hard for consumers to compare the offerings. It is not so easy to extend this model to products and standard services.

Secondly, when pricing information is kept private, comparison is harder. But keeping personalised pricing information private is very hard for products in the social media era.

There is another challenge that companies are wary about that customers will start to fake the information they supply, or create multiple online avatars to game the system. This is another factor that is keeping personalised pricing still a little bit away from reality.

But whatever be the outcome of all these technical, legal and ethical dilemmas, it is clear that personalised pricing is here to stay. The job of regulators is going to get that much harder in order to protect consumers from being taken for a ride. However cruel this may sound, all we as consumers can do is brace ourselves for a new era of shopping, where the price tag will be dead and consumer surplus will be an empty vessel."

If not, do some advance tax planning","The Financial Express",FALSE,"Avoid the last-minute rush, and don't take on a large tax-saving burden for March. Start now in December.

We are about to get into the tax-saving season. Most Indians will rush to buy tax-saving instruments such as life and health insurance, ELSS, PPF, etc., before the March 31 deadline. However, here's a suggestion. Avoid the last-minute rush, and don't take on a large tax-saving burden for March. Start now in December. Do some advance tax planning. You have more time to make wise decisions and evaluate all options with a little more breathing space. Here's how it will help you.

In December, you have the time to assess your tax liabilities and to decide which tax savers work best for you. Work with your accountant or assess your salary slip to determine your exact tax dues, and see how much you have already saved via rent, PF deduction, child's school tuition fee, home loan EMI, and others. This way you know how much more you need to invest for saving taxes, and then you can make thoughtful decisions by not over- or under-investing.

A last-minute dash to the bank or post office to purchase a tax saver may not be in your best interest. For example, your bank manager may sell you a product that provides poor returns that you would be stuck with for the next five years. So, working a little bit in advance can help you avoid poor decisions made in a hurry.

Opting for insurance only to claim tax benefits can leave you with high premiums and inadequate coverage. While health insurance is mandatory, you have numerous options for life insurance, so take the time to study them. Remember that your family's financial security is at stake, so don't be in a hurry to simply save some tax. Consider other investments that can fall under the '1.5 lakh limit if you aren't in need of insurance. Conversely, if you are looking for an investment to claim tax deductions and could benefit from insurance, apply for one. Consider an ELSS mutual fund that works both as a one-time lump-sum tax-saver and as a monthly SIP.

Taking advantage of the benefits under Section 80C, which allow you to claim up to '1.5 lakh of tax deductions, is easy when you have planned your investments thoroughly and effectively. Based on tax liabilities, see which instruments cover your insurance and investment needs best. Not all instruments are created equal; some are better than others!

Rather than following the herd, take the time to assess your options. Apart from insurance premiums, Section 80C allows tax deductions on a plethora of investments like PPF, EPF and home loans. Planning your investment ahead of time lets you evaluate your financial goals, align investments accordingly and also, earn attractive returns. For instance, with National Pension System (NPS) withdrawals becoming 100% tax-free, you can consider investing in them.

So, start planning for taxes now to avoid errors that may invite income notices, and make the most of tax deductions."

But the 'smooth-sailing' has already taken and continues to take a toll not only on the authority of the elected representatives and governance by the executive, but also freedom of speech, freedom of dissent and freedom of association.

While the role of an 'unseen' hand in Pakistan's politics is not a secret any more, the past few months have witnessed it further creeping in and taking over the areas believed to be the sole domain of the elected authority. Regulating the media, for example, has also been virtually usurped by that very hand.

In the same token, the judiciary has overstretched its involvement from taking suo motu notices ranging from rates of daily commodities to observing water schemes, raiding hospitals, deciding school fee, ordering removal of illegal encroachments from markets and roads, and playing an overactive role in long-term projects such as developing and expanding the country's water resources by generating funds for the construction of dams.

One wonders what is left for the elected government to do. The forward push by the two major state institutions has forced the executive and legislature on the back foot while the fifth pillar, a free and independent media, has already resorted to the worst-ever self-censorship under pressure from losing corporate interests.

Journalists raising questions and criticising the prevailing situation are being forced out of the pages and their television programs either censored or shut down to end criticism.

Recently, the Pakistan military spokesperson, addressing a news conference, asked the media to report positive news for six months. Days later, the country's media supervisory body, called Pakistan Media Regulatory Authority or PEMRA, circulated an order titled ""advice"", asking the media offices not to report sexual abuses and crimes, etc, because, this is allegedly creating a negative image of Pakistan abroad.

Eighteen international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) have already been asked to close their offices, web pages of the Voice of America Pashto and Urdu language services have been blocked, while other media groups, both local and global, are under severe scrutiny for whether they are reporting ""positives"" and avoiding ""negatives"".

The latest step to achieve the goal of ""positive image"" includes strict surveillance of social media accounts with a focus on Facebook and Twitter. Reports and personal experiences shared by social media activists suggest their activity on the sites is closely monitored and often bombarded by trolls for raising voices against the faux pas of the newly elected government.

Pakistani authorities have already written letters and sent notices to Twitter about social media activity by a number of organisations and individuals. One must remember that YouTube had already gone through a ban in Pakistan. Under fear of intimidation, even common people think twice before posting on social media.

But where does all this lead to? Can Pakistan afford 1949 China-style ""thought reforms"", re-education of people through ""xinau"" or brainwashing to know the ""right ideas and the right questions and answers"" and to convert themselves into the ""New People""?

Notwithstanding the ideas of ""New Pakistan"" and ""tabdilee"" or change, by Prime Minister Imran Khan, the answer, to any sane mind, would be a certain 'no' because Pakistan is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural society with people strictly bound to their religions, faith and ideologies, and any adventure to put them in a single frame will not be without repercussions.

Keeping in view the worsening relations with the United States, long-term disputes with much bigger neighbour India, an unending war in Afghanistan, terror threat in the tribal territory, an insurgency-like situation in Balochistan and the emergence and expansion of new religious extremist groups in the mainland Pakistan, one may gauge the level of concerns in the security circles. But warding off such threats by favouring some and bashing and side-lining others will only exacerbate the problems.

From the pre-election season to election day in May this year followed by the formation of the new government, a majority of the political parties have expressed serious reservations about the whole process. Except for the ruling Tehrik-e-Insaaf party of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the rest have lodged their protest, raising accusing fingers at the security agencies.

Now, that the formation of the new government is over and the country's ""most favourite"" prime minister is in the driving seat, the opposition parties are still feeling the heat of being pushed to the corner through what they call ""a discriminatory attitude"".

The former ruling party, Pakistan Muslim League, is in hot water due to unproven cases of corruption and misuse of authority by the anti-graft National Accountability Bureau, or NAB. Ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam, the two most vocal leaders against the judicial activism and military's role in politics, were swiftly put behind bars days ahead of the election. The duo is now free but still facing the courts and maintaining a meaningful silence.

Another top leader, former president Asif Ali Zardari, who is also co-chairman of his late wife's Pakistan Peoples Party, openly expressed his anger against the judiciary and the army without naming a particular individual or institutions.

In a thinly veiled reference to the military, Zardari said those who have a fixed service tenure of three years have no right to take decisions about the future of the country. And in yet another line the same day, he warned the hyper judiciary against involvement in matters relating to the executive or parliament.

Nawaz Sharif, the three-time elected prime minister, when questioned by a journalist about his silence and that why he does not smile during his court appearances, replied that ""What can we say about smiling, we can't even cry if we want to"".

Be it politicians, journalists or common Pakistanis, there exists a sense of frustration the way they are losing their group and individual freedoms.

Whether this effort on curbing individual and group freedoms is planned or otherwise, the more likely result will be more dissent and polarisation in the society which has already witnessed an unprecedented level of schism during the May 2018 election.

States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

This was a year for consolidating the gains that have accrued from major policy decisions taken in the previous four years, a time for monitoring of ongoing projects, tackling road blocks and adding to the already impressive pace of work achieved last year. The Ministry took a decision to complete all ongoing projects that had been awarded upto 2015-16, and placed the highest ever target of constructing at least 12,000 kms of national highways as against 9829 kms achieved during 2017-18, and make special efforts to take this length to 16000 km. Overall, more than about 61,300 km length of road projects, costing more than Rs. 6.48 lakh crore, are in progress at present. The balance ongoing works (which have been awarded, appointed dates declared and works going on at sites) are more than 30,200 kms during the year. In the first nine months of FY 2018-19, 5,759 km has been completed in 18-19 against 4,942 km up to same period in last year.

1.2 In order to achieve this target the Ministry brought in policies, guidelines and practices for expediting pre-construction activities and bringing in more efficiency and transparency in the process. The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS)was developed to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC Mode. BhoomiRashi portal is being used extensively for expediting the process of notification for land acquisition. The portal BIMS and BhoomiRashi portals have further been linked with Public Financial Management System(PFMS) to facilitate real time payment to beneficiaries.

1.3 On the finance front too, National Highways Authority of India did a successful financial closure of its first project under Toll- Operate -Transfer this year andoffered 586 km of national highways under the second bundle. The first TOT bundle of 9 projects, totaling approximately 681 KM of roads in two states of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, was awarded earlier during the year for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the Authority's estimate. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) also got an unsecured loan of Rs 25,000 crore from State Bank of India for 10 years with 3 years of moratorium on repayments. This is the largest amount of loan to have been sanctioned to NHAI in one stroke by any institution. This is also the largest long term unsecured loan sanctioned by SBI at a time to any entity.

A two days long exercise was conducted to review of over 700 ongoing National Highway projects in the country, and over 300 projects were identified to be completed by 2019 achieving the highest ever construction in financial year 2018-19.

The table below details the trends of NH construction over the years.

This is the umbrella program for the highways sector unrolled in 2017-18, that aims to optimize the efficiency of road traffic movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. 34,800 km of National Highways are to be constructed under the Phase-I of the programme between 2017-18 to 2021-22 in a phased manner at a cost of Rs. 5,35,000 crore. This includes 5,000 kms of the National Corridors, 9000 kms of Economic Corridors, 6000 km of Feeder Corridors and Inter-Corridors, 2000 kms of Border Roads, 2,000 kms of Coastal Roads and Port Connectivity Roads and 800 kms of Green-field Expressways.

Projects for 6,407 km road length have been awarded under the BharatmalaPariyojana(including residual NHDP) till the end of October this year. DPRs are being prepared for projects for the balance length. De- congestion projects have been completed for 13 out of 191 congestion points identified, and are under progress for de-congestion of 80 other points. In addition, DPRs are being prepared for 93 congestion points.Out of the 35 locations identified for Multimodal Logistics Parks, DPRs have been initiated for 7 locations and availability of land parcels is being confirmed with State Governments for the rest of the locations.

In order to ensure safe and smooth flow of traffic, Ministry has envisaged a plan for replacement of Level Crossings on National Highways by ROBs/ RUBs under a scheme known as SetuBharatam. Under this programme, out of 174 ROBs/RUBs which are to be constructed, 91 have been sanctioned with an estimated cost of Rs.7,104.72 crore. Out of 91 sanctioned, 59 ROBs/RUBs have been awarded which are in various stages of progress.

The project envisages development of easy access to the four prominent Dhams, namely, Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedranath and Badrinath, situated in the state of Uttrakhand. These four Dhams are prominent pilgrimage centres. The project entails development of 889 km of roads with configuration of two-lane with paved shoulders at an estimated cost of about Rs. 12,000 crore. The projects are being taken up on EPC mode and the programme is targeted for completion by March, 2020.

The two projects of Peripheral Expressways around Delhi, comprising 135 km Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), and 135 km Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE) connecting NH-1 and NH-2 from Western and Eastern side of Delhi was completed this year and inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May 2018 and November 2018 respectively. The EPE was constructed by NHAI and WPE by Haryana Government. The two expressways were envisaged with the twin objectives of decongesting and de-polluting the national capital by diverting the traffic not destined for Delhi.

The EPE stretches from Kundli on NH 1 to Palwal on NH 2, and was constructed at a cost ofRs. 4617.87 crore, in addition to Rs. 5900crorewere spent on acquiring 1700 acres of land. It was completed in a record time of about 500 days against the scheduled target of 910 days. It is a fully access-controlled six-lane expressway with a closed tolling system. The expressway has an iconic toll plaza equipped with electronic toll collection infrastructure, ITS control system of the entire EPE and a digital art gallery, with holographic models of major structures and making of the EPE. Weigh-in-Motion equipment at all 30 entry points, solar power on the entire length, eight solar power plants with a capacity of 4000 KW, rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation and 36 replicas of monuments depicting Indian culture and heritage are major features of this expressway. This project has generated employment opportunities of about 50 lakh man-days.

The 8.36 km long Package -1 of the projects was inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May this year. It is a 14 lane, access-controlledsection stretching from Nizammudin Bridge to Delhi UP Border, and was completed in a record time of 18 months as against the earlier expected construction period of 30 months, at a cost of about Rs. 841.50 crore. This is the first National Highway in the country with 14 lanes, and has several features that would help reduce pollution. These include a 2.5-metre-wide cycle track on either side of the highway, a vertical garden on the Yamuna Bridge, solar lighting system and watering of plants through drip irrigation only.

Package II from UP Border to Dasna(19.28 km), Package -III - Dasna to Hapur( 22.27) km and Package -IV - Green-field Alignment from Dasna to Meerut -(31.78 km) are under construction and are likely to be completed by March 2019.

The 473 km expressway will link Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway to Mumbai-Pune Expressway thus providing Expressway connectivity from Ahmedabad to Pune for a length of about 650 Km.

This 1250 km Expressway is being developed along a new alignment between Delhi and Mumbai, which passes through backward and tribal districts of Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. A sum of one lakh crore rupees will be spent on this expressway.It will reduce the distance between Delhi and Mumbai from the present 1450km through NH 8 to 1250 km, and the travel time to 12 hours. The sections of proposed highway from Delhi to Dahod in Rajasthan are under tendering, while the section between Vadodara to Ankleshwar in Gujarat have already been awarded. The DPR is under progress for the remaining sections.

DPR is under progress for this 260 km Expressway. This is a green-field alignment. There are two existing roads connecting Bangalore-Chennai, one is via Hoskote (Bangalore)-AP then to Chennai & second is via Electronic City (Bangalore) Hosur(Tamil Nadu) and then to Chennai. The alignment of the proposed expressway is passing in between these two stretches.

Greenfield alignment is being explored for this 500 km long proposed Expressway.

DPR has been awarded and alignment finalization is under progress for the new green-field 940 km Nagpur - Hyderabad - Bangalore EXP.

DPR is in progress for 75 km of Kanpur - Lucknow EXP

Hon'ble Prime Minister inaugurated the 16.55 km, Rs 759.36 crore Varanasi Ring Road Phase-I and 17.25 km, Rs 812.59 crore Babatput-Varanasi road on NH-56 in November. It has reduced the travel time from Varanasi to the airport, and is proving a big relief to the people of Varanasi and to tourists providing a more convenient access to Sarnath, an important site for Buddhist pilgrimage.

The Ministry has taken up construction of a signature 4-lane Bridge to connect the mainland at Okha to Byet-Dwarka Island off the Gujarat Coast with this SignatureBridge spanning a length of 2.32 kms. The Project has been awarded on 01.01.2018 at a cost of Rs. 689.47 crores. This will be the longest span cable stayed bridge in India with the main span of 500 mtrs. The project is scheduled to be completed in a period of 30 months.

Approval has been given for a project for construction of 9.9 km long new 6 - lane bridge across river Ganga on NH - 96 at Phaphamau in Allahabad with total capital cost of Rs. 1948.25 crore. The construction period for the project is three years and likely to be completed by December, 2021. The new bridge will resolve the traffic congestion on existing old 2 - lane Phaphamau bridge on NH-96 at Allahabad. The new bridge will also facilitate to the large congregation of people at Holy City Allahabad during Kumbh, Ardh-Kumbh and other yearly ritual baths at SANGAM in Prayag. This will give a boost to pilgrimage tourism and local economy of Holy city of Prayag. This new 6 - lane bridge will also be beneficial for the Lucknow / Faizabad bound traffic coming from Madhya Pradesh via National Highway - 27 and National Highway - 76 through Naini Bridge. In addition, this project of new bridge will generate direct employment during construction for about 9.20 lakh mandays.

Approval was given to a project for construction of 6.930 km long 4-lane bridge at Phulaut in Bihar, along with approval for rehabilitation and up-gradation of existing Birpur- Bihpur section of National Highway-106. The construction of this new Bridge will fill the existing 30 km long gap between Udakishanganj and Bihpur of National Highway Number 106 in Bihar, which will provide through connectivity between Nepal/ North Bihar/ East-West Corridor (passing through NH- 57) and South Bihar/ Jharkhand/ Golden Quadrilateral (passing through NH -2), besides full utilization of National Highway Number-31.

A network of 35 Multimodal Logistics Parks had been identified for development in the Phase - 1 of BharatmalaPariyojana. The availability of the land parcels for development of Multimodal Logistics Parks has been confirmed at 7 locations and DPRs have been initiated in all the nodes.

This is a project for constructing a 14.150 km long, 2-lane bi-directional Zojila Tunnel in Jammu & Kashmir. This would be India's longest road tunnel and the longest bi-directional tunnel in Asia. The construction of this tunnel will provide all weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil and Leh and will bring about all round economic and socio-cultural integration of these regions.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the construction, operation and maintenance of the 2- Lane, 4.532 Km long Bi-directional Silkyara Bend - Barkot Tunnel on Dharasu-Yamunotri section along NH -134 in the State of Uttarakhand. The project forms part of the Chardham Plan. The construction period of the project is 4 years at an estimated cost of Rs. 1383.78 crore. Once complete, this stretch will reduce the travel distance from Dharasu to Yamunotri by about 20 Km and travel time byaboutanhour.It will also provide all weather connectivity to Yamunotri, encouraging regional socio-economic development, trade and tourism within the country. The project will be implemented by National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. (NHIDCL).

Around Rs. 1,90,000 crore worth of projects have been sanctioned for the construction of road projects for over 12,000 km in the North East region. The projects being executed by NHIDCL are to the tune of Rs. 1, 66,026 crore, covering 10,892 km of roads in all the eight NE states. Projects costing Rs. 17,257 crore have been allotted to the respective state PWDs. Further, projects costing Rs. 7,000 crore are entrusted to the NHAI.

The Ministry has focused on completion of on-going projects along with sanction and award of new projects. A total of 73 projects (8,187 km) worth an estimated investment of Rs.1,00,000 crore wereidentified as Languishing Projects. The reasons for delay were identified and policy interventions undertaken to address the same.

The Ministry is monetizing its road assets constructed with public funds through Toll-Operate-Transfer (ToT) scheme. The scheme envisages bidding of bundled national highways for a concession period of 30 years. The first bundle comprised 9 projects, totalling 681 km of roads in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. It was awarded in 2018 to Macquarie for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the NHAI's estimate.The second bundle comprises over 586 kms spread over four states - Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal and Bihar. The offer has 12 toll plazas across four highways.

TheNational Highways Authority of India (NHAI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding(MoU)withtheStateBankofIndiatoreceiveRs.25,000croreasa long-term,unsecuredloanfor10years.Thisisthelargestamountofloantohavebeen sanctioned by the SBl in one go. This is also the largest ever fund that NHAI has ever received in one go.

The Ministry has issued detailed guidelines for determination of proper alignment of NH projects, advising executing agencies to examine the feasibility of a green- field alignment, especially in the case of economic corridors, instead of widening existing highways. This has been done because widening involves acquisition of land for Right of Way (RoW), shifting of utilities and demolition of built up structure, all of which involves a lot of time and cost. Also, earlier highways were largely planned to be serpentine, linking all possible towns in the vicinity. This road geometry has been found to be sub optimal, especially in case of economic corridors. BharatmalaPariyojanaalso calls for a corridor approach for economic corridors. It has also been found in a few test cases that it is feasible to acquire a RoW of 60 to 70 mtrs for a green field road project at the same cost as involved in the expansion of an existing road, especially when the associated costs and time taken in utility shifting, tree felling, additional compensation for demolition of structures coming in the RoW under expansion are taken into account.

AWebUtilityhasbeendevelopedwherebythelandacquisitionprocedureforthe NH projects, including processing of all LA related gazette notifications, are being done through a common platform called ""BhoomiRashi"". The Utility has been linked with the e-gazette platform of the MinistryofUrbanDevelopment,GovernmentofIndia,forpublicationofGazette Notifications.TheuseofBhumi Rashi has helped in cutting down the processing time from 2 to 3 months earlier to one to two weeksnow.

BhoomiRashi has also been integrated with the Public Financial Management System(PFMS)platformoftheMinistryofFinancefordepositofcompensationin theaccountsoflandowners/interestedpersonsonarealtimebasis, instead of being parked with CALA.

The Ministry has developed a Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC mode for all NH works and centrally sponsored works.BIMS acts as a data base for allbasic details of bidders like civil works experience, cash accruals and network, annual turnover etc,. This allows quick pre-qualification assessment of bidders based on evaluation parameters like threshold capacity and bid capacity from already stored data. Technical evaluationcantherefore be carried out faster using this information.

AnnualawardsforexcellenceinNationalHighwayssectorhasbeeninstitutedfrom thisyearonwardsforrecognizingconcessionairesandcontractorswhohavebeen performing exceptionally well. Applications have been invited from all the concessionaires and contractors working in the field of highways construction and tolling. These awards are designed across the fivecategories of construction management, operation and maintenance, best toll plaza, safest highway, innovation in design and construction technology.

India's first Highway Capacity Manual developed by CSIR-CRRI was launched this year. The manual is designed to be a tool for guiding road engineers and policy makers in the country. It lays down guidelines for the development and management of different types of roads, based on traffic characteristics on such roads having varying lane configurations.

The Ministry has organized a workshop on 18.12.2018 in Delhi for Regional Officers of Ministry, NHAI and NHIDCL to discuss the issues relating to land acquisition, contract document (EPC/DPR) and E-Disha (ERP projects), new standards and technical specifications. A Manual of Guidelines on Land Acquisition for National Highways under the National Highways Act, 1956 has also been released for seamless process of Land Acquisition for National Highways.

As per the Ministry's annual report on road accidents based on the data reported by Police authorities throughout India, there has been some marginal reduction in the number of road accidents and fatalities in 2017, as can be seen from the table below.

The Ministry has been making concerted efforts to address the problem of road safety through a series of measures that include improving road infrastructure, road safety audits, identification and rectification of black spots on roads and strengthening the automobile safety standards, organizing road safety awareness programmes and strengthening enforcement etc. These efforts have started showing some results.

The Ministry has so far identified 789 road accident black spots in various States of which 651 ON National Highways and 138 are on State roads. Work for rectification of these black spots is at various stages of completion.

The Ministry has been working in association with States, Vehicle manufactures and NGOs for strengthening the driving training. Institute of Driving training and Research (IDTRs), Regional Driving Training Centres (RDTCs) and Driving Training Centre (DTC) have been established which act as model Driving Training Centres with state of art infrastructure. Ministry has also launched a scheme for creating driving training centres in all the districts of the country and support refresher-training programme for heavy commercial vehicles drivers. The Ministry is implementing a scheme for setting up of Model Institute of Drivers Training and Research (IDTR) by States/UTs. So far 24 (nos.) ITDRs have been sanctioned in different States/UTs and bout 16 are complete and functioning.

The Ministry has issued guidelines associating Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) for promoting awareness about road safety under a scheme titled ""Grant of financial assistance for administering Road Safety Advocacy and awards for the outstanding work done in the field of Road Safety"". It is envisaged that the NGOs will undertake activities for creating road safety awareness among citizens.

A mobile App and Toll- free Emergency number 1033 for highway users, developed by NHAI, were launched in March this year. The SukhadYatra mobile application provides information on toll gates. The key feature of the app includes a provision for the user to enter road quality-related information or to report any accident or pothole on the highway. It also provides users with real-time data related to waiting time expected at toll plazas and various facilities like points of interest, highway nest/ nest mini, etc. The app can also be used to purchase FASTags.

The toll-free number 1033 will enable users to report an emergency condition, or highway-related feedback, across the highway. The service has also been integrated with ambulance / tow away services along the roads.

This Ministry observed the 29th National Road Safety Week from 23to 30April 2018. This year's focus was on schools and commercial drivers and the theme was ""Sadak Suraksha JeevanRaksha"". In the opening ceremony the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways emphasized the Ministry's priorities in ensuring safety of road users in the country. Awards were given to 10 school children who won the national level essay competition on road safety. The Hon'ble Minister also administered the road safety pledge to all those present on theoccasion. A variety of programmes related to the Road Safety were also organized in several cities across the country to enlighten people on Road Safety, and Driving Rules. Many NGOs participated in the Ministry's efforts to create awareness about the issue.

The Ministry had constituted a group of State Transport Ministers under the Chairmanship of Shri Yunus Khan, Transport Minister of Rajasthan to work out interstate issues and reach a consensus on adoption of uniform rates of taxation, permits and other issues. A Group of Transport Ministers from 13 states met in Guwahati on 18-19 April this year and adopted a 9-Point Guwahati Declaration aimed at harmonization of taxes and permits, road safety measures, policy changes and measures for strengthening State Road Transport Undertakings. The most important decisions taken by during the meeting included the recommendation for One Nation One Tax for the diverse road tax structure, which would ease travel.

In order to help accident victims in getting reasonable and fast compensation from insurance companies, the Ministry revised the relevant rules of the Motor Vehicles Act according to which every accident victim or his next of kin will be entitled to a compensation of Rs 5 lakh in case of death, and uptoRs 5 lakh, proportionate to the extent of injury in case of grievous hurt and disablement. Accident victims can claim higher compensation through court if they are not satisfied, but with this rule even the poorest of the poor will get a fast and reasonable compensation.

A Central Command and Control Centre is being set up at the NHAI HQ for CCTV surveillance and Monitoring of Vehicular Congestion at 210 Fee Plazas of National Highways that have higher traffic volumes. it is proposed to be connected with Regional Offices and the project execution is on service model for a period of five years.

Three short films for generating public awareness for the need to comply with the rules of the road, eventually contributing to the cause of road safety, were launched by Hon'ble Minister for Road Transport & Highways, on 14th' August, 2018. Film actor Shri Akshay Kumar who featured in these films on pro bono basis, has also been appointed as Road Safety Brand Ambassador by the Hon'ble Minister.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has designated the Asian Institute of Transport Development as an apex body for capacity building in the area of road safety. The objective is that this centre would act as a depository of research studies and best practices.Human resource development and exchange of knowledge form an important component of its activities. Up to October 2018, the National Centre for Road Safety has been able to train over 1,400 professionals in road safety and road safety audit by conducting 31 courses pan India.

The Ministry took several initiatives in the transport sector during the year to make road travel more convenient for people. Some of these areas under-

To improve ease in licensing, this Ministry has simplified the driving license application form. Four forms i.e. (a) Learner License, (b) Driving License, (c) Renewal of License, and (d) updation of Address - all have been consolidated into one. The new form will enable Aadhar based verification of the applicant's identity to provide online services for renewal, change of address etc. Another highlight of the new form is that it would capture an applicant's willingness for organ donation.

The permissible safe axle weight of goods vehicles was revised and increased by about 15% to 20 % for different configurations of axles. The decision was taken with a view to help in increasing the carrying capacity of goods transport vehicles and bring down logistics cost. The amendment will increase the carrying capacity of goods vehicles by about 20-25 % and lower logistics costs by about 2%. It will also bring down the incidence of overloading. While automobile technology and road construction quality have improved greatly over the years, the axle loads have remained the same since 1983 when they were last notified. There was a felt need to harmonize the axle load with international standards.

NHAI has developed a matrix-based methodology to rank the Fee Plazas on parameters such as electronic tolling, time taken in clearance of FASTag lanes, display panels, staff behaviour, cleanliness, etc. The data for the matrix is to be collected by the Regional Officers who will use the same to rank the Fee Plazas under their jurisdiction. Meanwhile, a countrywide drive was launched by NHAl on more than 300 toll plazas across the country on 10 February, 2018, to address issues that affect highway users. Officers visited toll plazas and addressed issues of user convenience and took feedback from the people.

The Ministry has revised the maximum speed of various classes of vehicles vide notification dated 6th April 2018. The notification prescribes the speed of various classes of vehicles. Thus a passenger vehicle with not more than 8 seats including driver can have a maximum speed of 120 km/hr on expressways and 70km/hr on municipal roads.

An advisory has been issued by the Ministry to all the States / UTs to accept the documents in electronic form through DigiLocker platform of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India and the mParivahan mobile app of the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways.

6.3 Linkage of PFMS with Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) and BhoomiRashi

The two IT initiatives of this Ministry, which are aimed at expediting pre- construction processes relating to bidding and land acquisition respectively, have now been integrated with the Public Financial management System (PFMS). The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) is aimed at streamlining the process of pre-qualification of bidders for EPC Mode of contracts for National Highway workswithenhanced transparency and objectivity. The BhoomiRashiportal of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways allows for totally digital and paper-less processing of land acquisition cases, and has resulted in transparent, quick, corruption-free and error-free handling of land acquisition cases. It has alsomade the possible real-time tracking of activities and generation of reports relating to land acquisition. Revenue records of about 7 lakh villages across the country have been integrated in the portal. This digital change has drastically reduced the time taken for issuance of land acquisition notifications from 3-6 months to 1-2 weeks. Over 2000 notifications have already been issued by the Ministry in the first eight months of this financial year that while during the past two years, about a thousand land acquisition notifications could be issued every year. The process has also brought transparency in the system. Earlier the approved compensation amount used to be parked with the CALA (Competent Authority for Land Acquisition) but with BhoomiRashi portal this amount directly transferred into the account of the person concerned, through Public Financial Management System which is an integral part of the portal. In addition to this, the process is also environment friendly since there is no physical movement of files - all work is done digitally.

An advisory has been issued by this Ministry wherein the citizen can produce the transport related documents such as registration, insurance, fitness and permit, the driving licence, certificate for pollution under check and any other relevant documents, if required, in physical or electronic form, on demand by any police officer in uniform or any other officer authorized by the State Government in this behalf. This would enable the use of digital platforms for carrying and verification of the documents and is a step towards citizen facilitation and to ensure so that citizen are not harassed/ inconvenienced.

A teacher in the garb of an entrepreneur is not someone who comes around too often.

Probably this combination provided the perfect ingredients to build one of the world's most successful edutech start-ups, as Byju Raveendran has shown.

After its most recent round of funding of $540 million from Naspers, General Atlantic and Canadian Pension Fund, valuing the company at $3.6 billion, Byju's has emerged as the most valuable edutech start-up globally.

The company's valuation has quadrupled in the past year, making it among the top five most valuable Internet companies in India.

IMAGE: 'Byju's has expanded it's reach 4x to almost 2,000 towns and cities.' Photograph: Kind courtesy byjuslearningapp/Facebook.com

Starting out as a math teacher pre-2010, Raveendran, an engineering graduate who, after spending a couple of years at a shipping company, realised, like so many others, that his calling was in fact somewhere else.

Taking time off his job, he would help his friends and whoever else wanted to learn crack math and science at entrances such as CAT.

Finding his calling in teaching, he quit his job and started pursuing the career full time.

Soon, he was giving lectures in cities across India.

Raveendran consolidated all his learning and started Byju's in 2011, initially with members of his own learning group.

It's not like other companies did not build education businesses using new-age technology -- EduComp, the firm that installed tablets and interactive screens in schools, had a good run before going bust few years ago -- but Byju's success, standalone in its scale, was on the back of its product.

""Raveendran is very focused on deep conceptual learning and has therefore built a path breaking approach to teaching complex concepts.

""Their product pushes for deep conceptual clarity, helping students perform better and achieve better learning outcomes,"" said Ruchira Shukla, regional lead, Venture Capital, International Finance Corporation, an investor in Byju's since 2016.

""Since we invested, Byju's has expanded its reach 4x to almost 2,000 towns and cities.""

Byju's sells online learning modules for a fee.

The content can be consumed on smartphones, tablets and desktops.

It has built its own repository of content by bringing in thousands of teachers and experts, making the firm a dominant player in the school education market (K12) and the go-to place for entrance examination preparation as well.

As of today, Byju's completes monthly sales to the tune of Rs 1 billion from its approximately 1.3 million paid subscribers.

""After initially creating the material (pre-recorded video lessons) himself, Raveendran continued to work intimately on the content side.

""That got the firm good word-of-mouth publicity in the early days before it installed crazy country-wide sales teams,"" said an education tech entrepreneur who closely tracks the company.

As the company grew, Byju's doubled down on sales, creating a country-wide network of 'feet-on-the-street'.

The quality of school education in India is still not the best and parents, in any place big or small, typically spend on learning outside the school.

Byju, who hails from a coastal town of Azhikode in Kerala, realised that learning is universal and, since the initial days, has led a parallel sales effort in small non-metro town and cities.

Investors swear by Raveendran's insights into the education market, his clarity as far as his business plan is concerned and his vision for the future.

He wants to create a global platform for learning that can be used in all markets.

For now, the company is working on launching in English-speaking markets, mainly the US and the UK.

'We are in the process of building products for the international markets. Our core focus is on getting the K-3 (for grades 1, 2 and 3) product ready for launch in the next 6-8 months.

'For our global product, we looked for acquisitions (abroad) but did not find a perfect fit. Hence, we decided to build the product for the global audience in-house.

'We are working with some of the most popular YouTube teachers who are experts in their own domains,' Raveendran said in an emailed statement.

Byju's scale has also helped the company attract global investors such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the philanthropic fund of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, which led a $50-million investment in the company in September 2016.

Since then, the company has gone on to raise almost $725 million, from a clutch of investors including Chinese Internet giant Tencent.

Even as Byju's looks at opportunities overseas, the company says its key focus will remain in India.

There are over 260 million students enrolled in schools in India, more than even China, making it the largest opportunity of its kind in the world, Raveendran explains.

He has said that unlike his e-commerce peers, who are out to create a market from scratch, the market for education already exists and it's up for grabs."

A 40-YEAR-OLD carpenter, who was arrested for allegedly stealing cash and valuables worth Rs 5 lakh from a doctor's residence in Sion on Wednesday, claimed that he committed the crime to pay his children's school fee. The accused, Imtiyaz Abdul Ansari, recently secured bail for another offence before being nabbed for the theft, Sion police said. A Kurla resident, Ansari had over 19 cases registered against him.

""Ansari said it was his first crime in the central suburbs. He further claimed that he stole to pay the school fee of his daughter and two sons, studying in class 11, 9 and 8, respectively. He said that he used the cash to pay for electricity and other household bills,"" said an investigator.

The complainant Pushpa Gala(61) is a resident of Sion, while her husband is a doctor who runs a clinic in Malad.

Ansari contacted the doctor after reading his phone number outside the Malad clinic, police said.

""He called them and asked if they were looking for a carpenter. Ansari claimed that he had worked at their residence few years ago and that's how he has their number. After they replied positively, the accused went to their residence to repair their door lock on December 21,"" said a police officer. While working in the bedroom, Ansari saw that the locker keys were kept on the bed. As soon as he got the opportunity, he opened the locker and stole cash and valuables.

""After finishing the work, Ansari left the house. The incident came to light the next day, after the complainant's daughter, who returned from a trip abroad, noticed that the valuables were missing. Then they approached the police,"" said an officer.

The officer, who rarely saw a stable posting, is fondly remembered by many seniors.

""When I see politicians pouring out condolence messages and praising Madhukar Shetty's honesty, I feel like laughing out loud. Many senior officers made sure that he was shunted from one post to another,"" a retired senior police officer said.

Retired DGP RK Dutta and IPS officer Madhukar Shetty, in 2009, had made the lives of several corrupt leaders uncomfortable. He was responsible for the arrest of MLA Sampangi, and then submitted a report on illegal mining that eventually forced the then CM B S Yeddyurappa to resign from office.

Speaking about this, Dutta said, ""There were many influential people who were arrested during his tenure. He always believed in correcting the system."" Shetty, reportedly, also wanted to devise a course on 'anti-corruption' for the force.

""He believed that there was no place for corruption within an institution like Lokayukta. But when his beliefs were challenged, he submitted a report on his own department and left the country to do his PhD. He would often ask - 'Why are we punishing the victims and not the accused?',"" another officer said.

Recollecting an incident, a senior police officer who worked with him at Lokayukta said, ""Once, there was a constable who was caught accepting a bribe of around Rs 2,000.

Shetty always met the accused after to know their reasons. When he was talking to the said constable, the latter's phone kept ringing. Shetty saw that it was his wife on the phone and answered the call and put it on speaker mode. Shetty was moved with that call. His wife, in a complaining tone, said, ""We've crossed the deadline to pay our child's school fee, and you haven't been home in two days. Tomorrow, our son will be asked to stand outside. What should I tell him?' she asked. The officer promptly gave them money for fees from his own pocket, and only revealed to the wife what her husband had done after the fee was paid.

While many say that Shetty himself was not interested in high profile postings, an officer revealed, ""Siddaramaiah, and even Kumaraswamy, wanted him to give him higher postings in the city, but Shetty was not interested. The reasons, for him, may have been due to compromising on truth and being prepared to 'listen' and 'cooperate' with all.""

Fascinated by them, she purchased some. Then she had no idea that one day she will create artefacts using shells.

Radha Mallappa (55), a native of Hullahalli, Nanjangud taluk, who was already interested in art work, thought of creating artefacts using seashells. Seeing her zeal, her mother S Susheelamma encouraged her to create some unique art pieces. It was a turning point in Radha's life. By the time she turned 20, she had created a niche for herself in the art field.

Today, her Seashell Art Museum, located on Chamundi Hill Road, and inaugurated on December 3, 2017, exhibits over 130 exquisite and unique artworks created using seashells. Her collection of shells is so vast that one will be surprised to find different sizes, shapes and colours.

All this did not happen in one day. It was the result of painstaking effort and care. She has spent about 6-8 years to create each masterpiece investing 14-18 hours per day. She has created art pieces up to 14 feet in height. Wherever required, she has used plywood to give the finishing and support for the structures.

Huge artefacts of Lord Ganesha, Shiva Temple, Saint Philomena's Church, Taj Mahal hold the visitors remain spellbound. She has made it to the Guinness World Records for creating the largest seashell Ganesh.

Radha says, ""Using conch shell, nautilus shell, coral, coral shell, silver bath, sea glass, and other treasures from the sea we can incorporate simple ideas and decorate homes. Many think creating an art piece using seashells is very easy. But it's not as simple as they think.

A lot of dedication and patience is needed."" She has collected seashells from places like Muscat (Oman beaches), Andaman, Nicobar, Rameswaram and Mangaluru. She has developed a network with the distributors of seashells. She places orders after finalising the colour, size of the shells with the help of social media. She says, ""The variety of seashells found in one ocean is not available in another ocean.

There are several hues available in seashells and I love to collect them from different parts of the world.""

""Selection of seashells of the same size, colour is in itself a big task. We hardly get 1 to 1.5 kg of the same size, colour seashells out of a 10 kg pack. We have to spend hours to come out with artworks,"" explains Radha, who has been conferred with several awards by various organizations and associations.

""The most common question the visitors ask is if I have painted the seashells. When they come to know they are natural, they are surprised. Their next question is if shells are available is so many colours.""

Radha prefers to use cleaned shells as the cleaning procedure is quite difficult. First, the shells have to be rinsed, bleached and cleaned until the smell goes. They will be rinsed in acid to give brightness. Oils are used to preserve the natural colours.

In the initial days, she had gifted several artefacts. Later, she thought of opening a museum and started creating exquisite pieces. ""My wish is to create a replica of Mysuru Palace, the wonders of the world and the famous Jog Falls,"" says Radha, who has spent crores of rupees on creating these pieces and setting up the museum. She has also sold her house.

Different Strokes

She has created more than 240 varieties of craft work. She creates artworks from discarded waste material, which include peels of onion, garlic, groundnut, cardamom, etc. She is also an expert in Mysore and Thanjavur style painting, embossing works. She has opened a small sales counter inside the museum spread over 50x80 square feet, where she sells small artefacts and daily wearable objects like hairpins, saree pins, clips, key bunches, and other showpieces for visiting customers and tourists.

Best out of waste

Flowers are created out of onion skin, walnut-pista-almond peels, fish wire, gunny bag, betel nut skin, cow horns skin, cardamom skin, groundnut skin, corn skin and garlic skin, plastic paper etc,

So he gave himself a new identity: IAS officer Vishal Kumar.

For several months, this 'officer' -- who identified himself as a district magistrate, spoke in a rasping tone and was unusually forthright in telling government officials which issue to take up and what to ignore -- managed to keep up the ruse of authority. But the bubble had to burst and it did on Saturday when police saw Tyagi for who he was. Head down, handcuffed, visibly afraid, and stripped of his manufactured IAS trappings, Tyagi was marched by a posse of policemen into Badalpur police station and booked under sections 419 (impersonating) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC, which carries a maximum prison term of seven years.

Tyagi was arrested from Dujana village in Greater Noida, where he was hiding. Police said he was trying to get work done in favour of people known to him in exchange for money.

Tyagi, a resident of Sahibabad, would call up senior officials with authority to take decisions in any government department if someone paid him enough to get his work done. A driver by profession, he would identify himself as Vishal Kumar, a 2005-batch IAS officer of the Rajasthan cadre, and get directives passed in his favour.

Police said he was enjoying this authority for the past several months until he dialled the number of SP (rural) Vineet Jaiswal last week. Tyagi wanted Jaiswal to clear the papers for a car that his friend Chaman wanted to sell. In the process, he gave away.

""His language was quite unbecoming of a senior official. He would identify himself as a district magistrate, but would never name the district. He would say he is a DM from Rajasthan. I doubted his intentions when he called me up to get a work as minor as getting approval for a car's papers done,"" Jaiswal said.

According to the officer, Tyagi had made calls to the income tax, land revenue and transport departments. At times, he would call up station house officers of various police stations and allegedly get them to drop cases against his acquaintances.

Tyagi's orders raised more eyebrows when he called up the SHO of Badalpur police station a few days back.

""He had been calling repeatedly for a minor case to be resolved. I doubted him by the way he spoke over the phone. My suspicion became stronger when he mentioned the batch year (2005) when I asked him about his state cadre. I asked an officer to put his mobile phone on surveillance. He was tracked and then arrested,"" Jaiswal said.

Tyagi charged a fee for getting orders passed and hurdles cleared for his friends. ""Police are tracking his bank accounts and other financial details,"" Jaiswal said. He graduated from LR College in Sahibabad last year. His mother is a primary teacher in a private school in Ghaziabad and his father works with a CA firm.

""Police have recovered a mobile phone from him. But the phone is not the one with which he would make the calls. We are examining his call records. He had made calls to the income tax, sales and several other departments,"" Jaiswal said. ""When he was questioned, he vehemently denied all the allegations against him. Then, he confessed to the crime,"" the SP added.

Tyagi, however, has an IAS connection, distant though it may be. His employer -- he works as a driver -- is the brother of a 2016-batch IAS officer of Tripura cadre."

The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) will take over security of the highly sensitive Srinagar Airport. At present, the CRPF handles security here. The move comes after a proposal to handover security of all three airports in the state -- Srinagar, Jammu and Leh -- to the CISF was cleared by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) last month. As a first step, the CISF has conducted the first man-power survey at the Srinagar airport. According to officials, the agency would be initially taking charge of anti-hijacking operations.

GPS-enabled buses in Srinagar soon

The State Road Transport corporation (SRTC) will soon kick off the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) -fitted buses to ferry tourists in the state. An official said the state government is procuring GPS-enabled buses. ""It is also supporting purchases by private transporters for easing mobility and traffic congestion in the Srinagar,"" he said.

While the new buses would be added to the SRTC fleet, the private transport companies plying services in the city would be provided certain incentives for purchasing such vehicles. The move is aimed at providing better and hassle-free transport services to tourists i. The new fleet would have a two-fold monitoring system. One GPS control room would be established at SRTC while the second one would be set up at Traffic Headquarters to monitor.

Brick kiln owners asked to switch to green-tech

In order to protect the environment, the Governor Administration in Jammu and Kashmir has asked brick kiln owners of the state to switch over to eco-friendly Zig Zag technology. In zigzag kilns, bricks are arranged to allow hot air to travel in a zigzag path.

The length of the zigzag air path is about three times that of a straight line, and this improves the heat transfer from the flue gases to the bricks, making the entire operation more efficient. It ensures uniform distribution of heat, helps reduces coal consumption to about 20 per cent and also reduces emissions considerably.

School fee charged in winter months

Private schools in Kashmir charge tuition and bus fees for nearly three winter months during which the schools remain closed. By 15th of December, every school in the Valley announces winter vacations till March. However, despite closing schools, authorities charge the tuition and bus fare from the parents of the students and most of the schools force the parents to pay the winter fee in a single go before closure of schools for winter months. People have been appealing the Director School Education Kashmir to act against the schools, who are forcing parents to pay."

With the new academic year set to commence in the next few months, there are various key decisions that are now lying in the backburner as the CM is yet to allot ministries to the newly-elected members of the assembly.

Take for instance the schedule for common entrance tests and school admissions. Last year, the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) had declared the schedule for all common entrance tests on December 28 and released the admission schedule for schools on December 30. However, this year, the government is yet to commence the process for the same. ""The release of the schedule will take another 2-3 weeks. We have to wait before the minister of education department is appointed,"" said Papi Reddy, chairman of TSCHE, adding that there won't be much of loss as there is sufficient time before the exams are held.

Finalising of a committee to issue notification for fee fixation of professional courses also lies pending. ""First, a committee is constituted that will issue a notification calling applications from private colleges to fix the fee structure for the next three years. Once we receive applications, the same shall be audited and subsequently fee will be fixed. However, we have to wait for the minister to be appointed to seek approval on the committee,"" said Rama Rao, consultant at Telangana Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee (TAFRC).

Other aspects such as affiliation process for intermediate colleges and finalization of admission process for degree courses are also pending.

Making matters worse, several key positions such as principal secretary, commissioner of school education and chairman of the TAFRC also have to be finalised by the new education minister.

The delay by the chief minister has not only irked the opposition parties but also the parents community. ""The fee hike issue has been pending for the last four years. While the TRS party added the school fee issue in it's manifestos in 2014 as well this year, no results were yielded. Once the education minister is appointed, we intend to meet him and seek relief before commencement of the new academic year,"" said Subramanyam Neerukonda, president of Hyderabad School Parents Association (HSPA)."

The civil supplies department, set up in 1918 when thousands of people fell victim to frequent episodes of famine, completed 100 years in August. The landmark event, though, went completely unnoticed. There were occasions when several pockets of princely Hyderabad state ran out of food stocks. Rice supplies, then, were rationed at 50 grams per head per day and it was increased to 100 grams only in 1950.

The pandemic flu of 1918 resulted in the decline of Hyderabad city population by 9.4% -- the population of Hyderabad state in the 1921 census was lower than that of 1911. There were more deaths than births and the decadal population dropped from 1.33 crore in 1911 to 1.24 crore in 1921. The flu which struck in September 1918 killed 46.5 people per 1000 that month and the death toll increased rapidly to 464 deaths per 1000 by Octoberend. Two per cent (3.50 lakh) of Hyderabad's population had been wiped out within a month.

2018 was also the year when the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), set up as Beri-Beri Enquiry Unit at Coonoor in Tamil Nadu, turned

100. It was shifted to Hyderabad in 1958.

Also completing a century was the Hyderabad Currency Act 1918 which introduced paper money for the first time. Earlier, only coins were in use. The Act came into force on June 4, 1918.

The Osmania University was also set up in 1918 though the institute celebrated the centenary in 2017.

While exams went online, campuses erupted with unrest and agitation

From reforms to resentment, 2018 was a mixed bag for students and parents. After almost two decades since its inception, common entrance tests such as Eamcet, ICET among others went online for those seeking admission to various professional courses.

In a major development, Telangana joined the national pool for medical courses by earmarking 15% of MBBS seats and 50% of postgraduate medical seats to students from other states.

What rocked Hyderabad this year was a string of student protests reported from top institutions such as Birla Institute of Technology Science, Tata Institute of Social Science, apart from other engineering colleges such as Vasavi College of Engineering, Chaitanya Bharati Institute of Technology etc. Their demands ranged from fee regulation to continuation of courses.

Those in school found no respite from the spiralling fee structure as the state government for the first time ordered school managements to maintain status-quo on the fee hike and issued an admission notification. Subsequently, on January 22, the Hyderabad High Court issued an interim order allowing schools to hike fee, leaving parents fuming. It was only closer to the end of year that the Delhi Public School, Mahendra Hills, decision to slash fee by 50% brought them some hope.

Apart from fees, two alleged cases of sexual abuse of primary students reported from a private school in Tolichowki, added to the angst of parents who demanded better surveillance in educational institutions.

City set to get an AIIMS, but will H1N1 deaths stop?

Right at the beginning, the government found itself in a spot with maternal deaths showing a three-fold jump since 2016-2017.

The core Hyderabad district itself reported as many as 105 maternal deaths compared to just 31 in 2017.

A worried healthcare department put all heads together and managed to bring things under control by strengthening government hospitals and introducing several health schemes, including KCR Kits, where pregnant women were given financial assistance in instalments towards the end of the year.

Fee regulation among several other issues triggered protests from students at top institutes such as TISS, BITS and many others

The maternal mortality rate (MMR) now stands at 70 female deaths per 100,000 live births. But right through the year, the government struggled to contain the deadly swine flu (H1N1) virus, with 154 deaths officially recorded till October this year and with 90% cases reported in Hyderabad city itself. If the battle to control the mutated virus was an uphill task, the dengue virus with 2,700 deaths and malaria with 1,500 deaths, underscored the government's failure to tackle diseases in Hyderabad. The health department also struggled to create more jobs and depute doctors and other necessary staff to rural areas, forcing patients to flock to Hyderabad's hospitals.

On a positive note, the decision to renovate the heritage block of the iconic Osmania General Hospital and build a new hospital premises, came as a welcome move. On December 20, Telangana received happy tidings, when the Union cabinet finally clearing the decks for the establishment of a new All India Institute for Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bibinagar, at a cost of Rs 1,028 crore. The new prestigious facility spread over 200 acres will also have 100 MBBS seats.

"21","1028092820","2018-12-28","https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blink/know/tell-me-a-story/article25848620.ece","Tell me a story","The Hindu Business Line",FALSE,"Anupam Dam, a pre-primary schoolteacher at the Purbachal Vidyapith School in Nadia, West Bengal, watched the quiet excitement among his students as they read this simple story -- by Mini Shrinivasan -- on a screen in the classroom. Within minutes, they were hooked to the story of a young boy climbing up, and learning how to come down. They slowly stitched together the simple words, read them aloud and figured out the rest from Deval Maniar's large illustrations.

The story had appeared on a split screen -- the Bengali version, their mother tongue, on one side, and English and Hindi on the other. The exercise was meant to prune their mother tongue skills and familiarise the Std 1 students with English. ""Most of the students are first- and second-generation learners,"" says Dam. ""It is difficult to get them to speak in English. They understand the language, but lack the confidence to converse in it.""

Dam, along with many other teachers, is trying to engage children with languages through stories. His aide in this exercise is StoryWeaver, an online repository of stories for children. Started in 2015 by Pratham Books, a not-for-profit publisher of children's books, StoryWeaver is not just a virtual library but is also viewed differently by diverse groups.

If Dam sees it as a teaching tool that opens up story chests for his students, Chetan Acharya, president of the Konkani Bhasha Mandal (KBM), looks at it as a medium to save small languages. To artist and traveller Sarayu Kamat, StoryWeaver books are the way to connect with a community. For language-based organisations and translation practitioners, it is a vast pool of resources.

It offers over 10,000 stories for children in 124 languages, including Bhoti (spoken in Ladakh), Kumaoni (in Uttarakhand), Santali (in eastern India) and Gondi (in south-central India) and foreign languages such as Kurdish, Afrikaans and Haitian Creole. The content on the website is available on open licence, making it free for anyone to translate it into any language. For instance, I Can Climb is available in 60 versions and 47 languages including Thai, Vietnamese, Khmer, Sinhala and Norwegian. Dam himself has translated over 25 stories on the platform -- from English and Hindi to Bengali and vice versa.

""The purpose of StoryWeaver is to create a reading ecosystem, driven by the ideas of inclusion and collaboration,"" says Himanshu Giri, CEO Pratham Books. Anyone can access the site or use the content for free. Translators, publishers and other organisations who make content available on StoryWeaver do so without charging a fee.

Free access separates StoryWeaver from the rest. Giri admits keeping the medium open-source is complicated when there are authors, illustrations and publishers on board. ""Asking any established author or illustrator to give away rights is tough. I call myself the copyleft model,"" quips Giri. Yet, StoryWeaver has managed to do so. On the upside, the platform offers authors and illustrators a reach that copyrighted material often does not have.

Bengaluru-based Pratham Books got a hint of the unprecedented reach of online stories when it put up material on open licence in 2009. It uploaded some 20 titles on a CC (creative commons) licence platform, on which a work can be freely shared, translated, altered and so on. ""Over a year, 20 became 100 with derivatives in multiple languages. Our books were being used to teach English in Tokyo, they were being translated online into Hebrew and Zulu,"" says Giri.

StoryWeaver thrives on collaboration, and has managed to create a larger community bound by stories. ""Some partnerships have evolved organically. Someone interested in translating a story into his/her mother tongue would approach us,"" says Giri. On the other hand, the platform has generated interest among diverse advocacy groups working in education, literacy and health, spurring partnerships and generating stories in local languages. The focus in StoryWeaver is on underserved, local languages. ""At the time of Independence we had over 2,600 languages, we are left with 700 now,"" points out Giri.

The platform attempts to push back at least a few languages from the brink of disappearance through local interventions. ""Technology will not help us scale unless people help us. Language is such a thing that needs human involvement,"" he adds.

Others -- such as governments and organisations -- are sitting up and taking note of StoryWeaver. The Arunachal Pradesh government has asked Pratham Books to establish libraries in government schools. ""Around 400 classrooms are digitally equipped,"" says Giri. CGnet Swara, the online voice portal that allows people in the central tribal belt to report local news, partnered with the platform to translate stories into Gondi. The website has over 250 stories in the language now.

Purvi Shah, Head, Digital Initiatives, Pratham Books, says the call to preserve a local language through stories often comes from the community. Suchana, an organisation working on child welfare and literacy in West Bengal, partnered with StoryWeaver to translate stories into Santali and Kora, another indigenous community language spoken in the region. ""Suchana evangelised the idea of translating from Bengali into these languages; now we have over 84 resources in Santali and Kora on the platform,"" says Shah.

As the partnership between Suchana and StoryWeaver has grown, so has the link of Santal and Kora communities with their stories. Since readers were often in remote areas, translated stories were downloaded in PDF format, saved on devices and taken to the grassroots. To make it effective in areas without internet access, the platform allows stories to be saved offline. ""Suchana has raised funds to print these stories into books,"" Shah says. It is making the stories accessible to Bengali-speaking teachers so that they can, in turn, spread the Santali books within the Santal communities and widen the reader base, she adds.

Shah calls it the ""ripple effect"", where a child warms up to the idea of reading, slowly sheds the fear of words and graduates to reading more. ""The goal is to create a large repository of mother tongue resources and instil in children the joy of reading in their language. That is why we never digress from stories,"" adds Shah.

The KBM's association with StoryWeaver is over two years old and has resulted in nearly 120 stories being translated into Konkani. ""Children should get a chance to read and think in their mother tongue. This is a small effort to save a language,"" says Acharya of KBM. Konkani, among the 22 languages that are a part of Schedule Eight of the Constitution and written in five different scripts, was waiting for a boost that would connect it with the young.

""Stories are one way of doing it,"" Acharya says. At the primary and secondary school run by the KBM in Madgaon, students were trained to browse and read on StoryWeaver. The mandal also conducted a workshop for schoolteachers, training them to use the platform and even try their hand at translation. Pratham Books and KBM together printed 50 translated titles. ""We made 500 copies of each book, and distributed them for free in 250 schools,"" Acharya adds.

StoryWeaver has also forayed into languages that barely have a history of children's literature. Earlier this year, it held a hackathon in Haryana by bringing together schoolteachers from 20 government schools to translate children's stories into Haryanvi, a language that closely resembles Hindi but does not boast a strong literary tradition. ""It is a deep-rooted oral language, and yet the schoolteachers who came for the hackathon did not remember reading a Haryanvi story growing up,"" says Amna Singh, associate language editor at Pratham Books. When a language begins to fade out of official use, it's considered an early marker of a bleak future. ""Documenting it is the best way to keep a language alive,"" Singh says.

At the two-day event, teachers were trained on the nuances of translating for children. They translated 74 stories from Hindi to Haryanvi, peer-reviewed and polished each other's work, and enhanced the StoryWeaver pool. The experience emboldened the team to conduct a second hackathon in Kolkata, this time bringing together language experts, students of literature and schoolteachers. The exercise had participants splitting their hair on how to aptly translate ""You are being silly, Mr Brown"" into Bengali.

""They animatedly discussed the most suitable translation for 'silly',"" Singh recalls.

Participants with different skill sets made the exercise vibrant. ""The schoolteachers were game changers. They were the closest to the children and would not allow a story to be sanitised,"" she adds. The teachers argued that if a story was cleansed to speak a language the children were unfamiliar with, it would never lure them to the classroom.

Collaborations at StoryWeaver have often extended into foreign shores and the Philippines-based QwertyWorks, a professional translation group, is one such international ally. ""We uploaded our very first book from StoryWeaver in April this year,"" says Jake Irwin Estrada, founder and CEO. In a matter of months, the group translated 67 books from the platform -- 23 were translated into Tagalog and 44 into Cebuano -- two languages spoken in the Philippines. ""We are currently working on translating more books into secondary Philippine languages such as Hiligaynon, Ilokano, Bikolano, and Tausug and Maranao,"" adds Estrada.

While most stories remain online, Estrada keeps a limited number of printed books to be distributed among children who attend public day-care centres near his office in Manila. ""Some of these children don't have enough money to buy food for school, let alone books,"" says Estrada. The children, he says, are shocked when they receive books in their native language, and are allowed to take them home. ""They end up receiving from us the first book that they will ever own,"" he adds.

StoryWeaver boasts a handful of ""champions"" -- people who have translated hundreds of stories into a particular language for free. And then there are those like Sarayu Kamat who have taken the stories into the community. On a recent trip to Bastar, she took with her 200 stories in Gondi, each of them printed in colour on A4 sheets and spiral bound into small books. ""We visited several houses in Kanker and distributed the books. We also donated some to the local school library,"" Kamat says. She shares pictures of young Manisha, who belongs to the Muria tribe in Chhattisgarh, enjoying the Gondi book Kamat had gifted her.

As the portal scales new milestones such as breaching the 10,000-story mark, Giri wants the community to own it: ""We want people to run it. We want publishers to join this."" Even if for-profit publishers would share their backlist (older books from a publisher) on StoryWeaver, he says, it would go a long way.

""The goal next year is to get a few known children's publishers from India on board,"" he says. ""If people own it, they will value it more."""

From darkness to light. Or so I thought when I heard about my shifting from the dark dungeons of coal mines, as coal secretary, to the bright lights of school education, as secretary for school education and literacy.

However, I discovered soon that in the coal sector, mining was underground and mafias operated above it, but in the minefield of school education, it was the other way round. All the education mafias existed underground, and they were all masked, masquerading as so-called noble giants. Having taken on some of the mafias of the coal sector and partly succeeded in bringing the sector to order, the task was now to handle these 'noble giants'. It was made more difficult as there was no public outrage against invisible scams in education as was in the case of coal.

Everything seemed to be apparently in order.

To make matters worse, I was the fifth person to hold the charge of secretary in the education department in just two and a half years. Most of my predecessors with impeccable credentials in the education sector did not continue or were not allowed to continue. The government apparently found in me to be the most 'educated' person (I had never worked in this sector except for a brief tenure of three months in 1997 in adult education in Uttar Pradesh) to handle this sector.

It would be an understatement to state that the education sector was in bad shape - both in terms of budgetary allocation and human resource management.

The budgetary allocation for school education was Rs 55,115 crores during 2014-15. This amount got reduced in subsequent years. For instance, the allocation for 2016-17 was Rs 43,554 crore.

On the human resource front too, the situation was alarming. The department had five secretaries between 2014 and 2016. A number of joint secretaries were also changed during this period. It was like musical chairs reminiscent of my days in UP where it was rumoured that the only industry flourishing was the transfer industry.

In the two biggest states of the country, the positioning of top management followed a peculiar pattern. Whereas in UP, there were two additional chief secretary-level officers manning school education and secondary education separately (creating huge coordination problems), in the state of Bihar, one officer looked after both the education and health departments. Consequently, the health of education continues to suffer.

In addition to this, the mafias were having a field day, eating into the system, like termites. Fortunately, like all mafias, those in the education sector too were not a majority, but played a dominant role in decision-making. They were extremely well connected and deeply entrenched. There were a host of mafias, but the prominent ones were operating in these areas:

There are around 16,000 B.Ed and D.El.Ed colleges in the country. A large number of these exist only in name. If you pay them well, you can get a degree without an effort. It was rumoured that if you pay them more, they could even arrange for a 'naukri' (a government job). Action was initiated by then chairman of National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) Santosh Mathews, an upright officer, by issuing notices to all the colleges to furnish the details of their existence on affidavits. The idea was to ensure that only those that actually existed got recognition and in case of wrong information they could be prosecuted. It worked initially, but the colleges realised that quite a few of them could be in trouble. Despite the support he got from most of the states, he was put under enormous pressure by the mafias who took the 'judicial' route to pin down the chairman. He had to quit.

In a few northern states of the country, a number of examination centres are given on 'theka' (contract) for copying. These centres are highly 'priced' as they facilitate mass copying or cheating during examinations. The current chief minister of UP, Yogi Adityanath, came down heavily on this mafia. This was last done by Kalyan Singh in 1991, but thereafter no chief minister could dare to do that. Consequent to the steps taken in UP in this year's exams, more than one million students chose not to give exams. It is a reflection of the 'addiction' to mass copying.

The publishing industry thrives on the education sector. People with vested interests want to maintain status quo as this benefits them. It happens at two levels. As respective state governments provide free books to students, there are various ways in which money is made. The 'mandatory cuts' in getting the books printed centrally constitutes a substantial portion. The initiative taken by the UP government in 2018 and the consequent savings thereunder lends credence to this allegation. The Bihar government is toying with the idea of direct benefit transfers recognising the 'dealings' inherent in central printing and distribution.

The other level of money making is done by a handful of private publishers who enter into an 'arrangement' with the private schools in the name of quality, and compel the students to buy almost four to five times more expensive books as compared to the NCERT ones. If all the students of around 20,000 CBSE-affiliated schools were to source NCERT books, there would be an estimated annual expenditure of around Rs 650 crores. Compared to this, if they source books from private publishers, it would cost around Rs 3,000 crores per annum. The difference is too great to justify the quality argument.

The NCERT did a wonderful job in the current academic year to ensure that books were available on time so that the students were not compelled to buy expensive books, but this effort will need to continue. The NCERT will always be under pressure from people with vested interests to be 'inefficient'.

Most of the private schools in India contribute enormously to imparting quality education. However, some of them are bringing a bad name to this segment. There are some extremely powerful individuals who are able to get away with the most immoral things in education. They violate various norms, legal and ethical, with impunity because having been part of the official machinery at some point in time they know the tricks of the trade.

Irrational hiking of fee, charging huge sums of money to 'lend' their brand, harassing the brand assignees are some of the many tricks they practice. The chairperson of the CBSE Rajesh Chatur who chose to take them on was shown the door in 2017. His successor, Anita Karwal, one of the finest civil servants, was also set to be 'sacrificed'. But she held her ground despite pressure.

The good news in all of this is yet again from UP where the state has enacted a law on the fee regulation after consulting all the stakeholders. Hence, the legislation has been welcomed by all. Hopefully, other states will follow suit.

Far and away, the biggest video game of the year was ""Fortnite,"" which has become a major piece of mainstream pop culture - and a revenue-generating juggernaut - in its own right.

An underrated aspect of the ""Fortnite"" phenomenon, however, is all the ways in which its developer, Epic Games, has been using its success as a lever to subtly but firmly shift the power dynamics of the video game industry. When Epic decided to skip Google Play, and offer ""Fortnite"" directly to Android users, it was

And Epic is apparently living its principles, too: Just recently, it launched the Epic Games Store, a PC storefront that offers developers a full 90% of their revenues. Discord, a popular gaming voice chat service, also joined this push with a similar model, ultimately putting pressure on leading PC games store Steam to change its revenue split, too.

All of this is happening against the backdrop of a major R&D push at the big tech companies to totally shake up the dynamics of the video game industry from the bottom up. This year, Google's Project Stream, currently in beta testing, aims to bring console-quality games to any phone or computer via the web browser; Microsoft has its own Project xCloud, with similar aims. Mega-published Electronic Arts has its own streaming ambitions, too.

Speaking of Microsoft, this year it doubled down on Xbox Game Pass, an all-you-can-eat buffet of Xbox games for $10 a month. The idea, Microsoft's Phil Spencer told Business Insider this year, is to build towards a new business model for video games, threading the needle between free-to-play titles like ""Fortnite"" and the traditional $50-$60 price tag for a new game. Individually, these are interesting developments. Taken all together, it paints an astonishing picture: Literally, every facet of the video game business is facing upheaval. And every single incumbent platform, from the digital game storefronts all the way down to the humble video game console itself, suddenly seems way more vulnerable than it did even a year ago.

Steam, originally launched in 2003, is the most popular PC games store on the planet, and likely the biggest single digital games store, period. The success of steam has made proprietor Valve Software, best known as the developer of the ""Half-Life"" series and esports smash ""Dota2,"" arguably the single most important company in the business.

Recently, though, Steam has come under scrutiny. Last year, Steam was criticized for having perhaps too much power in the industry, achieving something that critics declared something close to a monopoly - essentially locking developers into whatever revenue split it cared to offer.

Earlier this year, Steam courted controversy, as well, after a game casting players as a school shooter was approved for sale on its digital storefront. In the wake of the uproar, Valve actually took an unexpectedly drastic measure: It decided that it would open the floodgates and allow literally any game to be sold on Steam, unless it contained illegal content or, in its words, was ""straight up trolling."" Critics took it as an abdication of responsibility for the platform.

Read more: The world's largest gaming service, Steam, is giving up on regulation and turning over 200 million users into guinea pigs

All of this just added fuel to the fire of a debate that has been ongoing in Silicon Valley and beyond for a while: Why, some have asked, should developers accept that the major stores - including Apple's and Google's - take a 30% cut, when it doesn't always seem like those same stores have developers' best interests at heart?

Read more: The uproar over how 'Fortnite' is being released for Android shows how much we have acquiesced to Apple's way of doing businessSo it's no surprise that Epic Games,

To be sure, both companies have their work cut out for them: Attracting developers away from the mighty Steam is going to be no small task, tantamount to asking them to cut out their most proven audiences. Still, those more favorable terms of business is already proving attractive, as Epic especially has locked in several exclusive titles, like the anticipated ""Hades"" from Supergiant Games.

If these upstart gaming stores find success with giving developers a bigger piece of the pie, you can be certain that you'll be hearing a much more public airing of grievances about Apple, Google, and anybody else who takes a big cut of store revenues. And more directly, Steam, which once seemed like it had a perpetual stranglehold on the PC gaming industry, suddenly looks very vulnerable, indeed.

The dedicated video game console has been a mainstay of the industry for decades. While the business is definitely cyclical, it's weathered would-be crises - like the advent of the smartphone boom - and kept on trucking.

Now, Sony and Microsoft are working on the next generations of PlayStation and Xbox, respectively. But the stars are aligning to, perhaps, make this the last generation of traditional video game consoles.

The surest signs yet come from Google and Microsoft, which are both gearing up to offer their own cloud-based gaming services. Essentially, these services would do the hard work of actually rendering the game in their own, massively powerful data centers. Then, the video gets streamed to your device. When you move the controller, the signal goes back up to the cloud, starting the cycle over.

This has several implications. First off, it means that any device, regardless of computing horsepower, can theoretically run any game - after all, it's Google's or Microsoft's cloud that needs to have the cutting-edge graphics hardware, not your phone, tablet, or computer. Google has been testing it with the graphics-rich ""Assassin's Creed Odyssey,"" and by all accounts, it works a treat. Just open a Google Chrome browser window and get playing.

All of which implies that future blockbuster-quality video games could be playable from your phone, on the go, anywhere. It's been tried before, sure - notably the failed OnLive service and Sony's own PlayStation Now - but the incoming rise of ultra-speed 5G wireless internet could make it more feasible, even as ""Fortnite"" proves that more people, especially the younger crowd, will embrace the smartphone as a gaming platform...for the right game. And while the video game console might stick around, it could mutate: A console would no longer need to pack a ton of computing horsepower into a package that costs hundreds of dollars; it could theoretically be a smaller, cheaper package that mostly exists to provide a link to the cloud. Again, this has been tried before to little effect, notably with the Sony PlayStation TV, but times have changed and the market has evolved.

Finally, this brings us back to Microsoft and the Xbox Game Pass.

It's not hard to imagine a world where the Project xCloud gaming cloud service and the Xbox Game Pass dovetail: Imagine a world where you pay $50-$100 for a console and $10 a month for games, and get every (or, at least, most) big-ticket new release. It's a world that might not be so far away, given that Microsoft is already experimenting with providing the Xbox and Game Pass for a monthly fee. It could be that new model that Microsoft has been looking for.

To lay it all out:

The PC gaming industry is in a time of upheaval, in a battle for a better revenue sharing model that could have ramifications for Apple and Google, too. As a result, Steam, once thought unimpeachable, is under unforeseen pressure, as ""Fortnite"" developer Epic Games pushes its leverage hard.

Video game streaming is looking increasingly ready for prime time, in a move that could bring big-budget gaming to the smartphone in your pocket. This could mean that the next generation of Xbox and PlayStation will be the last to resemble what we currently think of as a video game console.

And the very business model of games could be subject to a shakeup, as Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass points the way towards a new way to pay for video games.

It all means that nothing is certain, and just about every aspect of the business is in flux, as we enter 2019."

President JKJCCPS Showkat M Chowdhary said the Fee Fixation Committee, as per the High Court Directions, approves the fee for a full calendar year and not on monthly basis.

He said the schools submit all the documents, income and expenses attested by Chartered Accountant, undertakings and declarations to the Fee Fixation Committee on the basis of which the fee is fixed.

""The private schools hire staff on yearly basis who are provided salary and provident funds for full year. No school hires staff as daily wagers. Accordingly, the schools charge tuition for full calendar year. The schools also make it sure that the teachers and other staff are paid properly. They also upgrade its infrastructure and other facilities on regular basis in an effort to impart quality education to the students so that they can compete not only at state or national level but at international level.""

About the transportation charges, JKJCCPS said the private schools charge for only 10 months even though they provide salary to the drivers and conductors for full year.

""Besides other charges including road tax, insurances are also borne by the schools for 12 months and there is no exemption from any authority or company to schools for the school buses during winter months. The schools only save fuel during the winter months on the basis of which only 10 months transportation fee is charged from the parents.""

JKJCCPS said transport facilities are provided to the students on no profit no loss basis.

""This facility is for the smooth transportation of the students so that they reach the schools and return back home on fixed times. It is neither prudent to say that schools will ply buses on losses.""

JKJCCPS said it is not mandatory for the parents to avail transport facility. ""If parents feel the transport is not viable, they can opt out of this facility and drop the students at schools on their own.""

It said the Coordination Committee has already given clear-cut instructions to the schools not to charge arbitrarily or make unnecessarily charges.

""We have also urged parents to register their complaints with the Coordination Committee for its prompt redressal.""

JKJCCPS urged parents no to resort to media trails instead seek better education for the wards.

""In today's modern world when competition is very high for the students, parents should exhort upon the school management to further upgrade infrastructure in terms of latest teaching aids and other facilities which should be integral part of class room.""

JKJCCPS further urged parents' association to sit with coordination committee over the issue and clear doubts, if any, regarding the fee charged from the students.

""We believe that media trials will serve no purpose but only hamper the school functioning and derail our effort to impart quality education. We will also like to invite media for open discussion and clear any doubts on the matter so that we focus on providing quality education to the students and help parents lay a strong foundation of their children."""

The district inspector of school (DIOS) PK Upadhyay said two schools, Cambridge School in Sector 27 and Bal Bharti School in Sector 21, have agreed to return hiked fees. While Cambridge School management agreed to return hiked amount per semester (â‚¹17,000), Bal Bharti School has decided to return â‚¹7,000 as hiked amount in one semester.

""We had served notices to the two schools regarding hiked fees in the past and they have now agreed to roll it back. Till now, we have got confirmation from two schools only. We are probing other schools which have also hiked fees,"" Upadhyay said.

The move comes after continued agitation by the All Noida Schools' Parents' Association (ANSPA) against ""arbitrary fee hike"" which is not in accordance with the Uttar Pradesh Self Finance Independent Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act. The ordinance was first brought into motion on April 9, 2018 and the Act was enforced in August this year.

According to K Arunachalam, general secretary of the ANSPA, they had sent a complaint to the DIOS regarding six private schools, namely Apeejay School, Somervillle School, Amity International School, Delhi Public School, Noida, Cambridge School and Bal Bharti School, for increasing fees in an alleged arbitrary manner.

""Although we have received information regarding two schools agreeing to roll back hiked fees, they have not done it yet. If schools really intend to adjust the hiked amount with the future fees, they have to do it in the next quarter. It has been four months since the Act has been enforced, however, no private school has followed it yet,"" Arunachalam said.

On November 3, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar had held a meet with principals of all private schools in the district and asked them to decided their fee structure as per the newly regulated Act and upload it on their school's website within a week's time.

Reacting to allegations of inaction by the district fee regulatory committee, Upadhyay said, ""We will decide in the next committee meeting on schools which do not follow the fees Act.""

However, Asha Prabhakar, principal of Bal Bharti School, denied claims made by the DIOS.

""We had already returned the hiked fees to parents in July this year. The ordinance came in April and we were told to roll back hiked fees. There was a rise of â‚¹7,000 in the first quarter and we returned the amount in the second quarter fees.

Students enrolled in government-run English medium primary schools say they do not want to switch over to Hindi as a medium when they begin lessons in upper primary school after finishing Class 5. Their demand to convert some of the upper primary schools from Hindi to English medium is growing louder with every passing day.

Kajal Kumari, a student of English medium primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar said, ""Switching back to Hindi will not be easy. I request the authorities to please do something so that we may continue to study in English after passing Class 5. It is through a lot of hard work that we developed a comfort level in studying in English. Now, if we go back to learning lessons in Hindi, it will undo whatever we learnt over the past few years.""

In 2015, the basic education department had converted a few primary schools of Uttar Pradesh into English medium institutions. The primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar was also made English medium at this time. It has 434 students enrolled in it and most of them do not wish to switch over to a Hindi medium school.

Officials said that after seeing the craze for English-medium schools growing in the state, the BJP government decided to convert 5,000 primary schools to English-medium ones from the April 2018 session. At present, 4,97,108 students are studying in these government-run primary schools.

""In Lucknow alone, there are 44 such schools where more than 6,200 students are enrolled,"" said Amar Kant Singh, Basic Shiksha Adhikari, Lucknow.

Hariyali Srivastava, assistant teacher at primary school Gejha, said the problem was that most students coming to government-run primary schools hailed from humble backgrounds. ""Their parents can't afford to send them to private English medium schools in Class 6, as the fee is very high,"" she said.

Corroborating what the teacher said, Kajal added, ""I want to study only in a government-run English medium school because my father (an e-rickshaw driver) can't afford to pay the fees charged by private English medium schools.""

Zainab Khatoon, another Class 5 girl of the same school, said that she wanted the state government to intervene in the matter.

Making an appeal to senior officials in the basic education department, Srivastava said, ""The students have learnt all terminology in English. Now, they will have to study in Hindi medium upper primary schools, which will be very difficult for them. Our students are asking for help. They want schools to be made English medium till Class 10.""

Lucknow BSA Amar Kant Singh agreed with the teachers and said that the demand for English medium schools after Class 5 was ""quite natural"". ""After studying in English medium institutions, students will not like to go back to Hindi medium schools,"" he said.

Admissions :

Admissions into Biotechnology takes place through entrances examinations in many of the institutions. Some of the prominent entrance examinations includes- JNU CEEB Combined Biotechnology Entrance Exam, IIT JAM (Indian Institute Of Technology Joint Admissions Test ), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Graduate School Admissions Exam etc. If the fundamentals of the subjects is clear then cracking these exams is a very easy task. However many other institutes offer direct admissions into biotechnology without any entrances with the minimum eligibility criteria.

The students aspiring to take up admissions into Biotechnology can shortlist their preferable institutions from the underneath ranking. Though there are numerous government and private colleges offering biotechnology the students can opt for them taking into account factors like- infrastructure, fee structure, scholarship programs,the skill development workshops offered, the hands on practical research,the internship programs etc.

Here is a list of some best institutes offering Biotechnology across Delhi-NCR (Source :The Week)"

The AssociaÂ­tion said that the fee was charged after examining and scrutinizing its income and expenses. President JKJCCPS Showkat M Chowdhary said the Fee Fixation Committee, as per the High Court directions, approves the fee for a full calenÂ­dar year and not on monthly basis. He said the schools submit all the documents, income and expenses attested by Chartered Accountant, undertakings and declarations to the Fee Fixation Committee on the basis of which the fee is fixed.

""The private schools hire staff on yearly basis who are provided salary and provident funds for full year. No school hires staff as daily wagers. Accordingly, the schools charge tuition for full calendar year. The schools also make it sure that the teachers and other staff are paid properly. They also upgrade its inÂ­frastructure and other facilities on regular basis in an effort to impart quality education to the students so that they can compete not only at state or national level but at inÂ­ternational level."" About the transÂ­portation charges, JKJCCPS said the private schools charge for only 10 months even though they provide salary to the drivers and conductors for full year. ""Besides other charges including road tax, insurances are also borne by the schools for 12 months and there is no exemption from any authority or company to schools for the school buses durÂ­ing winter months. The schools only save fuel during the winter months on the basis of which only 10 months transportation fee is charged from the parents."" JKJCCPS said transport facilities are provided to the students on no profit no loss basis. ""This facility is for the smooth transportation of the students so that they reach the schools and reÂ­turn back home on fixed times. It is neither prudent to say that schools will ply buses on losses.""

JKJCCPS said it is not mandatory for the parents to avail transport facility. ""If parents feel the transÂ­port is not viable, they can opt out of this facility and drop the students at schools on their own."" It said the Coordination Committee has alÂ­ready given clear-cut instructions to the schools not to charge arbitrarily or make unnecessarily charges.

""We have also urged parents to register their complaints with the Coordination Committee for its prompt redressal."" JKJCCPS urged parents no to resort to media trails instead seek better education for the wards. ""In today's modern world when competition is very high for the students, parents should exÂ­hort upon the school management to further upgrade infrastructure in terms of latest teaching aids and other facilities which should be inÂ­tegral part of class room.""

JKJCCPS further urged parents' association to sit with coordination committee over the issue and clear doubts, if any, regarding the fee charged from the students.

""We believe that media trials will serve no purpose but only hamper the school functioning and derail our effort to impart quality educaÂ­tion. We will also like to invite meÂ­dia for open discussion and clear any doubts on the matter so that we focus on providing quality education to the students and help parents lay a strong foundation of their children."""

'Pedal to Jungle', an expedition in Rajasthan... was the message in our Mangalore Bicycle Club Whatsapp group. Jungle and Rajasthan? I had always pictured Rajasthan as a dry region. I clicked the link and saw that the organisers -- Rajasthan Forest Department and Le Tour De India, Jaipur, had indeed planned a jungle trip in the state.

I decided to sign up and for the tour (November 29 to December 2), paid â‚¹9,000 fee and rented a Mountain Terrain Bike(MTB) from Le Tour. Two other friends, GN Ashoka Vardhana (64) and Hariprasad Shevire from Mangaluru, also signed up.

The three-day tour was to begin from Udaipur's Baghdara Nature Park. On the first day we had to pedal about 60 km (to Jaisamand Lake), on the second day we cycled 120 km (to Sita Mata Wildlife Sanctuary) and on the final day we went 25 km (to Dam Dama Forest check-post).

Rahul Bhatnagar, Chief Conservator of Forest and Wildlife, Udaipur, Suhel Majboor, the Divisional Forest Officer and Kushal Rathore of Le Tour briefed us the evening before we set off at Udaipur's Bike Studio by the We were 32 riders, including six women, from different parts of the country. Bhatnagar hoped the second edition of this tour would bring participants closer to Nature and indicated that more events were being planned.

The expedition was flagged off from Baghdara's entry gate and we rode along a kuchcha road in the interiors of the Nature Park. We stopped for breakfast on the banks of Baghdara Lake. Freshly prepared aloo parathas, sandwiches and fruits fuelled us for the next leg of the journey.

Exiting the Park, we navigated a small road to reach Jagat, at a distance of about 20 kilometres for a pit stop. Enjoying the beauty of the Ambika Mata temple that dates back to the 8th Century, we relished samosas and chai before visiting the Government Higher Primary Girls' School nearby to interact with students.

Narrow village roads then took us towards Jaisamand Lake through the countryside of Udaipur and it was past 2 pm when we reached the entry gate of the lake. After lunch in the lake garden, we hiked over to the adjacent hill to view Hawa Mahal, said to have been built by Maharana Jai Singh. The 450-metre climb gave us a breathtaking view of the lake beneath. The palace that is under the control of Archaeological Survey of India was out of bounds for regular tourists.

We went on a boat ride on the 85 sq km lake, said to be the second largest man-made one in India built by Maharana Jai Singh across the river Gomati. After watching spectacular cultural performances by artistes, followed by dinner, we retired for the night into the tents pitched in the lake garden.

The second day's ride began on a highway, but soon we entered Karawali town after which where steep ascents and descents awaited us. After a gruelling ride of about six hours with multiple pit-stops for refreshments, we reached the Forest Department's office at Dhariyawad town in Pratapgarh district. Post lunch, some bikers got back onto the saddles while others took the support vehicle for the next 25-kilometre journey to the sanctuary.

Bhatnagar pointed out that the region was the meeting point of three mountain ranges -- Aravali, Vindhyas and Mewar. I soaked in the beauty as I heard the folk songs around the camp fire. We retired for the day with the lullaby of Jhakum, ringing in our ears.

On the last day, we rode through the sanctuary . It was a steep ride made bearable with the green cover and the small streams that we crossed. The enchanting Sita Mata rivulet with crystal clear water held me back for a while. The 25-kilometre ride marked the end of the bike trip.."

But at Emma's Torch, a cozy restaurant in Brooklyn, NY, the question is a prelude to a very different kind of advisory. ""We're a nonprofit restaurant,"" began my server on a recent evening, ""that provides culinary training and job placement services to refugees, asylees, and survivors of human Â­trafficking. Every dish is created by our students.""

This type of story is being told in many ways at a number of philanthropically minded restaurants, bars, bakeries, and cafes. As you might expect, most of these programs focus on hunger. Seattle's Conscious Eatery brings a one-for-one model to the business similar to that of Toms shoes, providing more than 18,000 meals to the area's homeless so far. In Philadelphia, chef Â­Michael Solomonov's Rooster Soup Co donates all profits to the Broad Street Ministry Collaborative.

Other restaurants make antipoverty initiatives a focus. New York's Major Food Group (whose empire includes the Grill and Carbone) has joined the Robin Hood Foundation for ""Major Good,"" a pull-out-the-stops $25,000 private-Â­dining experience for 12. The entire fee goes to the foundation, which aids low-income New Yorkers. Managing partner Jeff Zalaznick says you don't even need to eat at a Major Food dining room to contribute: When you don't show up for a standard reservation, the company turns over the cancelation fee to Robin Hood. Since starting the program, the group has donated over $200,000 in cancelation fees per year. (Please don't do this on purpose; it's rude.)

With 78 per cent of Americans wanting companies to ""stand up for important social-justice issues,"" according to Cone Communications, it's no surprise that restaurants are doing well by doing good. There's a pragmatic, even capitalistic side to being ethical: ""With high demand for labor, restaurants are opening their employment doors to people from all backgrounds, including disconnected youth and previously incarcerated individuals,"" says Rob Gifford, executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association's Educational Foundation.

On-the-job training, however, can come with drawbacks, namely unpolished service and sloppy food. I didn't experience that at Emma's Torch. The waitstaff are professionals, so the front of the house runs smoothly. Likewise, the kitchen is overseen by chef Alexander Harris, formerly of Union Square Hospitality Group's Blue Smoke in Manhattan.

How's the food? Everything I had was well-executed, with a comfort food sensibility that aptly reflects its maxim, ""New American cuisine from New Americans."" A brunch-only fried chicken sandwich was topped with creamy vegetable slaw and harissa aioli. It was served on a pillowy brioche from Hot Bread Kitchen, an incubator in the heart of New York's Spanish Harlem that also trains economically distressed immigrants. More challenging dishes for new cooks, such as a pan-seared red snapper over hoppin' John, were deftly handled. And a bread pudding mined the hallmarks of baklava -- pistachio and honey -- to give new life to a classic.

The dining room has been packed every time I've visited, a sign that good food and good intentions aren't mutually exclusive. And expansion is in the works: Emma's Torch will soon open a cafe in the soaring art deco lobby of the Brooklyn Public Library.

As diners become more attuned to it, the trend is becoming more ambitious. In Syracuse, NY, the teaching restaurant With Love gives an immigrant chef a five-month-long pop-up, along with business support and training. Dog Tag Bakery in Washington offers a five-month fellowship for post-Sept. 11 military veterans and their spouses or caregivers. The participants roll croissants and pull espresso alongside professional bakers and baristas -- and they also leave with a certificate in business administration from Georgetown's School of Continuing Studies. This year, Starbucks Corp. sold almost a quarter-million Dog Tag brownies in just over a month, and the shop's Washington flagship got major exposure when two famous friends stopped by for lunch: Joe Biden and Barack Obama."

Sirsa has issued a show cause notice to GK's close confidant and former DSGMC media adviser Parminder Pal Singh and removed him from post.

In the notice, Sirsa raised question on the bills raised by a PR agency which were approved by the former media adviser. He ordered the removal of Parminder Pal on Saturday and sent him a notice, stating that bills of PR firm 'Mahajan Communications' appeared fake, fabricated and exorbitant. In fact, the notice even implicated GK, as it mentioned that these were approved first by Parminder Pal and then by the DSGMC president last month. Giving time of three days, Sirsa asked him why should action not be initiated against him. Sirsa also constituted a two-member committee to investigate the ""fake bills"" and got the office of media adviser locked.

Parminder Pal on his Facebook posted that the notice was issued to him in ati-utsah (hurry). He said the PR firm was engaged for projection of various tasks undertaken by DSGMC and he signed the bills only after seeing the results produced by the firm. Denying any wrongdoing, he said, ""My three kids are studying in a DSGMC school and they were entitled to a fee-waiver for being amritdhari (an initiated Sikh initiated into the Khalsa) but I never availed that and paid fee of Rs 15 lakh to the school for six years. I provided my services on honorary basis and never drew a single penny for that."" Asked if it was the result of tussle between GK and Sirsa, he refused to comment.

GK, other office-bearers and executive members have already resolved to hold elections three months before the schedule. The DSGMC chief has handed over the charge to vice-president Harmeet Singh Kalka, while Sirsa is holding his office. Ten days back SAD president Sukhbir Badal had also dissolved party units in Delhi, Rajasthan and UP.

In his reply submitted to Kalka and Sirsa, that the notice was ""false, misconceived and devoid of any merits"" and amounted to ""misuse of power"", He also pointed out that no letter or notice was sent to him earlier.

In the evening a circular, dated December 22, 2018, and signed by the DSGMC general manager, was also sent to mediapersons which mentioned that Parminder Pal had been removed from the post and all statements would now be issued by Sirsa or Kalka. Meanwhile SAD office secretary and spokesperson Charanjit Singh Brar confirmed that Parminder Pal had been removed from the post of national spokesperson of the party.

It was a pre-Christmas party and someone was asking me why I was so obsessed with toilets. I patiently explained that no less a personage than Bill Gates considered it important to research and understand why so many Indians preferred the fields to closed toilets.

""Why don't you write about something more important?"" asked my interlocutor. ""Such as human rights?"" I considered this for a long moment. ""Do you think humans have a right to do it in the fields?"" I asked him finally. ""Why don't you ask some villagers what they think?"" he dared me. So I did.

I met my first problem right here - no one in the Mumbai suburb of Swachhpura could understand why we needed to discuss something that had been an accepted tradition since the dawn of peristalsis. No one disputed that on Indian streets, cows and bulls dropped steaming patties where they wished, or that birds did it on the sculpted heads of statesmen and visionaries.

But humans, being at the top of the food chain, should be able to excrete at will where they wished. This was the considered opinion of the council elders. ""But is open-air excretion a human right?"" I asked.

""It's a human need as well as a right and no one can take it away,"" the village elder replied. ""Though God knows wave after wave of colonisers have tried their best to suppress and deny human excretory rights. Our diets used to be rich in fruits, nuts, quick-cooked vegetables, unmilled cereals, and fibres. Then along came McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut and their ilk, with their fizzy zero-calorie drinks and burgers high in proteins and preservatives and no roughage. Now our children don't go in

the morning.""

""You're telling me that suppressing human excretory rights has been an international agenda through history?"" ""Exactly,"" he said admiringly. ""You are definitely the sharpest knife in the drawer.""

""There's more,"" he continued. ""Multinationals offer top dollar for our land and rivers to build their factories. We're poor, so we take the offer. Now the field I once used to fertilise with my exertions every morning belongs to a corporate giant who makes breakfast cereal we don't even like.""

I thought this was an opportune moment to introduce the toilet theme. ""Supposing we constructed a toilet in each village, so that every villager could use one? Imagine a closed room, completely private, with an easy-to-clean ceramic bowl, a tap with running water, special super-soft, double-ply tissues which we call toilet paper - and a small fee, perhaps a rupee, to hire an attendant to keep it clean?"" The assembly was silent, chewing over this new concept. ""You mean we'll now pay to do something that we could once do where we wished?""

Another calculated: ""A rupee a day is 30 rupees a month. I have seven in my family, so we're looking at about 200 rupees a month. And, we usually don't have any money in the last week. Does this mean we'd have to just not go until the next salary arrived?""

""There's that old suppression of minority rights trick again!"" shouted an angry villager. ""They're trying to create a problem for us by taking a right away, then trying to get us all hot and bothered about our rights being violated, and then suggesting a solution that will only make us poorer and more constipated!""

""Not necessarily,"" I said. ""What if the first 25 families that endorse walled public toilets were offered a free lifetime supply of Isabgol? It's an outstanding laxative.""

There was silence. ""Also free education up to end of school for the first three children,"" I added. More silence. ""And fur-lined seats,"" I threw in, desperately. Some villagers began to nod. ""Do we have a right to these free add-ons - Isabgol, school, fur-lined seats?""

I smiled. Breakthrough! ""You do!"" I cried. ""You also have a natural right to an Income Generating Activity, such as packaging locally harvested fleaseed husks, that will generate enough income to pay for the free add-ons."" ""We pay for free add-ons?"" frowned a villager.

""You can call them whatever you like,"" I said triumphantly. ""Bottom line: you have a right to a toilet. You have a right to a fur-lined toilet. You have a right to have a smooth unfettered bowel movement each morning. You have a right to a laxative. You have a right to child-friendly environment and free primary education. You have a right to pay for all of the above. Isn't science wonderful?""

""I beg to differ about the paying. . ."" began one old man. I held up a finger. ""I regret that is the only thing you don't, at this moment, have a right to do,"" I said."

Funerals speak volumes about the deceased. When the mortal remains of Dr S Jayachandran, 71, the 'â‚¹5 doctor' of North Chennai, were placed at his home last week, hundreds and hundreds of everyday people poured in -- including fisherfolk, rickshaw pullers, daily-wagers and conservancy workers. The doctor touched countless lives during his four decades of practice in Kasimedu and Old Washermanpet. He charged next to nothing for consultation, but that's not the only reason he was loved deeply by the people of North Chennai. K Vinoth, founder, Ocean Awareness, was close to Jayachandran, and speaks of him in a voice choked with tears.

Appa saved my life some 25 years ago, when I had malaria. He came to the rescue of my daughter, when she fell seriously ill when she was six days old. He had clinics at three different places over his 25 years of practice in Kasimedu, and later started practicing from his home on Venkatachalam Street in Old Washermanpet. Initially, he charged â‚¹2 for consultation, which went up to â‚¹5. Those who could afford it, paid â‚¹20.

He had a soft corner for fisherfolk; I don't know why. He often said we were always working hard. I'm a fisherman's son and he treated me like his own. He is the brain behind Ocean Awareness; it is he who suggested that we clean up our beaches, set up baywatch towers, and hold marathons in North Chennai. He was constantly thinking of ways to uplift our people; he told youngsters to speak kindly, and not raise our voices even when angry.

He dreamt of building a school for children of fisherfolk. ""Edhachum pannanum da (We should do something for them),"" he said. I'm sure we will build the school he envisioned.

He was diabetic, but happily ate chocolates if his young patients offered him. ""They will be disappointed if I don't eat it; there's so much love in that one chocolate,"" he would say.

Whether or not he ate at weddings of the rich, he made it a point to eat at weddings of the less privileged. We were at one such wedding and I asked if there were no vegetables with rasam rice. He got very upset with me; he asked me to be respectful of our guest's humble efforts.

He spoke with so much familiarity with everyone. He's rapped my head with his examination torch when I told him I skipped my medicines.

He kept working all his life; he has conducted over 4,000 free medical camps across India. He never took care of his health, though. If I pointed this out to him, he told me that he should die suddenly one day, when he was practicing. His words came true.

Rag pickers, conservancy workers thronged his clinic. I remember he once asked a patient to get a scan done. ""Here, take this â‚¹800. The scan centre will charge more, but tell him I sent you,"" he told the patient."

This unusual drive is part of the department's efforts to ensure that admissions in pre-primary classes cross the figure of one lakh students.

In past four days since the admissions began, over 25,000 children between ages 3 to 6 have been admitted in the pre-primary classes.

On Saturday, Secretary Education, Punjab, Krishan Kumar, along with the staff of Education Department visited homes in Mohali District area to make the parents aware about pre-primary classes being offered at government schools.

The teacher added that by the end of this year over 4000 schools would be given the same facelift.

Pertinently, Rising Kashmir received a number of calls from the parents of the wards studying in various leading private schools of Srinagar who complained of issues like increase in tuition fee, charging of bus fare for vacation months, extra charges and the onetime tuition fee of winter months.

One of the parents said, there are many private schools in Srinagar who keep the students result withheld till the parent pay tuition fee and transportation in one go for the vacation months."

Director School Education Kashmir, Dr. GN Itoo on Sunday warned action against private schools demanding lump sum fee and the charges for heating and transport facilities for the time when these facilities are not being provided to students by the school.

Taking cognizance of media reports, DSEK issued a circular on Saturday clarifying that no school can force the parents to pay fee in one go and the school fee, as per norms, is to be paid only in monthly installments including for the vacation period.

The circular further stated that during vacation period, fee is to be charged only for the services which are being utilized by the students and no other fee can be charged. ""Schools can charge only tuition fee in case of teachers and salary of drivers in case of transport. No heating charges can be recovered from students when these services are not being used by students during vacation period,"" the circular reads.

DSEK has also advised the administrators of Private schools of complying with these orders in letter and spirit and added that they can charge tuition and transport facilities from the parents for winter vacations only when they are giving the salary to the teachers and drivers for these months.

That year, he founded Mrida, along with Manoj Khanna and Gurveen Kaur Sood, who also had corporate experience.

Mrida focuses primarily on three areas: renewable energy in rural areas, creating market linkages for small farmers, artisans and womenfolk, and producing and marketing health and wellness products.

Mrida entered the villages with small solar installations that lit up homes and helped recharge mobile phones. In some cases, the microgrids, as they are called, were supported by corporate houses as part of their CSR (corporate social responsibility) initiatives.

If you remember the memorable plot of The Jungle Book which would make your feet tap around while Baloo hummed Bare Necessities, keep an eye out for the devious Sher Khan and root for a stubborn, naive and yet brave Mowgli, you may soon be able to see them come alive again. This time, not on your TV set or the big screen, but at the childhood home of author and Nobel Laureate Sir Rudyard Kipling, located within the premises of the Sir JJ School of Art at Fort.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has put in place a plan, which has been in the works for a few months now, to set up a virtual reality set near the bungalow, which will screen a show involving characters from The Jungle Book with the music score from the 1967 adaptation of the book, written in 1894. A BMC official who is part of the project said the equipment needed for the set up will be camouflaged at the site, so as to give the viewer a real taste of what it might be to roam around Mowgli's home.

""A Jungle Book theme based visual display will be set up and visitors will be able to see the characters emerge from behind the trees. There are plans to set up a water jet screen at the site where the book's characters will promote a social message, for instance, caring for forests,"" the official added, requesting anonymity. Meanwhile, the house will be converted into a souvenir shop and a reading room.

Confirming the project plan, Additional Municipal Commissioner of western suburbs Idzes Kundan said, ""The project will be a tribute to Kipling, a great man and a famous author. There are a lot of formalities that need to be taken care of. The plan is at a preliminary stage and will be finalised soon."" The Mumbai Urban Art Commission, set up earlier this year by civic chief Ajoy Mehta, has been taking steps towards bringing attention to the city's architecture.

Senior civic officials said the VR shows at the site will be 25 minutes long and that these will be held twice or thrice a week, for which a fee -- yet to be decided -- will be charged. ""The Sir JJ School Of Art comes under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department and the college administration depends on them for all infrastructural repair works. The entrance fee for the shows will be given to the director of the college who can then use the funds for the development of the institute,"" said the official.

Rajiv Mishra, principal of JJ, said once finalised, the idea of the project will be mooted to the state government for approval. ""The maintenance capacity for civil works and ability of the PWD office is restricted and not up to the mark. The opportunity of maintaining the premises well will be possible if revenue generating ideas like this could be created on campus,"" he added.

Civic officials said that around 4-5 months will be required to finalise the plan and it will take another six months to complete the work. If all goes well, they are planning to throw it open to the public by the end of next year. The project will cost around R10 crore and it will be entirely driven by CSR funds.

The BMC will need an approval from the heritage committee before they can start work on bungalow. They will also have to get in touch with The Walt Disney Company to get the required permissions as the firm owns the copyright to the book and all of its adaptations. Civic officials from the heritage department said that they are also planning to approach Kipling's family to involve them in the project.

Ready by next year

The bungalow, also known as Kipling House was built in 1882, more than a decade after Rudyard Kipling, born in 1865, moved to England with his sister. The original house in which he was born was demolished and Kipling House came up next to it. Kipling's father, John Lockwood was a professor of architectural sculpture at JJ and served as a principal of the college. He lived at the home along with his wife Alice.

Until the early 2000s, the bungalow served as the residence of several deans of JJ College. The bungalow is a Grade II heritage structure and it is currently being restored by the directorate of archaeology and museums. Dr Tejas Garge, Director of the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums said while majority of the work has been completed, the remaining has been interrupted due to lack of funds.

""The major structural repairs have been completed and the electrical work is being done. We have to take up some tiling and landscaping work. We have the estimate prepared but haven't sent it out due to financial crunch. We will send it in January or February and then money will be allotted for the project,"" he said. The restoration, he estimates, should be completed by November."

The National Basketball Association, or NBA as it is popularly known, on Thursday pipped the more fancied football leagues such as the English Premier League or the Spanish League to announce pre-season friendlies in India.

Individual promoters have been announcing many friendlies between former stars of many such football clubs in the last few years only to backtrack later for want of enough sponsorship and financial support.

In 2011, Blackburn Rovers became the only top flight club to play an exhibition game in India but that was only because they had an Pune-based Indian owner in poultry business conglomerate Venky's.

Mind you, holding a pre-season friendly outside the geographical jurisdiction of the league is not just aimed at expanding the fan base but has to also be a revenue generating trip and no league or club would commit to an overseas pre-season games unless both objectives are met.

NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum said as much during the announcement of the two games between Indiana Pacers and Sacramento Kings. ""We make sure we have enough fans, when the time is right to bring the NBA game here, where the fans will be excited about. That the tickets will sell out and that there would be enough interest around these games.""

It hasn't been an overnight process that has led to growing interest in a game that is definitely not high on the radar of the Indian sports fan. The early morning timings of the NBA games on Indian television aren't really ideal for exponential growth in viewership.

""NBA has been making sure that we are making these investments. For the last seven years we have been investing. We have been investing in grassroots development programs where we have reached 10 million boys and girls. We have trained 10000 physical education teachers on how to run basketball practices and how to train kids.

""Our viewership was now 120 million last year, 1.4 billion impressions on Facebook. Now we see there is a demand for NBA basketball,"" said Tatum.

Though the NBA officially established their India office only in 2011, they began working on the Indian market back in 2006 and since then more than 35 current and former NBA and WNBA players visited India to conduct clinics for coaches and young kids.

The real game changer, however, for NBA has been their junior NBA program launched in 2013 in collaboration with Reliance Foundation that runs for three months and apart from conducting competitions, trains the players and physical education teachers of participating teams for free.

""It is the biggest school program in the country and the growth has been exponential,"" NBA India Managing Director Yannick Colaco said, adding it has expanded from 235 schools and 142,000 kids in 2013-14 to 6142 schools and 4.9mn children in 2017-18. This year the program aims to reach 6000 schools and 6.5mn students.

In 2017, they also launched NBA basketball schools and now have 26 centres where children can train after school. ""It is a tuition fee based program but we give a lot of scholarships too. It is run with our partners India on Track but the entire program has been designed by NBA,"" Colaco added.

But the flagship project that NBA is banking on to produce a star basketball player from India is the NBA Academy in Noida where they are training about 24 kids. One of them, Princepal Singh, has already moved to the NBA Global Academy in Canberra, Australia, and recently made his India senior team debut at the age of 17.

""The way it is set up right now it can take 24 kids, that's the optimum capacity with the facilities we have. We are in the second year and after two years we will have to take a step back and see where we have been. Do we expand the capacity of this academy or set up another academy,"" Colaco said, adding they have tried to democratise the process of trials as far as possible by allowing kids to even send their entries by showcasing their skills on social media platforms.

""There is only so much scouting you can do. In fact, among the 45 kids selected for the national finals, seven came through social media and one of them is now in the academy,"" he added.

But how difficult is it going to be to get the sort of commercial success that NBA is looking for with no Indian role models to follow in the league.

Colaco believes that the way sport is followed around the world now, most kids aspire to pla in the top leagues and idolise global stars and banks on the fact that one of the academy products may one day go on to play in the NBA.

As things stand now, Satnam Singh was drafted by Dallas Mavericks in 2015 but did not get a game while Sim Bhullar became the first Indian origin player to actually play in an NBA game. Amjyot Singh is also currently playing in the G-League.

However, one cannot deny the fact that NBA graph went up exponentially in China when Yao Ming arrived on the horizon and became a household star.

Tatum explains that it wasn't an overnight process and NBA had been investing in China for long to find one Yao Ming.

""That's the thing about Yao Ming. When Yao Ming came, we took off. But we were in China 20 years before Yao Ming showed up.

""I don't think it will take 20 years here. But we understand that it doesn't happen over night. I would say that we are seeing progress. It takes time. It takes time to get kids to that level. But we see that the talent is there. And just in a year and half, we have been investing in the academy, we can see tangible growth in the skills of the players,"" he added.

The decision to hold two pre-season games in Mumbai also proves that brand NBA has not just found it's feet in the Indian market in the last decade or so but is now ready to take flight. And credit needs to go to NBA India's slow and steady build up approach with a focus on grassroot development apart from the right marketing strategies."

In June, Deepak Malghan, an associate professor with the Centre for Public Policy at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, made an unusual appeal to the institute's placement committee and environment club. The email - part request, part withering criticism - asked them to ""disinvite"" Hindustan Unilever from the job placements for management students in October.

In 2001, a thermometer factory owned by the corporation in Kodaikanal had dumped toxic mercury in the local environment of the popular Tamil Nadu tourist spot. The factory was subsequently shut. Earlier this year, activists alleged that the company's trial remediation of soil contaminated by mercury at the site in November 2017 had failed, possibly mobilising more mercury into the environment that it had recovered because it deployed a substandard process. They say that the company has refused to apply the standards follows in the United States. Hindustan Unilever has denied these claims.

The email was part of Malghan's larger mission to remind the Indian Institutes of Management, which are among the country's top business schools, of their responsibilities as public institutions even though they sit close to private business interests and influence. These institutes became degree-granting institutions with the passage of the Indian Institutes of Management Act in 2017.

""Disinviting them...will send out a powerful message that management institutions can actually walk the talk about corporate responsibility,"" Malghan wrote in his email. ""Disinviting Unilever from placements requires us to act like we are a real place of higher learning - with real students and professors in a classroom rather than customers and service providers. It requires us to act like a real university would - not like a glorified placement agency masquerading as a place of higher learning.""

Malghan's email elicited a ""censure order"" from the director of the institute on October 17 asking him to retract it. The note said Malghan must ""develop greater sensitivity"" towards colleagues and ""institutional stakeholders both internal and external"". Malghan retracted his letter on November 28 but ""under protest"" and after appealing to the board of governors. ""Thinking through the complex intersections between corporations, society, state, market, and the biophysical environment is an important learning objective for budding managers,"" he wrote. The retraction was shared with over 1,000 students. A week later, both the retraction and the original email became public.

This was not Malghan's first attempt to remind an Indian Institute of Management that it is a public institution. In 2017, he and doctoral student Siddharth Joshi co-authored a paper and a number of articles on the negligible social diversity among faculty members in the Indian Institutes of Management, arguing for affirmative action in the doctoral programmes that serve as a ""talent pool"" for faculty recruitment.

In the paper, Malghan had also criticised the culture of the Indian Institutes of Management to pay faculty members extra for a range of activities - such as conducting admission interviews - that in any other public university are standard academic functions teachers are expected to perform. The Indian Institutes of Management call such payments ""incentives"", but Malghan calls them ""bribes"". He has been unsuccessfully filing queries under the Right to Information Act, 2005, to obtain compensation structures of faculty of the Indian Institutes of Management.

In 2015, Malghan became the first ecological economist - studying the ""intersections between the human economy and the biophysical system that contains and sustains it"" - to win the VKRV Rao Prize, a top award for social scientists under 45. He has taught at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, his first faculty position, for nine years. He spoke to Scroll.in about the role of these institutes as public institutions, the response to his criticisms and what the institutes must do to arrest their decline into the role of a ""customer service provider"".

""Business schools are the first departments on any university campus worldwide that are captured by vested interests including crony capitalists,"" Malghan said.

Edited excerpts follow:

Is there space for this form of activism in the IIMs? All professional education institutions seem to discourage it.

The short answer is that the limited space that exists is rapidly shrinking. My specific censure order is only symptomatic of much deeper structural problems. A more important question is should there be space for this form of activism, rather than is there space. The answer to this normative question is self-evident. What is a university that does not allow a free and open exchange of ideas? IIMs pride themselves as being crucibles for thought leaders - one of those vacuous terms that has its antecedents in the public relations industry. I think it is not the university's job to train shills for the elite. A university's mission ought to be to foster thoughtful individuals including voices of dissent.

Had you written about IIM policies before the paper you co-authored on faculty diversity? What prompted you to look at the IIMs?

My collaborative work with Siddharth [Joshi] is indeed the first time I have written publicly about IIM policies. The initial impetus for our work came from the fact that anecdotally everybody in the IIM system knew that IIMs have long been guilty of an unconscionable neglect of questions of diversity and inclusion in our doctoral programmes. The dubious methods used by IIMs to skirt constitutional and statutory mandates surrounding affirmative action were well-known internally. Like a lot of other contemporary Indian institutions, IIMs are an almost exclusively upper caste, and also mostly an urban upper class preserve. Based on imperfect data, we conservatively estimate that about 95% of all IIM faculty members are drawn from upper caste Hindu groups. Out of over 640 faculty members across 13 older IIMs, there are four faculty members from the SC [Scheduled Castes] groups and only one from ST [Scheduled Tribes] groups. The social composition of faculty at IIMs might as well have been produced by an apartheid regime.

Much of the credit for beginning this difficult conversation must go to Siddharth. Besides being a first-rate scholar, he is also a committed rights activist. I am a faculty member with tenure and really had little to lose materially. Siddharth was a graduate student yet to defend his dissertation when he first started work on the IIM social diversity project. Siddharth bravely withstood a variety of attacks and derision.

What was the response to the paper?

Initial reactions were predictable - when you are accustomed to privilege, any conversation on equity feels like oppression. As a sympathetic colleague pointed out, there was deflection. There was obfuscation. There was trivialisation. There were concerted attacks from colleagues ganging up. Finally, there was some personal vilification, too. Siddharth and I were largely able to tune out the negativity because there were a bunch of incredible colleagues and students across different IIMs who supported us in more ways that I can recount here.

Some among the IIM alumni have supported the sort of reform you have written about. Are there other faculty members who share your views?

I have to set the record right here. IIM alumni have not issued statements in support of the reforms that Siddharth and I have written about. If anything, we have reacted to enlightened alumni articulating the critical need for faculty social diversity at IIMs. If you have seen some limited reforms at most IIMs (except IIM Ahmedabad), the entirety of the credit must go to the global alumni network that has tried to remind us about Ambedkar's vision for the republic. The alumni have been at the vanguard of marginal changes (but revolutionary by IIM standards) that you have seen sweep the IIM system in the last couple of years

Siddharth and I have received some very important support from faculty members across IIMs. From over a dozen faculty colleagues that have openly supported us, I must single out Professor Mira Bakhru, a former faculty member at IIM Bangalore. Professor Bakhru was the first faculty member to write about social diversity deficit at IIMs. Many faculty colleagues around the country, across different IIMs have worked hard in the last two years to think through operationalising meaningful affirmative action in the doctoral programmes at IIMs.

What effect does this lack of diversity have on teaching, research and students?

The most important diversity that must be treasured by a university is intellectual diversity. I do not wish to suggest that intellectual diversity is somehow correlated with social diversity (ethnicity, gender, etc). However, there is strong evidence that a diverse faculty and student body with varied life experiences are crucial to the educational mission of a modern university. Actually, the IIM leadership recognises how diversity contributes to better outcomes for students and faculty alike. It is only that not all diversity axes are created equal. For example, IIMs have made tremendous progress on the gender diversity front at all levels - MBA students, doctoral students, and most significantly faculty body. However, there has been more reluctance to extend the gains from increased gender diversity to say social group diversity. Caste is the most significant axis of social heterogeneity in India, not to mention the most pernicious axis of stratification. Unfortunately, much of the reluctance to address deep-seated caste inequities can be attributed to a wholly misguided and indefensible notion of meritocracy that smacks of entrenched privilege.

In the two-year MBA programmes, however, IIMs do admit a very socially diverse class. But students from historically underrepresented sections of India do not find role models in their classroom. I can bet that a class on infrastructure management is going to look very different if the faculty body had adequate representation of Adivasi and Dalit groups who have borne the brunt of a rapacious infrastructure industry. Instead we now have classes on infrastructure that are taught by faculty members who serve on boards of crony capitalist firms. For example, at IIM-B [Bangalore] the infrastructure management class is taught by somebody who is on the board of an Adani company.

Finally, IIMs are elite public institutions with considerable normative influence on the national discourse. It is unconscionable that elite institutions are as skewed as IIMs are in terms of their social representation. This problem is not unique to IIMs or even to public universities in general. For example, my own guess is that the social composition of elite media houses is as skewed as IIMs. Some of the duplicity surrounding affirmative action policies including reservations at IIMs stem from misconstruing affirmative action as a welfare or poverty alleviation measure. Affirmative action at elite institutions is anything but. It is about representation at the elite decision-making tables.

You point out that IIMs have demanded autonomy but not exercised it for ""critical engagement with business practices"". In which direction do you see the institutions going under the new IIM Act passed last year? The new law has granted even greater autonomy to the institutions.

Yes, egged on by a consumptive urban upper class, the IIMs have used the unprecedented autonomy granted to these institutions (even before the new Act) for largely self-aggrandisement. IIMs do not see themselves as enlightened public universities. Autonomy for IIMs has largely meant abdicating their social contract as a public university. The social diversity deficit at IIMs is only one of the most egregious symptoms of these institutions abandoning their public mission. I believe the new Act will only exacerbate this trend even though it also provides a framework to recover the public mission. The litmus test for any university is this: does it use the autonomy to promote an environment where the life of the mind is nurtured and treasured? Available evidence suggests that IIMs fall short of this ideal by quite a bit.

You have mentioned the ""powerful faculty bodies and board led by corporate honchos"" that run the IIMs. How have they - and IIM-Bangalore in particular - responded to your criticism?

Individual colleagues and many students have supported or at least defended the exercise in self-criticism. The leadership has been much more, shall I say, sceptical if not hostile. Of course, several colleagues have also been very critical and a colleague has even described me as being obnoxious and a hypocrite. In general, the intellectual culture at IIMs (and I can speak most authoritatively only about IIM-B) is not open to critical inquiry. The problem is structural. Business school academia is focused not on understanding the world but on manipulating it. IIMs really are not an exception. Business schools are the first departments on any university campus worldwide that are captured by vested interests including crony capitalists. Quite often it is the case of not being able to criticise the very hand that feeds you. When students are reduced to fee paying customers, the professoriate has to debase itself into a customer service provider guild. The only exception to this otherwise bleak picture that I have painted is the doctoral programme that has been my refuge.

Why did you describe faculty members receiving incentives for research as ""bribes""? How did your colleagues react to this?

Many of my faculty colleagues have been upset with Siddharth and I going to town with IIMs' worst kept secret - the fact that faculty members at these institutions need special incentives to write academic papers, and ""upset"" is putting it very mildly.

There are three fundamental problems. First, we have made a fundamental category error - incentives and integrity are two very different objects. The idea that you can fix what is fundamentally an integrity problem with incentives betrays a certain kind of studied illiteracy. How can a professoriate that is so confused about incentives and integrity lecture in an MBA classroom about business ethics? If faculty have to be paid to do admission interviews, we really cannot complain about MBAs that are paid those vulgar bonuses to run the casino economy.

The immediate corollary of this category error is that faculty demand to be bribed to do anything at all - from reading and writing to admission interviews and supervising master's thesis project. An improved incentive structure will do nothing to fix this fundamental flaw with our system. Unless we recognise that we cannot bribe our way into making up for our original sin - jettisoning our innate integrity - we are doomed. Yes, we need a set of shared norms but not metrics that reduce the deans at IIMs wholly into a bean counter.

Second, IIMs are a public university - at least in theory. We have (if only an implicit) social contract with the Indian republic. Our current compensation arrangements are in breach of this compact. Every major public university (including business schools at public universities) has an open and transparent faculty compensation structure. Unless we are willing to publicly defend who and what we pay ourselves, the present regime is simply illegitimate. In the past few months I have filed several RTI [Right to Information] requests at various IIMs asking them to reveal their faculty compensation structure (the generic structure) but all of them have come up with the flimsiest of reasons to deny this information.

Third, we are a faculty body that has lost any sense of proportion. At a public university, compensation structure ought to be benchmarked against the means of the larger society. We are being non-transparent about our compensation structure because we are paying ourselves incentives that are patently indefensible. We may come up with any number of excuses to pay ourselves. My favourite is the one offered by several colleagues - we need to pay ourselves because we now aspire to send our children abroad (read Western university) for undergraduate education. We are perfectly within our rights to harbour such aspirations but it is not any Indian public university's remit to pander to these aspirations.

It takes a certain kind of entitlement to believe that being on 98.4 percentile of the income distribution in our country (this is at the beginning assistant professor level) as a public university teacher means living a life of abject poverty.

How has your own experience at IIM-Bangalore been?

On the balance, my time at IIM-B has been most fulfilling. I must especially single out the superb doctoral programme at IIM-B that has provided me an opportunity collaborate with, and learn from young scholars in disciplines ranging from social anthropology to hydrology. The dozen or so doctoral projects that I have been involved with have been the most important source of intellectual sustenance at IIM-B. Doctoral programmes at IIMs operate outside the din and media glare associated with the bread-and-butter MBA programme. While much of the IIM system is focused on celebrating corporate titans of the world, I have been happy to inhabit a much less glamorous space that has produced many outstanding scholars."

Along with additional space, the department is also eyeing to generate revenues by auctioning the junk items. The decision would also help the department saving crores as they don't have to construct additional classrooms.

The move came after department officials inspected several schools to learn that almost all schools have several articles lying without any use. State has over 71,000 schools. The department is expecting to generate space equivalent to the around 2,000-3,000 classrooms.

""Since the enrolments in government schools have shot up by 18 lakhs in the last five years. Most of the senior secondary schools have junk occupying a space equivalent of a classroom. This space once cleared can be used to accommodate more students by adding an extra section or a class. The exercise will help in making optimum utilization of resources. The additional space created for fee would save department's crores of rupees,"" said a department official.

The department is taking the scheme very seriously that they have formed nodal officers to monitor the progress of the scheme. Every school has to list such articles and to be submitted to the district education officers. The last date for submitting the list to the district level officers is January 11 and auction will take place on January 18.

""It is a great policy decision. Schools struggle to find a way to depose off the junk pending from years. This decision would help the schools to keep the classroom neat and clean,"" said Ameen Kaimkhany, president of Rajasthan Urdu Teachers Association."

Q. I have plans to be in the United States for pursuing my higher studies next year. Hailing from a middle class family, I have to look forward to support myself as far as possible. It will really help me if details and procedures on applying for a job after joining the university are explained. Are there any restrictions on number of working hours for a student who works on the university campus?

- Akshay Kumar, Mettuguda

A. As also mentioned in an earlier column, most international students in the United States go on an F-1 (non-immigrant) student visa. On an F-1 visa, a student is eligible to work only on the campus of their university. Immigration laws of the USA do not allow international students to work off-campus during their studies. On-campus work opportunities are also limited to up to 20 hours per week during the academic semester and up to 40 hours per week during school breaks. Also, please take note that you are eligible for on-campus employment only while you are enrolled full-time in an academic programme.

The on-campus work depends on availability of such positions. If a department/ college offers assistantships, you may apply for the same during your application or after admission. Most of the time, an assistantship means that the student does not pay tuition and receives a scholarship or stipend that can cover some portion of accommodation, meals, books and some personal expenses. The sum paid for assistantship varies by State, town, university, etc. Assistantships are available to students in the form of Teaching Assistantships (TA), Graduate Assistantships (GA), and/or Research Assistantships (RA) wherein students help their departments with teaching, research, both teaching and research, or other department/college work. You may look up the department/college webpage or contact the department for further information about assistantship options. You may also apply for other on-campus jobs that are generally advertised through a student job portal by most universities. There is competition for all open positions, so you should plan to apply as early as possible. Also, have a close look at the eligibility criteria before applying for the position.

F1 students can also avail Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and Optional Practical Training (OPT) after completing one year of coursework. CPT is an off-campus internship or practicum in a major field of study and requires pre-approval by the international student office of your university. OPT is also off-campus work for which you may apply after completion of an academic degree. It is 12 months of work directly related to your academic major, extended up to 24 months for STEM fields.

Q. I am in third year of MBBS. My friends told me about USMLE is required to practice in the US. Can you share details?

- Veronica Rao, Khairatabad

A. USMLE stands for United States Medical Licensing Examination and it is a licensing examination required in order to receive a license to practice medicine within the United States. The USMLE comprises three different steps that examine the individual's knowledge of specific topics related to the field of medicine and the application of all of these skills and areas of knowledge in the medical field. Students and graduates of medical schools outside the United States and Canada should apply for the different steps of USMLE by following the instructions at the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) website. You may refer to following websites to get further details about USMLE:

a) USMLE website: http://www.usmle.org/;

With the conclusion of Jammu Municipal Elections after thirteen years came the hope for accountability, solutions for public grievances - hope for a change. Corporators arranged thanks giving lunch/dinner and subsequently visited their wards with respective MLAs, who still had the CDF (Constituency Development Funds) as the assembly was still active and public got much needed confidence booster, once again promises of clean Jammu were given and public started believing the Corporators of their wards. Each and every Corporator's Facebook wall is full of pictures, either of felicitations or of drain cleaning which earlier MLAs were flaunting on social media. Along with all these activities background canvassing for Mayor and Deputy Mayor were also going on.

Despite BJP having clear majority in JMC, election of Mayor seemed to be a tough but ultimately Jammu got its Mayor and Deputy Mayor on 15th November 2018 after many deliberations. With this also the process of photo sessions, felicitation ceremonies commenced and in between Governor dissolved J & K assembly on 21st November and suddenly all MLAs disappeared from scene in shock mode, Mayor and Deputy Mayor became the ultimate VIPs to be invited for inaugurations which they lapped up happily as if posts of Mayor and Deputy Mayor were carved out for this purpose only. After nearly one month of their elections first general body meeting of JMC was convened and whatever expectations or dreams public were having got shattered with a bang. If one goes through the agenda of the meeting, 'Seva Bhav' for public disappeared and top priority with unanimity is to increase honorarium of Corporators to at least forty to fifty thousand despite the example laid by PM Modi who had donated 21 lakhs rupee, his personal savings as Chief Minister's salary in 10 years, for educating daughters of drivers and peons working with Gujarat Government. In today's contest it is to think about your interests rest all is secondary.

Eleven items were listed in agenda and it included demand for opening of school for Children of Municipal employees as if there is no government school in entire Jammu , recruitment of Safai Karam Charis - what about the existing ones who work for few hours in the morning and then disappear for their private assignments, promotion orders of employees - for their outstanding efforts to make Jammu a City of garbage and chaos , beautification of JMC walls - as if it is the only place in whole Jammu, no parking zone in JMC premises- to further congest adjoining roads , plantation in and around JMC - to provide better air to corporators, outsourcing of autos for garbage collection, night sanitation and animal birth control programme- to claim no responsibility of theirs in future. Jammuites are shocked and amazed to see no agenda for Jammu public as if all these corporators have been elected for their own cause, for the building of JMC or employees there in. It's not long ago when State High Court had to intervene when a RTI revealed that Rs. 34,65,374 were spent to convert a cattle pond to Municipal Quarter No.10 at Gandhi Nagar which was later allotted to Joint Commissioner (A) who was nearing his superannuation, a gift was given to the former officer at the cost of the rights of the animals.

Similarly a PIL seeking high level probe into the illegal/backdoor allotments of Municipal Quarters/ Flats/ Shops in favour of ex-employees of JMC /private persons and sought investigation by State Vigilance Organization as JMC further extended lease of their accommodations for 40 years at a meager rent of Rs.600 to Rs.900 per month for prime municipal flats situated at Gandhi Nagar, Jammu and beneficiaries included former Commissioner/ Secretary to Government of J&K Housing and Urban Development Department who at one time was JMC Commissioner as well, former Joint Commissioner (Adm) JMC, ex-PA to Commissioner JMC, Driver of JMC, PSO to Commissioner/ Secretary to Govt. of J&K H&UDD to name a few and ultimately the Division Bench ordered for the entire record of more than 600 allotments of JMC assets made in the similar fashion without adopting any procedure/ criteria. Past and present actions are in sync depicting only self use of JMC resources with impunity.

Contrary to JMC, right now SMC (Srinagar Municipal Corporation) is working day and night with Mayor Junaid Azim Mattu leading from front as any feedback on his twitter handle is treated as complaint and corrective measures are taken immediately. Srinagar public is actively participating and enjoying the proactive approach of their Mayor. No day has gone since taking oath when Mayor and Deputy Mayor have not visited different problematic areas and on spot decisions have been taken. All reharis have been asked to register so that some alternative arrangements are made to accommodate them in a phased manner but in Jammu Mayor has ordered restoration of illegal Kiosks in front of GMC to be restored at unused matador stand despite traffic bottle neck in the area. Another worth mention decision by SMC is collection of waste from butcheries so that the it is properly dumped at the authorized site but no such initiative at Jammu. Sunday bazaar market of Lal Chowk has been regularized with nominal fee, all encroachments are getting removed in a phased manner including bunkers , traffic police kiosks on footpath, suggestions / plans are being made for beautification, requisition for funds for water bodies preservation are few other measures. Though identical is the situation at Jammu's Sunday market right from Bus stand, Shalamar, City Chowk, Super bazaar, Purani Mandi, Raj Tilak road to Parade but no such stream lining or revenue generation initiative. SMC Mayor is regularly arranging meetings of different departments for better co-ordination for quick and better results but it requires a herculean effort to get one's street light repaired at Jammu. All talks little action is the buzz word at Jammu.

Coming back to JMC, only way to lodge complaint is through their web site and believe it requires hell lot of effort to get registered your complaint and the mobile number of contact person you receive by return SMS is either non -existent or the concerned person is not responsible for the concerned ward. Countless Commissioners have been replaced in a span of last three years without any result so much so that Smart City project is standing at same place from where it started but who bothers. There is no Solid Waste Disposal site/policy in place despite number of reminders from High Court, no STP in place as such whole sewage waste is being dumped in river Tawi from where drinking water is supplied to whole old city, no fogging during monsoon to check dengue. Plastic carry bags are sold openly in the market, from where they are procured and how they reach market is not priority of JMC reasons better known to them only. No scheme in place for door to door household garbage collection and no campaign in media for public awareness. There is no transparency in dog sterilization program as these services are shuttling between NGOs and Municipality and both blaming each other for the failure to curtail dog menace in almost every ward. No biometric attendance of employees in place with the result even newly elected corporators are running pillar to post to get allocated nonexistent Safai workers of their respective wards. Leaking water pipes of drinking water in drains are there in every ward as there is no mechanism in place for coordination between JMC and PHE, civil wing of JMC unable to get repaired the damaged lanes as there is no accountability, illegal infrastructures coming up despite army of 17 exclusive employees in Enforcement wing of JMC to look after 75 wards. High Court has to intervene time and again to rap JMC for repeated deficiency of services but that too is of little use and all these glaring lapses are testimony to failure of parental department which was with BJP for last 3 years.

Earlier MLAs were performing the duties of Corporators, looking after lanes, drains of the area but their half hearted efforts were more intended for photo sessions as such it had yielded only shoddy work which disappeared with the first monsoon shower of the season as there is no check on quality of work as no supervising engineer is there on site to see whether drains have proper slope or lanes have been laid as per set parameters or the resultant malba lifted. There is urgent need of streamlining the system with latest techniques along with innovative ideas to get the things done in proper manner. Installing vending machines for plastic bottles at all public places, converting flowers collected from temples to incense sticks, rain water harvesting in new buildings are few innovations which all modern cities are adopting. Mayor or concerned staff of JMC should visit Indore, the cleanest city of India, for practical ideas how they achieved this as with the elections approaching fast and BJP running the JMC now it's their last chance to set things right which their ministers and MLAs had failed in the past and with their own Government at Centre and President's rule in state they don't have any excuse this time right now. One hopes JMC takes corrective measures to put a system in place instead of random knee jerk measures which are of no use. Planning and implementation are the most important aspects without which JMC is bound to fail once again this time as well as in the past. Right now the question of public is, will they deliver this time?

AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal Saturday lashed out at the Congress, BJP and INLD, accusing them of never paying attention towards improving schools and hospitals, adding it was only his party which improved the national capital's education and health sectors in the past three years.

Addressing a 'School and Hospital' rally in this district of Haryana, he promised to order an audit of all private schools in the state and return the ""excess school fees"" to parents if the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to power after the assembly elections next year.

""After 70 years of Independence, there is only one party which openly talks about schools and hospitals. Today, no party in the country has the courage to talk about hospitals and schools. We have improved the condition of government schools and hospitals in Delhi,"" he said.

Sirsa is considered a stronghold of opposition INLD.

""I want to ask you do you need hospitals and schools or violence between Jats and non-Jats?"" he said, adding the public did not want casteism or violence between Hindus and Muslims.

The Delhi chief minister accused the Congress, BJP and INLD of ""looting"" the country for 70 years.

""These parties looted the country for 70 years. If Kejriwal can change the shape of schools and hospitals in Delhi, why did not these parties do so in 70 years?"" he said.

""I appeal to the youth to support us and save the country. If these parties continue to rule for some more years, the country will not survive,"" he said.

Kejriwal also hit out at the Khattar government for not allowing him to visit a government dispensary in Karnal last month.

""I had gone to Asandh to see a dispensary. But the Khattar government stopped me midway. Am I a terrorist? I am the chief minister of Delhi. I was going to visit the dispensary and I had come to my Haryana, I was born in Haryana. Haryana is mine and it is not anybody's personal property,"" he said.

Praising his government in Delhi for changing the face of government schools, the AAP leader said even rich parents had now started admitting their wards in these schools.

""We have also been able to return the excess fee charged by private schools in the last 10 years. Have you ever heard of private schools returning fees? You change the government in Haryana and bring AAP to power.

""We will also not allow school fees to be raised in next five years. We had done it in Delhi and we will do so in Haryana as well,"" he said.

Kejriwal added that his government in Delhi had also decided that in case of power outage, consumers would be provided compensation.

He launched a scathing at Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu by recalling the latter's days of deception when he deception when he backstabbed his father-in-law, late CM NTR, soon after the TDP founder was elected to the Assembly from Tekkali in 1994.

YS Jagan said the local minister Atchannaidu was a complete failure in addressing public issues in the last four years. ""The TDP minister, it is said, is the big boss of the sand mafia in Amudala Valasa, Narasapuram and other places in the region. All government contracts are awarded only to the minister's brother Hari Prasad,"" he said parroting the locals' woes.

All the rivers in the region have been exploited in the name of Neeru-Chettu program while the TDP leaders demand commissions for building toilets, providing pensions and Anganwadi jobs.

The Leader of Opposition said 1,500 people in this constituency had to approach the Courts to get their pensions after the TDP leaders deliberately removed their names. The locals said Atchannaidu encroached government lands to build godowns.

Any one who wants to get a new granite quarrying license and NOC should pay Rs 25 lakhs to the associates of Atchannaidu. A land belonging to the RTC in Tekkali has been registered in the name of Atchanaidu's relative.

In Chandrababu Naidu's rule, the electricity charges for polishing units have been increased by Rs 8 per unit. Employees of Metkore Ferro Alloys were staging a protest against the management demanding payment of salary dues, while I was passing by, he said.

Speaking about the protests against Kakarapalli power plant, YS Jagan recalled that in 2014 Chandrababu Naidu promised to cancel permissions for the plant. Fishermen were losing their livelihood while 51 villages were living in danger. In Bhavanapadu Port project, the farmers' lands were acquired for cheap prices only to benefit the rich and powerful.

YS Jagan said the locals who were affected by cyclone Titli are still awaiting compensation. Fake cheques have been in circulation in the aftermath of the cyclone, he said reading out anonymous names owho were said to have been awarded the compensation.

Chandrababu released just Rs 520 crores while the damage evaluated in the Titli cyclone was Rs 3,400 crore.

The Opposition leader mocked Chandrababu's claims of controlling the ocean currents in cyclone Phethai. While the cyclone was on, Chandrababu took a special flight to the swearing-in of chief ministers in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.

Does Chandrababu's Real Time Governance System predict the cyclone effect better than that of IMD and ISRO? Did you send a satellite into the space for estimating weather conditions? he asked Chandrababu. YS Jagan recalled that late Chief Minister Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy signed an MOU with ISRO in 2006.

Doesn't the RTGS system remind Chandrababu on the pending Rs 87,600 crore farm loans?

Doesn't the RTGS stystem remind Chandrababu on the pending loans of the women's self help groups?

""Only Nara Lokesh was employed with a minister's post in the last four years.""

In Chandrababu's rule, the electricity charges, fuel prices, RTC bus charges, house tax , school fees etc. have skyrocketed. Chandrababu, who promised to provide nine hours of electricity to farmers, did not keep his word. Besides, the TDP is collecting huge revenue in the form of electricity bills, he said.

In 2014, Chandrababu vowed to ban all liquor shops in the state. But, after four years of his rule, he has ensured that every village had a liquor shop, YS Jagan said.

Chandrababu's opprtunism and antics have touched new heights with his friendship with the Congress. After having abused Congress leaders post-bifurcation, he is now befriending the Congress. He had planned on spending crores of Rupees to buy out MLAs in Telangana. In the process, he was caught red-handed in note for vote case. His friendship with the Congress is only to protect himself from facing prosecution in the cases and corruption charges.

Just a few months back, the Congress leaders released a book on Chandrababu's deceptions and corruption charges. Chandrababu took a massive U-turn in demand for the Special Category Status (SCS) after accepting the special package.

YS Jagan recalled the golden days of Dr YSR. He lashed out at Chandrababu Naidu for ignoring the interests of lakhs of students with the scrapping of fee reimbursement.

After coming to power, we are going to transform the lives of the poor in the State, he said while explaining the benefits of Navarathnalu."

2 new petrol pumps

The Chandigarh Administration has allotted two sites to the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation to set up two petrol pumps as the corporation will operate these petrol pumps. Additional Secretary Estates, Chandigarh has send a letter to Municipal Commissioner KK Yadav earmarking site number 3 at Industrial area phase II (and site number 4 in Sector 51 A on vikas marg for the MC to set up two petrol pumps. In January this year, Chandigarh administrator V P Singh Badnore had announced the allotment .

No deposits for Uber drivers

The Chandigarh Transport Authority has directed popular taxi-hailing app Uber to stop the practice of asking people to deposit a minimum amount while booking a taxi through the digital mode of payment, terming it as an ""unfair"" practise. A direction was issued to the company on the basis of a complaint of a resident, Ajay Jagga, who wrote to the Prime Minister's Office recently stating that the company was holding people's deposits of up to D350 for no reason for those paying through digital modes.

Death certificates on spot

The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation has decided to install computers and a printer at cremation grounds in the city and will be issuing death certificates immediately after cremations. The first copy will be issued free of cost to the familes of the deceased. However, these certificates will not be issued to those killed in any of the six government hospitals in the city. Their certificates will be issued by the hospital directly. In all other cases, the certificate will be issued at the ground after verification of documents."

As one of the cool kids at school, I started a coin collection in fifth grade. I remember going on trips to the bank with my mom for rolls of coins to sort through, looking at dates and years to fill in the slots in my blue coin-collecting albums. That, alongside my parents owning a business, sent me on many trips to local banks. But over time, my number of visits to the bank have dropped to zero.These days, I stick with an online-only bank as my primary bank. I don't have a single branch available. While it seemed strange at first, it was easy to grow accustomed to.

Let's look at the pros and cons to help you better understand if you could survive with online-only banking.

Online account offers from our partners:

With online-only banking, you are the teller and new accounts representative for yourself. Instead of going into a bank branch, you handle your own banking transactions from your computer or smartphone - like you could with many traditional banks, too.

Online banking uses secured connections, so as long as you use strong, unique passwords, it's totally safe to bank online. The best accounts allow you to deposit checks from your phone, transfer funds to or from any account at any bank with no fees, pay bills online, and avoid fees common to traditional brick-and-mortar banks.

As long as you get paid via direct deposit or check, as opposed to cash, online banking should easily meet all of your financial needs. Now, let's take a more detailed look at how some of the features work so you understand how the replace your old banking experience.

Once logged in, you can view balances, pay bills, make transfers, and deposit a check with a photo. If you have other accounts at the same bank, such as credit cards, loans, or investments, you can manage and make transfers to those accounts as well.

With online banking, it is easy to have all of your accounts under one roof. But even if you don't, it's easy to manage everything through convenient mobile apps.

The only real downsides of online banking are losing the in-person banking option and depositing cash with a teller. If you have a job where you are paid mostly in cash or tips, like a restaurant server or valet parking attendant, online-only banking probably isn't viable for you.

Taking cash out of an online bank account, though, is easy. Most online banks charge no fees for any ATM access, and some reimburse fees charged by other banks' ATMs. Some popular accounts that offer no-fee ATM access include Ally Bank (up to $10 per month reimbursed) and Charles Schwab Bank (unlimited reimbursements).

To deposit cash, you may want to consider pairing your online banking account with a favorite local credit union. Most credit unions offer a basic no-fee checking and savings option, which you can use to deposit cash and transfer to or from your online bank account.

Even online banks that don't charge fees usually offer a large network of free ATMs. Through memberships in various banks networks, Capital One (39,000 free ATMs), Discover Bank (60,000 free ATMs), and others typically have a convenient location near your work or home.

For example, most big banks charge huge fees for overdrafts. Online banks charge lower fees, if any. Capital One gives you four options for how to handle overdrafts to help you avoid or manage fees. Simple and Chime don't charge those fees at all - in fact, the only fee online bank Simple charges is for foreign debit card use. Otherwise, you won't pay them a cent. Ever.

Capital One and Ally typically stand at the top of the leaderboards in terms of interest rates, but other online banks don't lag far behind. Online savings rates are commonly around 20x better than what you get from the big, nationwide traditional banks.

If the idea of better interest rates, lower fees, and managing your own banking online is tempting to you, online banking may be the right choice.

To get started, you can keep an old account in addition to your new online account, slowly shifting your banking. Alternatively, you can get an online account and keep a local credit union account for physical banking needs. The truly bold dive in without looking back.

Online banking may feel new to you, but it has been around since the early 1980s. It's safe and secure and the future of managing money. As long as you don't need to regularly deposit cash, online-online banking may be a great decision for your money needs.

But where to find them? Deal, no deal or even another referendum?

While #Brexit has dominated much of public debate and Government time, #Metoo and #gigeconomy have also featured prominently in public debate though they are assigned to the Government's growing list of ""future legislative reform needed if we just had time"" pile - shame JK Rowling couldn't make Hermione's time turner a reality.

The Government has repeatedly stated that it intends to maintain current UK employment laws so that existing workers' rights are unchanged following exit day, this could of course change, as political fortunes change ('Fantastic [Brexit] Beasts: the [G]rimes of Grindel[gov]'). The reality is that it is unlikely the Government will change its mind and repeal all EU-derived employment law or make large-scale changes to employment law in the aftermath of Brexit. There may be scope to tweak some provisions within the current legislation, but political considerations make it relatively unlikely that core employee rights would be reduced significantly following Brexit.

John Whiting, now CBE, is the writer's personal favourite taxman for this simple and honest statement, which continues to be true. Like last year, determining worker status in modern workplaces has once again been a hot topic in 2018.

Back in February we finally saw the delayed Government Response to the recommendations of the Taylor review of modern working practices; and the answer to the tricky employment status issue is...more consultation and thinking!

The Government has rejected Matthew Taylor's recommendation for introducing a 'worker status by default' presumption and is instead revisiting the possibility of a new statutory test to determine employment status. As acknowledged in the latest consultation which closed on 1 June, codification of the test for employment status would involve trade-offs. On the one hand, a simple and clear formula will give more certainty. On the other hand, the current case law based framework provides the nuance and flexibility often needed when applying the test to different circumstances which are inevitable in the labour market.

Ultimately, employment status is a complicated subject because employment relationships are just that - complicated. A status test set down in legislation rather than case law doesn't change that fact. Trying to encapsulate the nuanced factors developed over years of case law into legislation will be no easy feat. But have the courts been any more helpful this year?

Since the 2016 landmark tribunal decision (and 2017 Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) judgment) that Uber drivers are workers (despite Uber's best efforts at drafting bamboozling contractual clauses) there has been a seemingly endless supply of successful new claims predominantly concerning couriers [Insert your choice of courier company name and you will most likely find a case].

In June, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Pimlico Plumbers Limited & Anr v Smith on whether a plumber who was self-employed for tax purposes was nonetheless a worker for employment law purposes. In relation to the personal service requirement for establishing 'worker' status, the Supreme Court confirmed that a limited or occasional power of delegation could still be consistent with personal performance. The 'dominant purpose' of the contract remained one of personal service.

The Supreme Court's judgment significantly decreases the importance of the right of substitution as a determining factor. A substitution clause in and of itself does not magically prevent worker status. On the other hand, integration in the business appears to be a factor of increasing importance in the current wave of worker status cases.

The Supreme Court has tweaked the judicial test by succinctly articulating the 'dominant purpose' factor. But this is more judicial test evolution rather than revolution. Unfortunately, for hopes of world peace, arguments over the required elements of worker status are far from over. Whether and to what extent 'mutuality of obligation' between assignments is relevant to a person's status during assignments is still up for grabs. 'Mutuality of obligation' is a crucial factor to establish 'employee' status, but is it required and if so, to what extent, for establishing 'worker' status? As the Supreme Court said there is no easy answer to this question and it will have to await appraisal on another occasion.

The further appeal in the Uber case was heard by the Court of Appeal on 30 and 31 October. Will the judgment, when handed down, provide an answer? No doubt whichever way the judgment goes, the losing party will further appeal.

Unfortunately, we are not much closer to tackling world peace!

Last year in Jones v Birds Eye, the employment tribunal reminded us that following the 2013 EAT decision in Moran v Ideal Cleaning, the number of agency workers potentially falling within the provisions of the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 was significantly lower than originally anticipated. Following Moran, not all agency workers are protected; it is only those supplied to work temporarily. Those placed indefinitely (meaning open-ended in duration) are not placed 'temporarily' and are therefore outside the scope of the Agency Workers Regulations (AWR).

In both Moran and Jones the agency workers were found not to be temporary and so not covered by the AWR. Conversely this year in Brooknight Guarding Ltd v Matei we have an example of an agency worker placed temporarily. The EAT agreed with the tribunal, that while a relief security guard mainly worked at one site, it was as a 'cover security guard'. Each 'as required' assignment was on a temporary rather than on a permanent or indefinite basis.

In Kocur v Angard Staffing Solutions Ltd, an employer breached the AWR in providing an agency worker with fewer enhanced contractual days' holiday and shorter paid rest breaks than comparable permanent employees, despite the agency worker receiving a higher hourly wage. The EAT rejected the defence that the agency worker's higher rate of pay offset his inferior holiday entitlement and rest breaks - the AWR require a term-by-term comparison not a package approach.

For a part-time worker to establish less favourable treatment under the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (PTW) they need to identify an actual full-time worker comparator who is: employed by the same employer under the same type of contract and engaged in the same or broadly similar work having regard to level of qualification, skills and experience.

In Roddis v Sheffield Hallam University, the EAT considered what constitutes the 'same type of contract' for PTW purposes in the context of a claim by an employee working under a zero hours contract. The University argued that a lecturer's zero-hours contract was not the 'same type of contract' so he could not compare himself with a full-time lecturer on a permanent contract of employment.

A good academic try? Well no. The EAT had no trouble in rejecting this argument. It cannot be that a zero-hours contract of itself constitutes a different type of contract for the purposes of the PTW, since the consequence would be that an employee on a zero-hours contract would never be able to compare themselves to a full-time worker. As the EAT points out, if a contract of employment containing a zero-hours clause was a distinct type of contract under the PTW, the PTW would be self-defeating.

Back in June 2013, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 was revamped. Significant new provisions were introduced. The changes included introducing co-workers' liability for victimisation with corresponding employer statutory vicarious liability.

In November, the Court of Appeal in Timis and Sage v Osipov confirmed that an individual's personal liability for detriment which they cause to a whistleblower colleague can extend to liability for that colleague's dismissal. Where a distinct prior detrimental act done by a co-worker results in the whistleblower's dismissal, the whistleblower can still recover compensation for losses flowing from the dismissal - a so-called 'dismissal consequent on detriment' claim. In this case, it leaves two wrongdoer directors on the hook for just over Â£2 million of losses, the employer company being insolvent.

For there to be a qualifying disclosure under the whistleblowing legislation, there must be a disclosure of information, not a matter of opinion or an allegation. In practice, information and allegations are often intertwined. In June, the Court of Appeal clarified that the question is whether the disclosure has ""sufficient factual content and specificity"" (Kilraine v London Borough of Wandsworth).

This year we have also learnt on the whistleblowing front:

Common law vicarious liability is a principle of strict, no-fault liability for wrongs committed by another person. In an employment relationship, an employer may be liable for the wrongs committed by an employee where there is a sufficient connection between those wrongs and the employee's employment. This is a very long-standing legal principle with the foundation of the 'modern' principle going back to 1912 (Lloyd and Grace, Smith and Co). But have 21st century developments expanded its scope?

Following a number of appellate level 21st century judgments, when considering whether an incident has sufficient connection with the employer, it is not merely a question of whether the employee was 'at work' in a strict sense. Instead it is whether the employee was otherwise 'clothed in the employer's authority' or ''acting within the field of activities assigned to them'.

For example, an employer was liable for a Managing Director's violent assault of a colleague at an impromptu post-Christmas work party after-party as the MD 'chose to wear his metaphorical managing director's hat' at the time of the incident. Another employer was vicariously liable for a data breach by a rogue employee as access to the data was within the field of activities assigned to him. The fact that the rogue employee's actions were designed to harm the employer was irrelevant.

July saw the Court of Appeal hand down one of the most significant judgments of the year - a combined judgment in Royal Mencap Society v Tomlinson-Blake and Shannon v Rampersad t/a Clifton House Residential Home. In a single judgment, the Court of Appeal has effectively overturned the precedent value of numerous EAT judgments concerning the treatment of 'sleep-in' shifts for national minimum wage (NMW) purposes.

Where a worker is required to work a number of 'sleep-in' night shifts at the employer's premises (to be available in case of an occasional emergency but otherwise expected to sleep all or most of the shift), does the full night shift constitute 'working' for the purposes of the NMW? The Court of Appeal has now answered this question ruling: ""the only time that counts for NMW purposes [during sleep-in-shifts] is the time when the worker is required to be awake for the purpose of working"".

Quite simply the only time that counts for NMW purposes is the time when the worker is required to be awake and actually carrying out work. Time spent sleeping/relaxing does not count. Factors previously found to point towards NMW being payable for the entire sleep-in shift are now irrelevant. The sleep-in exception in the NMW Regulations applies to cases where ""the essence of the arrangement is that the worker is expected to sleep"".

Turning to on-call time for Working Time Directive purposes, until this year Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case-law has tended to focus on the worker's location during stand-by periods and whether it is at a place determined by the employer. Early this year, in Ville de Nivelles v Matzak, the CJEU considered whether on-call time is 'working time' for fire-fighters on-call at home but with a duty to respond within eight minutes. The CJEU has held that such time is 'working time'.

Perhaps a bit counterintuitively, this judgment still reaffirms the importance of proximity to the workplace. In this case, the obligation for the firefighters to remain physically present at the place determined by the employer (their homes) and the 'geographical and temporal constraints' resulting from the requirement to reach their place of work within eight minutes, limited the opportunities which the firefighters had to devote themselves to their personal and social interests. The situation of the firefighters in this case could therefore be distinguished from that of a worker who, during his stand-by duty, must simply be at his employer's disposal inasmuch as it must be possible to contact him. While being on employer premises during on-call time is not required, the proximity of the worker to the workplace at a place determined by the employer (even if it is the worker's home) is still a key factor.

In what is now a perennial favourite, holiday leave accrual, carry-over and pay calculations have once again featured heavily over the year.

Working out holiday entitlement for term time only workers, casual and zero hour workers can often prove to be an administrative headache. The Working Time Regulations (WTR) require holiday pay to be calculated on the basis of the average hours worked in the preceding 12 weeks immediately before payment is made. However, many employers have instead worked out holiday pay by using a 12.07% of annualised hours shortcut as set out in ACAS guidance (5.6 weeks is equivalent to 12.07% of hours worked over a year for a full time worker).

While the 12.07% method is accurate in many cases, it isn't always. In March, the EAT in Brazel v The Harpur Trust confirmed that calculating holiday pay for variable hour, term-time workers based on 12.07% of annualised hours is incorrect. The express provisions contained in the WTR cannot be overridden for ease of calculation. As shown in Mrs Brazel's case, the shortcut did not work accurately for part-time term time workers. Employers using a 12.07% of annualised hours calculation as a shortcut need to review their holiday pay calculation practices or face potential claims.

In Gomes v Higher Level Care Ltd, the Court of Appeal was asked whether compensation for failing to provide rest breaks can include an injury to feelings award. If yes, this would significantly increase the value of rest break breach claims.

The Court of Appeal has confirmed that compensation for claims for failing to provide rest breaks does not extend to injury to feelings, being akin to a breach of contract claim.

While compensation for failure to provide rest breaks and annual leave does not extend to awards for injury to feelings, not all WTR claims are excluded. In contrast, compensation for injury to feelings may be awarded in working time detriment claims since they are more akin to a statutory tort (South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service v Mansell & ors).

We have also had yet another EAT judgment on overtime and holiday pay calculations. The EAT in Flowers and others v East of England Ambulance Trust, once again confirmed that for a WTR claim ""normal pay"" is that which is ""normally received"". Focusing on whether overtime is or isn't ""voluntary"" is irrelevant. The key is regular receipt. But also check the contractual provisions. If there is a contractual right to have overtime included, there may not be a need to establish a regular pattern. In Flowers, regardless of the WTR claim, the claimants were entitled under a contractual clause to have any overtime pay received in the preceding three months included in their annual leave calculation whether or not the overtime worked was part of a regular and settled pattern.

In two German references, Kreuziger v Land Berlin and Max-Planck v Shimizu, the CJEU held that a worker who does not apply for paid annual leave during employment does not automatically lose the right to an allowance in lieu of untaken leave on termination. The worker must have been given an opportunity to take that leave. While employers are not required to force workers to actually exercise their right to take paid annual leave, a bit of nagging may be needed. It is for the employer to show that it encouraged the worker to do so, while informing them, accurately and in good time, of the risk of losing that leave at the end of the applicable reference period.

The CJEU has confirmed that the Working Time Directive (WTD) does not require holiday leave accrual during the taking of parental leave (Tribunalul BotoÅŸani v Dicu). Parental leave (in the UK 18 weeks' unpaid leave to care for a child) is distinguishable from sickness absence and maternity leave. If national law suspends the employment contract during parental leave, then annual leave entitlement does not accrue during the taking of that parental leave. Parental leave is not equivalent to a period of actual work for determining the duration of paid annual leave.

In the UK, legislative provisions which apply to maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental leave expressly state that during the leave period the employee is entitled to the benefit of all the terms and conditions of employment except remuneration - so holiday leave accrual continues during these leave periods. However, there is no corresponding legislative provision in relation to EU law derived parental leave.

If an employer unilaterally imposes a contractual change, it is possible for employees' agreement to be implied if they continue to work without protesting after the change has been imposed. But this is risky. Careful analysis of all communication from employees (both verbal and written) is necessary to ensure nothing has been communicated that suggests or evidences objection to the changes. Where the change imposed does not have immediate effect, silence would not be considered to be agreement simply as a result of the passage of time.

In April, the Court of Appeal in Abrahall and ors v Nottingham City Council reminded employers just what risky business it is to assume agreement. In this case, the Court held that a group of employees who continued to work following their employer's imposition of a pay freeze did not agree to a variation of contract. Although the employees did not bring tribunal claims until two years later and did not individually communicate protest, they had protested through their trade unions at the time. The employees continuing to work could not be taken as unequivocal acceptance of a change that was wholly to their disadvantage. A decision by the union not to take industrial action over the imposed change did not equate to accepting the variation.

Also in April, we received Supreme Court clarification on when contractual notice of termination served by post takes effect (Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust v Haywood). In the absence of any specific contractual provision, contractual notice takes effect only when the employee personally takes delivery of the letter containing the notice (so not date recorded delivery signed for by a family member). In this case, the date of termination was crucial because it determined whether the notice period expired on or before the employee's 50th birthday, which affected her pension entitlement by some Â£200,000.

This judgment now aligns the contractual law position with the statutory position in respect of the effective date of termination (EDT) under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

Lesson: when dismissing an employee, it is usually best to inform the employee in person (written confirmation being simply that, confirmation, and not the mode of first communication of the actual decision). This will remove any ambiguity about the date of dismissal.

From this year's crop of unfair dismissal judgments we have learned:

A head teacher's failure to disclose to school governors a close personal relationship she had with a registered sex offender was misconduct justifying dismissal (Reilly v Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council - Supreme Court). This judgment is of particular note as Lord Wilson questions how useful is the long-standing Burchell v BHS reasonableness test, but without reaching a conclusion. The Supreme Court has, in effect, invited argument in a future case.

Misconduct does need to necessarily amount to gross misconduct for a fair dismissal. There is no magic in labelling something as gross misconduct rather than as serious misconduct for unfair dismissal purposes. As ever, each case will be fact specific to determine whether the employer acted reasonably in treating that reason for dismissal as sufficient to justify dismissal (Quintiles Commercial UK Ltd v Barongo - EAT).

The deemed extension of the effective date of termination by statutory minimum notice does not apply where the employer is entitled to immediately dismiss (summary dismissal) by reason of the employee's conduct (Lancaster and Duke Ltd v Wileman - EAT)

An employee's letter giving 'notice' was not an unambiguous resignation. The context for the letter was that the employee was expecting to take up a different role in another department (although that role was subsequently withdrawn) and the tribunal was entitled to read it as giving notice of intention to leave a particular role rather than to terminate employment (East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust v Levy - EAT).

Where an employee is contractually entitled to receipt of Permanent Health Insurance (PHI) payments, absent any over-riding express terms, the courts will imply a term preventing an employee being dismissed where this would deprive them of the benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled under the PHI scheme. While an employee may use the implied term in a breach of contract wrongful dismissal claim, tribunals must not allow that breach to automatically dictate its conclusions on unfair dismissal. Having said that, breach of the implied term will still be a very important relevant factor when assessing fairness (Awan v ICTS UK Ltd - EAT).

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee for taking part in the activities of an independent trade union. Union officials who are also employees will lose this protection where they are found to have acted wholly unreasonably or maliciously in carrying out their functions. But where is the line drawn?

The Court of Appeal confirmed a trade union official was automatically unfairly dismissed despite misuse of confidential information. In the Court's view, it is not uncommon for a union representative to be given, without soliciting it, information that he or she realises has been obtained without the owner's consent. Although it might be said that the only correct course in such circumstances would be to decline the information or destroy it, the court was 'not here concerned with an ethics seminar'. Instead the key question was whether the very limited way in which Mr Morris made use of the obviously illegally obtained information (forwarding it to HR and insisting on a meeting to discuss the contents) was a 'sufficient departure from good industrial relations practice to take his conduct outside the scope of 'trade union activities' .

The Court held the line had not been crossed. At most, some sort of warning for storing and not deleting the information might have been appropriate. The official's conduct was not outside the scope of 'trade union activities' and he was therefore entitled to the statutory automatic unfair dismissal protection (Morris v Metrolink RATP Dev Ltd).

On the tax front, since 6 April the way that termination payments are taxed has changed. All payments in lieu of notice are now treated as earnings subject to tax and class 1 NICs. Effectively, employers are required to subject to tax an amount equivalent to the employee's basic pay (as defined in the new rules) if notice is not worked. However, planned changes making termination payments above Â£30,000 subject to class 1A NICs (employer liability only) have been postponed even further to April 2020, which is good news for employers.

While case law on transfers of undertakings has been relatively quiet this year we have had some interesting cases and some rare examples:

A renewed warning that if a parent company takes over the day-to-day running of the business of a subsidiary, this may result in a TUPE transfer of the subsidiary's employees to the parent. Significant care should be taken when a parent company decides to show more of an interest in the business of its subsidiary (whether following a share acquisition or otherwise). If the parent starts making decisions and issuing directions in a manner which suggests that it has assumed control of the subsidiary, it could inadvertently become the employer. In Guvera Ltd v Butler a parent company learned that lesson at some considerable cost, with awards for failing to inform and consult on the intra-group transfer amounting to Â£3.5 million having been made to the numerous claimants in this case.

European case-law in line with existing UK case-law that a temporary cessation of activities prior a transfer does not necessarily prevent the existence of a transfer of undertaking (Colino SigÃ¼enza - CJEU).

A reminder that in assessing whether there has been a service provision change (SPC) to multiple new providers, the effect of fragmentation must be considered when identifying the relevant activity. In some cases, the way a service is carried out post-transfer will be a relevant consideration in determining whether the activities are fundamentally the same as those carried out by the outgoing contractor. It is important to assess the issue of fragmentation early on in the analysis, because in some cases the fragmentation will be so acute that it will no longer be possible to say that there has been a service provision change (London Care Ltd v Henry and others - EAT).

EAT guidance on the meaning of 'undertaking', 'economic entity' and 'administrative function', which is rarely seen in domestic cases. A useful round-up of case law (both domestic and European) in relation to services or entities performing functions within the public sector (Nicholls and others v London Borough of Croydon).

A rare example of a permitted change to terms and conditions following a TUPE transfer. A transferor was not prevented from withdrawing a travel time allowance. The genuine reason for its withdrawal was that it was outdated and unjustified, not for a reason related to the transfer (Tabberer v Mears Ltd - EAT).

It was hard to miss that on 25 May, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) together with the new Data Protection Act 2018 came into force introducing a raft of important changes to the data protection regime. Key changes include:

In July we received Court of Appeal guidance on the balancing test needed when dealing with a ""mixed data"" Subject Access Request and when a third party objects to their data being disclosed (B v General Medical Council):

Although the decision concerns the DPA 1998, it will continue to have relevance under the DPA 2018 and GDPR regime.

This year employers are reminded that checking references given by applicants is an important part of any recruitment process. Especially where experience equates to safety, doing so is critical.

In Francis-McGann v West Atlantic UK Ltd, a pilot applied for a captain position with a freight airline. He falsely claimed to have previously worked as a captain and gave as a referee Mr Desilijic Tiure - in hope that the reference would never be checked. The pilot was appointed as a captain before his references were checked and provided with training based on him already being an experienced captain.

The person who initially decided to hire Mr Francis-McGann was clearly not an obsessive Star Wars fan. When his references were checked, it became obvious that Mr Desilijic Tiure was fictitious, being Jabba Desilijic Tiure, better known as Jabba the Hutt of Star Wars fame! However that was merely the first Episode.

After being summarily dismissed, Mr Francis-McGann brought a tribunal claim for three months' unpaid notice pay! The tribunal had no qualms in dismissing his claim and allowing the employer's cross claim for recovery of training costs in accordance with a contractual clause in the sum of Â£4,725. The force was clearly not with Mr Francis-McGann.

In July, the EAT gave a warning to prospective employers considering withdrawing a job offer following the receipt of an unsatisfactory reference criticising an applicant's levels of absence in their previous job without first considering whether there was an underlying disability.

In South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust v Lee a prospective employer was liable for discrimination arising from disability when it withdrew a job offer after receiving and relying upon two unsatisfactory references. One of the references was unduly negative and inaccurate because it heavily relied on disability-related absences. The tribunal found the discriminatory reference had more than a minor influence on the new hirer's decision-maker. As such, it did not matter that the non-discriminatory reference may in and of itself have been sufficient cause to withdraw the job offer (although this may be relevant when awarding compensation). Lesson - consider references critically to assess whether any adverse comments in references may relate to disability necessitating follow-up enquiry.

Do employers need to match enhanced maternity pay for fathers taking Shared Parental Leave (ShPL)?

Early in April, the EAT in Ali v Capita Customer Management confirmed that it is not direct sex discrimination for employers to offer 14 weeks' enhanced maternity pay but only statutory ShPL pay.

While this case is in line with Government guidance and the traditional view, it is notable that Mr Ali's case concerned an enhanced maternity pay period of only 14 weeks which happens to be the minimum maternity leave period required under the EU Pregnant Workers Directive. As such, a question mark remains where enhanced contractual maternity pay period exceeds 14 weeks.

While we received at least a limited answer on the question of direct sex discrimination (subject to a pending appeal), the question of indirect sex discrimination is still very much up for grabs. Three weeks after the EAT handed down the Ali judgment, the EAT handed down its related judgment in Hextall v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police.

In Hextall, the same question was considered through the prism of an indirect discrimination claim. In this case the EAT held the original tribunal incorrectly analysed the question of comparators and also failed to correctly identify the particular disadvantage. The case was therefore sent back to the tribunal. The question of indirect discrimination continues to be unresolved and we wait a further tribunal decision (determined on the correct legal basis). Like Ali, Hextall too is subject to a pending appeal.

While large private sector equal pay claims against several large supermarkets are making their way through the tribunal system and the usual endless preliminary issues, this year we have learned:

'Discrimination arising from a disability' is still a relatively new concept first introduced by section 15 of the Equality Act 2010. Over recent years we are gathering a body of case-law on the intricacies of this concept which involves the employer treating the employee ""unfavourably because of something arising in consequence"" of the employee's disability. Section 15 entails two distinct causative issues: The first involves examining the employer's state of mind: did the unfavourable treatment occur because of the employer's attitude to the relevant 'something'? The second is objective: is there a causal link between the disability and the 'something'?

This year we have learned:

In Donelien v Liberata UK, the Court of Appeal reassures employers that they can rely on the advice of occupational health advisers in determining whether an employee is disabled, so long as appropriate questions are raised and further clarification is sought where necessary.

An employer does not necessarily need to take every step possible to establish whether an employee is disabled in order to avoid having constructive knowledge of disability. The test is what an employer could reasonably be expected to know. In this case, the employer had not relied solely on an occupational health report stating that the employee was not disabled. It had also taken into account 'return to work' meetings and letters from the employee's GP. An employer's efforts need not be perfect and, in the circumstances, the employer had taken reasonable steps to ascertain the nature of the employee's illness and could not reasonably have been expected to do more particularly when dealing with an uncooperative employee.

To establish an indirect discrimination claim, the employee will need to show that the employer applied a ""provision, criterion or practice"" (PCP) that puts, or would put, those of the employee's protected group at a particular disadvantage compared to other groups. In Carreras v United First Partners Research, the Court of Appeal held that an expectation that an employee would work late does not have to be presented as an instruction to cause a disadvantage. If the disabled employee can establish the existence of a long-hours culture, this may be enough to amount to a 'practice' under the Equality Act 2010.

In Colt Technology Services Ltd v Brown, the EAT decided an important point regarding the effect of PHI on discrimination compensation, where the employee has had the opportunity to choose different levels of PHI cover through a workplace flexible benefits scheme.

The EAT considered the 'insurance exception' to the general rule that claimants should only be compensated for actual loss. The policy behind the exception is that an employer should not be able to benefit from an employee's prudence in taking out insurance, and so insurance pay outs are not set off against the employee's financial losses in those circumstances. In the context of a flexible benefits package - where an employee can choose the level of their insurance benefits in exchange for foregoing extra salary - this principle must be apportioned. The portion paid for by the employer without the employee foregoing extra salary will be offset (in this case 50%) and the portion for which the employee had foregone extra salary will not (in this case an additional 25%).

In relation to a claim for unlawful victimisation under the Equality Act 2010, ""giving false evidence or information, or making a false allegation, is not a protected act if the evidence or information is given, or the allegation is made in bad faith."" But does an ulterior motive for making a victimisation claim show bad faith?

In Saad v Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust, the EAT confirmed that honesty not motivation is key. The primary question for victimisation purposes is whether the employee has acted honestly in giving the evidence or information, or in making the allegation, that is relied on as a protected act. The existence of a predominant ulterior motive, while potentially relevant, is not the focus of the enquiry. In this case, just because the allegation was raised as a means to deflect criticism during a performance process did not automatically mean it was done in bad faith.

In Unite the Union v Nailard, the Court of Appeal reminds employers that harassment can be committed by inaction was well as action. Failure to act in relation to third party harassment which is brought to the employer's attention, may itself amount to harassment. If the reason for the failure to act was influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the relevant protected characteristic, then that failure to act may itself amount to harassment. Employers should ensure that they train staff on dealing with harassment issues, make it clear that harassment from suppliers, clients and customers is not tolerated and keep clear records of issues arising.

In Bakkali v Greater Manchester Buses, the EAT point out that in harassment claims, context is a crucial element. Conduct ""related to"" a protected characteristic (in the test for harassment) is wider in scope than conduct ""because of"" a protected characteristic (in the test for direct discrimination). It requires a broader enquiry, involving ""a more intense focus"" on the context of the offending words or behaviour.

The Holy Grail: financially sustainable access to justice.

Following last year's abolition of tribunal fees by the Supreme Court, the number of claims has been steadily increasing. While the number of individual tribunal claims overall has not yet returned to the pre- 2013 introduction of the fees regime level, we have reached an important statistical milestone. September's quarterly statistics revealed that single-claim receipts are, for the first time, at a higher level than when fees were first introduced.

While the number of claims is set to rise over the near future, the Ministry of Justice in November announced that a new fee regime ""balancing tribunal funding and access to justice"" was ""in development"".

Four years after the introduction of mandatory ACAS early conciliation (EC) we finally have appellate level confirmation on how to apply the 'stop the clock' provisions. In April, the EAT confirmed the widely accepted view that the time limit to present a claim should always be extended by the number of days it takes to complete the EC procedure (Luton Borough Council v Haque).

While there are several rankings published every year by individual organisations, MHRD accepts NIRF (National Institute of Ranking Framework) ranking. According to 2018-2019 rankings, IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Bangalore, IIM Calcutta, IIM Lucknow and IIT Bombay are the top 5 B-Schools in India.

With CAT 2018 Result inching closer, aspirants are scrutinising their options for colleges. Everyone has already started looking at the plethora of ranking of MBA colleges in India. However, there is a world beyond rankings. The second critical factor to consider is placements. Most candidates look into past placement records of colleges before they take admission. In this regard also, NIRF has made things easy by providing actual placement statistics, which the institutes have officially submitted to them.

As per them, the top 5 B-Schools in India on basis of the average package offered are IIM A, B, C, SPJIMR, XLRI. Their median placements in the 2016-17 batch were respectively 2148548, 2000000, 2000000, 2000000, 1900000. Please note that here we are talking about median placements and not highest packages.

Arranging top 50 B-Schools in India on basis of their median placements, the highest is 2148548 and lowest is 300000. But, as you can see, placements do not solely determine ranking. Because SPJIMR has fourth best placements yet has an overall rank of 19. Likewise, XLRI has fifth best placement yet ranks at number 5. Another example is IIFT, with 1507000 median placement, is 12th best in terms of placements and yet is at 23rd rank.

So what other things matter?

Candidates should also consider aspects such as diversity, scholarships, infrastructure, research projects undertaken by the institute, consultancy projects undertaken by the institute and qualifications of faculty members. Checking accreditation, the affiliation of the college is also important. CAT 2018 exam apart, there are many MBA entrance exams like MAH MBA CET that are yet to happen, that open gateway for admission to several good colleges.

Also, take into consideration that rankings are prone to loopholes. The fact that colleges such as FMS Delhi, JBIMS, NMIMS, XIMB are not in NIRF ranking, for any reason, begets for candidates to go for a second opinion.

Third, but a really important factor to choose the perfect MBA college, is fees. Top colleges for MBA / PGDM that have low fees are FMS Delhi, JBIMS Mumbai, NITIE Mumbai, TISS Mumbai, IIT Delhi, IIT Roorkee, DMS Pune / PUMBA, BHU, Delhi School of Economics, JMI University. At FMS, the annual tuition fee is approximately Rs 10,480 per year which is one of the lowest pan-India.

Candidates are aware that pursuing a management program usually requires a lot of investment (fee is usually around 25 lakhs), and moreover, those 2 years will shape their future. Hence, good planning is critical while selecting colleges.

Aspirants can also get a better picture of what the college is like by connecting with alumni or present students of a B-Schools. However, it is not uncommon to come across extreme reviews, hence utilize student feedbacks and reviews by exercising best judgement. Wishing you the very best for your CAT Result 2018, and MBA Admission 2019.

The profile of the Dharavi slum in Mumbai, one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the world, may have risen when it was showcased in the Oscar-winning movie ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" but my tour guide didn't particularly care about that at the moment. What concerned him more was the pejorative nature of the word ""slum"" and how outsiders perceived Dharavi, an area smaller than New York City's Central Park but where about a million people live and work.

""We don't want people to think slums are dangerous and full of lazy people,"" said Hitesh Vaidya, a guide for Reality Tours and Travel. The reality of daily life in Dharavi is sobering, however: Laborers work in unsafe conditions, and a lack of basic services like clean water and sanitation facilities endangers the health of residents. Mr. Vaidya and I spent the next couple of hours touring the many different industries and businesses within Dharavi, which included plastics recycling, textile manufacturing and food production. I left with a better knowledge of both the poverty and industriousness of Dharavi, as well as an understanding of Mr. Vaidya's point: that the two are not mutually exclusive.

Mumbai (sometimes called by its former name, Bombay) is an electric and complicated city, an extraordinary place, both uplifting and heartbreaking. Its eclectic composition of different groups and cultures makes it a difficult city to define, but for many, it's a city that represents possibility. Dharmesh Gandhi, a friend who lives in Mumbai, offered his take on India's financial center and one of the world's most populous cities: ""It's like New York,"" he said. ""Everything is happening here, so everyone wants to come here.""

After a four-day visit this past October, it was easy to see why: The shopping and entertainment options were excellent, and opportunities for great dining were second-to-none. And while the rupees flow freely in Mumbai, I was able to keep my spending under control.

A couple of logistical items: My flight, booked through Jet Airways, cost a bit over $200 for a one-way flight from Sri Lanka. As I was re-entering India, I had to produce my double-entry e-visa once more to passport control. My Uber ride from the airport was about 370 rupees, or a little more than $5. If you'd prefer not to use Uber, another popular service is Ola Cabs. I used both while in Mumbai, typically opening both apps and using whichever had a car closer to me. The ubiquitous tuk-tuk is conspicuously absent in much of Mumbai (""The traffic here is bad enough,"" Mr. Gandhi told me). In central Mumbai, you'll just see regular taxis. Fortunately, they're metered, with fares beginning at 22 rupees.

I was well-located in the Fort neighborhood of the city, close to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus railway station, the huge Victorian landmark constructed in the late 19th century. My quarters at the Hotel Residency Fort, Mumbai, booked for $52 a night on Hotels.com, were modest luxury, roomy and air-conditioned, and with free breakfast.

A walk around the neighborhood was the first order of business: A stop by Mumbai's first Anglican church, St. Thomas Cathedral, established in 1718, was followed by a visit to the free Jehangir Art Gallery near Wellington Fountain. I enjoyed the Nayanaa Kanodia exhibition, ""The Quintessential Woman: A Celebration,"" which featured oil paintings and drawings celebrating feminism. Another exhibition, ""Rural Beauty,"" featured darker, more sensual pencil and pastel works by Parshuram B. Patil.

There are numerous fine museums in Mumbai, including Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (formerly known as the Prince of Wales Museum of Western India). Admission is 500 rupees, plus an additional 50-rupee fee to take cellphone photos. The main hall of the museum, which features Rajastani temple columns and wooden railings from a nobleman's home, is topped with a great Islamic dome -- a nod to Mumbai's diverse history.

There are some wonderful statues of Indian deities on the ground floor -- Shiva, Ganesh, Brahma and Vishnu, some dating as far back as the sixth century. I also enjoyed looking at a series of paintings from the late 17th and early 18th centuries, done in the Rajasthani Bikaner style, particularly one depicting a scene from the Mahabharata epic.

My favorites, though, were probably the later work of Jehangir Sabavala, a Mumbai-born artist who died in 2011 at age 89. His paintings, which intriguingly join East with West, have elements of both Cubism and Impressionism. I particularly liked ""The Eye,"" as well as his somber ""The Raven,"" 2010 works that were two of Sabavala's final pieces.

The most interesting museum I visited, however, proved to be the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Mumbai City Museum, which claims to be Mumbai's very first, established in 1872 (100 rupees admission). The building itself is quite beautiful, and houses interesting artifacts like old model ships, ganjifa -- round playing cards that became popular under Mughal emperors in the 16th century -- and examples of pottery from the Sir J.J. School of Art near the turn of the 20th century. Particularly interesting was an exhibition documenting the movement of peoples to Mumbai over the years, from the Kolis fishermen of Gujarat in the 13th century to the Parsi, Surati and Khoja people that immigrated with the rise of the East India Company.

But it's not just the past that impresses in Mumbai -- the present is pretty happening, too. I headed to the club the Quarter one evening to catch a show with Azamaan Hoyvoy and his pseudo-funk trio (750 rupees for a standing ticket). They grooved through a number of pretty good covers, including ""How Deep Is Your Love"" and Allen Stone's ""Unaware."" Cocktails at the Quarter run in the 600 rupee range, but you can get a Kingfisher beer for 275.

I spent another evening at Shanmukhananda Hall, a large auditorium near the King's Circle train station, to take in a Lucky Ali concert (1,500 rupees, purchased through the website Book My Show). Lucky Ali, a Mumbai-born musician, went through crowd-pleasing soft rock favorites with a six-piece band. Between numbers, he took the opportunity to speak on various issues. ""If Ganga goes, where do we go?"" he asked, referring to the Ganges River. ""I think half of you probably haven't even been there. Go there! Plant some trees or something.""

About two-and-a-half miles to the southwest is Siddhi Vinayak Mandir, a beautiful temple dedicated to Ganesha and an essential place of worship for many Mumbai Hindus. I arrived just in time one evening for a puja, and after leaving my shoes at a counter outside, was ushered in to the sound of clapping, drums, bells and the smell of incense. A small, serene-looking Ganesha statue sat among orange and white flowers while a group of about 150 of us stood engaged in an intense, rhythmic call-and-response that changed tempos and melodies throughout the course of the next 30 minutes. For those looking to worship in a hurry, a ""quick darshan"" line can be entered for a payment of 50 rupees.

Any explorer of Mumbai will eventually need to try one of thousands of street vendors and restaurants that grace the city. Fortunately, there is no shortage of good options, and nearly every price point is covered. The Bombay street sandwich is one you'll see everywhere and, if you're feeling adventurous, certainly worth trying. A typical example features sliced cucumber, potato, onion, tomato and beetroot on toasted bread, served with a variety of spicy chutneys. At 25 or 30 rupees, it's an absolute steal.

Mumbai's reputation for street food par excellence is well deserved, and on Sheikh Memon Street, near the Juma Masjid mosque, I indulged in another treat: a plate of dahi puri (40 rupees), savory chickpeas stuffed into flaky puri shells, drenched in tart yogurt and dusted with spices and herbs. And no Mumbai street food discussion is complete without mentioning vada pav, the quintessential carbohydrate bomb that features a fried potato fritter squished into soft white roll (about 10 rupees, and it can be found all over).

The city does upscale dining with equal aplomb. Prateek Sadhu and Aditi Dugar own Masque, an elegantly repurposed industrial space that serves a 10-course tasting menu every day except Monday. The wine pairing alone, however, costs 6,000 rupees -- it's not exactly a place for penny-pinchers. Fortunately, Masque offers a bar menu for walk-ins like me looking for a lighter meal.

A very good sour eggplant toast (350 rupees), sweetened with tamarind and covered with caramelized onions, functioned as a kind of tangy eggplant pÃ¢tÃ©. A twist on pani puri, the classic street food, filled the thin shells with a cactus salad and corn mousse (350 rupees). Something described as pork okonomiyaki (500 rupees) really was like a sweet-glazed pork taco, competently prepared and served with a nice cabbage slaw. My server, Ayush, was particularly good and made me feel right at home.

Somewhere in the middle, you've got Gurukripa, an all-day casual vegetarian restaurant in the Sion neighborhood. There's an exceptionally good pav bhaji (96 rupees), a tomato-y mash of spiced vegetables served with a slab of rapidly melting butter. White rolls, crunchy papadum and a sharp onion salad round out the meal. Or there's Ling's Pavilion, a Mumbai institution, where the steamed pork with salted fish (500 rupees) and creamy fried corn curd (275 rupees) will help explain the country's love of Chinese food.

And don't forget the shopping. At the excellent Kitab Khana bookstore, I perused the sizable section entitled ""Books on Gandhi and by Gandhi"" before settling on Mohandas K. Gandhi's autobiography, ""The Story of My Experiments with Truth,"" for just 156 rupees. Another day, I set out in search of spices and ended up at Lalbaugh Market near Chinchpokli Station. Wandering down Dinshaw Petit Road, I followed the sound of loud, metallic pounding until I ended up at Vishwas, a specialty spice store where a shopkeeper was in the process of mashing a red substance into fine powder. I asked for haldi, or turmeric, and the man behind the counter spooned a 200-gram plastic bagful for 60 rupees.

But the best way to get a feel for the city might be to walk along Fashion Street on a weekend afternoon. Fashion Street is on the western edge of Fort, along Mahatma Gandhi Road, flanking a big public park, Azad Maidan, and branching off into Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil Road to the south. On the street, packed solid with shoppers, are hundreds of stalls containing anything you could possibly want to wear -- dresses, T-shirts, jeans and accessories.

I picked up a shirt for 250 rupees and, after a bit of haggling over the initial ask of 1,000, walked away with a pair of jeans for 600 rupees. Satisfied with my haul, I walked through the Karnatak Sports Ground, where organized teams were playing games of cricket. As the sun began to set, I crossed the street to Azad Maidan, past food vendors selling snacks and couples lounging on the grass while groups of boys played decidedly more casual pickup cricket games with tennis balls.

Over a good dinner at the Parsi restaurant Ideal Corner, I reflected on my time in a city that has so much to offer -- too much for one trip, certainly. Some trips are draining, but Mumbai left me feeling energized. I would have to return again to this dynamic city, and soon."

Grants totaling $19,800 were awarded to 10 local nonprofits, bringing the fund's cumulative grantmaking total to nearly $50,000 since it was established less than five years ago.

Created in 2014 by a group of committed Bath residents, Bath Community Fund is a permanent endowment that supports programs that preserve Bath's historical and environmental legacy, enhance the local arts and culture landscape, serve youth through education and recreation, and meet residents' social service needs.

Several of this year's grants will benefit youth programs in Bath, including a $1,000 grant to Girls on the Run Northeast Ohio to support a running-based youth development program for girls in the Bath community. The program, which combines physical activity with discussions about self-confidence, bullying and healthy relationships, is offered to girls in third through eighth grade at Bath Elementary School, Richfield Elementary School and Revere Middle School.

""With the generous support of Bath Community Fund, 80 girls will have the opportunity to experience a program where learning to be healthy, confident and strong is the goal. Not only do these young ladies have the opportunity to unleash their limitless potential, but they also bond as a team and have the opportunity to celebrate each other for the unique ways that they are different,"" said Robyn Cutler, executive director of Girls on the Run Northeast Ohio.

While there is a fee to participate in the program, Cutler said girls are never turned away based on their ability to pay. Grants, sponsorships and individual donations allow the organization to offer scholarships to low-income families, ensuring all girls have the opportunity to lace up their running shoes.

""The perception that those living in (the Revere) district are equally able to participate in a program like Girls on the Run is incorrect,"" Cutler added. ""There are a number of girls receiving financial assistance, and funding from Bath Community Fund prevents this barrier. Girls on the Run is a program for every girl!""

Now in its third year of grantmaking, Bath Community Fund received 15 funding requests totaling nearly $53,000 - almost triple the amount it had available to grant, according to Mary Anne Krejci, chair of BCF's Grant Committee.

To expand the fund's impact, leaders of Bath Community Fund have set an ambitious goal to raise $2.018 million in celebration of Bath's bicentennial year in 2018 through the ""For Bath, Forever"" campaign. With an endowment of more than $2 million, the fund will be able to award at least $100,000 to nonprofits in Bath every year, forever. ""A fund of that size would allow us to meet all of the grant requests we received this year - twice over,"" Krejci said.

Other grants awarded in 2018 will support the construction of an additional restroom at Bath Community Park, provide food for Revere students in need, and make theater productions more accessible to senior citizens, among other projects.

The following is a full list of grants awarded in 2018:

Apollo's Fire the Cleveland Baroque Orchestra, to provide free and discounted concert tickets for students and senior citizens of Bath Township, $1,000

Bath Park Board, for the construction of an additional restroom at Bath Community Park, $5,000

Bath Volunteers for Service, to support the 42nd Annual Bath Tour of Distinctive Homes, $800

Crown Point Ecology Center, to support Tiny Tillers, a gardening and nature exploration program for preschoolers from the Bath area, $2,000

Girls on the Run Northeast Ohio, to support a running-based youth development program for girls in the Bath community that combines physical activity with discussions about self-confidence, bullying and healthy relationships, $1,000

Revere Power Pack Program, to provide food for Revere students in need to take home for the weekend, $2,000

Stewart's Caring Place, to provide support services for Bath residents on a cancer journey, $1,500

Victory Gallop, to replace aging fencing on the farm, which offers therapeutic horseback riding programs for children with special needs and life-threatening illnesses, $2,000

Western Reserve Historical Society, to expand the welcome center at Hale Farm & Village, $3,500

Western Reserve Playhouse, to build a new entryway that makes the playhouse more accessible to seniors and people with disabilities, $1,000

No other Mohiniyattam dancer has garnered as many national accolades as Kanak Rele, who was awarded the first Guru Gopinath National Puraskaram of the Government of Kerala.

On being informed about the Puraskaram, her response was: ""For the last four decades, I had identified myself with Keralites and now the government too has approved it."" Her contributions have been monumental in rejuvenating the lyrical dance form of Kerala.

As a child with an inclination for dance, she was fascinated by performances of Kathakali and Mohiniyattam, which she watched from close quarters at Shantiniketan, while staying in West Bengal with her uncle. In addition, she was exposed to veterans of all Indian classical dances in Mumbai. At the age of seven, Kanak was initiated into Kathakali by Guru Karunakara Panicker. He stayed at her home and trained her for many years, even after her studies abroad. This moulded her into a consummate performer.

Her passion for dance saw her turn away from medical studies even after she was selected and had paid the fee for the course. She took up Industrial Law went on to study International Law at Manchester University, UK, for her post graduation. As her specialisation was Civil Aviation, she landed a post in Air India. But her decision to become a professional dancer compelled her to turn down the offer against the wishes of her parents. Her husband's support and guidance of Karunakara Panicker enabled her to pursue her own choice.

Kalamandalam Rajalakshmi, who was based in Mumbai in those days, was helpful in introducing her to Mohiniyattam. She taught Kanak the basic lessons as practised in Kalamandalam, which had revived the dance form during 1930s.

The exquisite charm of lasya attracted her and she was determined to delve deep into the roots of the dance form, which had its first revival during the period of Swati Thirunal and had then gradually sunk into oblivionowing to a variety of reasons. It may be remembered that when Poet Vallathol introduced Mohiniyattam in Kalamandalam, there was a long search for a teacher and a student as the very name of the dance had a social stigma attached to it in those days.

A grant from Sangeet Natak Akademi at this juncture was a blessing as it enabled her to meet surviving performers and scholars who could enlighten her about the evolutionary stages of Mohiniyattam. Her pursuit received further impetus thanks to a grant from the Ford Foundation. She met and interacted with stalwarts like Kalpurathe Kunjukutty Amma, Thottassery Chinnammu Amma and Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma and filmed them. The recordings are a prized possession in the archives of her Mumbai institution even now.

She observed that Kunjukutty Amma's abhinaya techniques bore resemblance to those of Nangiarkoothu and Kamsa Natakam. The footwork had much in common with Thullal, Padayani and Arjunanrittam. Chinnammu Amma's style owed much to Thiruvathirakkali.

Kalyanikutty Amma's had some elements of the both, but, at the same time, also embraced entirely different features. The study established and highlighted the correlation of folk, ritualistic, semi-classical and classical arts.

The veteran dancer has been successful in recreating the dance form based on the traditional and the technical format and help evolve a teaching methodology. Intensive research on the kinetics of the dancer, based on the movements of volution (geometrical patterns) and revolution (spiral), so characteristic of Indian classical dances, and an analysis of audio and film documentations against the backdrop of Natyasastra, Hasthalakshanadeepika and Balaramabharatam gave shape to the 'Kanak Rele School' of Mohiniyattam. She propounded her 'kine-aesthetics' after taking advice from experts from manifold disciplines, including medical science.

Her monumental work earned her a doctorate from the University of Mumbai.

While she had dwelt at length on the prayoga of the dance form in the first edition of the book Mohini Attam -- The Lyrical Dance (1992), she suceeded in building up a sastra in the revised edition (2013).

Bhava Niroopana (1996), another book that followed, is a comprehensive account of the theoretical basis of abhinaya and it traces the development of our religious thought and its influence on aesthetics. The two books are followed in many institutions across the country, including Kerala Kalamandalam, for undergraduate and post-graduate classes.

The foray into Sopana Sangeetham happened after a meeting with Kavalam Narayana Panicker in 1982. This was providential, for she was able to overcome many rough edges experienced while following music and talas of the Carnatic system. ""It is only when I started working with Sopana Sangeetham that things arranged themselves in proper shapes and hues. The very basic movement that sustains Mohiniyattam dancing is andolika or the oscillating movement. These kinetic patterns are beautifully aided by the gamakas of Sopana Sangeetham that strengthen and beautify the body movements. My inspiration for productions highlighting the trauma of women in society, which were based on different women characters in Indian mythology, has been Kavalam's compositions,"" she says.

She had led innumerable workshops with him in Mumbai. Even during her visit four days before his demise, the duo discussed plans to organise more such workshops.

Nalanda Dance Research Centre where she's the director, has been recognised as a Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Government of India. This is the only dance institution in the country to be awarded this prestigious honour.

Meanwhile, Nalanda Nritya Kala Mahavidyalaya was established for the popularisation of her style. Thanks to her perseverance, the institution has been affiliated to the University of Bombay. It is perhaps the first institution in the country to award university degrees of BFA, MFA and PhD in Mohiniyattam. Nritya Bharati, a documentary of seven Indian classical dances produced by Nalanda, has been acquired by the Ministry of External Affairs as an official capsule for all Indian missions abroad."

A Ganesh Nadar/Rediff.com brings you their inspiring story.

At a time when most parents in India don't mind paying a hefty donation to send their children to English medium schools in hope of a brighter future, a municipal school in Tamil Nadu is trying to do something different.

The Pallavaram Municipality Primary School in Zameen Pallavaram (also called Old Pallavaram), on the outskirts of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, is trying to build skills in students outside of academics, and excel in contact sports like karate and brainy ones like chess.

And they are going out of their way to arrange funds so that they can send their students to international competitions to gain exposure as well as win accolades.

Unlike most civic schools which are either defunct due to lack of teachers and/or students or in dilapidated shape, this school is well maintained.

It has tall and clean whitewashed buildings. There are classes from 1 to 5 with a strength of 580 students and 17 teachers.

When I visit the school, Headmaster N Karthikeyan is addressing students from class 5 who are sitting cross-legged on the ground.

As we are speaking, a young lad enters the class room.

""I want to meet Karate Anna,"" the boy, who had heard about R S Sreenivasan, the school's dedicated karate teacher, says.

""We took only three students to Sri Lanka and came back with six medals -- five gold and one bronze,"" Sreenivasan tells me later.

The three students from the school -- M Aaris (class 2), A M Siddesh Hariharan and I Hari Govind, both from Class 4 -- participated in the 5th Open International Semi Contact Shotokan Karate Championship in Sri Lanka on October 6 and 7.

Some 1,500 students from Australia, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan competed in the championship.

At another tournament in Aranthangi, Tamil Nadu, where all the five southern states participated, this school won the overall shield and was also the only government school to have won prizes.

It started in 2016 when the government of Tamil Nadu issued a notification that schools should have karate classes for girls so that they learnt self-defence.

""If we only trained the girls, there would never be enough students. Therefore I decided to train the boys, too,"" Karthikeyan recalls how the idea came about.

A Geetha, a teacher at the school, recommended Sreenivasan's name.

A day after the government circular was issued, Sreenivasan began training the school's students.

""We told the master that we would pay Rs 100 per student. He expected at least Rs 5,000 a month for two classes a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 4.30 pm to 5.30 pm,"" says Karthikeyan.

""These are poor students. Some pay and some don't. I pay the difference so that the Master is not disappointed,"" he adds.

Arranging funds for the Sri Lankan tournament wasn't easy either.

But help poured in from all quarters.

""Whenever there is a small shortage of funds I pay from my pocket and if we need more I have a few friends that help out,"" says Sreenivasan.

Tamil Nadu Education Minister K A Sengottaiyan was so pleased to know that a government school was participating in an international tournament that he called the headmaster and asked what he could do to help.

The minister sponsored the air tickets to Sri Lanka and also requested government officials on the island to look after the kids.

""We were received at the airport and well looked after. We had a vehicle at our disposal. They had arranged for our stay with separate accommodation for the kids,"" says Karthikeyan.

WATCH R S Sreenivasan train the girl students at the Municipal Primary School in Zameen Pallavaram.

It's not always the funds that bother Karthikeyan.

Just when we are speaking, a lady comes in with her son, a student at the school.

""I asked you to come because he was supposed to be here at 6 am for a tournament but he didn't come,"" says Karthikeyan.

""He overslept,"" the mother answers.

""He will oversleep, he is a child, you should have woken him up. There were 30 students, you don't expect me to call everyone of them in the morning.""

""The tournament and travel fee was Rs 300. I can't ask the tournament organisers for a refund nor can I ask the transporter. I don't mind paying as long as he participates. He did not participate, but someone else could have and maybe even won the prize there. I didn't want him to win, but I definitely wanted him to participate. Next time, don't let him sleep,"" the teacher admonishes the parent.

Karate is not the only game the students excel at. They have won medals in chess too. The Thirumal Chess Academy, Mudichur, coaches the students for free.

""We offered to pay a nominal amount, but they refused,"" said the encouraging headmaster, who proudly displays the prizes his students have won in chess and karate.

""We also have carrom here, which I teach. It's free. After school they can play as long as they want,"" the headmaster adds.

WATCH: R S Sreenivasan trains the boys at the school.

Students at the school recently participated in the national karate tournament in Kanyakumari.

""What we really require is to participate in an international tournament in Malaysia and Singapore in May 2019. The cost per child will be Rs 75,000,"" says Karthikeyan. ""We are planning to send a dozen kids and a coach. We need about Rs 1,000,000 which we hope to get from our well-wishers.""

"77","1022615192","2018-12-19","https://www.sportal.co.in/golf/the-truth-about-the-golf-club-agreement-the-tidewater-news/","The truth about the golf club agreement &#8211; The Tidewater News","Sportal - World Sports News - Live Scores",FALSE,"by Barry Porter

I wish I did not have to write this article, but the mis-information, mis-characterizations and downright untruths being spread about the agreement have necessitated that I do so. I am certain that some of the opponents will challenge and misuse the information below. I only ask that you check out the facts and be aware of opinions and misstatements masquerading as facts.

The first issue that I will address is that the payment to Cypress Cove is not a donation or a gift. The County negotiated a renewal of a Recreational Services Agreement with Cypress Cove to provide the following services:

1. Recreational Golf Services to the golf teams of Southampton High School and Southampton Academy at no cost to the schools.

2. Recreational Golf Services to any golf classes conducted by Paul D. Camp Community College and any golf team sanctioned or promoted by PDCCC at no cost to PDCCC.

3. Recreational Golf Services to the First Tee or any other club or approved youth group who serve Southampton County.

4. Access to the golf course for Southampton County Residents at a discounted fee. The fees (including green and cart fees) charged are $27.50 per 18-hole round on weekdays and $32.50 per round on weekends. Additionally, County students and County youth may play for $10 per round (which does not include the use of a cart.)

The services provided to the schools include practice balls, use of the golf course for practice and priority use of the golf course for their matches. Last year the value of these services exceeded $14,000. In the past, the golf course has provided these services for a nominal cost, but it can no longer afford to do so. In the absence of this agreement, it would have to substantially increase the fees it charges to the schools.

Several people have suggested just eliminating the golf teams because so few students participate. I believe that this proposition is grossly unfair to the kids who do choose to play golf. Not every student is big enough, strong enough or fast enough to play football, basketball, volleyball or any of the traditional high school sports. Some of them (including some of the kids who do play football, baseball, etc.,) discover golf and excel at it. There have been at least five students I know of who have earned college scholarships because of golf. Contrary to what the opponents would have you believe, most of the kids who play golf are not rich kids, and these scholarships are very important in making college more affordable for them.

Other critics suggest that the parents should pay all these costs as they do in all the other sports. All I can say to that is that I do not know of any parents paying fees to provide a football field, a baseball field or a gym for indoor sports. This agreement provides the equivalent of a football field for the students (both male and female) who chose to play golf. The cost of equipment, shoes, etc. is still the responsibility of the participant (or parent.)

Additionally, unlike most high school sports which offer only limited participation opportunities after graduation, golf is a sport that can be played for much of one's life. I played football, basketball, baseball and ran track at Southampton and enjoyed every minute of it. Lack of opportunities as well as injury concerns after graduation forced me to retire from these sports. I was lucky enough to be introduced to golf while in my 20s. Before I started playing it, I thought it was a silly little wimp's game. I soon found it to be a very challenging, extremely frustrating (at times) and quite athletic sport. It quickly filled the void I had from having to give up my high school sports.

Most people, like me, only discover golf in adulthood. Many County residents do play golf and others may be inclined to try it if an affordable opportunity is available. This agreement provides that opportunity. Cypress Cove is a private course and was closed to the general public until the original agreement with the County in November 2017. This year, County residents played about a thousand 18 hole rounds of golf under the agreement. The renewal of that agreement with a reduction in cost (from $30,000 to 25,000) to the County continues to make the golf course available to County residents at a discounted fee. I encourage County golfers to continue to use the course and suggest to anyone who may have an inkling to try it to do so. You may discover that you like it.

I constantly hear is that Cypress Cove is a private organization and the County should not give money or support a private organization. To the contrary, the County does it all the time. Every business and most, if not all the charities and community groups the County deals with, are private organizations. Southampton County Historical Society, the Blackwater Regional Library, the Community Concert Association, the Rawls Museum, the Western Tidewater Free Clinic and others are all private organizations. Yet, the County gives money to these ""private organizations"" money every year without any strings or requirements for any services.

Most agree (including some of the opponents of this agreement) Cypress Cove is a valuable community asset from a recreational and economic development perspective. Would it survive without our agreement? I do not know the definitive answer to that question. I do know that it would probably be more of a struggle and that our agreement last year did help them in a challenging time. I do know that If the golf course were to fail, the consequences would be extremely harmful to Southampton.

In the 2017 tax year, Cypress Cove paid $22,000 in Real Estate, Personal Property, Sales, and Meal taxes to Southampton. Not only would the County lose those revenues, it would see a substantial reduction in property values in all properties surrounding and near the golf course. Conservatively, the County would lose at least another $25,000 in tax revenue. Yet, this result may not be the worst impact to the County.

In 2018, the Social Services Child Abuse initiative, The Chamber of Commerce, Bronco Credit Union, Southampton Academy and Paul D. Camp Community College held Fundraiser Tournaments at Cypress Cove. These five tournaments raised over $73,000, all of which has been or will be used for worthy causes in our community. Other smaller tournaments were held, but these were the big five.

A recent letter to the editor in The Tidewater News incorrectly quoted me as saying that Cypress Cove made a lot of money on these tournaments. That statement could not be farther from the truth. What I said was that the above organizations made a lot of money from these tournaments and that the money would be used in our community for worthwhile causes. After expenses and lost revenue from closing the course, I would be surprised if the course does any more than break even on these events.

I and three other supervisors voted to approve the renewal of the agreement with Cypress Cove Golf Course because we believe the services it assures for Southampton residents are important and the $25,000 fee for doing so is an extremely reasonable cost. We understand the importance of the golf course to our community and think that supporting it is in the best interest of the County, just as we think that supporting many other local businesses is also in the best interest of the County.

Another recent letter in this paper stated that ""at least two of the county supervisors are either members of the country club or members of one of their boards,"" implying some improper actions. I have made it clear from the beginning that I am a member of Cypress Cove.

I continue to pay my dues even though my health issues have precluded me from using the facilities for the last three years. I do so, not because I enjoy wasting money, but because I strongly believe in supporting an asset that is vital to health of Southampton County.

Other than myself, I do not know of any other members of Cypress Cove on the Board of Supervisors. I do know that not any of the other three supervisors who voted for the agreement are members and that I am not on any of ""their boards."" As for my participation in the discussion and vote, I did seek and received legal advice from the County attorney with respect to any conflict of interest on this issue. This advice stated that I did not have a conflict of interest because I did not receive any benefit from the agreement which was greater than that of any other resident of the County. Had the advice been different, I would have recused myself from the process.

Anyone has the right to disagree with any decision of the Board of Supervisors and to express that disagreement. However, no one has the right to make up their own ""facts"" and spread mis-truths about it.

There are different ways to beat boredom. Some people like to listen to music while some enjoy shopping when getting bored. But 13-year-old Aadithyan Rajesh has a different way of keeping himself engaged. He likes to built apps when he is bored. Meet the little Indian whiz kid who has set a new record of being the youngest CEO of a company.

Aadithyan, a student from Kerala, was only nine when he developed his first mobile application. And today he runs his own company in Dubai.

After developing his first app, Aadithyan started uploading mobile apps on Aptoide which is an alternative marketplace for mobile apps and runs on Android OS. After designing logos and websites for clients, he finally launched his own company named Trinet Solutions on December 17, 2017 when he was only 13.

Talking to Khaleej Times, Aadithyan said he started working using computer when he was five.

""I was born in Thiruvilla, Kerala, and my family moved here(Dubai) when I was five. The first website my dad showed me was BBC Typing, a website for kids where young students can learn typing,"" he told the international daily.

Aadithyan lived in a neighbourhood where he didn't have too many friends. Scarcity of friends gave birth to his love for technology and computers. ""I was six years old and would spend a lot of time on YouTube reading cartoons and playing spelling bee games. I began to become fascinated with computers and technology.""

After spending some time with games, he decided to develop his own app named Ashirwad browser. The web browser was similar to Google chrome but with less functionalities. Since the Google Play Store charges a base fee to upload an app, Aadithyan decided to upload instead upload his app on Aptoide marketplace.

""I began learning everything I could about software, app development and hardware as well. I became increasingly interested in cybersecurity, too.""

Currently his company Trinet Solutions is run by him and three of his school friends from standard 11 and 12 grades of his school.

""I need to be over the age of 18 to actually become an established company owner. However, we function like a company. We have worked with over 12 clients, and have given them our design and coding services entirely for free,"" he said.

Aadithyan aims to turn his company into a multinational firm one day and develop apps for iOS. He also has a YouTube channel and vlogs on his channel -A Craze. His videos are shot by his six-year-old sister named Aaradhya.

""In the morning, I go to school, then I head back home and rest for a while. After which, I learn Math, and then spend time on company work and on the YouTube channel.""

Whether you resolve to be fitter and healthier, connect more socially or to tick off some points on your bucket list, this is a time to take stock of the year gone by and to think of the year ahead.

Given below are some thoughts and you could consider adding some or all to your list of New Year resolutions.

Eat better for your Health

Take your health into your hands. Change your eating pattern. Take baby steps toward eating right. After all, if you have been careless with your food habits, you cannot change these overnight.

Less fats, more fibre with a healthier mix of fruits, vegetables and nuts is always advisable for most people. As seniors, it becomes even more important and relevant for us to regulate our diet. Eat smaller meals more often. Most experts recommend eating 5 times a day but with reduced quantities. As some wise people say, ""stop eating just before you are full!"" Others say that at least half of your plate should be fruits and vegetable.

Add a mix of vitamins and supplements to your diet to balance what you are not receiving through your normal diet.

Remember that eating better is the only answer to reducing your weight.

Find a New, Healthy Activity

As we get older, whether we have been active earlier or not, now it is much more important to be active. Build exercise or yoga into your daily routine. A round of tennis or golf, a brisk walk for at least 30 minutes every day (150 minutes per week of walking is the minimum recommended), yogic breathing exercises, swimming or cycling would be great to get into your daily schedule.

I have met several seniors who have started running and competing with people of their own age. In the process of staying fit, they have also found a whole new community of like-minded and passionate friends. It is best to experiment and find the right activity for your personality and activity level.

Complete some points in your Bucket List

Give yourself a break. You have earned this. Over the years, all of us have been adding to our bucket list. This list has kept getting longer since we were not able to find the time during our work life.

Resolve to tick off at least two significant items on your bucket list in the coming year.

Connect More with Friends and Family

Re-establish old connections that you lost while you were busy at work. Don't wait for someone else to take the first step. Once start to reach out to your family and friends, you will be surprised at how much warmth you will receive. It is interesting to see how many people are rediscovering their old school and college friends using Facebook and LinkedIn.

Weekly lunches or coffee mornings with a group of friends, WhatsApp or Skype calls with your family members spread across the World are great ways of re-connecting. Time spent talking and laughing with those that mean the most is time well spent.

Reduce your belongings

Resolve to clean out your closets and your home. Think of the difference between ""want"" and ""need"" before you start this exercise. Keep things you need and give away those you want. This may sound philosophical but try and give away whatever you have not used for the past one year. Your challenge will always be ""what if"" you suddenly need the item again. If you decide to give it away, keep this as an active resolution till the next year and then assess whether you felt the need for the item(s) you gave away. Chances are that you will never miss these items.

In addition, this will start a process of de-cluttering your belongings and clearing up your home over a period of time.

Brush Up on New Technology

Technology, as you are well aware, is changing our World. If you have not already understood the many forms of communication and connection through Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube and so many others it is time to do so now. Get familiar with the operating systems of your phones and other devices. Learn and understand these platforms since more and more of our lives will revolve around applications being developed on such platforms and around such communication medium.

To brush-up your own knowledge and skills, there are on-line tutorials for every possible question that you may have. You can also request a younger person at home or in your neighbourhood to tutor you.

Tell Your Story

You have had a wonderful and fulfilling life and now is the time to tell your story. Write your blog and publish it on a daily or weekly basis. Think of all the anecdotes in your life and write about these. Think of the milestones in your career and the time you spent as a child and record these. Think of your parents and your extended family and store these memories carefully in writing.

If you are not comfortable with writing out your blogs, dictate these into your mobile phone. Most phones now have the feature of ""voice to text"" which should quickly convert your voice recording. If this too does not work, send the recording to anyone who will transcribe it for a very small fee. A dictated blog will also preserve your voice for posterity.

Not only will this record your own memories and thoughts, this could also become a record of your family history for the future generations.

Give your brain a workout

The more you exercise your brain, like your body, the stronger it will be. Remember that diseases of the brain like Dementia and Alzheimer's are increasing.

Read more and beyond your daily newspaper. Join or start discussion groups on subjects that interest you. Try Sudoku, Chess, Quiz Up or Scrabble. All these games are available free on your smart phone. Play online with people you do not know and compete with the best. Nothing prevents you from becoming the best in the region or for that matter in the World, using your brain and not brawn power.

Once you take the lead you will find lots of followers who want to play with you but were hesitant to take the lead.

Remove negativity and anxiety from your life

Life is too short and at our stage in life, we are already on the ""back nine"" of a round of golf! Now is the time to remove all the negativity we have carried inside us about family, friends and the World in general. All this negativity is only hurting ourselves.

If you are feeling anxious about someone or something, speak about it to your family and friends. Bottling this up inside you will only make it more challenging to deal with.

Resolve to celebrate the little joys that you will have and don't hold back.

Get enough sleep

Most people seem to believe in a myth that as you get older you need lesser sleep. Nothing is farther away from the truth. If you are sleeping late or getting up very early, stay in bed longer than you normally would have and soon you will be sleeping longer and waking up much more rested. Avoid your daytime nap in the early days till your night time sleeping pattern becomes normal. Then you can easily go back to your power siesta as well!

Get regular medical check-ups

Monitor, manage and record your blood pressure, your blood sugar and your weight in a regular systematic manner. If you don't have any of these challenges, consider yourself blessed. It is necessary for you to get annual medical check-ups done and if you did not get a checkup this year, resolve to undergo a comprehensive check up in the New Year.

Travel and discover new places

Throughout your working life you would have wanted to see new places but did not have the time either because of work commitments or family commitments. Now is the time for you to realise all those dreams. You and your partner can travel to new cities or new countries or even discover new parts of the city you live in.

Discovering new places, new cuisines, new customs and making new friends will be a very energising experience.

Finally, as you celebrate during this festive season with your loved ones, raise a toast to the coming year, but with a smaller glass!"

The school volunteered to pay the training fee of anyone interested in learning the concept so that they could return and teach the students about it. The headmistress, a teacher, the director and another staff member of Anand Niketan, Shilaj have signed up for a three-month course in organic farming. The course that charges Rs 6,000 from each participant was fully funded by the school and is run by Vivek Shah and his wife, who have their own organic farm close to the city.

""It was voluntary. But we decided to learn it because we wanted to implement it in our school particularly for grade 1 & 2 students who learn about farming,"" said Nirdosh Sehgal, the headmistress of the school who was among those who attended the course.

The course is carried out every Sunday. ""Land for farming is an issue but in our school, we have large pots. As of now we grow flowering plants in them but they can also be used for growing vegetables and such,"" said Sehgal.

Shah said that the motive is not only to teach the participants about organic farming but to take them through the entire process of identifying the soil, planting the seeds, generating their own compost, and harvesting the yield too.

""We are concentrating on winter greens that can be harvested in a period of a month or so like methi and such. That way participants will not only learn how to grow their own food but also how to harvest it,"" said Shah.

Speaking about her experience Sehgal said the training opened her eyes to several aspects of farming. ""I always thought termites were not useful but here I learned that they have their role in maintaining soil health. We also learned about the broadcast way of planting seeds where you don't plant it in a planned way in neat little rows,"" said Sehgal.

Sehgal said the school already had a kitchen garden activity but none of them has had 'formal' training in farming and related activities."

Not surprisingly, private coaching institutions have started offering special classes to crack the Symbiosis entrance tests.

Though the admissions would be based on ranking in the all India entrance exam, the institute had promised to reserve 25% seats for students with Nagpur domicile. They would also be given 15% concession in fee.

TOI was the first to report about the premier institution's entry into Orange City, with NMC allocating 75-acre land at Wathoda in East Nagpur on December 29, 2016.

Symbiosis will start admitting students to four programmes from July 2019, when the first phase of its campus is completed. Symbiosis Pro Chancellor Vidya Yeravdekar confirmed this in a SMS reply.

Three of its institutes -- Symbiosis Institute of Business Management (SIBM), Symbiosis School of Law (SSL), and Symbiosis Institute of Planning, Architecture and Design -- would offer MBA, BBA, BBA-LLB, BALLB, and BArch degree courses. The institute has recently started recruitment of faculty members and non-teaching staff too. SIBM will have intake of 120 students while SSL will have 240 seats.

Students appearing in the entrance exams for the institute's flagship MBA and other courses next month would be able to opt for Nagpur as the study centre. Private coaching centres have been quick to exploit the opportunity, and started offering preparatory courses for students from the city and region.

Nihit Mor, who runs one such centre, said the response to Symbiosis's centre is huge. ""We are getting queries from a lot of parents, who were earlier reluctant to send their kids, especially girls, out of the city,"" he said.

Mor added that Symbiosis schools are among the best in the country and would offer world class education in Nagpur itself. ""Symbiosis BBA is among the top 3, and law among top 10 in the country. These are good options for Nagpur students, and they no longer need to leave the city for studies,"" he said, adding that the application process may start in January.

Experts feel aspirants must get their domicile ready since it will be the proof to claim the benefits offered by the private institute. However, they also added, parents and students need to understand that the Nagpur campus so far doesn't have 'deemed university' status, like other Symbiosis institutes."

""The industry owners will resist the ban, they will use political influence and money power. Only by withstanding the pressure, ban would be possible.

Aimed at school children from Grade III to XII, ILSO is a global online test that will be based on the Skillizen Curriculum, the world's 1st Critical Life Skills Curriculum. This curriculum follows a unique method that transfers the most practical Life Skills in such a manner, that even an 8-year-old can playfully master those skills.

The registration lines for ISLO is live, with a nominal registration fee of USD 7.99 or INR 490/-. This is the first Olympiad in which besides schools, parents can also directly enroll their children online. Home schooled children can also participate.

Launching the Life Skills Olympiad, Mr. Sidharth Tripathy, Founder & CEO, Skillizen Olympiad Foundation says, ""The children of 21st century need a whole range of critical Life skills to engage, manage and lead the world. When children grow-up and join the workforce, we often find organizations complaining that Indian students might be bright, having passed through one of the toughest educational curriculums in the world, but they are mostly not employable. Critical Life Skills are extremely essential to convert the children into responsible citizens and successful individuals.""

This unique life skills test will focus on assessing skills and competencies that are essential for young children of 21st century to lead their personal and professional lives. The questions of ILSO 2018-19 will be based on real life scenarios that will test the young students on their application of critical life skills like leadership, ethics, teamwork, communications, empathy, goal setting and many more.

""Life skills are a set of skills that enable us to lead our life to its fullest potential; skills that we all need to effectively manage the challenges of everyday life, be it at school, at work or in our personal lives. Our objective is not to prepare kids for the next grade or educational level but for the real world. School children are always comparing themselves against their classmates or at best with other children in their own school. While preparing for this test, young minds from grade III-XII will be able to acquire new Life Skills and compare their skills levels against the smartest children across 100+ countries. Participation in ILSO will perhaps be their first step to become a global citizen,"" says Mr. Sidharth Tripathy.

It is normally believed that we acquire life skills as we grow up. However, during his research work at Harvard University in 2011, Mr. Tripathy concluded that human brain can most effectively acquire critical life skills only during its hardwiring phase, which is between 6 to 16 years.

""The research findings were eye-opening and it has led to the birth of Skillizen, World's first Critical Life Skills Curriculum with a mission to create 'Citizens with the Right Skills'. Today we are looking forward to integrate a Life Skills Curriculum that would help students to acquire and apply skills such as Communication Skills, Teamwork, Leadership, Critical Thinking, Smart Consumer Literacy, and many more parallel to our educational system,"" Mr. Sidharth Tripathy says.

The main prizes for the winners of ILSO would include free ticket to visit Harvard University in USA, mini iPads and Kindles. Besides the top prizes, there are assured prizes for all participants."

There are 174 illegal private schools operational in villages without requisite approvals for the buildings, officials of education department in Gautam Budh Nagar district said.

The Uttar Pradesh government on April 23, 1976, had established the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) and, according to the Master Plan 2021, the city is spread across 2,031 hectares, comprising 81 villages and 168 Sectors including residential, commercial and Industrial uses.

The Noida authority has the mandate to regulate buildings of all kinds, including schools, in urban and rural areas. It has the power to issue notices and seal illegal and unsafe buildings.

After the twin building collapse in Greater Noida's Shahberi, in July 2018, killed nine persons, the Noida authority had conducted a survey and identified illegal buildings in all villages.

On August 3, the Noida authority had identified 1,757 buildings, which were constructed without approvals.

""However, we did not count unsafe buildings, which are being used for schools in villages. The administration and education department should look into this issue,"" a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to media, said.

Noida authority chief executive officer Alok Tandon and additional chief executive officer RK Mishra were unavailable for comment on the issue despite repeated attempts to reach them. The authority' officer on special duty, RK Singh, refused comment on the issue.

Over 70 of 174 illegal schools are operational in Noida villages, officials of education department said.

""We had acted against illegal schools in 2017 and over 85 were shut down then. We are taking necessary action in this regard and schools, which are illegal, will face tough legal action,"" BN Singh, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.

Officials of the district administration may also write to the Noida authority as to why it did not act against owners of buildings, where illegal schools are operational.

These illegal schools cater to over 1 lakh students. They do not have affiliations to the Uttar Pradesh state education board, the Central Board of Secondary Education or any other board. These schools mostly cater to the children of factory workers and daily age earners, who cannot afford to send their children to recognised private schools.

""Each school, on an average, accommodates over 1,000 students and the fee is in the range of â‚¹800 to â‚¹1,500 a month. All these schools are sheltered by the education department.

As seven freshly dug up graves became a new abode of the seven slain civilians at Pulwama, the former justice of India Markandey Katju drew parallels with Jalianwalla Bagh carnage and My Lai massacre. But the civilian killings have only added to a growing sense of fast-blurring line between combatants and civilians in the Kashmir Valley.

Yet another chilly Saturday morning in Kashmir turned bloody as its seething south witnessed the killing of seven unarmed local civilians that include a newly-married husband, a class 9 student, a carpenter's son, a lone-bread winner, a government worker, a son of a farmer and a young 14-year-old cricketer who used to be locally addressed as Virat Kohli for his batting.

All of them were killed post a deadly counter-insurgency operation that consumed three local militants and an army man in Pulwama district's Sirnoo village.

The incident has put the entire valley on the boil, as, for the third straight day Kashmir remained shut to mourn what the former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah termed as a ""massacre"".

Aqib Ahmad Bhat, 14

The youngest of the lot, 14-year-old Aqib Ahmad Bhat was one among the hundreds who had marched towards the gunfight site in a bid to 'rescue' the 'armed brethren'.

After falling prey to the Indian armed forces' bullet-spree, he was brought dead to a hospital in Srinagar. For very long, he remained unidentified, until his aged father stumbled upon Aqib's dead body and wailed: ""He is my son!""

Passionate about cricket, he was locally addressed as Virat Kohli for his batting technique. Three days before he was killed, Aqib had scored an unbeaten 75 runs in a local match. The deceased teenager is now survived by two siblings, mother, and a labourer father.

A bullet in his head claimed the 14-year-old's life.

Suhail Rasheed, 15

Son of a mentally-unsound farmer, Suhail, too, was one among the crowd, who was present near the gunfight site. He had recently passed class 9 and was admitted to the tenth standard. A vivid anti-India protestor, Suhail was picked up during a late night raid this year's summer, beaten up and was kept in a custody for a couple of days.

The season changed, and on one chilly winter morning, he was shot in the head by the Army. He died on the spot.

Liyaqat Majeed Dar, 17

Liyaqat had just completed his class 11 and on the day of the incident, had left his home to pay the admission fee for the twelfth class, but, could not. While returning back, he along with his student friends marched towards the gunfight site, only to become a victim of the army bullets.

When the army opened fire, reports say, Liyaqat was running away when he got shot in the back of his head.

He died on the spot.

Amir Ahmad Palla, 18

Reportedly the first civilian to fall prey to the army firing, Amir was the sole breadwinner for his family at the age of 18. He had to drop out of the school because of poverty, and was working at a Pollution Checking Centre.

A resident of Ashmandar village, which is not far away from the spot of the gunfight site where he breathed his last, Amir leaves behind two sisters, a younger brother, and ailing parents.

Shahbaz Ahmad Najar, 19

Shahbaz was reportedly killed in his neighbour's courtyard when a bullet indiscriminately shot by the army pierced his head. Shahbaz, a BA first year student, was with his family when he encountered death.

A resident of Monghama village, he used to work as a part-time mechanic to financially support his family. His father is a carpenter by profession.

Shahbaz has left behind his parents and two brothers, of which, one is handicapped.

Abid Hussain Lone, 28

Abid's is one of the most tragic stories. He has left behind a three-month-old daughter after recently getting married to an Indonesian woman. A management graduate, Abid had just recently moved to his hometown along with his family.

As per reports, Abid was almost half a kilometer from the gunfight area when a bullet hit the left side of his face that bore through his throat and exited from the neck.

""I had heard Kashmir is a heaven on earth,"" Firstpost quoted Abid's wife as saying. If only she knew how routinely it burns.

Touseef Ahmad Mir, 29

Touseef, was shot when he was rescuing a fellow local who had been hit by a bullet. The bullet-victim survived, but in that process, Touseef lost his life. A resident of Urichursoo, Touseef was his father's only son, among five daughters. He was married and had two kids.

Reports say Mir had gone to a local milkman with his surplus milk for sale. While returning, he joined a group of locals in an auto that was moving towards the gunfight site.

He was shot dead on the spot.

Not only has this, with the end user phase the market is segmented into Adult and Paediatric. Whereas, China is predicted to be an effective market for conjugate vaccines during the near future. Extensively increasing geriatric population, growth in consumer awareness, rising disposable income and healthcare expenditure, modernization of healthcare infrastructure and a rising medical tourism industry will operate the growth of the conjugated vaccines market in China. According to the United Nations, China is aging more speedily than almost any country in the present history. For adult vaccines, this acts as a key driver, due to more requirements by the geriatric populace. Since the toll of pneumococcal disease in China in massive, pneumococcal vaccination could develop children's health and protect lives and is, therefore, a prime selection for attachment in the EPI schedule. The conjugate vaccine market in China is predicted to have significantly high growth. Moreover, this region spent marvelous resources on the eradication of measles, but such eradication efforts should be collected with other immunization initiatives, such as educating caregivers about the benefits of other vaccines. In addition, it is expected that the market of conjugate vaccine in China will increase more actively in the near future.

Bengaluru: Byju's, an Indian education startup, more than doubled its valuation to $3.6 billion after a funding round led by Naspers Ventures and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

The company raised $540 million, which will be used to fuel an expansion into English-speaking countries, Bangalore-based Byju's said in a statement on Monday. The new valuation puts it among the top five on CB Insights' ranking of India startups.

Byju's has attracted millions of users in India, where there is often a lack of good teachers, helping to teach students from kindergarten to year 12 subjects including math, science and English. Its existing backers include the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, founded by Facebook Inc. co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, as well as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Sequoia Capital.

""The company has aggressive plans for international market expansion and will make bold investments in technology that will help to further personalise learning for students,"" it said in the statement.

Launched in 2015, Byju's app has 30 million users, with more than 2 million of them paying an annual fee of 10,000 rupees ($139), unusual in a country where users are mostly unwilling to pay subscriptions. The app contains interactive content, animations and tutor-led video lessons.

""India has the largest school-age population in the world and Indian households are willing to invest a lot in their children's education because a good education is the best path to success,"" founder and Chief Executive Officer Byju Raveendran said in the statement.

The education technology industry is undergoing a massive shift, Raveendran said, with students learning through interactive methods.

Tutors bring the real world into the act -- using pizza to explain fractions, a birthday cake to teach circles and segments, a basketball game to demonstrate projectile motion. The startup has grown at 100 percent rates since its launch and will target tripling of its revenue to 14 billion rupees this year. - Bloomberg"

For Ravi Kiran, childhood was not an easy one, as his father, an industrial worker in Hyderabad, lost his job in 2007, prompting his mother to take up odd jobs to run the household. In such a situation, schooling became a distant dream for Ravi, till his family learnt about ICFAI Republic School - renamed as Ekalavya School in 2013 - that provides education to underprivileged children charging minimal fee.

Today, Ravi works as a data analyst at Wipro Technologies in the city. He owes a lot to the school, where he learnt the skills and went on to became a successful software developer.

Located in Fatehnagar in Hyderabad, the walls of Ekalavya School echo with many such success stories. Run by IIM-Ahmedabad Alumni Association (IIMAAA) Hyderabad Chapter in partnership with RBL Bank, the school in the current batch has 310 students spread across class 1-10th, of which 45% are girls. The school will be rechristened as Udbhav RBL School from the next session starting in April 2019.

The association runs another Udbhav School in Rasool Pura area in partnership with Coromandel International. The school has 523 students that have an average family income of Rs 6000-8000 a month. Their parents have to pay 10-15% of the school expenses, while the rest of the expenses are borne by the association. Giving a thrust on girl child education-the schools now has 56% of female students.

Over the years, the students at both the schools have made a mark, by winning accolades in academics, sports and other co-curricular activities. For instance, Snagannagari Pravilika, class X student from Udbhav School has won several awards in girls power lifting championship at various competitions held at district level, state level and national level in the past two years. Pravilika says that the school provided her with the facility of smart classes and, hence, she was able to dedicate extra time for practising the sport.

Both the schools, located in Rasool Pura and Fatehnagar, had been taken over by IIMAAA when they were on the brink of closure after death of ICFAI founder N J Yasaswi.

""Both our schools have only one philosophy-all the children should get the same opportunity. Our school provides all modern facilities including music lessons, dance classes, karate training, English speaking classes and all sports activities,"" IIMAAA member T Muralidharan told Education Times.

The student/teacher ratio at both the schools is 23, which Muralidharan says, is a very good average compared to other government and private schools of Hyderabad.

The association is also raising a corpus in case the IIIMAA is not there, the operations at both the school don't come to a halt. ""In next 10 years, we plan to raise a corpus of Rs 100 crores so that we can run at least 25 schools across India with over 10000 students,"" he says."

Also, false claim of ignorance has dearly cost Gandhi Buniyadi Secondary School (GBSS) located at Pynthorumkhrah area of the city.

As per available documents, a city based advocate, Aneeta Synrem filed an RTI application dated March 20, 2018 in which she had sought for the number of candidates along with their names, guardians name, roll number, who had appeared in the SSLC (Secondary School Leaving Certificate) Selection Test from 1990 to 1996 from the Headmaster/ Public Information Officer (PIO) of GBSS.

In his reply dated April 4, 2018 to the RTI, the Headmaster refused to furnish the information on the ground that the information sought for relates to more than 20 years by stating that under Section 7 read with Sub-Section 3 of Section 8 of the RTI Act, 2005 he is not mandated to furnish the same.

Aggrieved of the refusal, Synrem filed an appeal dated April 16, 2018 before the first appellate authority, District School Education Officer, East Khasi Hills, RM Pariat - who in his order dated May 22, 2018 directed the Headmaster of GBSS to furnish the information within ten days.

Next, the Headmaster, in his reply dated May 29, 2018, furnished an incomplete reply - which does not contain the information relating to the year 1990 and 1991 and had also demanded an exorbitant fee of Rs. 250 for supply of photocopies of 48 pages (A4 size copies) in violation of Rule 4(1)(a) of the RTI (Regulation of Fee and Cost Rules), 2012 where it is stated that the charge of A4 size photocopies is Rs. 2 only.

Aggrieved, once again, of the incomplete information and charging of exorbitant fee by the Headmaster, Synrem filed another appeal on June 12, 2018 before the District School Education Officer, East Khasi Hills followed by another complaint under Section 18(1)(b)/18(1)(c)/18(1)(d)/18(1)(e) of the RTI Act, 2015 with the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC), Meghalaya, PBO Warjri.

The registered complaint, MIC/Complaint/19/2018/51 was heard on November 16, 2018 and the CIC in his order had imposed upon the Headmaster/PIO of GBSS a penalty of Rs. 10,000 at the rate of Rs. 250 per day for 40 days with effect from April 20, 2018 being the date after the information would have become due on May 29, 2018 - the date of providing the information.

During the hearing of the matter at the Meghalaya Information Commission, several fallacies emerged. To a query, the said Headmaster replied that he could not provide the information because it was old and he was unable to trace the records. He also stated that since the seeking for records were above 20 years, he believed that he is exempted from providing the information including that the school was not a centre for selection test in the years 1990 and 1991. However, the commission pointed out that information above that number of years has to be given more liberally and exceptions are only for subjects which fall under Section 8 (1)(a)(c) & (i) of the RTI Act, 2005.

To justify his failure, the Headmaster repeatedly stated about his unfamiliarity and ignorance of the provisions of the RTI Act. Regarding demand for exorbitant fees for providing information, the Headmaster submitted that it was a mistake made by him due to his ignorance to which he was pointed out as per Section 7(6) of the RTI Act states that no such charges can be made if the information is not given within 30 days.

Taking exception, the commission pointed out that the replies of the Headmaster to the show cause notice issued by it on October 10, 2018 however reflected a very good understanding on the part of the PIO of the provisions and requirements of the various sections of the RTI Act and Rules and that his replies to the questions, before the commission, in person contradict his claims.

The commission while expressing its inability to accept his claims of ignorance in relation with the two replies that he made in response to the show cause notice dated October 24, 2018 and November 15, 2018, in its order stated that both these replies reflected a very good understanding of the RTI Act and his replies to the questions from the commission in person was an attempt to mislead it. On his repeated claim of ignorance, the commission said, ""...his detailed replies to the commission dated 24/10/2018 and 15/11/2018 reflect an unusually good understanding of the RTI Act and Rules, an understand which is rarely seen among other PIOs.""

Hence, the commission has charged the Headmaster with ""...knowingly given incomplete information"" and has further ""sought to harass the applicant/ complainant by demanding an unjustified payment of Rs. 250 as photocopying charges"" and penalized him for his acts of commission and omission."

"101","1019701834","2018-12-16","https://theprint.in/opinion/petrol-price-hikes-may-annoy-you-but-cheap-oil-is-not-helping-climate/163931/","Petrol price hikes may annoy you, but cheap oil is not helping climate","ThePrint",FALSE,"Relatively low prices are making consumers less apt to do their share to reduce emissions by buying vehicles that use less fuel - or none at all.

The relationship between supply and demand, a fundamental economic concept, holds that when the price of something rises, people use less of it. Similarly, when prices fall, they use more.

And it may seem logical that low oil prices benefit consumers, countries, even the world. When consumers save money on gas, they can spend it elsewhere.

Yet, I argue that climate change makes this view obsolete.

That's because cheap oil has two big downsides along with its short-term gains. It erodes the advantages of vehicles that get more miles to the gallon, making consumers less apt to do their share to reduce emissions by buying vehicles that use less fuel - or none at all.

It also makes the case for energy innovation seem less urgent to policymakers and the automotive industry.

Burning fossil fuels, the main source of manmade carbon dioxide, is the biggest cause of climate change. In the U.S. and other wealthy countries, oil is the single largest source of these emissions.

But relatively low prices are boosting petroleum sales worldwide. Consumption is climbing particularly in Asia, where a sustained economic boom has lifted billions out of poverty and put millions more people behind steering wheels.

Those new middle-class and wealthy consumers and the industries spawned by meteoric economic growth are burning millions of barrels of petroleum every day. This includes transport of goods by road, rail, water and air. But it is passenger vehicles that dominate global mobility, and they are consuming the greatest volume of fuel in the U.S., China and everywhere else.

To be sure, petroleum is the raw material for a great many products besides gasoline, diesel and other fuels - from lipstick to asphalt. The economic benefits of cheap oil can be widely distributed, bolstering growth and keeping inflation down.

President Donald Trump, expressed this view when he likened low oil prices to ""a big tax cut for America and the world"" in a tweet.

But cheap oil has other effects as well. After improvements in fuel economy during the 1970s and early 80s, two decades of low gasoline prices reversed this trend, causing average miles per gallon to actually decrease a little in some years. Only in 2004, when prices rose, did fuel economy again become an issue.

After years of hovering around and even topping US$100 per barrel, aside from a brief peak during the Great Recession, oil prices collapsed. They fell to less than $50 by the end of 2014 and sank even lower in early 2015.

Americans responded as economists would expect them to: by driving more. The lower prices fell, the less it cost to fill their tanks. Summertime gas consumption hit an all-time high.

Unsurprisingly, U.S. emissions from transportation rose by 10 percent between 2014 and 2017, even as they fell for electricity generation and other sectors.

In addition, drivers bought bigger vehicles. Sales of SUVs, minivans and small pickups soared, while passenger car sales plummeted.

By 2018, Americans were buying two SUVs or pickups for every sedan. The trend, also present in Europe, is a core reason why emissions have risen from advanced nations for the first time in five years.

Automakers are responding by phasing out passenger car production and manufacturing more SUVs and trucks in a trend that reaches beyond U.S. borders. SUV sales are surging around the world.

Partly due to the extra miles driven and the size of the vehicles involved, carbon dioxide emissions from wealthy nations rose by 0.5 percent in 2018, following five years of decline.

But who controls oil prices? As an energy scholar and former petroleum geoscientist, I believe that it's clear that no one does.

Governments can establish climate policies, such as carbon pricing, stiff fuel taxes and other measures, that raise gasoline prices. But, as the recent French protests and two defeats in a row in Washington state for a carbon fee or tax have shown, there are limits to how far or fast they can go, even in rich countries.

And low-income nations view such measures as damaging and intrusive. Raising fuel prices has inspired massive resistance, even riots, in nations as diverse as India, Iran, Mexico and Haiti.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has teamed up with Russia to create an oil-exporting alliance known as OPEC+. Those countries can cut supplies to increase prices, as they agreed to do in December 2018. They can also increase output, should they wish to lower prices.

Yet that doesn't mean that exporters have the power to call all the shots. For example, if China - the world's largest oil importer - were to have a big recession, Saudi Arabia and Russia would probably have trouble finding buyers for all of the oil they want to export. Overproduction in that scenario would make oil prices sink.

There is another reason the group can't dominate. They must compete against the world's largest oil producer and most rapidly growing crude exporter: the U.S.

Advances in drilling technology have made it easier than ever to produce petroleum at a time when humanity should use less of it for the planet's sake.

Until and unless electric vehicles become dominant, it will prove extremely hard to wean the world off of oil.

I believe that governments and automakers should for this reason be working together for the long term. By providing strong incentives for consumers and industries to make the jump, they can stop letting cheap oil stymie climate action.

Otherwise, as hundreds of millions more people become drivers in coming decades, the laws governing supply and demand could steer all of us down a road to devastating degrees of global warming.

The disappearing world

Stills from British photographer Jimmy Nelson's short film, Blink. And They're Gone, look like covers for National Geographic. In which case, Nat Geo is set for 1,500 covers, because those many images appear in the film, in the blink of an eye. By befriending and gaining the trust of members from 36 indigenous tribes, Nelson has lovingly captured their textile traditions, headdresses, abodes and meals.

The film opens with the tribes 'posing' on different branches of native trees - baobabs and banyans - and moves on to scenes from their daily life: hunting fish, skinning carcasses, navigating their unforgiving landscapes. Helmed by Senthil Kumar, chief creative officer of ad agency JWT India, the two-and-something-minute film is a comment on how precious this world is, and how it's disappearing right before our eyes.
