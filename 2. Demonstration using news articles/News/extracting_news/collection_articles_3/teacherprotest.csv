The contractual teacher was declared dead by doctors on Sunday, 16 December, and other protesters claimed that he had died of cold on Saturday night, an official told PTI.

Dumka Civil Surgeon AK Jha, on the other hand, said they had information that one para-teacher had died in the course of agitation on Saturday, 15 December.

The para-teachers across the state have been agitating for the last three months over regularisation of their services along with other demands.

They had been staging indefinite rotation dharnas outside Marandi's house since 25 November.

Das, who along with six others, had joined the dharna on Saturday, spent the night outside the minister's house and did not wake up on Sunday morning, other members of the agitation said.

He was rushed to a hospital where the doctors declared him dead.

Asked about the cause of death, AK Jha said, ""We are waiting for the post-mortem examination report. Then only we can confirm the exact cause of death.""

The post-mortem was conducted by a medical board comprising a forensic expert, constituted by the district administration. Dumka Superintendent of Police YS Ramesh said the sit-in agitation ended on Sunday afternoon.

Meanwhile, the minister condoled the para-teacher's death and talked to Dumka Deputy Commissioner Mukesh Kumar in this regard.

Referring to the problem of the para-teachers, Marandi said Chief Minister Raghubar Das was abroad presently and she would discuss the matter with him once he was back.

""We want to have a constructive discussion on the problems of the para-teachers,"" she said.

The teacher was identified as Kanchan Kumar Das, a resident of Nonihat village under Hasdiha police station in Dumka district. He had been a para-teacher at the Upgraded Middle School in Chinadangaal under Ramgarh block since 2005.

""A postmortem of the body has been performed at Sadar hospital. We are waiting for the report to know the exact cause of the death,"" Dumka superintendent of police Y Ramesh said.

""Chill effect in the weather could be a reason for death. But, it cannot be established until postmortem report comes,"" Ramesh said.

Over 45,000 para teachers across the state are on an indefinite strike since November 16 forcing over 12,000 schools to shut. They are demanding the regularisation of their services after their counterparts in Chhattisgarh, who have served for eight years, have been regularised as assistant teachers.

They launched 'Ghera Dalo, Dera Dalo' programme at residences of BJP ministers, parliamentarians and legislators to push for their demand from November 25.

As part of the programme, Das and other para-teachers were protesting before Marandi's house on Saturday night in Dumka, around 300-km northeast from capital Ranchi.

""After participating in a protest rally in Dumka market in the afternoon, we reached the sit-in venue before the minister's house in the evening. Kanchan was already there in our makeshift tent,"" one of Das' companion Yudhir Mandal said.

Mandal said they went to bed at around 8pm but Das went to the market. He returned around 10pm and they chatted for a while before sleeping.

""We woke up around 5.45am on Sunday and was preparing tea. Around 6.30am, we called Kanchan but he did not give any response and his body shrank in cold. We immediately called an ambulance and took him to Sadar Hospital Dumka. But, the doctors declared him brought dead,"" he said.

Dr Dilip Kumar Bhagat, who examined Das, said his body was brought late. ""He had already died. So, it was hard to find out the exact cause of his death,"" he said.

Das' father Akhilesh Das, 60, said his son had no serious health complications. ""My son died due to cold. It is the state government, who is responsible for his death. The government has killed my son,"" Akhilesh said.

Kanchan was unmarried and lived with his father. His elder brother works in Kolkata.

Opposition parties also held the government responsible for the teacher's demise. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has demanded centre's interference in para-teachers' issue.

""The current BJP government in Jharkhand has lost its sensitivity and humanity. A teacher dying before a minister's house is very shameful. A case of murder should be lodged against the minister,"" said JMM spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya.

Meanwhile, Ekikrit Para Sikshak Sangharsh Morcha (EPSSM), an umbrella body of different para teachers' associations, has threatened to intensify the agitation.

""The government is not ready for any dialogue over the teachers' issue. We do not know if chief minister has made it a personal ego. We have a simple demand to regularise us on the line of Chhattisgarh,"" said EPSSM state member Vinod Tiwary.

Marandi, who was in Ranchi on Monday, expressed grief over the teacher's death. ""I will talk to the chief minister Raghubar Das and education minister Neera Yadav to sort out the para teachers' issue at the earliest,"" she said.

Marandi said that the government was serious about their issues and agreed to concede demands to some extent. ""I would request the agitating teacher to withdraw their strike,"" she said."

On learning of her deputation, the students and the villagers decided to protest the decision.

SDMC president Raju said, ""Prathibha has been working at the school for the past 12 years, and her performance has been commendable.

Following an unusual students' protest at a government high school in Tiruvallur, north of Chennai, the school education department had to delay the transfer of an English teacher by 10 days.

On Wednesday afternoon, more than 100 students from various classes of Government High School in Veliagaram launched a protest and virtually held the teacher hostage after learning that he was transferred to another school in the region.

G Bhagawan, 28, was one of two English teachers in the school. When the transfer orders came as part of a routine redeployment of staff to maintain the teacher-student ratio in government schools, those who got transferred were the two juniormost teachers who taught English, including Bhagawan.

""Bhagawan was teaching English from 6th to 10th standard. Transfer orders came on Tuesday. Another teacher came to the school on Wednesday at 9 am, completed procedures and left to join the new school before 10am. But Bhagawan, who got delayed in the process, was stopped by students,"" said principal A Aravindan.

""Students had also informed their parents about the transfer of both English teachers. So they reached the school, leading to dramatic events,"" said Aravindan, adding that Bhagawan was one of the best teachers in his school.

As students and parents joined to stop him, and staff witnessed the emotional scenes, Aravindan informed his higher-ups. ""I was told to wait for 10 days to execute the transfer order. Parents are realising that it is part of the usual process,"" Aravindan said.

Local MLA P M Narasimhan was also contacted by the Parents and Teachers' Association (PTA), seeking his help to cancel the transfer order. ""Narasimhan seems to have convinced PTA members about the necessity of this transfer. I told Bhagawan that he can regain this trust and affection from his new school too,"" Aravindan said.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Bhagawan said his colleague who got transferred had left before him. ""I was stopped by students when I stepped out of the office. They took away my scooter key first. Then they snatched my bag, crying and shouting loudly. Then they literally dragged me to the classroom. I earned not only my salary but their love and affection too,"" Bhagawan said.

Bhagawan, who hails from a town 10 km away, had chosen his new posting location through teachers' transfer counselling. ""I have to go, but this experience taught me a great lesson and instills hope in my profession,"" he said."

An English teacher at Government High School in Velliagaram, Thiruvallur, had to end his tenure at the school leaving a batch of students emotionally stirred.

Heartbroken, the students clung to their teacher G Bhagawan who was definitely adored by them.

It was quick for the emotions to get the better of the situation when the students protested at the school upon learning the news of Bhagawan's transfer.

They locked the gates. They hugged him. They cried even more in their endeavours to stop him. The students were seen begging him to not leave.

""I was posted here in 2014 and I have surpassed my tenure here. I got my transfer letter and as I was leaving the school yesterday when the students surrounded me. I felt a sudden gush of emotions and indeed I will miss them all. I had to move on to another school according to the rules. I attended the government counseling and chose Arungulam,"" G Bhagawan said.

Bhagawan taught from Class 6 to 10.

His investment in his students was much more than the subjects he taught. Apart from syllabus and lessons, life lessons too formed an integral part of his teachings.

With English, he even took interest in teaching them general knowledge and social sciences.

""He had interactive sessions with us using the projector, narrating stories and singing songs. I want to go and study in the school where he is now being transferred to. Wish he could have stayed with us,"" Class 10 student Ranjith said.

When the wailing students and their parents united to request Bhagawan and school authorities to let him continue taking classes at the same school, the government and school administration took note of it and for now, his transfer is temporarily on hold.

Bhagawan has been given 10 days to teach at Velliagaram Government High School and the authorities are yet to take a decision regarding Bhagawan's transfer."

Their stance was clear - their beloved English teacher could not be transferred out.

Demonstrating a kind of love and admiration that is rare to witness in schools today, students of the school in Tiruvallur district staged protests soon after they received the news of their teacher's transfer. Bolstered by the support of their parents, students even decided not to go to the school on Tuesday to show that the government's decision of transferring their teacher was not agreeable.

""We don't want him to be transferred. He has been one of the most supportive staff members and has been like a brother to many of us,"" said Nithya, a student. Not every teacher can boast of such love from students. ""But then, not all teachers are Bhagawan Sir,"" say his students. In a matter of four years, the teacher has formed long-lasting friendships with his students, comforting the teens as brother, ally and guide.

""Many of us were not comfortable with English but with his encouragement, we were able to improve. He was always available to clear doubts at any time of the day and we could call him even late in the evenings after the special classes,"" said Tamilarasan, a student.

Instead of merely focusing on syllabus, students said he gave them information on GK, social service, developing skills and prepare for competitive exams and focused on employment-oriented education.

Principal A Aravind said that he had submitted a representation to officials of the education department based on the requests by parents and students. ""We have requested the department if there is a possibility of retaining the teacher. He is one of the best teachers we have, completely involving himself in teaching students. During special classes that would go beyond school hours, he would help in arranging food for students and had been overall very friendly,"" he said. ""The students too are very affectionate by nature, something I find more common in rural schools. It is usually difficult for them to let go of their teachers but this time even parents got emotional,"" he added.

Meanwhile, education department officials said the transfer is part of the usual deployment and based on teaching hierarchy. They have to carry it out as per the requirement."

Two FIRs have also been registered against the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal members for creating ruckus at the private school on Tuesday night.

""On the complaint of the student's father, we have registered a case against the teacher under various sections of the IPC and POCSO Act. We are investigating the matter,"" said Sheesh Ram Meena, the station house officer of Aravali Vihar police station. The accused is absconding.

After the news spread, some VHP and Bajrang Dal members reached the school and misbehaved with some teachers, said Meena. He said two cases have been registered against the 40-50 protesters for obstructing police to perform their duty.

A clip of his speech has gone viral. He can be heard saying, ""I am a teacher of a college where 80 percent of the students are girls and of that, the majority are Muslims. These girls are not wearing dresses as per the religious tradition. They are not covering their chests with hijab. But showing part of it is like a slice of red watermelon being displayed,"" as reported by Deccan Chronicle.

Students took out a 'Watermelon march' and sought action against the professor. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), RSS' student wing, smashed watermelons in front of the college.

According to CA Jawahar, principal of Farook Training College, Jouhar made the statements during a speech delivered at a counselling session. ""The speech is from three months ago that the teacher made elsewhere and not on our campus. So, we have no responsibility in that. He regularly holds talks and motivational speeches for families on holidays. No student has raised a complaint against him, so we are not in a position to take any action against him,"" the principal told The News Minute.

A remark by a professor of a teachers' training college in Kerala's Kozhikode that Muslim girls were not wearing the hijab properly and deliberately exposing their chests like ""sliced watermelon"" has triggered widespread protests across the state by students with some women posting nude photographs.

Many student organisations protested outside Farook Training College, where Jouhar Munavvir T teaches, seeking action against him.

They said they will send slices of watermelons to the teacher just like the 'Pink Chaddi' campaign in response to the attack on women in a pub in Mangaluru in 2009 by activists of rightwing fringe group Sri Ram Sene.

""We will flood him with watermelons,"" student activist P Ajitha said.

A few women students supporting the teacher also took out a rally on the campus whipping up tension in the college.

Students in other colleges also protested carrying sliced watermelons and sought strict action against Munavvir.

Some women even took to social media to post bare-breasted photos, which were removed by Facebook.

Television channel NDTV reported that 25-year-old Arathy SA was among those, who posted a nude picture, and that and her husband too shared the photo.

""I am upset with hypersexualisation of breasts by people. Whether it be professors in college or social media users seeing a model breastfeed and pose for a magazine. So I and my husband posted pictures of me nude,"" Arathy was quoted as saying by the news channel.

""Just because people may find my breasts attractive, doesn't mean they are entitled to violate me or my body,"" Arathy added.

Activist Diya Sana from Kochi also posted the picture of one of her activist friends, using watermelons to suggestively cover her breasts and face.

Munavvir made the controversial remark while speaking at a religious seminar in Kozhikode in north Kerala recently.

""I am a teacher of a college where 80% of students are girls and a majority of them are Muslims. Though they wear the hijab, they expose some part of their chest defeating the very purpose of wearing them. They expose, you know like how we cut a slice of melon to see whether it is ripe or not,"" Munavvir said.

He said parents and religious leaders should take note of such trends as they were un-Islamic and against the very tenets of the religion.

""You should see how they wear hijab. They cover their heads with a scarf. They wear hijab in a way their chest is not covered. We all know a woman's bosom is one of the body parts that attract man most. But our girls expose their chest giving an impression that the rest of their body is like the exposed part,"" he said.

The speech was later uploaded to social media sites and netizens started criticising the teacher for his ""Taliban-like comments.""

However, principal of Farook College CA Jawahar said the teacher made the statement during a counselling session three months ago outside the college and it was unfair to whip it up now.

""He goes regularly for religious discourses. We have nothing to do with it and no student has filed a complaint in this regard,"" he defended the teacher, saying only a portion of his speech was circulated.

Munavvir, a social science teacher, has been working with the college for the last six years."

According to a report in India Today, a Class 2 student was molested by her dance teacher at the school in Rashbehari Avenue near Deshapriya Park. . CNN-News18 said that the teacher had been harassing the child for months now, and had threatened to bury her alive if she complained. The child reported the incident to her parents, who in turn, informed their relatives and other parents. The angry parents then surrounded the school and demanded that the accused teacher be handed over to them.

One of the agitating parents alleged that the school authorities tried to downplay the matter when they were informed about it. ""It was then we decided to stage a protest outside the school,"" he said.

Kolkata Police rushed to the spot to contain the situation and took the accused teacher in custody. The police also managed to safely escort him away from the angry parents and an investigation has been launched.

The India Today report also said that a policeman was reportedly injured while trying to shield the accused from the beatings of the angry parents.

Another report in Zee news said that the molestation was going on for almost a year. The parents also alleged that the school was trying to shield the accused and had not made enough security arrangements, including CCTV cameras on the campus.

Police officials, who reached the spot to control the agitators, were also heckled. ""We have taken the teacher with us to the police station,"" a senior police officer said, adding the parents assaulted the accused when he was being taken away.

The incident comes almost two months after the GD Birla sexual harassment case, in which two school teachers were arrested for allegedly trying to rape a 4-year-old child. The police have arrested the two physical training teachers in connection with the incident and have also formed a special committee to look into the allegations of negligence and false representation on part of the school. The incident also led to the dismissal of the school principal, who refused to take responsibility for the lack of CCTV cameras in the school.

As the guardians stood demonstrating outside the Carmel Primary School the scene was eerily similar to the disquiet outside GD Birla Centre for Education in posh south Kolkata locality, where angry parents had camped outside the school for hours, leaving the principal and staff stuck inside the school.

The same educational incident was also at the centre of another similar incident in 2014. According to The Indian Express, a six-year-old girl was molested on her way to the washroom by the driver and the helper of a Volvo bus, hired by the school to ferry the students to a cultural event.

""When the girl returned home, she was bleeding profusely and had to be treated at a private hospital. Her parents met the school authorities with a medical report of the child the next day, but the school allegedly tried to hush up the incident on the grounds that it might tarnish the school's reputation and also affect the child's future,"" the report said.
