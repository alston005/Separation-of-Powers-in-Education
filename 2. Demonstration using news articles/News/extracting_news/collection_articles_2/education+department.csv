With a goal to consolidate the vast amount of study material available online for students, Ranchi District Education Officer (DEO) Rajnikant Verma on Saturday said he has formed several teams of teachers who will put together and assemble these sample question banks for students in all subjects at both matriculation and intermediate level.

The study materials are expected to be ready by the last week of November. While talking to TOI, Verma said, ""The goal is to form a complete data base of questions that will help the students with the preparation for the board exams. There is a huge database of content available online and the effort is to make use of all these available useful content in the form of a booklet format.""

The main goal of this project is to improve and help the students attain a pass percentage which will uplift the district.

In an initiative aimed at providing a safe travel facility to girl students, the education department has started a carpool policy under which it will reimburse the monthly travel costs incurred by parents or custodians of girls studying in state government schools. Chhatraa Parivahan Suraksha Yojna (safe transport scheme for girls), which came into effect last Friday, applies to girls in Class 9 and above.

Dinesh Shastri, district education officer, said that the initiative was aimed at ensuring that girls did not drop out of school due to safety concerns.

""The purpose of this policy is to ensure that girls get an avenue to reach school safely. We have seen that girls face several obstacles in reaching the school from far-flung villages and other areas. They are also hesitant about going to co-education schools. This scheme seeks to address that issue so that girls can continue going to school without any restrictions,"" said Shastri.

The education department has already apprised different district officers about the initiative through an official circular. Hindustan Times has a copy of the circular. As per the circular, the policy applies only to those girls who live in areas where there is no senior secondary school at the proximity of three kilometres. Girls who have opted for science stream in Class 11 and do not have a school teaching the same at a distance of 3 kilometre will also be able to avail the scheme. Further, the policy will only be available for girls who have a monthly attendance above 60%. The policy will include vehicles such as SUVs, auto rickshaws, minibus among others under its ambit.

""The policy will encourage parents and guardians to make use of carpool facility for girls in their neighbourhood. We will compensate the costs incurred per student through a monthly deposit in the girl student's account. Girls interested in the scheme can approach their school principals to avail the benefit,"" said Shastri.

As per the provisions of the scheme, the vehicle and the vehicle driver need to meet necessary travel norms. A valid drivers' license, vehicle insurance policy, and certificate from the transport department are some of the requisites. Vehicle carriers will not be allowed to ferry students beyond the prescribed capacity of the vehicle.

Education experts, however, said that reimbursing the travel cost would only bring a minuscule change.

""Incentives such as these depend on how people use or misuse these schemes. Financial reimbursements alone cannot guarantee safe transport. Safety depends on the larger attitude of the society towards girls. Societal attitude coupled with poor sanitation in schools makes girls withdraw. Change in mindset is more important,"" said Latika Sharma, chairperson, department of education, Panjab University"

This, when the government itself had issued a circular making the verses penned by writer M T Vasudevan Nair as the official language oath. The order that mandated MT's oath to be used in all educational institutions in Kerala was released in February 2018.

And adding to the woes is the latest diktat to inspect CBSE schools, which the already burdened officials claim is very difficult to implement.

According to education department sources, of the 31 DEOs in the State, only 10 are regular appointees and the remaining ones are acting DEOs while all the 63 dyDEO posts are lying vacant. In 584 mandals, there are 539 sanctioned MEO posts but only 36 regular MEOs are presently on the job. In rest of the 503 mandals, headmasters are given full additional charge of MEO posts.

The headmasters, each of whom are now in-charge of at least 200 schools, allege that as a result they are unable to attend to their regular duties since they are always away to inspect the schools.

Chava Ravi, general secretary of Telangana State United Teachers Federation (TSUTF), said that lack of regular appointments was having a telling impact on education in general and supervision of schools in particular.

Inspection of SSC schools in the State is done currently by FAC MEOs and this too is not done properly, he said, adding that in the current scheme of things, for inspection of CBSE schools government has to come up with a new mechanism as handing it over to the FAC MEOs might not work. One of the DEOs, on the condition of anonymity, told Express that such inspection of CBSE schools cannot be undertaken in Telangana.

""If we had to conduct visits, it would have been fine but inspection of all schools when we are so short on manpower is not possible. In our schools too we only do random inspection,"" the officer said. The teaching community, therefore, has been demanding regularisation of 21 DEO posts, along with one DEO per constituency & 45 additional posts MEO posts to ensure one for each mandal.

Action will be taken against principals of the schools or junior colleges who organise tours without permission to places just for entertainment or to those which abound in natural beauty but pose a threat to the safety of students, the letter said.

Deputy director of education Minakshi Raut said, ""We get proposals from junior colleges while the education departments at the local bodies get those from schools in their respective area.

""The Kerala model gives top priority to filling seats in government-run schools, next come aided schools and third priority is to private unaided schools,"" explained a senior official from the department. The official confirmed sending the proposal to the state government to be placed before the next cabinet meeting for approval.

Officials said there were two main reasons for this proposal to amend the rules: Seats remaining vacant in government-run schools as parents of children, under the RTE rules, preferred sending them to private schools rather than government-run schools; and the financial burden on the state government in refunding the cost to private unaided schools which spend on kids admitted under the RTE quota. ""RTE refund is a burden of Rs 1,200 crore every year for the state government.

The State govt. is again planning to tweak the criteria for admission under the reservation quota of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, which will prioritise government schools over their private counterparts.

The move has been criticised by parents' groups and education experts, among other stakeholders, who believe that the government is diluting the reservation clause. The Dept. of Primary and Secondary Education is proposing that the changes be applicable in the 2019-20 academic year.

The RTE Act states that 25% of seats be reserved for students of weaker sections and disadvantaged groups in private schools. However, as per the department's plan, a child must be admitted to government or aided schools in the neighbourhood.""Only if government or aided schools are not in the neighbourhood, should the child be allotted seats in a private school,"" said a source privy to the latest proposal.

Experts point out that the proposal will ensure that the reservation quota is scrapped as almost all neighbourhoods have a government school in the vicinity. (For admissions under the RTE quota, a 'neighbourhood' is considered as a revenue village in rural areas, a ward within city corporation limits, and the entire jurisdiction for urban local bodies.)Other sources confirmed that the department was planning to amend three clauses under the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012.

""This move has been proposed as officials in the department feel that reimbursements to private schools for the RTE quota caused a huge burden to the State exchequer,"" the source added. This academic year alone, the State government is estimated to have reimbursed around ₹500 crore.

This January, a similar proposal was submitted by the department, but was not approved by the former Primary and Secondary Education Minister Tanveer Sait after widespread criticism. The State department's own analysis pointed out the rate of decline in government school enrolments for class one got steeper in the years following implementation of the RTE Act. It had also pointed out that only a small percentage (1.2%) of the overall budget of the Department of Primary and Secondary Education was spent as reimbursement for 2015-2016. Parents are unhappy with this proposal as they enrol their children in private schools in the hope they would become well-versed in English.

Shashikala K., a domestic help whose son studies under the RTE quota in a private school in North Bengaluru, said: ""When we applied for admissions this year, there were more than a dozen private schools that we could apply to. We were very happy as we could get English-medium education free of cost.

The think tank -System Correcting Movement (SYSCOM) -in a 28-page-long document, suggested measures to improve the online admission system for first-year junior colleges (FYJC). Scrapping the in-house quota in minority colleges across the state was one of them. The document has been submitted to the education commissioner.

""Minority colleges have 50% reservations under minority quota as well as 5% reservations under management quota. With the 20% in-house quota, the total reservations go up to 75%. As per high court orders, the total quota should not exceed 50%,"" said Vaishali Bafna, a member of SYSCOM.

Other suggestions include, having a centralised admission portal for all admissions under the state education department, making it mandatory for colleges to display their fees, facilities, subjects offered, etc. on their official website.

SYSCOM has also asked the education department to ensure that dual reservation admissions are conducted on the basis of application and not on the basis of allotment. For instance, a student applying under the Scheduled Tribe (ST) quota and the sports quota at the same time should be first allotted the ST-sports quota seat before a student who is eligible for both quotas but has not applied under the same.

This follows the closure of the pre-primary section of a Tolichowki school where a minor was sexually abused.

The school education department asked the Tolichowki school to shut down it's pre-primary section after it found that the management ran it without seeking recognition and following the safety guidelines issued by the National Council of Protection of Child Rights.

""We have now given a final deadline of October 31 to all such schools running preprimary sections without approval. They have to submit online details following which the deputy education officers will conduct necessary inspections and compile the data,"" B Venkata Narasamma, Hyderabad district education officer told TOI.

The Hyderabad DEO admitted that while several schools running pre-primary sections had sought recognition after the department made it mandatory in 2016, there are several independent schools which continued to flout norms. ""We are finding it difficult to tap these private players who run schools under a franchise without seeking recognition. After October, we will be initiating strict action against all such schools which function without recognition and which fail to follow child protection and safety norms on campus,"" added Narasamma.

The Andhra Pradesh Education Act, 1982, clearly specified that school managements failing to secure recognition from the education department may face imprisonment from six months to three years. A fine of Rs 3,000 to Rs 50,000 can also be imposed on the management if found guilty.

Although the school education department jumped into action following the Tolichowki case, it faced flak from parents and activists for failing to maintain a list of such schools running preprimary sections without recognition. ""The school education department's selective action against one school is not fair.Despite multiple incidents of negligence occurring in pre-primary schools, the department has miserably failed to maintain a list of schools running without recognition,"" said N Subramanyam, president of Hyderabad School Parents Association. HSPA members also shot a letter to the Hyderabad DEO on September 30 to resolve the issue of unrecognised schools in the city."

Parents of students at the IES Modern English School, Dadar, have complained to the Maharashtra Commission for Protection of Child Rights (MCPCR), demanding action against education department officials from the state government, who they say, have failed in their duties. They have alleged that the new increased fee structure by the school is being debated for the past two years, yet the school administration took action against their children by suspending about 15 of them.

The parents, who feel that education officers should have taken action against the school for this, say no action is the failure of the government, and are demanding that MCPCR take action against the persons responsible for this.

School moved court

After a complaint by parents, the fee hike by the school was declared inappropriate by the education officer's office, but the school administration moved court and won. Parents fighting the fee hike were sent legal notices. As the fee payment was delayed by these parents following the dispute, their wards were suspended from school.

""First of all, removing children from school for delay in paying fees is wrong. We paid the full fee amount obeying the court's decision, yet education department officials did not take any action against the school for victimising children in the row over fees. This is clear failure of the officials from the state education department,"" said the parent who has submitted the complaint, adding, ""This is very dangerous behaviour on part of the education officials, which is setting a bad precedent of giving a free hand to private educational institutions in profiteering.""

While Satish Nayak, trustee of the Indian Education Society (IES), which runs the school, was not available for comment even after several attempts to contact him, a senior official from the MCPCR said, ""One case regarding action taken against the children is already going on at the commission after receiving parents' complaint.

Kohima, Sep. 24 (EMN): The Naga Students' Federation (NSF) on Monday drew the attention of the advisor to School Education KT Sukhalu to what it stated were discrepancies in government schools. The NSF has demanded corrective measures or action by October 24. The students' organisation submitted a representation addressed to the legislator on Monday.

Addressing a press conference NSF president Kesosul Christopher Ltu said that the anomalies were detected by the NSF following a visit to educational institutions in various districts during different occasions.

The main issues raised by the NSF include implementation of the Mid-Day Meal (MDM) Scheme; and issues concerning school uniforms, infrastructure; composite schools and implementation of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act of 2003 (Copta).

MDM scheme: During the visit in 2017, the federation said to have noted the failure in the implementation of the scheme; students were deprived of their benefits. Ltu said that the issue was highlighted to the chief minister, which was then taken to the State Vigilance Commission for investigation into irregularities and mismanagement. He lamented that despite a lapse of one academic session, the irregularities were still taking place this year.

""For the academic year 2018, most of the schools were not provided MDM and many schools were supplied with only 'dal' (dried, split pulses) and cooking cost without supply of any other commodities,"" the student leader pointed out. It compelled the school managements to sell afew bags of 'dal' to purchase rice and other commodities to provide meal to the students. It was learnt that the NSF had written to the State Vigilance Commission on August 21 last to expedite the investigation process, and to produce the report by 30 days. It also asked the commission to investigate discrepancies in MDM for the year 2017 and 2018, advocating that strict and effective disciplinary measure should be initiated against offenders in the implementing agencies.

With the passage of the 30-day mark, the NSF had a meeting with the Vigilance department officials, wherein, the latter was stated to have proposed for three months' time to complete the process. Towards this, Ltu said the NSF will take a call only after consultation with its federating units.

Free uniforms: The NSF has said that there was shortage and delay in supply of the school uniforms including trousers, skirt and shirts. ""Most of the schools were issued with only sweater and a pair of socks, all of which were of the same size, and could not fit even students from the lower primary classes,"" the federation lamented.

In several schools, Ltu said, students were given just cloth materials of 'compromised quality', and without stitching cost. ""It is imperative to mention that the cloth materials supplied were of the lowest quality,"" he said.

The NSF had written to the chief secretary on September 4 regarding the issue of school uniforms, and sought measures from the government within 15 days. Interestingly, the department of School Education was said to have replied to the letter on September 24, the day the NSF submitted its representation to the legislator in-charge of the department. The department simply stated that 'the government has decided to refer the matter to the State Vigilance Commission for necessary action'.

The student body also raised the issue of deteriorating infrastructure of most of the government schools. It highlighted that most of the classrooms and staff rooms in the government schools were in dilapidated conditions, and the schools, since their inception, have not received any funds for repair and renovation. Some of the schools were built in 1940s and were still running under the same structure, Ltu maintained.

The organisation also expressed concern that it was found through records from the government schools that no official inspection were being undertaken by the department, respective district education officers (DEO) and sub-divisional education officers (SDEO).

""This negligence of duty from the government officials is one of the factors mainly responsible for the untold hardships being faced by the schools and students and for low performance of students in their academics,"" the NSF stated in its representation. Stating that there was a gap between the schools and the department, NSF leaders were of the view that instead of just reviewing the performance of government schools in HSLC, department and government need to review and assess the schools and students by carrying out physical visitation and verification.

The federation also pointed out that the government has initiated to merge few schools together under one administration in the form of 'composite school.' However, with the lack of infrastructure in almost all the government schools, it felt this exercise will not serve its purpose as intended without upgradation of the present infrastructures.

Meanwhile, reminding that the Copta (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) being enacted and enforced, the NSF maintained it was imperative to put it in order. It informed that many shops within the given perimeters were detected selling banned tobacco products and demanded that the respective district administration should strictly monitor the strict enforcement of the act.

The student body asked the advisor for School Education to initiate action, and inform about it within 30 days. The NSF leader asserted that the affected party being the students, they would have to step out and show their resentment in a democratic way."

In three of the recent incidents, the files related to appointments of registrars for Karnataka State Open University (KSOU), term extension for Hampi Kannada University vice chancellor and issuing some work orders for a big amount, the officials of the department had not brought the matters to the minister's notice.

Devegowda told this to The New Indian Express and conveyed the same to Public Works Department Minister HD Revanna. Revanna later called senior officials of the department and warned them against bypassing the minister. ""I was kept in the dark and even the files related to the appointment of KSOU registrars were not brought to my attention,"" Devegowda said.

On Tuesday, Devegowda has written to the state government urging it to relieve a senior official from the department's planning section who had released Rs 108 crore in payments for various projects without informing the minister.

According to sources close to Devegowda, he recently met Revanna and sought a change of portfolio.

Recently, while reacting to questions on extension of term given to Hampi Kannada University Vice Chancellor Prof Mallika Ghanti, the minister said he was unaware of it. But when asked, sources at Raj Bhavan confirmed that the file had come from the state government.Sources close to the minister allege that former VC of University of Mysore Prof K S Rangappa is playing a role in all this. However, this allegation could not be independently verified."

The School Education Department's announcement to consider only Plus 2 marks for college admissions has evoked a mixed reaction.

While many students and schools expressed relief, teachers' associations opposed the move saying the schools may not take Plus 1 seriously.

""We're extremely happy since the prospect of taking up the boards in the new curriculum seemed daunting. Many of us were scared that if our total in the Class XI exams goes down even a bit, it will affect our chances during college admissions,"" said A. Priyadarshinie, a student from the city.

The School Education Department introduced board exams for Plus 1 in 2017 and the first batch of students who took up the exam in March 2018 secured a pass percentage of 91.3. While many schools had secured a good pass percentage, many teachers and students felt that individual scores could have been much higher.

While a number of teachers say that the new curriculum for Plus 1 introduced this year was interesting and challenging, the students found the transition difficult. Also, delays plague textbook distribution for a few subjects. ""We are yet to see the second volume of textbooks for many subjects. The faculty and students have been working hard and this announcement comes as a breather,"" said the headmaster of a school in the city.

The Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association, however, vehemently opposed the move by the government and said that it would further disadvantage students from government schools in rural areas.

""Private schools will now have a free run to teach Plus 2 portions in Plus 1 itself like before. Now, it is enough if the students merely clear the Plus 1 exams,"" said K.P.O. Suresh, State president of the association.

""Even though Plus 2 students will have a new curriculum next year and therefore can't be taught now, this will set a precedent for the future. Students in government schools who are actually taught both Plus 1 and 2 portions thoroughly will once again be left behind,"" he said.

Mr. Suresh also said that the move to not consider Plus 1 marks for admission into colleges defeated the purpose of ensuring that the students gave importance to their lessons during both years, which would have ensured that they were better prepared to handle competitive exams.

""This is unnecessary confusion for the students who are getting adapted to the changes already in place,"" he said.

N. Ramasubramanyan, correspondent, Sri Natesan Vidyasala Matriculation Higher Secondary School, said that before the compulsory Plus 1 board exams were introduced, he had appealed to the government to reintroduce the old practice of having district-level common exams in Plus 1.

""That Plus 1 board exam marks will not be considered for admissions is welcome since no other board has the system. As the Education Department has specified that students will not get their Plus 2 marksheets without clearing Plus 1, schools can't take them lightly,"" he said.

Welcoming the move, Vishnucharan Paneerselvam, correspondent, Shree Niketan Group of Schools, said that it will definitely lessen the burden and stress on the students who will be writing board exams for three successive years."

In a recent incident, a class 9 student from Brilliant Grammar School, Boduppal, was sent home over due fees.

""We are not against schools collecting fees, but that should purely be between parents and school management. Under no circumstances, should the child be involved. The same thing happened in this incident, where the class 9 student was sent back on the pretext that he did not pay the fees,"" said Achyuta Rao, honorary president, Balala Hakula Sangham.

""Unfortunately, despite a number of cases being reported every month, the school education department has no concrete plan to deal with such issues... We feel that unless they are directly made accountable and action is initiated against the district or mandal education officer concerned along with erring teacher and school management, the situation is going to remain the same,"" Rao added.

Meanwhile, school education department officials, who started inspecting private schools since the first week of August, have not taken action against a single school. ""I have had directed the deputy inspection officers and deputy education officers to visit at least 20 private schools every month and interact with students to know about issues bothering them. However, we haven't issued any show-cause notices yet,"" said B Venkata Narassama, Hyderabad district education officer.

Data from Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Belagavi, shows that 12 streams have been getting the least number of admissions for three years -- 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. According to university officials, there is no demand for those subjects in the job market. This list of 12 streams includes aerospace engineering, automation and robotics engineering, ceramics and cement technology, environmental engineering, instrumentation technology, manufacture science and engineering, and mining technology. ""The problem with these streams is that very few colleges offer these courses and some have started when the market was in boom in that particular area.

The decision was taken in a meeting held last week following the tragic incident at New Century Public School in Kukatpally which led to death of two students after a beam collapsed.

""The deputy education officers are instructed to visit minimum 20 schools in every mandal per month. They have to inspect if the buildings are structurally sound and whether there is any scope of hazardous events to occur. They have to check the structural stability certificates issued to the schools and submit a report by August 13,"" B Venkata Narasamma, district education officer of Hyderabad told TOI.

The education department has decided to take stern action against schools which are running out of dilapidated or unstable buildings. ""We don't want the Kukatpally incident to be repeated. During surprise visits, if any schools are found running in dilapidated conditions or constructed of poor quality material, notices will be issued and they may face action including demolition,"" said Narasamma.

Inspections will also be carried out at government schools as part of the exercise. ""So far, we have identified four government schools which are lying in dilapidated conditions. Details of these schools are forwarded to Hyderabad collector. We have proposed repairs in few government schools,"" Narasamma added.

Of the four government schools, one is in Nampally and other is in Sultan Bazaar. In order to ensure that there is no threat to students' lives, the education department is now making an effort to shift existing students in other nearby government schools.

The GHMC has also instructed all deputy commissioners and assistant medical officers of health to inspect schools in their respective circles and issue notices wherever lapses are observed. The GHMC will inform the DEO and the collector about it.

TIMES VIEW: While the government's move to inspect school buildings is an encouraging step, efforts should also be made to ensure that it doesn't turn out to be just a knee-jerk reaction to Kukatpally tragedy. A prompt action must be taken against guilty school owners."

AFTER A month of protests and numerous representations by teachers' bodies to the education secretary as well as local politicians, the UT education department has revoked the termination notices of three teachers, cancelled the termination of a contract teacher and reinstated two suspended school heads on Friday.

Last month, the department served termination, suspension and show cause notices to teachers, heads and principals for poor results in the Class X CBSE board exam.

Jaspreet Kaur of Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS), Sector 25, Pawan of GMSSS-38 (West) and Varinder from GMSSS-Khuda Ali Sher were all asked to return to work. Pawan and Varinder are employed under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).

Nirmal Singh, head of Government High School, Sector 38, and Satpal Singh, head, Government Model High School, Sector 11, were also reinstated after a month of suspension.

The show cause notice served to 56 teachers, however, is yet to be revoked.

Education Secretary B L Sharma said, ""Yes, we have revoked the termination notices and reinstated the suspended school heads. The order has been issued. We never intended to take anyone's job, but we wanted to send out a message that action can be taken if teachers underperform.""

Sharma added that the teachers have submitted an undertaking stating that they would ensure results above 75 per cent. Teachers were up in arms against the education department for the action taken against them, blaming officials for allowing grace marks and numerous violations of the RTE Act at government schools.

Teachers' bodies, including Joint Action Committee of UT Teachers and SSA Teachers' Welfare Association (SSATWA), also submitted representations to local MP Kirron Kher who spoke to Sharma and other officials too.

When asked if Sharma had bowed to pressure from the MP, he said, ""It had nothing to do with pressure. But yes, I had earlier told Kirron Kher that we want to take strict action against underperforming teachers.""

Kher refused to comment, stating that she was in Parliament. However, she added that she was aware that the order to revoke the notices had been issued.

To streamline regular supply of fresh milk to the students under the scheme, which was launched by chief minister Vasundhara Raje on July 2, the department sanctioned remuneration to hire a cook to warm milk. The Mid Day Meal Commissionerate, which works under the education department, issued an order a week back in this context allowing head of schools to hire a cook on Rs 500 per month remuneration. A separate budget for releasing the remuneration was decided to be deposited in the account of the schools.

Majority of the schools post the budget sanction, had hired cooks who are warming milk and helping the teaching staff in its distribution to the students. However, a latest order issued by the education department over the age criteria of cooks has created a complex situation for the teachers.

The order says that the school management shall not hire a cook, particularly a woman, who is 40-60 years old. Only young cook-cum-helpers in the age group of 18-40 must be hired for the work, said the order which has been released by a block education officer posted in Uniyara of Tonk district. Similar orders have been issued by the officials across the state.

This order reflects gender biases towards elderly women when it mentions that they should not be hired. ""The old women are not capable of warming milk, hence they should be removed immediately and cook-cum-helpers must be in the age group of 18-40 years only,"" reads the order.

Raje had on July 2 launched the scheme for students under which they are getting milk thrice a week. Every student of class I to V is being provided 150 ml and students of class VI to VIII get 200 ml of milk. The students are getting glass of milk immediately after the school assembly gets over.

A city school withdrew its controversial guidelines for students after the State Education Department on Thursday ordered an investigation into them.

The allegedly stringent 30-page rulebook brought out by MAEER's MIT Vishwashanti Gurukul School was contested by some parents after it mandated that girl students wear only white or beige innerwear and bloomers every day.

The rules, termed 'diktats' by protesting parents, also restricted time for washroom usage and prohibited the use of lipstick, lip gloss or any other cosmetic, as well as tattoos, for girl students. It mandated that girls wear only round studs not bigger than 0.3 cm on each earlobe and stipulated their skirts be of a certain length.

The school withdrew the rulebook after State Education Minister Vinod Tawde ordered an investigation and sent a team under Deputy Director of Education Meenakshi Raut to the institute.

The rulebook's presentation in the form of an affidavit elicited sharp criticism from parents.""While enforcing discipline is commendable, no institute ought to lay down such rigid rules,"" Mr. Tawde said, speaking in Nagpur during the monsoon session of the Assembly.

The guidelines mentioned the applicability of IPC sections 199 (false statement made in declaration), 200 (using as true such declaration knowing it to be false) and 202 (intentional omission to give information) if parents gave false information about their children.

""The rules were laid down for the security of the students. Our intention was pure; it was to avoid unpleasant incidents. We had no hidden agenda whatsoever as some parents have hinted,"" said Dr. Suchitra Karad-Nagare, Executive Director, MIT Group of Institutes. She said the institute had always welcomed dialogue with parents. ""We had hoped they would resolve the issue with us before going to the media first,"" she said.

A senior MIT official, requesting anonymity, said the rules were formulated to preclude any untoward incident involving girl students and that they were only meant to act as a deterrent.

""We have received reports where girl students complained of not being addressed respectfully by the boys. There have also been cases where students have misguided the authorities by giving wrong numbers of their wards. Are the school authorities or the parents responsible in such cases? Hence the rules,"" said the official.

However, some of the parents disputed the institute's claims. ""It read like a law book and not a rule book. How can an institution regulate a time for drinking water? The rulebook has imposed fear upon students and is a money-making exercise on the institute's part,"" said a parent, requesting anonymity. The rules levied a ₹1,500 cycle-parking fee while making helmets compulsory. Local MNS activists took up the cause, while vernacular channels decried the school's guidebook as ""a form of dictatorship""."

INDIAN NATIONAL Lok Dal MP Dushyant Chautala has raised questions over the recruitment of employees (C & D categories) by private agencies for the Haryana education department under ""outsourcing concept."" The party would approach court if the government did not scrap this system of recruitment immediately, the Hisar MP told mediapersons Sunday.

Dushyant said, ""As part of this process, recruitment in the education department will be done by private recruitment agencies on the basis of commission per head. Thus, ""primary schools to Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas will be covered under the new recruitment system"". As per documents, as many 19 private agencies, including four from Surat (Gujarat) were empanelled to provide employees to the government departments. The INLD MP said as many as 28,000 posts are to be filled through outsourcing policy and 3,000 of them would be recruited by these agencies for the education department. A matriculate Sanjay recruited by a Gujarat-based agency as multipurpose worker will join his duty in a government school of Hansi (Hisar) on July 2. Dushyant claimed such agencies would even recruit teachers for primary schools of the state.

""By adopting this Gujarat model of outsourcing"", Dushyant alleged, ""the Haryana government will also render the Haryana Staff Selection Commission and Employment Exchanges redundant."" When a system to recruit candidates for 'C' and 'D' category posts, that is Haryana Staff Selection Commission, was there what was the necessity of hiring private agencies for recruitment purposes, he questioned.

The Hisar MP claimed that the policy would adversely impact the equality of opportunity right to seek employment since the employees would be recruited on the basis of the will of the recruitment agency. ""It will also ignore the legal provisions that have made reservation a law to bring about social justice to the backward and the downtrodden.""

As per information received from employment exchanges under RTI Act, Dushyant said, in 12 districts of the state there were 2,62,768 registered unemployed youths. ""Of these only 290 have been provided jobs by the government, which is barely 0.1 percent of the total registered unemployed. The same RTI also informs that under the much touted scheme to provide employment of 100 hours to the unemployed youth only 9948 have been provided employment for 100 hours which is only three percent of the registered youth under the scheme,"" Dushyant said adding 'Rozgar Mera Adhikar' movement would be launched in the state to secure justice for the youths.

Around 3,200 private schools who have been awaiting permanent recognition from the state's education department are on brink of getting closed in Haryana. These schools have been functional for a long time on temporary recognition issued by the education department every year but it hasn't been renewed this year after the expiry of the last one on March 31.

Getting recognition is mandatory for the private schools for getting affiliation. Schools can file for the affiliation till July 6 as directed by the board, however, they can avail an extension of 10 days by paying a late fee of Rs 5000. All options are closed after that.

In 2017, the education department had announced that it doesn't find yearly temporary recognition favourable. Therefore, committees were formed under the District Education Officer(DEO) and District Elementary Education Officers (DEFO). Also, district deputy commissioners were debarred from providing recognition. Though the committees have not been able to come up with a solution of pending recognition of these private schools.

The private school owners are anxious and urging the central government to grant them temporary recognition as soon as possible and work on their regularisation. They also were accusing BJP who had promised to grant these private schools recognition after coming into power. They have planned to meet Education Minister Rambilas Sharma and other senior officers to talk about the issue.

These 3200 private schools have not been granted recognition because they have failed to abide by the land and building related norms, according to a report by CNN-News 18. These norms specify that private schools up to class 10 should have a land of 2,000 square meters (sqm) in case of a single floor and 1,500 sq m for a two-storeyed building. Likewise, the land requirement for senior secondary schools is 3,000 sq mts for single-story building and 2,250 sqm for double-storeyed structure whereas for schools with Science stream, the requirement is up to 4,000 sqm and 3000 sqm for single and double story, respectively."

The government is considering the proposal following allegations that a few corporate and private school managements have been misusing the present Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) pattern, by giving more internal marks to their students to manipulate their GPA (grade point average).

According to officials, a final decision will be taken by the state government after studying the pros and cons of the CCE pattern.

As per CCE, a maximum of 20 marks is allocated as internal mark based on formative and summative assessments and 80 marks for the final examination of each paper. The formative assessment and summative assessment will be key in calculating internal marks. All the project works of the students and valuation by teachers are to be sent to the respective DEO offices and the schools have to upload the internal marks on the website of the school education department.

However, many schools were not uploading the Formative Assessment marks on the website properly, affecting their final marks. As there is no proper checking by the education department officials, many corporate schools are allegedly misusing the CCE system by allocating 20/20 internal marks to all students.

To overcome the issue, the education department is planning to withdraw the CCE pattern and conduct the final examination for 100 marks, just like the earlier method.

However, the proposal is not finalised yet and the department is also looking at other options.

Speaking to Express, A Sairam, DEO of Srikakulam district said, ""The department officials have asked us to send proposals and opinions for stopping the misuse of internal marks by corporate schools. We are looking at other options rather than completely avoiding the internal marks. We are also planning to implement the internal examination in a different way. A few other options are also on the cards.""

Private schools have welcomed the move.

Meanwhile, private school managements said that they are happy with the proposal and that they were against the CCE pattern right from the beginning. ""We have opposed the CCE pattern from the beginning and now the officials are alleging that we are misusing it. Not all private schools are doing that, but it's a fact that a few corporate schools are misusing it. We support the government proposal to withdraw the pattern,"" said N Srinivasa Rao, principal of Vivekananda private school."

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia Saturday said the exercise of the education department to verify residence proof of school students was aimed at restraining the ""mafia"" involved in admission frauds. His remark came after the Election Commission reportedly asked the AAP government to stop the exercise of collecting voter identification details of families of school students.

Sisodia also said poll panel had no mandate in this matter, even as the Delhi BJP hit out at AAP government and accused it of collecting data for ""political purposes"". ""The education mafia is causing this controversy. The EC's mandate is not to support the BJP's education mafia, but to conduct elections. As long as the voter card is a valid address proof, the EC cannot ask us to stop the exercise,"" the deputy chief minister told reporters.

Sisodia, who is in-charge of the education department, said the ""education mafia"" exists in Delhi and it runs fake admission rackets. ""During checking it was found that in two schools wrong address proof of children were furnished,"" he said. No children will be removed from the schools but the department is seeking address details, the AAP leader said.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari, casting doubts on the move of the Delhi government, said it was trying ""political gains"" in the garb of address verification. ""We have been opposing this process since September 2018 when a notification for the purpose was issued by the Delhi government's education directorate,"" he said. He claimed that the government was collecting ""crucial data"", including voter ID data details, phone numbers, address, education qualification of parents of the children.

""The Delhi High Court had also raised an objection to it. Now, the Election Commission has also objected to it but what Sisodia is saying is an attack on Federal structure of the country,"" Tiwari said. He demanded that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tell people how the collection of data will benefit them."

This makes it mandatory for these institutes to select new teachers from amongst those securing a high rank in the test.

The division bench justices RK Deshpande and Vinay Joshi was hearing three separate petitions filed by educational institutes challenging the provision of the MEPS Rules. They contended that the provision binds the institute's management to appoint teachers only from the merit list prepared by the state education department.

They said this violates the institute's fundamental freedom of selecting candidates of their choice and interferes with the autonomy of the educational institute.

However, HC ruled that the state government was competent to prescribe additional qualifications for the candidates seeking appointment in aided educational institutions.The additional requirement did not interfere with the right of managements to select and appoint qualified and suitable candidates of their choice, the bench said.

The court also added that the additional requirement would help reduce corruption, nepotism, favouritism and other such malpractices while appointing teachers.

However, the court struck down a government resolution related to the provisions, which mandates school management to appoint candidates in order of the merit list prepared by the state department.

In an initiative aimed at providing a safe travel facility to girl students, the education department has started a carpool policy under which it will reimburse the monthly travel costs incurred by parents or custodians of girls studying in state government schools. Chhatraa Parivahan Suraksha Yojna (safe transport scheme for girls), which came into effect last Friday, applies to girls in Class 9 and above.

Dinesh Shastri, district education officer, said that the initiative was aimed at ensuring that girls did not drop out of school due to safety concerns.

""The purpose of this policy is to ensure that girls get an avenue to reach school safely. We have seen that girls face several obstacles in reaching the school from far-flung villages and other areas. They are also hesitant about going to co-education schools. This scheme seeks to address that issue so that girls can continue going to school without any restrictions,"" said Shastri.

The education department has already apprised different district officers about the initiative through an official circular. Hindustan Times has a copy of the circular. As per the circular, the policy applies only to those girls who live in areas where there is no senior secondary school at the proximity of three kilometres. Girls who have opted for science stream in Class 11 and do not have a school teaching the same at a distance of 3 kilometre will also be able to avail the scheme. Further, the policy will only be available for girls who have a monthly attendance above 60%. The policy will include vehicles such as SUVs, auto rickshaws, minibus among others under its ambit.

""The policy will encourage parents and guardians to make use of carpool facility for girls in their neighbourhood. We will compensate the costs incurred per student through a monthly deposit in the girl student's account. Girls interested in the scheme can approach their school principals to avail the benefit,"" said Shastri.

As per the provisions of the scheme, the vehicle and the vehicle driver need to meet necessary travel norms. A valid drivers' license, vehicle insurance policy, and certificate from the transport department are some of the requisites. Vehicle carriers will not be allowed to ferry students beyond the prescribed capacity of the vehicle.

Education experts, however, said that reimbursing the travel cost would only bring a minuscule change.

""Incentives such as these depend on how people use or misuse these schemes. Financial reimbursements alone cannot guarantee safe transport. Safety depends on the larger attitude of the society towards girls. Societal attitude coupled with poor sanitation in schools makes girls withdraw. Change in mindset is more important,"" said Latika Sharma, chairperson, department of education, Panjab University"

The headmasters, each of whom are now in-charge of at least 200 schools, allege that as a result they are unable to attend to their regular duties since they are always away to inspect the schools.

Inspection of SSC schools in the State is done currently by FAC MEOs and this too is not done properly, he said, adding that in the current scheme of things, for inspection of CBSE schools government has to come up with a new mechanism as handing it over to the FAC MEOs might not work. One of the DEOs, on the condition of anonymity, told Express that such inspection of CBSE schools cannot be undertaken in Telangana.

""If we had to conduct visits, it would have been fine but inspection of all schools when we are so short on manpower is not possible.

The department has proposed the Kerala model in which priority will be given to government-run schools to fill seats under RTE rather than private unaided schools.

""The Kerala model gives top priority to filling seats in government-run schools, next come aided schools and third priority is to private unaided schools,"" explained a senior official from the department. The official confirmed sending the proposal to the state government to be placed before the next cabinet meeting for approval.

Officials said there were two main reasons for this proposal to amend the rules: Seats remaining vacant in government-run schools as parents of children, under the RTE rules, preferred sending them to private schools rather than government-run schools; and the financial burden on the state government in refunding the cost to private unaided schools which spend on kids admitted under the RTE quota. ""RTE refund is a burden of Rs 1,200 crore every year for the state government. Not just that, this is impacting admissions in government schools, which is drastically going down since the last three years,"" said a senior official.

""It is also a fact that the state government is helping some private schools sustain as they are getting admissions only because of the RTE Act where kids are getting admission under the 25% reservation quota,"" said the official.

Meanwhile, poor infrastructure in government schools is also being blamed for the poor rate of admissions. One education expert said on condition of anonymity, ""One can't blame the RTE Act. The face of government schools will not change by abolishing or amending the RTE Act.""

However, education expert V P Niranjanaradhya said, ""There were some errors in the implementation (of the RTE Act) itself and bringing amendments to the rules is the best way to correct it. As per Section 3 of the Act, it is a must to admit kids in neighbourhood schools, but it is being violated. Despite a government or aided school being there in the neighbourhood, kids are getting admissions at unaided private schools far away."""

The State govt. is again planning to tweak the criteria for admission under the reservation quota of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, which will prioritise government schools over their private counterparts.

The move has been criticised by parents' groups and education experts, among other stakeholders, who believe that the government is diluting the reservation clause. The Dept. of Primary and Secondary Education is proposing that the changes be applicable in the 2019-20 academic year.

The RTE Act states that 25% of seats be reserved for students of weaker sections and disadvantaged groups in private schools. However, as per the department's plan, a child must be admitted to government or aided schools in the neighbourhood.""Only if government or aided schools are not in the neighbourhood, should the child be allotted seats in a private school,"" said a source privy to the latest proposal.

Experts point out that the proposal will ensure that the reservation quota is scrapped as almost all neighbourhoods have a government school in the vicinity. (For admissions under the RTE quota, a 'neighbourhood' is considered as a revenue village in rural areas, a ward within city corporation limits, and the entire jurisdiction for urban local bodies.)Other sources confirmed that the department was planning to amend three clauses under the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012.

""This move has been proposed as officials in the department feel that reimbursements to private schools for the RTE quota caused a huge burden to the State exchequer,"" the source added. This academic year alone, the State government is estimated to have reimbursed around ₹500 crore.

This January, a similar proposal was submitted by the department, but was not approved by the former Primary and Secondary Education Minister Tanveer Sait after widespread criticism. The State department's own analysis pointed out the rate of decline in government school enrolments for class one got steeper in the years following implementation of the RTE Act. It had also pointed out that only a small percentage (1.2%) of the overall budget of the Department of Primary and Secondary Education was spent as reimbursement for 2015-2016. Parents are unhappy with this proposal as they enrol their children in private schools in the hope they would become well-versed in English.

Shashikala K., a domestic help whose son studies under the RTE quota in a private school in North Bengaluru, said: ""When we applied for admissions this year, there were more than a dozen private schools that we could apply to. We were very happy as we could get English-medium education free of cost. If the rules are changed, it would mean that English-medium education is no longer accessible to us as every locality has a govt. school."""

A Pune-based think tank, which focuses on college education, asked the state education department to scrap the 20% in-house quota in minority colleges for junior college admissions.

The think tank -System Correcting Movement (SYSCOM) -in a 28-page-long document, suggested measures to improve the online admission system for first-year junior colleges (FYJC). Scrapping the in-house quota in minority colleges across the state was one of them. The document has been submitted to the education commissioner.

""Minority colleges have 50% reservations under minority quota as well as 5% reservations under management quota. With the 20% in-house quota, the total reservations go up to 75%. As per high court orders, the total quota should not exceed 50%,"" said Vaishali Bafna, a member of SYSCOM.

Other suggestions include, having a centralised admission portal for all admissions under the state education department, making it mandatory for colleges to display their fees, facilities, subjects offered, etc. on their official website.

SYSCOM has also asked the education department to ensure that dual reservation admissions are conducted on the basis of application and not on the basis of allotment. For instance, a student applying under the Scheduled Tribe (ST) quota and the sports quota at the same time should be first allotted the ST-sports quota seat before a student who is eligible for both quotas but has not applied under the same.

An official from the education department said the state would consider the suggestions given by the think tank. ""We take feedback from all stakeholders to improve the admission process every year. Suggestions made by the think tank would be also be considered. The committee looking after FYJC admissions would decide which of the suggestions could be included,"" said the official.

Bafna said that the education department needs to appoint a school level committee to ensure that all the norms with respect to FYJC admissions are fulfilled and that admissions happen purely on the basis of merit.

""The school principal should head the committee and must be made responsible for any error or issues in allotment taking place during the process"" reads the suggestion in the report.

Suggestions made by the think tank

As first step, the department has directed all District Educational Officers (DEO) to hold school-level meetings to include Saturday as a working day to complete the minimum working days of 200. However, Christmas examination and final examinations will be held as per schedule, top officers of the Education Department told Express.

A Shahjahan, General Education Secretary, told Express the decision on which Saturdays would be included as holidays will have to be decided by the respective DEOs in the affected districts. ""The DEOs will rearrange the working days of schools based on the holidays given to them on account of rain and floods. In some districts, more holidays were given and hence Saturdays will be working days based on the number of holidays. The rearrangement is underway. Since there were no Onam examinations, we are planning to make up the classes lost before the second term examinations itself,"" Shajahan said.

He also said the SSLC and HSE examinations will be held as per schedule and there is no room for any postponement.

A School Quality Improvement Programme (QIP) monitoring committee will also check the number of working days and recommend DEOs to plan the working days on Saturdays. Second Saturdays will be holidays as usual.

Last year too, the department targeted 200 working days, but could only achieve 172 days. Earlier, the higher secondary directorate's decision to assign a few Saturdays as working days in order to ensure at least 200 academic days this year has kicked up a storm. Various teachers' unions had decried the directorate's decision calling it a move to further 'overburden' both the teachers and students."

In fact, the school education department identified 10,866 vacant teacher posts and decided to recruit eligible candidates through DSC in the year 2017. For this, the department sent proposals to the finance department for approval.

However, the finance department has asked the education department to submit the details regarding the additional posts available in the department and the student-teacher ratio. To this, the department officials submitted the details and received clearance from the finance department recently.

With the Physical Education and Training (PET) candidates demanding the State government to increase the PET posts, the HRD Minister assured that they might be increased after discussing with the Chief Minister.

The candidates demanded the government to recruit for 1,056 PET vacant posts across the state.

The school education department asked the Tolichowki school to shut down it's pre-primary section after it found that the management ran it without seeking recognition and following the safety guidelines issued by the National Council of Protection of Child Rights.

""We have now given a final deadline of October 31 to all such schools running preprimary sections without approval.

""We are finding it difficult to tap these private players who run schools under a franchise without seeking recognition. After October, we will be initiating strict action against all such schools which function without recognition and which fail to follow child protection and safety norms on campus,"" added Narasamma.

Although the school education department jumped into action following the Tolichowki case, it faced flak from parents and activists for failing to maintain a list of such schools running preprimary sections without recognition. ""The school education department's selective action against one school is not fair.Despite multiple incidents of negligence occurring in pre-primary schools, the department has miserably failed to maintain a list of schools running without recognition,"" said N Subramanyam, president of Hyderabad School Parents Association.

Parents of students at the IES Modern English School, Dadar, have complained to the Maharashtra Commission for Protection of Child Rights (MCPCR), demanding action against education department officials from the state government, who they say, have failed in their duties. They have alleged that the new increased fee structure by the school is being debated for the past two years, yet the school administration took action against their children by suspending about 15 of them.

After a complaint by parents, the fee hike by the school was declared inappropriate by the education officer's office, but the school administration moved court and won. Parents fighting the fee hike were sent legal notices. As the fee payment was delayed by these parents following the dispute, their wards were suspended from school.

""First of all, removing children from school for delay in paying fees is wrong. We paid the full fee amount obeying the court's decision, yet education department officials did not take any action against the school for victimising children in the row over fees.

Kohima, Sep. 24 (EMN): The Naga Students' Federation (NSF) on Monday drew the attention of the advisor to School Education KT Sukhalu to what it stated were discrepancies in government schools. The NSF has demanded corrective measures or action by October 24. The students' organisation submitted a representation addressed to the legislator on Monday.

Addressing a press conference NSF president Kesosul Christopher Ltu said that the anomalies were detected by the NSF following a visit to educational institutions in various districts during different occasions.

The main issues raised by the NSF include implementation of the Mid-Day Meal (MDM) Scheme; and issues concerning school uniforms, infrastructure; composite schools and implementation of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act of 2003 (Copta).

MDM scheme: During the visit in 2017, the federation said to have noted the failure in the implementation of the scheme; students were deprived of their benefits. Ltu said that the issue was highlighted to the chief minister, which was then taken to the State Vigilance Commission for investigation into irregularities and mismanagement. He lamented that despite a lapse of one academic session, the irregularities were still taking place this year.

""For the academic year 2018, most of the schools were not provided MDM and many schools were supplied with only 'dal' (dried, split pulses) and cooking cost without supply of any other commodities,"" the student leader pointed out. It compelled the school managements to sell afew bags of 'dal' to purchase rice and other commodities to provide meal to the students. It was learnt that the NSF had written to the State Vigilance Commission on August 21 last to expedite the investigation process, and to produce the report by 30 days. It also asked the commission to investigate discrepancies in MDM for the year 2017 and 2018, advocating that strict and effective disciplinary measure should be initiated against offenders in the implementing agencies.

With the passage of the 30-day mark, the NSF had a meeting with the Vigilance department officials, wherein, the latter was stated to have proposed for three months' time to complete the process. Towards this, Ltu said the NSF will take a call only after consultation with its federating units.

Free uniforms: The NSF has said that there was shortage and delay in supply of the school uniforms including trousers, skirt and shirts. ""Most of the schools were issued with only sweater and a pair of socks, all of which were of the same size, and could not fit even students from the lower primary classes,"" the federation lamented.

In several schools, Ltu said, students were given just cloth materials of 'compromised quality', and without stitching cost. ""It is imperative to mention that the cloth materials supplied were of the lowest quality,"" he said.

The NSF had written to the chief secretary on September 4 regarding the issue of school uniforms, and sought measures from the government within 15 days. Interestingly, the department of School Education was said to have replied to the letter on September 24, the day the NSF submitted its representation to the legislator in-charge of the department. The department simply stated that 'the government has decided to refer the matter to the State Vigilance Commission for necessary action'.

The student body also raised the issue of deteriorating infrastructure of most of the government schools. It highlighted that most of the classrooms and staff rooms in the government schools were in dilapidated conditions, and the schools, since their inception, have not received any funds for repair and renovation. Some of the schools were built in 1940s and were still running under the same structure, Ltu maintained.

The organisation also expressed concern that it was found through records from the government schools that no official inspection were being undertaken by the department, respective district education officers (DEO) and sub-divisional education officers (SDEO).

""This negligence of duty from the government officials is one of the factors mainly responsible for the untold hardships being faced by the schools and students and for low performance of students in their academics,"" the NSF stated in its representation. Stating that there was a gap between the schools and the department, NSF leaders were of the view that instead of just reviewing the performance of government schools in HSLC, department and government need to review and assess the schools and students by carrying out physical visitation and verification.

The federation also pointed out that the government has initiated to merge few schools together under one administration in the form of 'composite school.' However, with the lack of infrastructure in almost all the government schools, it felt this exercise will not serve its purpose as intended without upgradation of the present infrastructures.

Meanwhile, reminding that the Copta (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) being enacted and enforced, the NSF maintained it was imperative to put it in order. It informed that many shops within the given perimeters were detected selling banned tobacco products and demanded that the respective district administration should strictly monitor the strict enforcement of the act.

The student body asked the advisor for School Education to initiate action, and inform about it within 30 days. The NSF leader asserted that the affected party being the students, they would have to step out and show their resentment in a democratic way."

In three of the recent incidents, the files related to appointments of registrars for Karnataka State Open University (KSOU), term extension for Hampi Kannada University vice chancellor and issuing some work orders for a big amount, the officials of the department had not brought the matters to the minister's notice.

Devegowda told this to The New Indian Express and conveyed the same to Public Works Department Minister HD Revanna.

The School Education Department's announcement to consider only Plus 2 marks for college admissions has evoked a mixed reaction.

While many students and schools expressed relief, teachers' associations opposed the move saying the schools may not take Plus 1 seriously.

""We're extremely happy since the prospect of taking up the boards in the new curriculum seemed daunting. Many of us were scared that if our total in the Class XI exams goes down even a bit, it will affect our chances during college admissions,"" said A. Priyadarshinie, a student from the city.

The School Education Department introduced board exams for Plus 1 in 2017 and the first batch of students who took up the exam in March 2018 secured a pass percentage of 91.3. While many schools had secured a good pass percentage, many teachers and students felt that individual scores could have been much higher.

While a number of teachers say that the new curriculum for Plus 1 introduced this year was interesting and challenging, the students found the transition difficult. Also, delays plague textbook distribution for a few subjects. ""We are yet to see the second volume of textbooks for many subjects. The faculty and students have been working hard and this announcement comes as a breather,"" said the headmaster of a school in the city.

The Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association, however, vehemently opposed the move by the government and said that it would further disadvantage students from government schools in rural areas.

""Private schools will now have a free run to teach Plus 2 portions in Plus 1 itself like before. Now, it is enough if the students merely clear the Plus 1 exams,"" said K.P.O. Suresh, State president of the association.

""Even though Plus 2 students will have a new curriculum next year and therefore can't be taught now, this will set a precedent for the future. Students in government schools who are actually taught both Plus 1 and 2 portions thoroughly will once again be left behind,"" he said.

Mr. Suresh also said that the move to not consider Plus 1 marks for admission into colleges defeated the purpose of ensuring that the students gave importance to their lessons during both years, which would have ensured that they were better prepared to handle competitive exams.

""This is unnecessary confusion for the students who are getting adapted to the changes already in place,"" he said.

N. Ramasubramanyan, correspondent, Sri Natesan Vidyasala Matriculation Higher Secondary School, said that before the compulsory Plus 1 board exams were introduced, he had appealed to the government to reintroduce the old practice of having district-level common exams in Plus 1.

""That Plus 1 board exam marks will not be considered for admissions is welcome since no other board has the system. As the Education Department has specified that students will not get their Plus 2 marksheets without clearing Plus 1, schools can't take them lightly,"" he said.

Welcoming the move, Vishnucharan Paneerselvam, correspondent, Shree Niketan Group of Schools, said that it will definitely lessen the burden and stress on the students who will be writing board exams for three successive years."

""Unfortunately, despite a number of cases being reported every month, the school education department has no concrete plan to deal with such issues...

Meanwhile, school education department officials, who started inspecting private schools since the first week of August, have not taken action against a single school. ""I have had directed the deputy inspection officers and deputy education officers to visit at least 20 private schools every month and interact with students to know about issues bothering them.

The message also applies to other students who were allotted seats through previous rounds.

The move is to ensure that every student gets a seat at a time when students are repeatedly cancelling admissions as they are unhappy with the college preference.

But a contractual worker is not fit for the job of a cook if he or she completes 40 years age. This paradox has surfaced after an odd order released by the education department regarding eligibility of cook-cum-helper being hired to warm milk under Annapurna Milk Scheme in the schools across the state.

To streamline regular supply of fresh milk to the students under the scheme, which was launched by chief minister Vasundhara Raje on July 2, the department sanctioned remuneration to hire a cook to warm milk. The Mid Day Meal Commissionerate, which works under the education department, issued an order a week back in this context allowing head of schools to hire a cook on Rs 500 per month remuneration. A separate budget for releasing the remuneration was decided to be deposited in the account of the schools.

Majority of the schools post the budget sanction, had hired cooks who are warming milk and helping the teaching staff in its distribution to the students. However, a latest order issued by the education department over the age criteria of cooks has created a complex situation for the teachers.

The order says that the school management shall not hire a cook, particularly a woman, who is 40-60 years old. Only young cook-cum-helpers in the age group of 18-40 must be hired for the work, said the order which has been released by a block education officer posted in Uniyara of Tonk district. Similar orders have been issued by the officials across the state.

This order reflects gender biases towards elderly women when it mentions that they should not be hired. ""The old women are not capable of warming milk, hence they should be removed immediately and cook-cum-helpers must be in the age group of 18-40 years only,"" reads the order.

Raje had on July 2 launched the scheme for students under which they are getting milk thrice a week. Every student of class I to V is being provided 150 ml and students of class VI to VIII get 200 ml of milk. The students are getting glass of milk immediately after the school assembly gets over.

""This is unscientific and unfair. How will the school perform better if there are no teachers? Fill the vacant posts first and then ask for better results. Besides, the average percentage of SSLC results varies in different districts. While Udupi and Dakshina Kannada perform better, Yadgir and other backward districts lag behind.

Meanwhile, teachers in government aided high schools can heave a sigh of relief after the Department of Primary and Secondary Education decided to withdraw the decision to withhold their salaries if the performance of SSLC students in their schools was poorer than the district average in the past five years.

A city school withdrew its controversial guidelines for students after the State Education Department on Thursday ordered an investigation into them.

The allegedly stringent 30-page rulebook brought out by MAEER's MIT Vishwashanti Gurukul School was contested by some parents after it mandated that girl students wear only white or beige innerwear and bloomers every day.

The rules, termed 'diktats' by protesting parents, also restricted time for washroom usage and prohibited the use of lipstick, lip gloss or any other cosmetic, as well as tattoos, for girl students. It mandated that girls wear only round studs not bigger than 0.3 cm on each earlobe and stipulated their skirts be of a certain length.

The school withdrew the rulebook after State Education Minister Vinod Tawde ordered an investigation and sent a team under Deputy Director of Education Meenakshi Raut to the institute.

The rulebook's presentation in the form of an affidavit elicited sharp criticism from parents.""While enforcing discipline is commendable, no institute ought to lay down such rigid rules,"" Mr. Tawde said, speaking in Nagpur during the monsoon session of the Assembly.

The guidelines mentioned the applicability of IPC sections 199 (false statement made in declaration), 200 (using as true such declaration knowing it to be false) and 202 (intentional omission to give information) if parents gave false information about their children.

""The rules were laid down for the security of the students. Our intention was pure; it was to avoid unpleasant incidents. We had no hidden agenda whatsoever as some parents have hinted,"" said Dr. Suchitra Karad-Nagare, Executive Director, MIT Group of Institutes. She said the institute had always welcomed dialogue with parents. ""We had hoped they would resolve the issue with us before going to the media first,"" she said.

A senior MIT official, requesting anonymity, said the rules were formulated to preclude any untoward incident involving girl students and that they were only meant to act as a deterrent.

""We have received reports where girl students complained of not being addressed respectfully by the boys. There have also been cases where students have misguided the authorities by giving wrong numbers of their wards. Are the school authorities or the parents responsible in such cases? Hence the rules,"" said the official.

However, some of the parents disputed the institute's claims. ""It read like a law book and not a rule book. How can an institution regulate a time for drinking water? The rulebook has imposed fear upon students and is a money-making exercise on the institute's part,"" said a parent, requesting anonymity. The rules levied a ₹1,500 cycle-parking fee while making helmets compulsory. Local MNS activists took up the cause, while vernacular channels decried the school's guidebook as ""a form of dictatorship""."

(Express photo) Don't wear jeans to work: Haryana to school teachersMega-chaos: 1 lakh youth reach Panchkula from all over Haryana16 new food items on Mid-Day Meal platter of students in Haryana schools

INDIAN NATIONAL Lok Dal MP Dushyant Chautala has raised questions over the recruitment of employees (C & D categories) by private agencies for the Haryana education department under ""outsourcing concept."" The party would approach court if the government did not scrap this system of recruitment immediately, the Hisar MP told mediapersons Sunday.

Dushyant said, ""As part of this process, recruitment in the education department will be done by private recruitment agencies on the basis of commission per head. Thus, ""primary schools to Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas will be covered under the new recruitment system"". As per documents, as many 19 private agencies, including four from Surat (Gujarat) were empanelled to provide employees to the government departments. The INLD MP said as many as 28,000 posts are to be filled through outsourcing policy and 3,000 of them would be recruited by these agencies for the education department. A matriculate Sanjay recruited by a Gujarat-based agency as multipurpose worker will join his duty in a government school of Hansi (Hisar) on July 2. Dushyant claimed such agencies would even recruit teachers for primary schools of the state.

""By adopting this Gujarat model of outsourcing"", Dushyant alleged, ""the Haryana government will also render the Haryana Staff Selection Commission and Employment Exchanges redundant."" When a system to recruit candidates for 'C' and 'D' category posts, that is Haryana Staff Selection Commission, was there what was the necessity of hiring private agencies for recruitment purposes, he questioned.

The Hisar MP claimed that the policy would adversely impact the equality of opportunity right to seek employment since the employees would be recruited on the basis of the will of the recruitment agency. ""It will also ignore the legal provisions that have made reservation a law to bring about social justice to the backward and the downtrodden.""

As per information received from employment exchanges under RTI Act, Dushyant said, in 12 districts of the state there were 2,62,768 registered unemployed youths. ""Of these only 290 have been provided jobs by the government, which is barely 0.1 percent of the total registered unemployed. The same RTI also informs that under the much touted scheme to provide employment of 100 hours to the unemployed youth only 9948 have been provided employment for 100 hours which is only three percent of the registered youth under the scheme,"" Dushyant said adding 'Rozgar Mera Adhikar' movement would be launched in the state to secure justice for the youths.

Haryana BJP spokesperson Raman Malik said, ""Apparently, Chautala has forgotten that the outsourcing policy has been prevalent in the state even before the BJP formed the government in Haryana, but one must not forget the saying that 'Irony dies a thousand death' especially when somebody whose head of family has been indicted by the courts and is serving a jail term for giving jobs to people of his choice or those who have been chosen for reasons well known to Haryana."""

Around 3,200 private schools who have been awaiting permanent recognition from the state's education department are on brink of getting closed in Haryana. These schools have been functional for a long time on temporary recognition issued by the education department every year but it hasn't been renewed this year after the expiry of the last one on March 31.

Getting recognition is mandatory for the private schools for getting affiliation. Schools can file for the affiliation till July 6 as directed by the board, however, they can avail an extension of 10 days by paying a late fee of Rs 5000. All options are closed after that.

In 2017, the education department had announced that it doesn't find yearly temporary recognition favourable. Therefore, committees were formed under the District Education Officer(DEO) and District Elementary Education Officers (DEFO). Also, district deputy commissioners were debarred from providing recognition. Though the committees have not been able to come up with a solution of pending recognition of these private schools.

The private school owners are anxious and urging the central government to grant them temporary recognition as soon as possible and work on their regularisation. They also were accusing BJP who had promised to grant these private schools recognition after coming into power. They have planned to meet Education Minister Rambilas Sharma and other senior officers to talk about the issue.

These 3200 private schools have not been granted recognition because they have failed to abide by the land and building related norms, according to a report by CNN-News 18. These norms specify that private schools up to class 10 should have a land of 2,000 square meters (sqm) in case of a single floor and 1,500 sq m for a two-storeyed building.

The government is considering the proposal following allegations that a few corporate and private school managements have been misusing the present Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) pattern, by giving more internal marks to their students to manipulate their GPA (grade point average).

According to officials, a final decision will be taken by the state government after studying the pros and cons of the CCE pattern.

As per CCE, a maximum of 20 marks is allocated as internal mark based on formative and summative assessments and 80 marks for the final examination of each paper. The formative assessment and summative assessment will be key in calculating internal marks. All the project works of the students and valuation by teachers are to be sent to the respective DEO offices and the schools have to upload the internal marks on the website of the school education department.

However, many schools were not uploading the Formative Assessment marks on the website properly, affecting their final marks. As there is no proper checking by the education department officials, many corporate schools are allegedly misusing the CCE system by allocating 20/20 internal marks to all students.

To overcome the issue, the education department is planning to withdraw the CCE pattern and conduct the final examination for 100 marks, just like the earlier method.

However, the proposal is not finalised yet and the department is also looking at other options.

Speaking to Express, A Sairam, DEO of Srikakulam district said, ""The department officials have asked us to send proposals and opinions for stopping the misuse of internal marks by corporate schools. We are looking at other options rather than completely avoiding the internal marks. We are also planning to implement the internal examination in a different way. A few other options are also on the cards.""

Private schools have welcomed the move.

Meanwhile, private school managements said that they are happy with the proposal and that they were against the CCE pattern right from the beginning. ""We have opposed the CCE pattern from the beginning and now the officials are alleging that we are misusing it. Not all private schools are doing that, but it's a fact that a few corporate schools are misusing it. We support the government proposal to withdraw the pattern,"" said N Srinivasa Rao, principal of Vivekananda private school."
