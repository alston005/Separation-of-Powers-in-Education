""To inculcate the spirit of nationalism in children from childhood, all government, granted and self-financed schools should instruct students of classes IX to XIII to say 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat' instead of 'Yes Sir' or 'Present Sir' during attendance,"" the notification said.

The Gujarat education minister, present at the event, took serious note of the suggestion, and two days later, the state government issued its notification.

Joshi also shared a few other ideas regarding education. ""We have introduced monthly textbooks to deal with the heavy school bag issue. There is no point carrying textbooks with initial chapters all the way until March. So we will have monthly textbooks which will work well with the students. We have also introduced bagless Saturdays. Students can design their own curriculum on these days, to study what they want to,"" he said.

Although the Uttar Pradesh basic education department has been talking about higher school enrolments, what takes away from their claims is the huge dropout rate witnessed in the state, especially at the elementary level.

Now, a primary school has decided to combat this issue in its own unique way. The school's 'Bal Sansad' is doubling up as the 'Santa squad' this festive season, conducting a door-to-door drive to get back dropouts and classmates who have been irregular.

Students of the primary school in village Lakhesar of Jaunpur district have used this Christmas to make guardians of their former classmates and other irregular students understand the importance of education. In this direction, they have also created a small informative pamphlet that urges parents to send their children to school.

Headmaster Ramesh Chandra Yadav said that one of the reasons why the dropout rate at the school was high was its location. ""The school is situated in a remote part and the terrain is tough. As a result, attendance and retention figures have been suffering.""

However, members of the 'Santa squad' are now out to change this.

Harshit of Class 5, president of the Bal Sansad, Saumya of Class 5, vice president, Vanshi of Class 4, health and hygiene minister, Anshika of Class 4, education minister, Chandni of Class 5, cultural minister and Sohani of Class 4, environment minister, have taken up the responsibility to get students back to school.

""On Christmas Day and since then, we have been going out in the afternoon, with our teachers Shivam Singh and Mukesh Dubey, to convince villagers to send their children to school,"" said Harshit and Saumya.

Chandni and Sohani added that it had been a learning experience for them as well -- convincing elders and classmates on how important it was to attend classes daily.

""In the process, the squad succeeded in bringing back12 students -- 10who had been irregular and two dropouts,"" informed Shivam Singh, teacher.

Appreciating the idea of forming a 'Santa squad', village head Nisha Tiwari has promised to help the school improve its infrastructure, including construction of better toilets and getting a projector to facilitate lectures. ""With her help, the school will soon have new and better facilities,"" said a teacher.

The headmaster said that the goal of the 'Santa squad' wasto build confidence among students and guardians, strengthen teacher-student relationship, create a positive atmosphere for promoting education, and improve student retention and attendance.

According to available data, the Net Enrolment Rate (NER) in UP at the elementary level is 79.86% -- 9 percentage points lower than the all India average of 88.94%. The state has an annual dropout rate of 8.58% at the primary level -- the 6th highest in the country and more than double the all India average of 4.13%. Also, the state's primary to upper-primary transition rate of 79.1% is the 4th lowest in the country -- 11.04 percentage points below the national average of 90.14%."

His name is Pediatric HAL.

HAL: Hi, I'm Pediatric HAL. I can show you how I feel by moving my face and my eyes.

Narrator: HAL is part of a line of medical training robots manufactured by a company called Gaumard. Gaumard makes humanlike robots that simulate childbirth, newborn care, surgery, and trauma wounds. Pediatric HAL is designed to mimic the reactions of a child around five years old. During training, doctors, nurses, and first responders all practice various simulations on HAL before treating real patients.

Narrator: In many situations, medical students practice on standardized patients who are actors faking certain symptoms, but those actors probably don't want to be stuck with a needle over and over again. Instead, students can use HAL to learn how to do more physically invasive procedures, like putting in a breathing tube or starting an IV. And because his body is programmable, HAL can show signs of poor health that an actor might not be able to mimic.

When you shine a light on HAL's eyes, his pupils may or may not dilate. Even really good actors probably can't control their pupils. And HAL actually responds to real equipment. If he starts to flatline, a nurse can use a defibrillator to shock his heart back into action. HAL also has a variety of internal motors and pumps that move air and fluids around, which help it mimic bodily functions, like breathing and using the bathroom.

Archetto: He has a small reservoir in his left finger, left middle finger, for glucose measurement. So you can take a regular glucometer and you can actually put a glucose solution in there, prick his finger, and it would give you an actual glucose reading.

Narrator: HAL also has reservoirs for holding fake urine, fake blood, and there's even one in his head for holding fake tears. We have artificial blood. It's honestly just a powder that you add water to and it creates a red fluid, but there's also urine and as I mentioned, there are tears. For tears, it's water. For urine, it's food coloring. Narrator: The educator can also modify HAL's responses on the fly. If a training team isn't working fast enough, the teacher can program HAL's software to make his blood pressure go up or his breathing get faster.

Archetto: Nothing ever goes according to plan in the emergency room or in critical care. So you may have a plan of care for a particular patient, but something changes and it all goes south in a hurry. We can make HAL respond just as a patient would be. So that's become so valuable in those learning environments.

Henry Henao: We have a concept called suspending disbelief. So it's the fact that, okay I know that it's a mannequin, it's a simulator. They know it's a mannequin and it's made of plastic and electronic parts, but they look beyond that. So we ask them to forgive the fact that it's not a real patient, and once they break through that they really start making very human connections to the patient in front of them. And they, yeah, it kind of melts away.

Narrator: People don't always communicate verbally, especially young children, and that's why HAL's creators programmed him to have these non-verbal reactions.

Archetto: When he cries, he cries real tears and that's important because, again, that's a way of communicating.

Narrator: At times, HAL's responses are so real that people respond to him like he's a human. Archetto: HAL was there and he was sitting in his bed and we made him cry, and one of the nurses, who was in attendance, reached down and actually picked him up and tried to console him. She actually hugged him. So, it does have that impact on caregivers. It makes the scenario very realistic.

HAL: My family says I'm one of the smartest kids around. I can show you how I feel by moving my face and my eyes and if you talk to me, I'll talk back."

Written by Javier C. Hernández

For months, Gu Baoluo had been looking forward to a boisterous Christmas celebration at one of China's best-known Protestant churches. He loved decorating trees, singing songs like ""Silent Night"" and watching the annual Christmas pageant recounting the birth of Jesus.

But in early December, the police shut down Gu's usual place of worship, the Early Rain Covenant Church in the southwest city of Chengdu as part of what activists said is the most severe crackdown on Christianity in more than a decade. The police confiscated Bibles, shuttered a school and seminary run by the well-known church and detained Early Rain's outspoken pastor on charges of ""inciting subversion,"" punishable in serious cases by at least five years in prison.

On Christmas Eve, Gu, 31, a rice seller, went to the only safe place to worship that he knew: a friend's home, where he recited hymns and prayed for the two dozen Early Rain members that are in detention. Fearing that he and his friends might be arrested, Gu used encrypted chat apps to share information about surveillance and harassment by the police.

""We will not forfeit our faith because of suppression by the authorities,"" Gu said.

As millions around the world gathered to celebrate Christmas, China is capping a year in which the government of President Xi Jinping has led an unrelenting campaign against unofficial churches in China, which by some estimates serve as many as 30 million people.

Xi, apparently concerned that independent worship might pose a threat to the ruling Communist Party's dominance over daily life in China, has sought to bring Christianity more firmly under the party's control. The government this year banned online sales of the Bible, burned crosses, demolished churches and forced at least a half-dozen places of worship to close.

The campaign comes as Xi, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, has worked to more aggressively control religion across China, including the detention of thousands of Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang.

Renee Xia, international director for China Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group, described the effort as targeting the ""heart of the underground Christian resistance."" The government has focused its campaign on unofficial Christian churches that promote ideas like social justice or have been critical of the party's grip on society.

""The message,"" Xia said, ""is that Xi can't be messed with.""

The crackdown has escalated in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The police this month shut down the 40-year-old Rongguili Church in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, which attracted thousands of worshippers. And in September, the authorities in Beijing ordered the closure of the 1,500-member Zion Church, one of the largest unofficial churches in the capital.

The government requires religious groups to register, though many still worship in unofficial churches, sometimes called underground or house churches.

Many in the party believe Christianity, which by some estimates is China's fastest-growing religion, promotes Western values and ideals like human rights that conflict with the aims of China's authoritarian government and Xi's embrace of traditional Chinese culture and Confucian teachings that emphasize obedience and order.

But the government's heavy-handed efforts to obliterate several high-profile churches have been met with resistance among Christians.

On Christmas Eve, the authorities posted a sign at Early Rain's former headquarters saying its 23rd-floor sanctuary had been converted into office space for the local government.

Li Shuangde, a teacher in Chengdu who has been part of Early Rain since 2011, said that church members had been asked by the authorities to sign letters stating that they no longer believe in Christianity. He said Early Rain had no choice but continue to exist in secret. ""We have moved underground,"" he said.

Members have continued to hold Sunday services, sometimes on the banks of a river near the church's former headquarters in a downtown high-rise. They have called for the release of detained leaders, including Wang Yi, the pastor of Early Rain, and his wife, Jiang Rong.

Wang, in a pre-written message released after his detention, spoke about the importance of disobedience.

""The Communist regime's persecution of the church is an extremely vicious crime,"" he wrote. ""As a pastor of the Christian church, I must strictly and publicly condemn such crimes.""

Wang had been scheduled to deliver a Christmas Eve sermon at Early Rain titled, ""The God Who Bestows Peace."" Instead, hundreds of Early Rain members on Monday scattered across Chengdu for services inside the homes of friends and relatives or at welcoming churches.

At Chengdu Xishuipang Reformed Church, a Protestant church with close ties to Early Rain, more than 100 people gathered inside a worship hall on the 16th floor of an apartment building.

A children's choir sang ""Silent Night,"" and a small Christmas tree, decorated with snowflakes, was on display near the lectern.

The anxieties brought on by the recent arrests hung over the ceremony.

""If you see the police, national security or community workers greet them with gentleness,"" Wen Hongbin, an elder at Xishuipang, told the congregation. ""If they try to grab the microphone, I ask the brothers sitting in the front row to please stop them.""

While he did not explicitly mention Early Rain, Wen asked those in attendance to remember ""those who are criminally detained."" Then he began a sermon about the meaning of Christmas and the sacrifice made by Jesus.

Since Xi rose to power in 2012, the authorities have led a sustained campaign against unregistered churches. In one province, more than 1,500 crosses were removed from churches between 2014 to 2016, according to advocacy groups.

This year, some Chinese cities have banned Christmas displays. But the government also allows some degree of celebration, in part to stimulate the economy. Here in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, Christmas trees stand side by side on city streets with propaganda posters, and music from ""The Nutcracker"" plays in the background at malls.

Officials in the United States have denounced the Chinese government's efforts to limit the spread of Christianity.

""China's Christians and other faith communities are under siege and treated as enemies of the state for daring to worship and peacefully live out their faith,"" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey said in a joint statement condemning the recent detentions.

But China's growing influence in world affairs has shielded it from some criticism.

One notably silent voice: the Vatican, which in September reached a provisional deal with the Chinese government to end a decades-old power struggle over the right to appoint bishops in China. The Vatican said it sent a delegation of leaders to China this month to work out details of the agreement, but declined to comment on the crackdown on Christian churches.

Despite Xi's efforts to expand the officially atheist party's control of worship, religious life in China is flourishing. While official figures are imprecise, experts believe there are about 60 million Christians in China, with roughly half worshipping at state-sanctioned churches and half at unofficial churches.

Independent churches like Early Rain, with more than 500 members, have attracted large followings in recent years, especially among white-collar workers seeking an escape from rampant materialism at the center of modern Chinese life.

While sermons at state-sanctioned churches are often tightly scripted, independent churches boom with searing indictments of corrupt officials and rousing calls to protect the rights of the poor.

Early Rain, which Wang founded in 2008, was among the most daring. Wang called Xi a sinner, held prayer sessions each year to mark the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989, and organized a fund to support relatives of political prisoners in China.

Gu, the rice seller, began attending services at Early Rain two years ago after finding videos of Wang's fiery sermons online. He felt Wang's concern for the poor was in line with his own view that the government was abusing workers and violating human rights by destroying their homes to make way for expensive developments. Gu was baptized last year.

""I saw injustices in society,"" Gu said. ""I saw that the government's promotion of China as a just country that enforces laws in a civilized manner was all a lie.""

Worried for his own safety, Gu recently closed his business, hoping to avoid government scrutiny. He said he has grown fearful as he has watched the police arrest his friends.

He loved decorating trees, singing songs like ""Silent Night"" and watching the annual Christmas pageant recounting the birth of Jesus.

But in early December, the police shut down Gu's usual place of worship, the Early Rain Covenant Church in the southwest city of Chengdu as part of what activists said is the most severe crackdown on Christianity in more than a decade. The police confiscated bibles, shuttered a school and seminary run by the well-known church and detained Early Rain's outspoken pastor on charges of ""inciting subversion,"" punishable in serious cases with at least five years in prison.

On Christmas Eve, Gu, 31, a rice seller, went to the only safe place to worship that he knew: a friend's home, where he recited hymns and prayed for the two dozen Early Rain members that are in detention. Fearing that he and his friends might be arrested, Gu used encrypted chat apps to share information about surveillance and harassment by the police.

""We will not forfeit our faith because of suppression by the authorities,"" Gu said.

As millions around the world gather to celebrate Christmas, China is capping a year in which the government of President Xi Jinping has led an unrelenting campaign against unofficial churches in China, which by some estimates serve as many as 30 million people.

Xi, apparently concerned that independent worship might pose a threat to the ruling Communist Party's dominance over daily life in China, has sought to bring Christianity more firmly under the party's control. The government this year banned online sales of the Bible, burned crosses, demolished churches and forced at least a half-dozen places of worship to close.

The campaign comes as Xi, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, has worked to more aggressively control religion across China, including the detention of thousands of Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang.

Renee Xia, international director for China Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group, described the effort as targeting the ""heart of the underground Christian resistance."" The government has focused its campaign on unofficial Christian churches that promote ideas like social justice or have been critical of the party's grip on society.

""The message,"" Xia said, ""is that Xi can't be messed with.""

The crackdown has escalated in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The police this month shut down the 40-year-old Rongguili Church in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, which attracted thousands of worshippers. And in September, the authorities in Beijing ordered the closure of the 1,500-member Zion Church, one of the largest unofficial churches in the capital.

The government requires religious groups to register, though many still worship in unofficial churches, sometimes called underground or house churches.

Many in the party believe Christianity, which by some estimates is China's fastest-growing religion, promotes Western values and ideals like human rights that conflict with the aims of China's authoritarian government and Xi's embrace of traditional Chinese culture and Confucian teachings that emphasize obedience and order.

But the government's heavy-handed efforts to obliterate several high-profile churches have been met with resistance among Christians.

On Christmas Eve, the authorities posted a sign at Early Rain's former headquarters saying its 23rd-floor sanctuary had been converted into office space for the local government.

Li Shuangde, a teacher in Chengdu who has been part of Early Rain since 2011, said that church members had been asked by the authorities to sign letters stating that they no longer believe in Christianity. He said Early Rain had no choice but continue to exist in secret. ""We have moved underground,"" he said.

Members have continued to hold Sunday services, sometimes on the banks of a river near the church's former headquarters in a downtown high-rise. They have called for the release of detained leaders, including Wang Yi, the pastor of Early Rain, and his wife, Jiang Rong.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

In the first press conference since the tearful confession immediately after the sandpaper-gate scandal, Steve Smith's eyes didn't well up, his voice didn't quaver, though he was awash with repentance and guilt. Addressing the media at the SCG, he admitted of ignoring something ghastly happening against spirit of the game happening right in front of his eyes.

""I don't want to know about it and I walked away. That was my chance where I could have stopped something from happening,"" he says.

From a leadership perspective that was a failure, a serious let-up, as grave an offence as partaking in it. ""Something happened out on the field and I had the opportunity to stop it at that point rather than say I don't want to know anything about it, that was my failure and I've taken responsibility for that,"" he says.

For several months, he was in a ""dark space"", though he says he has recovered. ""I'm going okay now. Initially after South Africa I was going through a bit, in a pretty dark space and had some tough days but they are few and far between now. Still have my moments, ups and downs, but I'm going okay and heading in the right direction,"" he says.

Advertising

Moving on wasn't easy, but he had people around him to offer emotional support, and he found solace in turning up for his childhood club, Sutherland Cricket Club in Sutherland, a suburb in Southern Sydney. It was former cricketer Stuart Clark, one of the committee members of the club, who suggested him to turn for the club sometime in July, and Smith didn't think twice.

ExplainedWhy IPL is a boon for Smith

The back-to-back scheduling of IPL and World Cup in England has thrown up interesting situations. Most boards have asked their players to limit their IPL stint since they want them to be fresh for cricket's most celebrated tournament. But for Steve Smith it's different. Banned after the sandpaper gate for a year, Smith will return to international cricket in March next year. So the IPL in April-May provides him the perfect opportunity to face a variety of bowlers from across the world and find his feet again. No net session, or any pre-World Cup camp, could have given him such comprehensive work out. Pressure-packed T20 match situations, while playing for Rajasthan Royals, will help him to hit the ground running at the World Cup.

There was a decent smattering of crowd when he first walked in, and the sight of club captain Chris Williams eased his nerves. ""I remember him as a young boy, in fact I'm the only player around when he started his career. I just took him to the nets and made him face the young bowlers. There was not much of a chatter, as the best way to make him feel comfortable was to make him bat, put him in the natural habitat,"" he says.

Williams is a physical education teacher at Liverpool Boys High School, and his motley crew includes sales representatives, personal trainers, school students, council staff and cricket coaches. ""They are of course overawed, but I tell them to give him his space, not to ask too cricketing tips or any naughty questions to ruffle him up. It's tough to ruffle him anyway, for he's a very loveable bloke,"" he says.

Williams's own popularity has spiralled since Smith joined the club. ""Back in the school, all the kids wanted me to get his autograph, want to know what we converse, and what he likes, eats, and little things like that. Once I took them for a match we were playing and he patiently answered all their queries.""

Some of his friends taunt Williams, like asking whether he's still the captain, does he feel nervous when setting the field, whether he instructs him how to bat, and if Smith will pick him for Australia when he returns. ""I tell, look I have known him since he was 15-16, and he's still much the same, humble and hard working. His knowhow of the game has considerably benefited us, and of course our matches draw a lot of crowd these days,"" he says, though he admitted feeling a little odd to deputing him in fine-leg and third man.

In the very first match itself, Smith scored an 85 though they lost to Mosman Club by three wickets in a tense match. ""Scott Rodgie who took his wicket was over the moon and I think he took the ball home,"" he says. A undreamt of souvenir for a club cricketer. A lifetime of bragging rights too.

The big fixture, though, was against Randwick Petersham, the one featuring David Warner. In attendance at the Coogee Oval, Randwick's home ground, was Steve Waugh, whose son Austin is Smith's club mate. Randwick's coach Greg Small says it was the biggest turnout he'd ever seen at the venue. ""People were watching from everywhere, pushing each other for space. I was expecting crowd but not to this extend. You have to go back to the 70s to find a similar crowd at a time when international matches were rare."" he says.

However, both star attractions failed to ignite the mood; Warner made 13, Smith was slightly better, falling two short of his half-century. In the end, Sutherland won, thanks to Shane Watson, who crunched 63 with five sixes and Austin Waugh who took them home with an unbeaten 46.

""Smith spent a lot of time with the crowd, taking selfies and signing autographs. The cheeriness was back and we were all happy to see him in that frame of mind,"" says Williams.

In the end, Smith steered them to T20 championship triumph, the first in their history, and Smith reciprocated the affection showered on him. ""I've enjoyed playing grade cricket. We have had some success out here in T20 this year, winning the competition for Sutherland which the club got a great thrill out of and I got a great thrill out of being involved at the club,"" he says.

Around the same time, he got married to his long-time girlfriend Dani Willis and joined hands with a men's mental charity firm Gotcha4Life, propagating mental health awareness in a bid to reduce suicide tendencies (on an average six men and two women take their own lives due to depression). ""I felt very glad because good things were happening in his life. We all want good things to happen in his life because at the end of the day he's a nice bloke. We want to see him comeback to the Australian team and score hundreds like he used to,"" says Williams.

However, they will have to wait till March for his ban to end, and Smith himself is not thinking too far ahead of his return. ""I'm just moving forward day to day, doing what I need to do to prepare to hopefully get another opportunity to play for Australia and if that's the World Cup and Ashes, so be it,"" says Smith.

Smith, though, would know he would cop with a lot of sledging, especially if plays the Ashes. ""I guess one thing that I've always done pretty well when I'm playing is just blocking out exterior noise and getting on with the job at hand. No doubt the Barmy Army are loud and you can't block it out as such, but it's just about staying in your own mind and not letting those external distractions take you over and staying in the moment and just getting the job done,"" he says.

Staying away from international cricket, at his peak, would have definitely hurt him. ""If I'm honest, it's been tough at times. Particularly when the boys haven't played their best in a couple of games. It's been hard watching and knowing I can't go out there and help them,"" he says.

But he kept the afflictions of mind, if any, from his club-mates. ""He was super-composed, always smiling and helping out. He was like just another player in the team, actively involved in strategising and discussions. He seemed to enjoy it, as much as we did,"" says Williams.

Meanwhile, he committed a commercial faux pas, turning up for Vodafone advertisement, in which he's speaking to the younger generation, while apologising for the ball-tampering incident.

Some felt it was ill-timed, some reckoned there was no need for it, some others felt he was gauging his market-value, which has taken a plunge since the scandal. But he defended it: ""That ad wasn't supposed to have gone out until after I spoke to you here today, actually. They liked it so much that they wanted to launch the campaign with it. I've been working hard recently,"" he clarifies, his voice choking a bit.

Advertising

The timing of the press conference too raised some eyebrow, but if anything he might have been relieved. For, at the end of the press conference, he could even muster a smile, not with the usual from-the-heart innocence, rather a forced one.

At least, he didn't break down."

The school was invited for lunch in the village. The lunch was arranged with the elders in attendance, and the whole community present. The public (government) primary school was doing good work, led by its lone teacher, Sachin. It's his fire that had changed the school.

At the door of the house where the lunch was arranged, some of the students were told not to enter, but sit outside and eat. These children were from Dalit families. Sachin spoke to the organizers. He wanted that there be no discrimination; in the school there was none. The organizers would not let the Dalit children eat with those from ""upper caste"" families inside the house. The teacher did not relent. As the argument escalated, he decided to stop the lunch. Either all of them ate together or they would go back to the school. Frantic negotiations started among the organizers. In the end, the kids sat together.

This teacher is an exception. Even those who never discriminate between their students on any ground inside the school find it hard to take the battle out of the school. They and their students face such conflicts daily, on every dimension of prejudice and discrimination -- caste, gender, religion, poverty and more. This is not a trivial issue. We expect school education to play a crucial role in developing an equal society. But the school is fully embedded in this very world of discrimination. Teachers have to have the understanding and the courage to battle this inside the school and outside. What can support and enable the teacher, to develop this understanding, and have the tenacity to fight these battles day on day?

On a hot September evening, 53 teachers were watching the television screen showing Shyam Benegal's Samvidhan. The room in the government upper primary school was about 600 sq. ft, and sweltering. My colleague Ravi was running the third episode of the 10-part series on the screen. The full series was scheduled to be screened on 10 consecutive days. This was in a small town called Dhorimana. This is 55km from Barmer, Rajasthan.

Ravi would pause the show at crucial moments, throwing a question at the gathering. There is a particularly poignant moment when Rajkumari Amrit Kaur and Hansa Mehta discuss the depth of patriarchy that even they have to face. Ravi paused the show and asked, ""How are things today, almost 70 years after the Constitution?"" It sparked a furore. There were 10 women in the room. But the debate was not divided along the lines of gender. A few men admitted that despite progress in these 70 years, patriarchy and gender discrimination were alive, even within themselves. The discussion moved to caste and then to religion. A minority confessed to the seams of discrimination and prejudice running on all these dimensions. Ravi brought it to a close; the intention was to light a few sparks, not to conclude.

The next time he stopped was after an intense segment where B.R. Ambedkar, Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, Syama Prasad Mukherjee and others debate the right to freedom of expression. Till one man spoke, seemingly there was agreement that we had secured freedom of expression for all in the past 70 years. He said, ""What about that woman Gauri Lankesh? She was killed for expressing her views, wasn't she?"" I was surprised to hear that in Dhorimana. But it did spark a fiery 15 minutes. Ravi managed to end the session, without the intensity going down, but with no animosity remaining.

Thirty-five teachers attended the show across the 10 days on an average, with a low of 20 and a high of 58. They came because they were interested, there was no order or incentive. It was an intense 10 days of exploring the Constitution. All in the context of the reality that they live in. Much after the 10 days had ended, we asked the teachers the value of Festival of the Constitution. Understanding the Constitution was only a part of it. The real matter was the discovery of like-minded colleagues. A peer network, which could provide sorely needed support on conflict-ridden matters. This sense that there was someone close to you was a spur for action in the school and outside.

Policies and curriculum mostly enable the teacher. But that is inconsequential, when confronting all this within her community and social relationships. There are those few like Sachin who may have the inherent courage. Many of even those wilt over time. Most who would like to battle discrimination find it hard to act, even within the school.

These biases are deeply ingrained in our society. The question to ask of ourselves is: What supports the teacher (or anyone else) in her daily life in the quest for our Constitutions' ideals? There doesn't seem to be much. Most of those who battle to bring our Constitution to life, in the Dhorimanas of this country, feel alone. They need not, because they are not really alone in Dhorimana. Once they get talking, they build a coalition for the Constitution. But this has to be done, it doesn't happen on its own. We cannot await Godot, we have to do this ourselves."

Lok Sabha has reconvened. However, despite repeated request from the Speaker, MPs continued to create ruckus over Supreme Court's Rafale verdict and the latest Delhi High Court judgment on Sajjan Kumar conviction.

Six minutes into the proceedings, Rajya Sabha, where the attendance was sparse to begin with, was adjourned for the day. Meanwhile, ruckus in Lok Sabha over Rafale verdict forced a quick adjournment. Sumitra Mahajan adjourned the Lower House till noon amid slogans raised by BJP MPs demanding apology from Rahul Gandhi.

The developments in the Rafale controversy are likely to take up precedence during the proceedings on Day 5 of the Winter Session of Parliament on Monday, given that both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were adjourned on Friday because of the ruckus triggered by the Supreme Court verdict on the fighter jet deal. The top court had ruled that there were no doubts about the details of the Rafale agreements -- pricing and the government's decision-making process to come to the deal -- and that it did not need to be investigated.

In the Lok Sabha, the government has listed three bills for discussion and passing. These include The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016, which pertains to protecting the rights and welfare of transgender persons; The Consumer Protection Bill, 2018, which seeks to ensure timely redressal and settlement of grievances; and The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Bill, 2018, which seeks to develop the National Capital as an international centre for arbitration.

Depending on how the proceedings go and whether Parliament can avoid the usual ruckus that it witnesses -- more so because of the Rafale controversy this time -- the government will also try to introduce a bill to replace the triple talaq ordinance it had passed on 19 September with the aim to check the Islamic practice of instant divorce. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is expected to move The Muslim Women (Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018, to replace the ordinance brought in after the Centre had failed to pass the triple talaq bill in the Rajya Sabha in the Monsoon Session. If he does move the bill, Prasad will make a statement in the Lower House of Parliament to explain why the government passed the ordinance to ban triple talaq.

In the Rajya Sabha, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is likely to move a privilege motion against the government in the Rajya Sabha, and the Congress is expected to register a demand for the recall of the Supreme Court's verdict. The Upper House of Parliament is also expected to take up several important bills on Monday.

Either Congress MP Shashi Tharoor or BJP member Sharad Tripathi will submit a crucial parliamentary report on India-China relations will in the Rajya Sabha. Besides the military standoff between the armies of India and China in Doka la at the tri-junction of India, China and Bhutan, the report also includes the status of the border situation and cooperation between both the countries at global organisations, among other concerns.

Among the bills the Centre has listed in the Rajya Sabha's agenda for Monday is one seeking the withdrawal of a bill from the House that pertains to proposed amendments in the Nalanda University Act of 2010. The others are the National Council for Teacher Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018, The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018, and The Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, 2018, which were already passed by the Lok Sabha.

The government will also answer questions related to ministries that fall under Group 1 of the Rajya Sabha list. These include the ministries of defence, drinking water and sanitation, earth sciences, environment, forest and climate change, information and broadcasting, mines, panchayati raj, parliamentary affairs, road transport and highways, rural development, science and technology, shipping, water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation, and youth affairs and sports.

RJD moves privilege motion over Rafale issue in Rajya Sabha

Reports have said that RJD MP Manoj Jha has moved Privilege Motion in Rajya Sabha against Attorney General over Rafale issue. The controversy over Rafale deal will take precedence in Parliament as MPs will meet to start Day 5 of the Winter Session.

Parliament LATEST updates: Speaker proceeded to Zero Hour. Prem Singh Chandumajra of SAD raises the issue of anti-Sikh riots.

The bill was brought in as per the direction of the Supreme Court, retorts Prasad and said several Muslim women suffered due to instant talaq. He introduces the Bill.

Lok Sabha has reconvened. However, despite repeated request from the Speaker, MPs continued to create ruckus over Supreme Court's Rafale verdict and the latest Delhi High Court judgment on Sajjan Kumar conviction.

Six minutes into the proceedings, Rajya Sabha, where the attendance was sparse to begin with, was adjourned for the day. Meanwhile, ruckus in Lok Sabha over Rafale verdict forced a quick adjournment. Sumitra Mahajan adjourned the Lower House till noon amid slogans raised by BJP MPs demanding apology from Rahul Gandhi.

The developments in the Rafale controversy are likely to take up precedence during the proceedings on Day 5 of the Winter Session of Parliament on Monday, given that both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were adjourned on Friday because of the ruckus triggered by the Supreme Court verdict on the fighter jet deal. The top court had ruled that there were no doubts about the details of the Rafale agreements -- pricing and the government's decision-making process to come to the deal -- and that it did not need to be investigated.

In the Lok Sabha, the government has listed three bills for discussion and passing. These include The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016, which pertains to protecting the rights and welfare of transgender persons; The Consumer Protection Bill, 2018, which seeks to ensure timely redressal and settlement of grievances; and The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Bill, 2018, which seeks to develop the National Capital as an international centre for arbitration.

Depending on how the proceedings go and whether Parliament can avoid the usual ruckus that it witnesses -- more so because of the Rafale controversy this time -- the government will also try to introduce a bill to replace the triple talaq ordinance it had passed on 19 September with the aim to check the Islamic practice of instant divorce. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is expected to move The Muslim Women (Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018, to replace the ordinance brought in after the Centre had failed to pass the triple talaq bill in the Rajya Sabha in the Monsoon Session. If he does move the bill, Prasad will make a statement in the Lower House of Parliament to explain why the government passed the ordinance to ban triple talaq.

In the Rajya Sabha, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is likely to move a privilege motion against the government in the Rajya Sabha, and the Congress is expected to register a demand for the recall of the Supreme Court's verdict. The Upper House of Parliament is also expected to take up several important bills on Monday.

Either Congress MP Shashi Tharoor or BJP member Sharad Tripathi will submit a crucial parliamentary report on India-China relations will in the Rajya Sabha. Besides the military standoff between the armies of India and China in Doka la at the tri-junction of India, China and Bhutan, the report also includes the status of the border situation and cooperation between both the countries at global organisations, among other concerns.

Among the bills the Centre has listed in the Rajya Sabha's agenda for Monday is one seeking the withdrawal of a bill from the House that pertains to proposed amendments in the Nalanda University Act of 2010. The others are the National Council for Teacher Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018, The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018, and The Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, 2018, which were already passed by the Lok Sabha.

The government will also answer questions related to ministries that fall under Group 1 of the Rajya Sabha list. These include the ministries of defence, drinking water and sanitation, earth sciences, environment, forest and climate change, information and broadcasting, mines, panchayati raj, parliamentary affairs, road transport and highways, rural development, science and technology, shipping, water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation, and youth affairs and sports.

Teachers use a mobile phone and enter attendance of children on the application, which is updated in a central server. In all, 13,000 schools are linked to this application so that attendance trends can be monitored and studied, instead of piling it in registers.

The application TN Schools Attendance is facing glitches such as delay in synchronisation of attendance data, absence of database updation and server trouble. Teachers said the entered data was not getting registered in the server and there were other problems with the server too.

""While the data was getting properly marked initially, since the last two weeks we haven't been able to access the application to mark attendance,"" said a teacher from a government school in Ashok Nagar.

The application was created by the school education department's Education Management Information System (EMIS) cell.

The idea behind creating this application was to closely monitor attendance records of each student studying in government schools in cities and districts and intervene if they identify a potential dropout.

The data will be monitored by the State Project Director - Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).

""The officers, after identifying long absentee can take appropriate steps to intervene and help the child, if needed,"" said Pradeep Yadav, principal secretary to government, department of school education.

Since the data is launched on a pilot basis, officials said they were currently working on resolving all glitches, which may be done in next two months. ""If each school has five to 10 classes, with a total of 50,000 students, the server will be getting around 5 lakh hits. Initially, the server could not handle the load, we are slowly implementing changes and resolving the issues,"" said an official from SSA."
