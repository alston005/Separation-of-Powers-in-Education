Amid privacy concerns over Aadhaar, amendments have been planned in the Act, under which the government also proposes to arm the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) with more powers, similar to that of regulators, sources said.

The Aadhaar Act, at present, does not empower the body to take enforcement action against errant entities in the Aadhaar ecosystem.

Children, holding Aadhaar, will have the option of cancellation of the 12 digit biometric identifier within a period of six months of attaining 18 years of age. The consent of a parent or guardian will be must for enrolling a child, while no child will be denied any subsidy, benefits or services for lack of Aadhaar, as per the proposed changes.

The proposed amendments also make provision for 'Virtual ID' and voluntary and offline modes of using Aadhaar.

A bill to amend the Aadhaar Act, the Indian Telegraph Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act is listed for introduction in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

Besides, the government also plans to set up a UIDAI fund under the Aadhaar Act and has proposed that the authority be exempt from taxes on income.

Mooting fines for violation of the Aadhaar Act, the draft provisions say that a new section will be added to provide for civil penalties, which may extend to Rs 1 crore for each contravention on failure to comply with provisions of the Act, rules, regulations and directions by any entity in the Aadhaar ecosystem. The Aadhaar ecosystem includes enrolling agencies, registrars, requesting entities, offline verification seeking entities and any other entity or group as may be specified by regulations. It further mooted an additional penalty of up to Rs 10 lakh for each day of continuing non-compliance after the first contravention. Punishment for unauthorised access to the Central Identities Data Repository as well as data tampering is proposed to be extended to 10 years each from the current three years.

According to sources, the government is keen to give UIDAI regulatory powers, considering the fact that over 122 crore Aadhaar numbers have been issued across the country but the authority does not currently have powers to take enforcement actions against errant entities. There will be a provision to file appeal before the TDSAT (Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal), and against the orders of TDSAT an appeal can be made in the Supreme Court. The government also plans to amend the Telegraph Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to provide for voluntary use of Aadhaar for obtaining SIMs and opening bank accounts.

The Supreme Court, in a landmark verdict in September last year, had upheld the constitutional validity of 'Aadhaar' but limited the scope of the controversial biometric identity project, ruling it is not mandatory for bank accounts, mobile connections or school admissions. Holding that there was nothing in the Aadhaar Act that violates right to privacy of an individual, the SC had cleared the use of Aadhaar for welfare schemes. The court had held that Aadhaar will remain mandatory for filing of I-T returns and allotment of PAN, but struck down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act, 2016 that permitted private entities like telecom companies or other corporate to avail of the biometric Aadhaar data."

Lakhs of women lined up across Kerala's 14 districts on Tuesday to form a human wall as part of the state government's 'vanitha mathil' or women's wall. The wall was organised by the CPI(M)-led LDF government and community outfits backing its stand on the entry of women at the Sabarimala temple.

Although the wall was envisaged as a counter to the Sangh Parivar campaign against the entry of women of all ages at Sabarimala temple following the Supreme Court verdict, the CPI(M) has managed to project the event as a statement of ""progressive Kerala"".

State Minister for Health and Family Welfare K K Shailaja was the starting point of the wall in the northern Kasaragod district, while senior CPI(M) leader and Politburo member Brinda Karat stood as the concluding link of the wall at the southern tip of Thiruvananthapuram district.

The entire ruling LDF cabinet, leaders of community organisations like the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam - which represents the Hindu Ezhava community - , leaders of the Punnala Sreekumar faction of the Kerala Pulaya Mahasabha representing the SC community, and Left-aligned intellectuals, writers, thinkers, activists and actors participated in the movement.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan stated on Facebook, ""The women's wall has become the largest women movement in the country to protect their rights enshrined in the Constitution and defend the attempts to deny them gender justice. This wall is a warning to the conservative-communal forces, which try to deny women their legitimate rights and renaissance values. The women's wall has emerged as a loud announcement that Kerala women are with the progressive thought.""

However, the Opposition Congress boycotted the wall, dubbing it ""communal"" as Hindu organisations were actively involved in the campaign. BJP and upper caste Hindu organisations such as Nair Service Society also kept away from the wall. The BJP had last week lighted an 'ayyappa jyothi' across the state to the northern as a counter to the women's wall.

NSS general secretary Sukumaran Nair, who is leading the Hindu communities opposed to the entry of women of all ages to Sabarimala, said Kerala would become a ""Satan's land"" after the women wall. ""No Chief Minister can destroy traditions and rituals,"" he said.

In Kasaragod district, an attempt to disrupt the wall was reported when a group of men, allegedly belonging to BJP, set on fire a wayside grassland to prevent women from lining up along the road. Police chased them away.

At Edappally - one of the busiest traffic points in Ernakulam district in central Kerala, scores of women lined up on the side of national highway 66. While there were not many minors, there were many elderly women. Exactly at 3.30 pm, the women stood shoulder to shoulder along the entire stretch of the highway, with many wearing the traditional 'kasavu mundu'. Announcements were made over a microphone, requesting the women to not clog roads and to avoid accidents. Senior CPI(M) leadership, including district secretary CN Mohanan, former secretary P Rajeev, Politburo member M A Baby, Politburo member Subhashini Ali, and writer M Leelavathy were present. Nuns of the Jacobite faction of the Christian Church were also present.

At 4.00 pm, the women were requested to raise their hands forward and take a pledge to uphold and protect the social reform values of Kerala and to support the constitutional tenets of gender equality.

In Kochi, Christian nuns also joined the wall while in Malappuram, Muslim women trooped to streets in large numbers to stand for the wall.

Nithya, 23, who works at the IT hub of Infopark in the city, said she had come to show her solidarity with ""the government's vision of a gender equal society"".

""We have to create a new generation that's well aware of our state's rich social reform movements and what they stand for. We have to fight against blind traditions and superstitions,"" she said.

Elizabeth, a school teacher and a member of the Left-backed Kerala State Teachers Association, said the movement was an important marker of female empowerment at a time when the women's right to pray has been violated by male-dominated protests at Sabarimala. ""Viswasam ulla sthreekal keranam (Those who have belief in the deity must be able to enter and pray),"" she said. ""It's a Supreme Court order and the Kerala government has to follow it. The government is handling it in a mature manner. Some political organisations are playing games by making women stand in front.""

At the same time, some participants could not rationally explain why they were there. It was evident that they had been mobilised by community organisations for the sake of building a crowd.

There were also those who took contradictory positions.

Ani, a housewife, said she came for the programme to stand for the rights of women. ""But in the Sabarimala issue, we are on the side of belief (which bars women of menstruation age),"" she said. Her friend Sarada, agreed.

Shortly after the women's wall disbanded, 91-year-old M Leelavathy - one of Kerala's most admired and respected literary critics and writers - underlined in a short speech at a public meeting that gender equality must not remain restricted to cultural and social spheres.

""There must be changes in the political sphere too,"" she said. ""For example, there's a women's reservation bill in Parliament. It advocates 33% reservation for women in Parliamentary constituencies. But I ask, why 33 per cent? Why not 50 per cent? After all, women are half of the country's population. Political leaders must ensure that they pass the bill, ' she said.

Subhashini Ali in her address said she felt wonderful to see scores of women from one end of Kerala to the other upholding principles of equality.

""Many extreme reactionary voices have been speaking on behalf of women in Kerala for the last few months. They have been trying to tell people 'women want this, women don't want this'. Today, lakhs of women have come here to say that you don't need to speak on our behalf. We can speak for ourselves. We want our rights, our equality and we have to move forward. They are telling these people that we have rejected their regressive traditions,"" she said."

On test is the mettle of India's democracy.

Written by Harsh Mander and Abdul Kalam Azad

When the sun went down on 2018, the doors closed for one million residents of Assam who were unable to file their claims to prove that they are Indian citizens. The claims of the three million who were left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) will now be examined by the Foreigners' Tribunals.

Assam, meanwhile, continues to battle the throes of a uncertain tumult. Through a complex and tortuous process with no parallels in any other part of the country -- and few if any in the world -- millions of Assamese residents were called upon to produce documents that prove that they are Indian citizens.

It is not often remembered that not just Punjab and Bengal, but also Assam, was partitioned in 1947, when after a referendum, Sylhet district was transferred from Assam to Pakistan. Migration from Sylhet and other parts of Bengal to Assam had continued until then for two centuries, fuelled by land-hunger and the attraction of creating farm-lands in the vast virgin forest tracts and river islands, and encouraged by the state. The cataclysms of Partition and the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 spurred fresh migrations into Assam.

From the late 1970s, a sporadically violent movement against ""foreigners"", by people who saw themselves as ""original inhabitants"", rocked the state. The current updating of the NRC is in fulfilment of the agreement reached by the agitators with the Union government, that persons who migrated after 1971 would be identified and deported.

The Supreme Court in 2007 ruled that it was not the duty of state agencies which charged a person with being a foreigner to prove their claim. Instead, it was for those who claimed citizenship to prove that they were citizens. This turned on its head natural law that a person is innocent until proved guilty. Resultantly, impoverished and often unlettered people were required to garner official documents -- such as of birth certificates, land-ownership and voters' lists -- to establish their citizenship credentials. The majority of indigent rural people anywhere in the country would be unable to prove their citizenship because birth-certificates were rare; many did not attend school and migrated for work or were married as children; land records are poorly maintained, and in any case, many are landless, or unrecorded tenants or encroachers on government land; and voters' lists are replete with omissions. The underlying chauvinism of the process was exposed also by official orders, again ratified by the SC, which exempted ""persons who are originally inhabitants of the State of Assam"" from any ""further proof or inquiry"" for automatic inclusion in the NRC. The ""original inhabitant"" is nowhere defined, but in practice original inhabitants are taken to exclude people who speak Bengali, Nepali, Hindi or Santhali, even if they have lived in Assam for generations.

The labyrinthine NRC authority is not the only agency empowered to identify non-citizens in Assam. In fact, three parallel processes, mostly dependent on low-level bureaucratic and police discretion, run side by side in what poet Manash Bhattacharjee aptly describes as the ""sniffer-dog"" idea of the state, hunting down ""foreigners"".

One of these ""sniffer-dog"" processes began in 1997 when, on the pretext of extensive revision of electoral rolls, the Election Commission, without any due process, marked 3.70 lakh voters as doubtful, or ""D-voters"". This stripped them of voting rights, and their cases were referred to the Foreigners' Tribunal. Election officials continue to identify persons they regard to be ""doubtful"". The Assam Police Border Organisation deputes police officials in many police stations who also identify people they regard to be possibly non-citizens, and refer their cases to Foreigners' Tribunals.

People who don't speak Assamese, and are not from indigenous tribes, are in this way beleaguered from all sides. They do not know when challenges to their citizenship may come, from the NRC executives, election officials or the local policeperson. In 2006, the Police Border Organisation referred Ajbahar Ali, a small farmer in Kheluwapara village in Bongaigaon district of western Assam, to the Foreigners' Tribunal. When he answered the summons from the tribunal he learnt that the tribunal in an ex-parte judgement had already declared him a foreigner. He was whisked away from the tribunal directly to a detention centre inside a jail. His wife Balijan Bibi sold their farmland, cattle and the only cell-phone they owned to pay a lawyer to challenge the order to get her husband released from detention. Their older son, Moinul Haque, travelled to the Guwahati High Court to hear the judgment, while his mother waited anxiously at home for his news. He returned the next morning only to inform his mother that the court has rejected their plea. Balijan Bibi didn't speak much, just asked her son to take rest. After a while, he found her hanging from the ceiling.

Months later, our Karwan e Mohabbat team visited their family. The children's father was in a detention centre with no prospect of his release, their mother was dead, and their land and all they owned sold. There are at least 28 suicides of people who had lost hope of proving that they were citizens of this country, and found no reason to live.

This is the collective tragedy of millions of religious, linguistic and ethnic minorities in Assam. No light is visible even in distant horizons, because the Union and state governments are silent about what the fate will be of those who in the end are declared to be foreigners? Over a thousand are housed indefinitely in hellish detention centres, in flagrant violation of constitutional guarantees and international law. But if the numbers tomorrow run into possibly millions, where will they be detained?

The Indian government is not even negotiating an extradition treaty for the return of these persons with the Bangladesh government. If they are to continue to live in India as non-citizens, are we not manufacturing a Rohingya-like situation, forcing people to live without rights or security in the country which refuses to own them?

At stake, however, is not just their destinies. On test is the mettle of India's democracy, its sense of justice, its inclusiveness and its humanity.

Besides such attempts to make this language weaker, what shocked the cultural fraternity was the assassination of veteran journalist and Rising Kashmir founder, Shujaat Bukhari- whose immense contribution is well known in cultural circles. Bukhari was not the only renowned journalist but an avid language activist -- who tried his best to save cultural identity of Kashmiris at several world forums.

The attack on our native language bought together cross-sections of people including our literati to raise their voices and organize demonstrations to get their voices heard.

Rising Kashmir gathered some of the events which surprised the Kashmiris and triggered anger among the masses.

Removal of Kashmiri translations from Bhasha Sangam

Ministry of Human Resource and Development first withdrew Kashmiri translations from its language-promoting portal -- Bhasha Sangam -- after Kashmiri Pandits objected to the version of the language it put out.

The Valley-based Kashmiri literary circle ridiculed the MHRD move to remove Kashmiri translations from its language-promoting portal -- Bhasha Sangam and called it a direct attack on ""Kashmiri identity"".

The Valley-based experts of Kashmiri language condemned and expressed displeasure over the move.

Banning Pheran

A controversy erupted in Kashmir following an order banning the use of the pheran, a key part of traditional Kashmiri attire. The order was originally meant for the state secretariat in Jammu and Kashmir.

In September, the General Administration Department of the Civil Secretariat in Srinagar asked government officials to ""be attired in proper formal dress while appearing before any court of law and while attending offices in the State of Jammu and Kashmir and strictly avoid casual or party attire"".

The decision was a security directive. However, the zonal education officer (ZEO) in Langate, following the civil secretariat directive, issued an order last week banning the pheran in educational institutions.

After facing widespread criticism, the school department, later, retracted the order.

Removal of Kashmiri programmes from Kashir channel

Scores of Srinagar based artists registered protests against what they call as ""extinction"" of Kashmiri programmes from Doordarshan's Kashir channel.

The protesting artists -- including freelance producers, directors, singers, actors and professionals associated with production and among others affiliated with the profession.

The artists, who are affiliated with Doordarshan from decades, lashed out at the government and said that there was an ""onslaught"" on Kashmir language as well as on their livelihood as Prasar Bharti wasn't producing any Kashmiri programmes for which the channel was launched.

The channel was launched in 2000 with an aim to cater to the Kashmiri population and also keeping in view the promotion of local talent.

Unfortunately, the artists have not been given an opportunity to work from a decade now.

The artists said the irony is that the channel has been turned into a ""money minting machine for Mumbai-based producers whose flop movies are run at a prime time while local artists suffer.""

They asked the authorities to restore the Kashmiri content on the DD Kashir channel.

Protest to save the dying ""mother tongue""

Scores of the people associated with Kashmiri Language Union (KLU) including students of Kashmiri language department asked the government to save the dying ""mother tongue"" of the place.

""The Kashmiri language is dying and we are losing our identity day by day,"" shouted protestors at Press Enclave Srinagar.

Besides raising slogans like ""Kashrin Henz Pehchan, Kashir Zaban Kashir Zaban (The identity of every Kashmiri is Kashmiri langue, Kashmiri language), the protestors asked governor administration to make this language compulsory at the higher secondary level in all educational institutions.

They appealed the administration including Director of School Education Ghulam Nabi Itoo to implement the order Via 333 edu of 2017 which states that mother tongue of Jammu and Kashmir (Kashmiri, Dogri and Bhudhi) should be made compulsory till higher secondary level throughout the state including Chenab valley.

Announcements in the Kashmiri language stopped at Srinagar Airport

The Airport Authority of India (AAI) stopped making important announcements in the Kashmiri language at Srinagar airport.

AAI had recently announced that the Kashmiri language would be used in their daily announcement at the airport, the move was also welcomed by locals.

As per the frequent flyers, the announcements in the Kashmiri language have been stopped for unknown reasons.

They complained that announcements are made in Urdu and English languages only and the Kashmiri language was not used.

This move has fumed many flyers, who blamed AAI for the step-motherly approach towards the Kashmiri language.

""Many travelers don't understand Urdu and English language. Why authorities have stopped making announcements in the Kashmiri language,"" said one of the passengers.

A revival of Kashmiri Music

The Kashmiri music was back on the track as it became popular among the youngsters.

In 2018, the videos of youngsters singing traditional Kashmiri songs were making rounds on the social media.

Young and professional singers reviewed traditional music by giving it a new feel. The new Sufi music, playing the traditional instruments like Rabab was trending.

The new music trends in local Folk and Sufi music helped in the restoration of the pristine glory of Kashmir language.

Besides, Kashmiri chaker, Rouf, Wanwon and Sufi lyrics also gained popularity among the masses."

The court made the observation while quashing a criminal case registered against Rajan, teacher of Narayana Lower Primary School, Nallur, Kozhikode, for jabbing on the shoulders of a Class II student.

Allowing the petition filed by the teacher, Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan observed that courts had taken a view that when a student was sent by his parent or guardian to a school, ""the parent or guardian must be deemed to have given an implied consent to the child being under the discipline and control of the school authorities and to the infliction of such reasonable punishment as may be necessary for the purposes of school discipline or for correcting him"".

However, the nature and gravity of the corporal punishment inflicted by a teacher would determine whether he/she could be proceeded under the penal provisions.

""If the teacher, out of unbridled fury, excitement or rage, inflicts injuries which are of such a nature as to cause unreasonable physical suffering or harm to the child, the same cannot be condoned on any ground or on the principle of express or implied consent,"" the court added.

The judge also pointed out that a school teacher, in view of his peculiar position, had the authority to enforce discipline and correct a pupil.

The courts had also taken the view that it could be assumed that when a parent entrusted a child to a teacher, he/she on his/her behalf impliedly consents for the teacher to exercise such authority over the student.

The position of a teacher vis-a-vis a student was peculiar in nature and only when he inflicted such harm which was unreasonable and immoderate that he/she would be liable to be proceeded against in a criminal court.

The petitioner contended that he was in the process of teaching the child the nuances of mathematics and to make her alert, he jabbed on her shoulders.

""Two women living under Rath Police Station area of Hamirpur came to my office on Friday, and married each other by garlanding one another,"" sub-registrar Ramkishor Pal said.

In September, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court decriminalised gay sex and partly struck down Section 377 as violated the right to equality. The law, however, doesn't allow same-sex marriage.

Daya Shankar Tiwari, the lawyer for the 21-year-old, said registrar RK Pal refused to register their marriage since there is no government law for the same.

He said his client is the daughter of a government school teacher, while the 26-year-old is the daughter of a labourer. Both married on their own wish, the lawyer said.

""But in the Sabarimala issue, we are on the side of belief (which bars women of menstruation age),"" she responded smiling. Her friend, Sarada, also from the same neighborhood, laughed and nodded.

Shortly after the women's wall disbanded, at a public meeting, 91-year-old M Leelavathy, one of Kerala's most admired and respected literary critics and writers, underlined in a short speech that gender equality must not remain restricted to cultural and social spheres. ""There must be changes in the political sphere too,"" she said.

""For example, there's a women's reservation bill in Parliament. It advocates 33% reservation for women in parliamentary constituencies. But I ask, why 33%? Why not 50%? after all, women are half of the country's population. Political leaders must ensure that they pass the bill,"" she said.

Subhashini Ali in her address said she felt wonderful to see scores of women from one end of Kerala to the other upholding principles of equality.

""Many extreme reactionary voices have been speaking on behalf of women in Kerala for the last few months. They have been trying to tell people, 'women want this, women don't want this'. Today, lakhs of women have come here to say that you don't need to speak on our behalf. We can speak for ourselves. We want our rights, our equality and we have to move forward. They are telling these people that we have rejected their regressive traditions,"" she said."

Gowsalya, who has recently positioned herself as an anti-caste crusader swearing allegiance to Periyarist-Dravidianist-Marxist movement, married Parai (a traditional drum instrument) artiste Sakthi at the Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam office in Gandhipuram early last month (19 December).

The marriage was touted by activists and a section of media as the ""triumph and assertion"" of Periyarist-Dravidianist-Marxist movement against the regressive and feudalistic cultural practices of Tamil society.

Conducted as a 'self-respect' marriage ceremony, the couple vowed to annihilate caste in society and fight for emancipation of women as part of their commitment to ''Periyarist' values. The marriage was conducted at the Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam's head office in Coimbatore with Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam leader Kolathur Mani, Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam general secretary K Ramakrishnan and an assorted gathering of political parties and activists in attendance.

Basking in the media coverage, the newly wed couple claimed that they would provide succour for inter-caste couples and those who married for ""love"". ""Periyarist, Ambedkarist and Marxist people working for the welfare of society can always come to our house to work for the people,"" they claimed.

Within hours of their much publicised marriage, several serious allegations against Sakthi started doing the rounds in social media. He was accused of cheating a Chennai woman by impregnating and abandoning her. Sakthi was also accused of sexually harassing many girls who were his students in the music school he was running. It was also alleged that Gowsalya, along with Sakthi, was part of an effort to persuade the deceived woman to terminate her pregnancy in lieu of a financial settlement.

The couple was accused of staging their marriage as an act of ideological grandstanding to further their career prospects as activists.

As the allegations gained considerable credence, in a damage-control exercise, social activist Thiyagu (who himself was accused by highly acclaimed Tamil lyricist Thamarai of abandonment) and Kolathur Mani began an inquiry into the allegations against Sakthi.

The inquiry established that the charges against Sakthi were indeed true. Sakthi was ordered to apologise before the gathering of movement elders belonging to Periyarist- Dravidian movement, while Gowsalya was asked to express regret for failing to condemn Sakthi's act. Sakthi was also ordered to stay away from playing Parai for six months and a fine of 3 lakh rupees was imposed.

Reacting to the verdict in a Facebook post, Gowsalya claimed that she had no role to play in persuading the woman duped by Sakthi to terminate her pregnancy. She, however, acknowledged her mistakes pointed out by the 'court'.

The New Indian Express quoted legal experts who pointed out that the entire process of inquiring and delivering judgment by movement ideologies was illegal. A retired judge opined that even a judge could not arrive at a conclusion and find the truth in personal cases.

Gowsalya, who hails from the powerful Thevar community, had married Shankar, a Dalit youth of Udumalpet in Tirupur district, in 2015. In early 2016, the couple was knifed by a three-member gang close to the Udumalpet town bus stand. Shankar succumbed to his injuries while Gowsalya survived."

While illegal activities have covered up the existence of a lake there, activists and residents say there is a clear violation of a 1999 High Court order.

The High Court had directed the state government not to convert Jaraganahalli Tank into layouts. The court papers observed by City Express reveal that not only the order of allowing water to be collected in the tank was violated, but also there was nothing that was done to prevent garbage dumping and sand lorries to be parked on the tank bed. A member of Save Yelachenahalli Lake campaign, Aleem said not just hutments, even bungalows have come up on the erstwhile lake. ""If we go by the map, it clearly shows the extent of the lake. The Storm Water Drain (SWD) was also encroached,"" he said.

Another resident who did not wish to be named said the garbage dumping was stopped after a fence was put up by the residents to prevent dumping. ""More than '1 lakh was spent on putting up that fence. The lake needs to be revived and protected from such illegal encroachers,"" the resident said.

""According to the pahani (land records), it is a water tank and not a lake which was given to a bank association along with the nearby land. Some portion of the land belongs to a government school. Now that it is a developed area, it has become difficult to assess the dimensions of the lake. A survey is needed. But the BBMP is in charge of the water tank,"" said a source.

Another document in 2008 shows a Tahsildar's report stating that the land has indeed been encroached, though the report does not claim that it is illegal. ""The village map and the BDA survey map also prove that there is a lake,"" said Aleem. The documents reveal that over four acres of barren land on the lake bed has been encroached, though transfer of such land is illegal.

Given the increasing traffic on this important highway, civil work for the road-widening project will begin in January 2019. The project is expected to be completed in two-and-a-half years. Work includes construction of nine major bridges, 44 minor bridges and four road over bridges.

Yeddyurappa to move to national scene?

The state unit of the BJP is likely to get a new president. If sources in the party's Central leadership are to be believed, BS Yeddyurappa will be replaced by a younger state president. Yeddyurappa could be elevated to a national position, to make way for young blood at the state level. CT Ravi, R Ashok, Ananth Kumar Hegde, Nalin Kumar Kateel, Aravind Limbavali, Shobha Karandlaje and Prahlad Joshi are probable alternatives.

Women can breathe easy

Bengaluru police have a plan to upgrade police stations as part if its efforts to improve women's safety further. Additional Commissioner of Police (East) Seemanth Kumar Singh said new schemes will be introduced under the Nirbhaya Fund of '667cr. Several police stations and special counselling centres for women will be upgraded. CCTV cameras and helpline numbers will be monitored effectively.

Finally, ring road will encircle IT CITY

The '17,000-cr project, spread over four years, will finally begin to take shape in 2019. The Karnataka Cabinet has agreed to fund land acquisition for the project, taking the first step towards better connecting the existing NICE Road from Tumakuru Road to Hosur Road, completing the circle around the city.

Aero India stays in Namma Ooru

The premier air show will be held from February 20 to 24 in Bengaluru. After the Defence Ministry delayed announcing the venue for the premier event well in advance, unlike previous editions, there were rumours that the show could be shifted out from IT City to Lucknow. Experts believe this could affect the turnout of companies for the biennial event.

Namo-Raga fireworks to light up political sky

The largest democracy in the world will choose its new government with the Lok Sabha elections in April-May 2019. After a landslide victory in 2014, BJP hopes to retain power. The Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, is hammering out a united alliance to take on the Modi-Shah juggernaut. Will Rahul's David be able to take down Modi's Goliath? That's the crux of Battle 2019.

M'luru Pumpwell Flyover to see the light of day

After missing countless deadlines, work on Pumpwell Flyover on NH-66 in Mangaluru city is likely to be completed in 2019. The delay has hit citizens hard by way of frequent traffic jams. First, it was attributed to a delay in handing over of land. Also, faulty design reportedly delayed work. However, work has gained pace over the past few weeks, and is most likely to be completed in 2019.

A lighter burden for schoolkids

In 2019, children across the country will carry lighter bags on their shoulders. Following the order issued by the HRD Ministry, the state Education Department is preparing guidelines to implement the same. Recommendations on weight limit for school bags were drawn up by an expert committee, based on a survey conducted among school kids. The weight of the bag will be in proportion to the age of the child and class.

Making roads safer across Karnataka

In 2017, Karnataka continued to remain fourth in the total number of road accident fatalities in the country. As many as 10,609 people died across the state, only 524 fewer than the previous year. The Road Safety Authority, a long-pending initiative on the lines of a similar body in Kerala, is expected to take shape in 2019. The state government is currently in the process of framing its rules.

Mahamasthakabhisheka at Dharmasthala

The Mahamasthakabhisheka, that happens

once in 12 years, will be held at Dharmasthala in Dakshina Kannada district from February 9 to 12 in

2019. The event is expected to attract thousands of devotees, and the temple town is preparing for the grand event. The state government has assured that it will complete all road works leading to Dharmasthala before the event."

This article is part of Inc42's special year-end series -- 2018 In Review -- in which we will refresh your memory on the major developments in the Indian startup ecosystem and their impact on various stakeholders -- from entrepreneurs to investors. Find more stories from this series here.

""The value of an idea lies in the using of it."" -- Thomas Edison

The cup of ideas runneth over in the Indian startup ecosystem. A good idea is the genesis for any successful startup, but sometimes just having a good idea is not enough.

According to the findings of a survey by the Institute for Business Value and Oxford Economics, 90% of India's startups fail within the first five years. It added that the lack of pioneering innovation is the major reason for the failure of Indian startups -- in essence, they are copycats of startup ideas of the West, the study said.

Turns out, almost half of the Indian startups are actually not needed at all.

It is the absence of scalable ideas that makes 9 out of 10 Indian startups sink like lead balloons, despite the best intentions of founders and investors. The lack of originality is clear from this caveat -- Despite being the third largest startup ecosystem after US and China, the number of international patents India has applied for in 2015-16 was only 1,423 whereas Japan's count stood at 44,235, China at 29,846 and South Korea at 14,626.

This shows the clear mismatch between the number of startups mushrooming and the extent of innovation in the country compared to others.

As per Inc42's The State of The Indian Startup Ecosystem 2018 report, more than 10K Indian startups have shut their operations so far.

While failure is a hard pill to swallow, it is also a great teacher. For a startup founder, there is no bigger disappointment than seeing the product of their efforts come to nought. However there is also the flipside -- if you've never failed, you'll never know what works.

With 2019 just a couple of days away, we at Inc42 have compiled a list of the biggest failed Indian startups of the year. As late-night talk show host, Conan O'Brien said, ""Through disappointment one gains clarity and with clarity comes conviction and true originality""

Just Buy Live connected retailers to buy goods directly from brands across multiple categories such as food, drinks, personal care, auto, smartphones, fashion, stationery, etc. The startup also offered an unsecured credit lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to facilitate the transaction on its portal and provide working capital to small retailers. In August 2017, the startup raised $100 Mn (INR 699.25 Cr) Series B funding from a Dubai-based investment firm, Ali Cloud Investments.

Why it failed

Various reports claim that Just Buy Live may have shutdown due to an unscalable business model and negative cash flow. As per Entrackr's report in March this year, Just Buy Live's cofounder said that the company has temporarily been shut down and would resume operation after raising fresh funding. Its website is currently down.

Shotang was a business-to-business (B2B) online marketplace that connected retailers, distributors and manufacturers to discover, transact and manage their business online using their platform. Its main products were mobiles and apparel. It earned revenue through commissions paid by distributors per transaction.

Why it failed

At its peak Shotang had a $40 Mn (INR 279.7 Cr) market valuation. It had last raised $864K (INR 6.8 Cr) from Patamar Capital in February this year, and $5 Mn (INR 35.94 Cr) from Exfinity Venture Partners in December 2015. Techcircle cited an anonymous person saying that the money it last raised was ""primarily meant to pay off creditors, employees, partners. It tried but failed.""

It is likely that the business was forced to scale down its operation amid fierce competition from the likes of Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm Mall.

PortDesk provided an e-procurement software solution for logistics management for port-related operations such as accounting, cash management, ports DA estimate and voyage, layout and contract management.

Why it failed

In June this year, it was reported that PortDesk has shutdown its business, however, the reason is still unknown. Only a year earlier, the startup had raised $2 Mn (INR 13.98 Cr) in a seed funding round from a Singapore-based maritime services company, Alphard Maritime Group. The startup's founder Pushpit Pallav was not reachable for comments.

Undoubtedly India's largest crypto exchange, Zebpay (till its closure) enabled users to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, and Litecoin, or to purchase airtime and gift cards. According to its website, it had over 3 Mn users.

Why it failed

Zebpay decided to down its shutters in the aftermath of the circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 6 April 2018, restricting banks and regulated payments companies from extending any services to crypto exchanges and wallets.

Many Indian cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as crypto groups, soon knocked the doors of the Supreme Court which, after multiple hearings, has listed the matter for further hearing in January next year.

However, amid the lack of crypto rules and regulations in India, Zebpay, on September 28, 2018 announced its closure. In a statement, it said, ""At this point, we are unable to find a reasonable way to conduct the cryptocurrency exchange business."" The crypto exchange, however, continues to allow users to deposit and withdraw coins/tokens into their wallet.

Since then, the situation has only worsened -- the founders of Unocoin, another leading crypto exchange, were arrested on October 23 by Bengaluru Police over a Bitcoin ATM installation.

Not only Zebpay, a slew of exchanges including Coinsecure, BTCXIndia, MoneyTrade, Bitconnect and more shut down for various reasons this past year.

Online parenting app Babyberry helped parents of a newborn baby to provide the best possible care for their child's holistic growth and development from physical, cognitive, social to emotional growth. The app included features such as digital vaccination chart and reminders, health records management and access to the nearest doctors based on geolocation.

Why it failed

It is uncertain as to what lead BabyBerry to shutdown its operations. Its website is pulled down, it hasn't posted any feeds on its social media since October last year, nor any queries to the founders could elicit any response. In August this year, a report had cited its founder saying that the startup is currently looking to solve technical errors on the platform after many of its customers reported the glitches. Notwithstanding, the startup had raised $1 Mn (INR 6.99 Cr) in 2016 meant for product development and marketing.

MrNeeds offered consumers an online subscription-based service for the delivery of products such as milk, bread, eggs, and other grocery items. In June 2017, ET had cited Wadhwa saying that its ""per delivery costs are 50% to 70% lower than the industry standard,"" and was serving 36K monthly orders for 9K families across Noida.

Why it Failed

The startup has pulled down its website, and is mobile application is not found anymore on Google's play store. It is, however, not clear as to what lead the startup to shut its operations. It is likely that the startup closed down its shutters amid fierce competition from the likes of BigBasket, DailyNinja, and others. Inc42's efforts to reach out to the founders have gone unanswered.

Bike rental startup Tazzo was focussed on point-to-point commuting service and charged INR 5 per km. Its mobile application was integrated using GPS technology and tracked every movement of its entire fleet in real-time, including overspeeding, theft, etc.

Why it failed

TheDearth of the follow-on funding was the main reason for Tazzo to shut down its operation. In October 2016, the startup had raised about $225K (INR 1.5 Cr) seed funding from DSG Consumer Partners, but the capital-intensive nature of the sector it catered too, and the lack of funding, forced the startup to halt its operation in September this year.

Trucks and logistics platform Ezytruk connected carriers, shippers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), to enable systematic transportation of goods. It offered services such as price comparison between carriers, real-time information of the goods, warehouse space management, etc.

Why it failed

Ezytruk had raised a seed funding of $147K (INR 1.02 Cr) from Dubai-based investors Ajith Nair and Anish K in January 2017. However, the startup could not scale and grow further as it was unable to raise further rounds of funding, reported Techcircle, which ultimately led the founders to shutdown the operation this year.

B2B wholesale marketplace Wydr offered a range of products across categories like fashion, home, automotive and electronics to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. The platform allowed sellers to customise their requirements, negotiate prices, and instantly close deals. As at February 2018, the startup claimed to have added over 10K manufacturers and distributors across cities in India.

Why it failed

A report by Entrackr on November 3 cited ShopClues cofounder Sandeep Aggarwal and an early investor in Wydr as confirming the shutdown. The report said that ""the company (Wydr) was scaling down for the past three months and finally pulled the plug a couple of days ago."" An email query sent to Wydr did not elicit any response. Its official website (www.wydr.in) is currently pulled down.

Monkeybox provided Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) - approved vegetarian meals for kids in the age group of 3-18 at school. As on July 2017, the company claimed to be supplying over 1,500 meals per day to more than 85 schools in Bengaluru, with over 2K subscribers on its platform.

Why it failed

The Blume Ventures-backed foodtech startup shut down its operations amid much surprise and speculation. On one hand, the startup had been making quite a few acquisitions -- such as food delivery company 75 In A Box, juice delivery startup RawKing -- and, on the other, there was speculation that it was shutting down as it had failed to garner the required revenue to stay afloat amid fierce competition. On March 23, Monkeybox published a statement saying that ""the operation will be temporarily terminated.""

However, the termination was final. Its official website (www.monkeybox.in) was pulled down.

Apart from Indian startups that shut shop, there are some companies that ceased their operations in India after facing stiff competition and declining revenue. Here are the top top international companies whose India operations were shut down this year.

Walmart-owned ecommerce company Flipkart acquired the Indian arm of global retail company eBay in March 2017 for an undisclosed amount. Like any other ecommerce platform, eBay facilitates consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales through its website.

However, the big difference between eBay and the others is it enables trading on its platforms both in an auction or a fixed price sale. In a buyer's auction, buyers bid for a specific product and in a seller auction, different sellers bid their fixed price for a single product and the buyer chooses the best offer.

Why it failed

In May this year, eBay announced that it was ending its partnership with Flipkart and also forbade the latter to use the eBay.in brand. As the partnership ended, Flipkart migrated eBay India sellers and customers to its platform. Although being among the first players in India's ecommerce space, eBay couldn't actually rake in much revenue and faced fierce competition from Flipkart and Amazon.

As the company slowed down, and before Flipkart took over, eBay India had fired more than 350 employees from its Indian arm.

The reasons for eBay's failure in India have been many: the marketplace model was ahead of its time (eBay launched in 2005); there was no guarantee of product quality for either the buyer or the seller, and Indians never really warmed up to the idea of online auctions.

The company CEO, Devin Wenig, has announced eBay will be relaunched with a new business model in India.

The Alibaba-backed Chinese dockless bike rental company, Ofo, offered bicycles for rent on campuses and gated communities across New Delhi, Indore, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Pune, Coimbatore, and Chennai. At the time of announcing its India operations, the company claimed to have completed 1 Mn rides across seven countries.

Why it failed

Ofo's move to shut down its dockless bike renting service in India is part of company's strategy to scale down its operations in international markets, including countries such as Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, and Israel.

Ofo maintains that the move is aimed at remaining profitable. Techcrunch cited Ofo France general manager Laurent Kennel as saying that the company would focus on ""mature and promising markets"" such as Singapore, the US, the UK, France, and Italy. Moving forward, it is believed to be communicating with local markets about its plans.

Tapzo was an ""all-in-one"" app that used to aggregate more than 35 different apps in one place, across categories such as cabs, food, recharge, bill payment, news, cricket, horoscopes, and more. Tapzo's numbers were definitely impressive: 14,000 daily user base, 55K daily transactions, and an annual run rate (ARR) of INR 210 Cr in GMV/bookings.

Why It Failed

Tapzo's reduced valuation at its last funding round can be considered as a trigger towards its shutdown. Tapzo raised $1.9 Mn (INR 13.28 Cr) in December 2017 from existing investors RB Investments Pte Ltd and Ru-Net South Asia at a post-money valuation of $47.3 Mn (INR 308 Cr) -- nearly 50% less than its valuation in the previous round -- $85.54 Mn (INR 600 Cr).

Around mid of 2018, in August, the startup got finally acquired by Amazon. After the acquisition, Amazon has merged the entire Tapzo team with Amazon Pay, and it was working in the backend. Media reports said that Tapzo's founders are likely to get on board Amazon Pay's team in India.

HolaChef was a food aggregator that connected customers with chefs across the city, offering a new menu selection every day as per its website. Before shutting its operations three months back, the company was managing packaging, storage and delivery of the food.

Why It Failed

The startup was shut down around May 2018 amid a cash crunch. A media report in August has suggested that Kalaari Capital and India Quotient had already resigned from the board of directors of HolaChef earlier in the year.

With the increased dominance of players like Foodpanda, Zomato and Swiggy in the online food delivery market, investors lost interest in the startup. This was coupled with a market correction to make things worse. The last funding raised by Holachef was in February this year when it raised $28,602 (INR 20 Lakhs) in Series B round.

Foodpanda pounced on the chance, acquiring the startup for cheap -- the deal was said to fetch minimal returns HolaChef investors. For Foodpanda, the acquisition was an attempt to test waters in the cloud kitchen space, which its bigger rivals Swiggy and Zomato were already exploring.

A cursory glance at the startup shutdowns reported by Inc42 in the past three years shows that of the 32 startups that ceased their operations, most of them were from sectors such as consumer services, ecommerce, and fintech sectors. However, these sectors were among the top trending sectors in 2018, attracting investment, mergers, acquisitions, and new ventures. In fact, these are sectors that are expected to do better than all other sectors as well.

Goes to prove that it's not all about the idea, doesn't it?

What startups can learn from these stories is to buckle up their business strategy, take stock and identify even the most minuscule problems, and start rectifying them, immediately. They can also sleep on the fact that an idea -- or even market demand -- doesn't alone make a brilliant startup. It's also about execution and the right time, right place. As Edison also said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.""

Update: Holachef and Tapzo have been acquired and not shutdown as was wrongly stated in an earlier version of this article."
"27","1030436734","2019-01-01","https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/perils-and-puzzles-of-personalised-pricing","Perils And Puzzles Of Personalised Pricing","swarajyamag.com",FALSE,"When tech giants have vast amounts of personal data of consumers, they can come up with a unique price for the same commodity or service for each user.

The increased availability of private consumer data in the hands of technology companies and e-retailers offers immense potential to personalise products and services. Along with this wave comes the next big thing called 'personalised pricing'. Personalised pricing is a significant innovation that takes down the 150-year legacy of standard price tags for a good or a service.

Credit for the use of price tags goes to the retail pioneer John Wanamaker, who, in the 1870s, purchased a former Philadelphia railroad depot and started a clothing retail store. Prior to that, pricing was always individually negotiated between the buyer and seller using various forms of haggling. The price tag revolution has since then shaped consumer shopping behaviour.

If consumers of a product have their maximum willingness to pay (WTP) spread somewhere between Rs 100 and Rs 1,000, then most retailers work out a decent cut-off point of say Rs 250 to price their product, such that a vast majority of the market purchases it at static price. This static pricing regime has withstood the storms of innovation until now; but its future is suddenly looking bleak.

Somewhere in the 1970s, came along dynamic pricing, where different segments paid differently for availing the same product or service. Customers here were segmented based on their time of purchase. Some examples are airline tickets, hotel rooms, happy hours at bars, or discount sales on Wednesdays etc. But the key is customers could still self-select which segment they wanted to be in. For instance, even business-class customers could avail cheap airline tickets if they planned their business trip sufficiently well in advance.

The new kid on the block is personalised pricing, which uses consumer specific data, such as their past shopping habits/behaviours, their private data about life events, or other psychographic traits to determine a price that is unique to that customer at that point in time. The difference between dynamic pricing and personalised pricing is that, dynamic pricing offers the same price to everyone asking for the same product at a particular point in time, while personalised pricing breaches that boundary as well. Personalised pricing has become feasible only due to the data technology revolution, where e-retailers and product companies have access to terabytes of private consumer data, which was hitherto unavailable to them.

Naturally, technology companies such as Amazon and Google are taking the lead when it comes to experimenting with personalised pricing. However benign the term personalised pricing may sound, is it really fair to the consumers, especially when their ability to self-select a purchase is taken away from them? Are there ethical issues in this model, far beyond the economics of trading?

Way back in 2000, when Amazon was the lone big e-retailer in the town, a customer noticed that he could buy a DVD for $4 lesser if he deleted cookies in his browser. This became a national controversy and Jeff Bezos had to personally apologise and gave away thousands of refunds. This was way before the days of social media. Such an outcry today amplified over social media would have sent Amazon's stock prices crashing.

But the world has since moved on, and today, the core shopping base constitutes the 1990s and millennial kids. Tech companies argue that the current generation does not share the same privacy concerns of older generation and are happy to share and let companies use private data, in return for more personalised discounts and offerings.

One of the most systematic live studies on personalised pricing was done by an online human resources staffing firm Ziprecruiter in partnership with professors from Chicago Booth School. This company was charging a flat fee of $99 for any sourcing request.

After a series of experiments, they discovered that they could double the average price to $199 (personalised pricing in the range of $19 to $399) and generate far more revenues than they ever previously earned. They lost a few customers, a few grumbled, but most were satisfied and their revenues grew significantly. Their background algorithm used a significant amount of private customer data to personalise the price.

The success of this experiment and the reluctant acceptance of surge pricing tactic of Uber without much complaints or regulatory hurdles have excited tech companies and e-retailers on the possibility of shifting to personalised pricing. With the amount of private customer data in the hands of tech firms and e-retailers, it is not a matter of if anymore, but just when.

Personalised pricing is as close as one can get to what is called first degree price discrimination in economics. In this concept, every customer receives a personalised price that equals his/her maximum WTP. This model is called efficient in economics because no one is left out and the entire producer/consumer surplus is monetised.

For example, if consumers are spread over their WTP for an ice-cream from Rs 2 to Rs 50, and if the retailer sets the price at Rs 15, then no doubt some portion of the market will be unable to purchase the product, but many customers enjoy consumer surplus to the tune of difference between their true WTP and Rs 15.

This inefficiency goes away with personalised pricing because all customers can enjoy the ice-cream and pay at the level of their true willingness to pay. It is also welfare maximising because the rich pay more and the poor pay less, and finally everyone gets to avail the offering.

But first degree price discrimination has always remained a pipe dream because determining maximum WTP is almost impossible, and no customer in his sane mind would ever want to reveal that. With the power of private customer data and advanced machine learning algorithms, companies are now closer than ever before in determining this crucial piece of information.

Proponents of personalised pricing argue that such a model should be welcomed by the society because it is fair, efficient, and welfare maximising. They dub the naysayers as bigoted cry babies, who have higher WTP and are refusing to give up their consumer surplus for the welfare of the broader society.

But the opponents of personalised pricing have multiple viewpoints. The first is the legal issue involved in using demographic aspects such as race, gender, religion, education, and age to discriminate customers.

Recently, a California court outlawed the practice followed by a dating app of match group that charged older customers higher prices on the grounds of age.

Similarly, race or religion-based discrimination is outlawed in many countries including India. But if you ask the tech companies, they argue that they use these demographic variables only as a proxy for determining the customer's true WTP, but they don't indulge in any discrimination.

For example, the WTP for a Hindu traveller flying over Diwali weekend is likely to be far higher than someone belonging to another faith, but the religion of the passenger is only a proxy for his WTP. It is not clear what stand the courts will take on this issue, but tech companies know that this territory is a legal quagmire.

The second issue is the fairness concern raised by consumer rights protection groups on whether it is fair to indulge in opportunistic behaviour. For example, there was tremendous outcry when the dynamic prices of various essential products like water bottles went up in the affected regions during hurricane Katrina in America. It was a natural calamity leading to a spike in demand for essential products and how fair was it for the companies involved to exploit the situation? Tech companies argue that all they can do under such a shortage situation is to efficiently allocate the goods based on customer's WTP.

However, consumer protection groups don't agree.

The third issue is the ethical concern of unequal bargaining power. Today, tech companies know far more about consumers than consumers can independently research about competing offerings, despite the availability of Internet search engines. The difference lies in computing power and algorithm sophistication. Hence, consumers are far more likely to be exploited in a take-it-or-leave-it offer, especially when they suffer from varying degrees of inertia in brand switching.

The only way to address this issue is to make the market more competitive so that customers do not suffer from monopsony prices. For example, regulators can mandate sharing of private customer data among the players or become the custodian of all such data to create a level-playing field.

But the larger issue is the one involving consumer psyche. Over the past 150 years of the price tag era, we have grown believing that there exists a fair market price for a product or service that is static and is equal to everyone.

No customer can stomach the feeling that he/she paid Rs 100 more over someone else for purchasing the same product. He/she would feel betrayed leading to bitterness against the seller. The hardest part is changing this psyche; no matter what economic theories have to say. Tech and product companies are aware of this issue and they know that consumer loyalty, referrals, customer life-time value etc, would suffer big time if such bitterness is created.

To compound the problem, it is the richer consumers with higher WTP who are short-handed and they often are the most valuable customers to the company. Companies argue that uniform prices do not exist in the market. People pay different prices to avail the same education by a mix of scholarships and funding support. People already pay differently to avail taxi and auto rickshaw services.

But there are two issues with that argument.

Firstly, differential prices are prevalent only in customised services, where it is hard for consumers to compare the offerings. It is not so easy to extend this model to products and standard services.

Secondly, when pricing information is kept private, comparison is harder. But keeping personalised pricing information private is very hard for products in the social media era.

There is another challenge that companies are wary about that customers will start to fake the information they supply, or create multiple online avatars to game the system. This is another factor that is keeping personalised pricing still a little bit away from reality.

But whatever be the outcome of all these technical, legal and ethical dilemmas, it is clear that personalised pricing is here to stay. The job of regulators is going to get that much harder in order to protect consumers from being taken for a ride. However cruel this may sound, all we as consumers can do is brace ourselves for a new era of shopping, where the price tag will be dead and consumer surplus will be an empty vessel."

There is the award-winning actor of countless Hindi films who is now enjoying a second life as the West's favourite go-to guy for dramatic roles, ranging from spy handler Shahbaz Karim, based in pre-Partition Lahore, in the highly regarded BBC One miniseries Mrs Wilson, to Dr Vijay Kapoor, the chief of neurology in the fictional New York hospital of New Amsterdam, NBC's new soap.

In this avatar, Kher is universally beloved, living like a newcomer in New York, at the age of 63, ""waking up early morning to learn my lines and walking around New York meeting new people and discovering art galleries"".

In this avatar, he plays the roles he gets with relish, whether it is father to Pakistani-American comic Kumail Nanjiani in The Big Sick in 2017, the BAFTA-nominated schizophrenic father in BBC Two's moving The Boy With the Topknot, late in 2017, or the ultra professional Hemant Oberoi in the forthcoming Hotel Mumbai based on the 26/11 attacks on the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai.

In this avatar, the two-time National Award-winning actor (one as a special mention and the other as a special jury award) is all set to make it again, in America, having signed a three-year contract for New Amsterdam which will keep him out of India for the most part till 2020.

And then there is Anupam Kher, the super patriot, who stages morchas against the ""intolerance brigade"", berates a retired Supreme Court judge for questioning the Afzal Guru verdict, asks Naseeruddin Shah how much more freedom he wants in India, and acts as former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the forthcoming movie, The Accidental Prime Minister, based on Sanjaya Baru's book, that reveals some uncomfortable truths about the UPA regime, quite conveniently playing into BJP's dynasty-is-the-devil trope.

This Anupam Kher routinely retweets Prime Minister Narendra Modi's various accomplishments, is a star speaker at The World Hindu Congress in Chicago to commemorate 125 years of Swami Vivekananda's historic Chicago address, and has emerged as the right wing's most vocal cultural ambassador on Twitter with 12.9 million followers, without actually being a member of the BJP.

This Anupam Kher is in the habit of tweeting some extreme views -- from comparing the arrest of JNU student leaders Kanhaiya Kumar and Umar Khalid to an ongoing ""pest control of the country"" (Gharon mein pest control hota hai toh cockroach, keede makaude ityadi baahar nikalte hain. Ghar saaf hota hai. Vaise hi aajkal desh ka pest control chal raha hai"", February 20, 2016) to attacking young Gurmehar Kaur, a soldier's daughter, who said it was war and not Pakistan that had killed her father in Kargil (The Intorant Gang is back. Same faces, different slogans.:

This Anupam Kher also occasionally gets sought-after sinecures -- in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee era, he was director of his alma mater National School of Drama, followed by chairman of the Central Board for Film Certification. In this version of NDA, he was made chairman of Film and Television Institute of India, till he resigned, citing work commitments. Oh yes, he was also awarded the Padma Shri in 2004 and the Padma Bhushan in 2016.

The real Anupam Kher sees no contradiction in his politics and in his art. As he puts it: ""People confuse me talking about my concerns, my passion for India, with my wanting to be in politics in India. If I was in politics or if I wanted to get into politics, nobody could stop me. I have not been subtle about anything in my life. If I find Narendra Modi an honest Indian, I am vocal about it and if I find other people dishonest, I am vocal about it. I am passionate about everyone who does great things for India whether it is Virat Kohli or the soldiers on the front. That is the way I am made.""

His friends and colleagues vouch for it. ""He believes in his politics,"" says veteran media analyst Amit Khanna, who remembers calling him, at Ravi Baswani's suggestion, from Lucknow where he was teaching drama in Raj Bisaria's Bharatendu Natya Akademi for a small part in his directorial debut Sheeshay ka Ghar. ""I think he was paid a mere Rs 5,000-10,000 for the role but he asked for an advance of Rs 1,000 because his father back home in Shimla had asked for a bottle of Vat 69 and 7 O'Clock blades."" Those were Kher's years of struggle, which took him from the Department of Indian Theatre at Panjab University (where he worked with the legendary Balwant Gargi and first met his wife Kirron Kher) to Delhi's National School of Drama and then to Lucknow in search of a steady income.

His part as Disco Killer the misdirected hitman in cult classic Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron was cut, and after six months of preparation for the role in Saaransh, it seemed even that was to elude him when the producers wanted to cast Sanjeev Kumar instead. Director Mahesh Bhatt intervened after Kher protested and the role of an aged father who has to fight a long and arduous battle to claim his son's ashes, made him a phenomenon.

He was 28 and worked virtually non-stop after that, ensuring great relationships across the board in Bollywood's notorious cliques. Whether it was Subhash Ghai or Yash Chopra or Yash Johar, he networked, built relationships to last, and excelled in all genres with almost all major directors in over 500 films. Along the way, he created a school to train actors, worked with differently-abled children, told his life story in an engaging two-and-a-half hour, one-man play, Kuch Bhi Ho Sakta Hai, and became one-half of BJP's most popular Bollywood couple, with wife Kirron Kher becoming Lok Sabha MP from Chandigarh in 2014.

He is also a card-carrying member of Bollywood's informal club of ultra nationalists, whose undeclared president is Akshay Kumar, his co-star in Baby andSpecial 26 and whose other leading lights are directors Madhur Bhandarkar, Vivek Agnihotri and Ashoke Pandit.

Kher has another identity, one which he has cultivated carefully though he is not from the Valley, that of a Kashmiri Pandit exile. In this incarnation, he speaks resolutely for the rights of migrants and calls out 'pro-Pakistan' elements in India. He shoots videos which play on news channels at prime time and speaks of how the Muslims of Kashmir had given Hindus just three choices: Ralive, tsaliv ya galive (convert to Islam, leave or perish). Ashoke Pandit, his ally in this cause, calls him his 'elder brother' and 'guiding spirit'. ""I've known him from the early 80s when he had just come to Mumbai and was staying in a small room in Kherwadi, Bandra with four others. Whenever he was homesick, he would come home to eat 'ma ke haath ka khaana'. I have never seen him complaining even in the darkest days and it is for this very reason that he jumps back after every setback.""

And he has had a few -- whether it was the financial disaster of his TV production company, the failure of his directorial debut Om Jai Jagadish or the ban he imposed on six movie magazines in 1992 after slapping a Stardust correspondent who reported the allegation that he had molested the sister of actress Mamta Kulkarni. It is typical of the shifting loyalties in the Mumbai film industry that Naseeruddin Shah then spoke up in his defence in a short video for the video magazine Bollywood Plus.

Kher insists he is not interested in active politics, ""at least for the next many years"". ""This is the greatest phase of my life,"" he says. ""I feel alive as a person and as an actor, in a profession where age has nothing to do with exploring new horizons. I am completely desi. I think in Hindi being from a Hindi-medium school. And now as the only Indian in the cast of New Amsterdam I think in my mind somewhere I am representing India and I must do my country proud.""

His television bromance with fellow doctor Iggy Frome (played by actor Tyler Labine) has even earned them a celebrity nickname -- Kapiggy. Kher has engaged directly with politics before, when he read out the memorandum upon the formation of the Aam Aadmi Party because he was impressed with their stand on anti-corruption, but his constant desire to be in the news may not fit with the regimentation required of a member of any political party.

Whether he is dining with Robert de Niro, fellow New Yorker and co-star of the Oscar-winning Silver Linings Playbook; shooting videos of his mother Dulari; or strolling on the street with a visiting Rishi Kapoor, Kher is enjoying the success he has made of his life. He is, of course, entirely unaware of the irony of being a Modi fan who criticises other people's intolerance, working in a hit broadcast show which celebrates all kinds of diversity, in Trump's America where plurality is under threat.

But the young man who came to Mumbai with Rs 37 in his pocket, and was not given the Rs 500-job he expected as a teaching assistant in a fellow actor's new school, will never be a mere memory for Kher who has intimate experience of failure. Which may well be why the busy actor will always overwhelm the nascent politician -- this is the man, after all, of whom it was said in the 1990s, that there were two absolute essentials for any Hindi film to be made. Raw stock and Anupam Kher.

The former may well be out of fashion now but the latter continues to remain relevant. Whatever it takes."

What emerges is that systemic violence and discrimination against women, especially in rural areas, runs deep, and goes beyond just the sexual.

Bundelkhand, as of late 2018, is poor, dry and stuck in a paralysis of governance, far from the 'feel good' narratives that most state-sponsored PR and blindsided patriotism seems buoyed by. Things are not getting better here, but things are also not the same. Cheap internet connections and smartphones are aglow in villages that dot the barren ghats. Women are at work, 'lower castes' are in public spaces, changing and redefining them. Large bribes are paid so that the women of the family can be teachers and nurses, earning hefty permanent salaries, and supporting unemployed male members.

But what of the dark lining below these stories of social and economic change? What does the workplace look like for these women who are resetting centuries of gender, class and caste oppression? Can they speak truth to power as we hear women in other places speaking? Or is silence a small price for the slow-moving liberties that they have gained? What shape can #MeToo take here?

I. Rajkumari*, 25, Journalist

The editorial structure of the media here is shaped like an inverted pyramid, with the number of paid editorial staff reducing to a pinpoint as you go lower and deeper into up country or rural locations, and where advertising revenues are slim. Large media corporations may have stringers, who, since they are not on the payroll, work for multiple organisations, and double as advertising agents with revenue targets and hefty commissions. In this game of mobility, networking, insecure finances, blackmail and political and administrative power brokering, women are rarely seen or heard. The ones who are, are treated with some curiosity and a lot of lewd relish.

Her Story

He made it impossible for me to go to the administrative offices.

Everyone was under his thumb.

No one would speak to me.

I stopped reporting.

Rajkumari never finished school, and in her late teens when she had the opportunity to be trained as a professional journalist, she took it. A Dalit, her family has had few avenues of livelihood, and there were many sisters to support. Rajkumari began working as a reporter. After her marriage, her marital family wasn't supportive of her 'gallivanting about' at unpredictable hours, and so she had to leave.

Years of economic and domestic strife later, she pleaded her way back to journalism. She began to work in the Ajaygarh block of Panna district in Madhya Pradesh, a short bus ride across the border from her village in Banda. Rajkumari saw no other women reporting, as she began to establish herself in her new beat, familiarising herself with villages, panchayat level workers and local influencers. When she went to the block office to question a few relevant officials on her first lot of stories, she was accompanied by a colleague, a senior reporter. It was clear immediately that the block office was controlled by one man, Ram Milan Pande, the Block Pramukh. (The Block Pramukh is the highest level of elected official at the block level.) Panchayat elections are both overtly and implicitly political, and Pande was a longstanding Congressman, with strong influence in the region. He had ambitions of running for an MLA position, in the upcoming Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, and he saw Rajkumari, a young, confident and mobile woman in the area, as a creative tool for campaigning. ""He was pretty friendly and quite aged, must have been more than 50 years old,"" Rajkumari's colleague Rajni told us.

In the weeks after, as Rajkumari began to report independently, she was a frequent visitor to the block headquarters. This was when Pande 'started sharing things with Rajkumari to win her confidence'. Well aware that this was par for the course, she suffered Pande's overtures just to get her stories done. But then, one morning in July this year, at the block to interview Pande for a story, Rajkumari's repeated requests were ignored. There was a meeting on she was told, and many officials from the block were present. Pande dealt with the issues at hand, and slowly, the room emptied out, leaving Rajkumari alone with him. He asked her to wait, have tea, he wanted to speak to her about something. He said he would pay for her fuel costs, and she should do some campaigning for him in the block. When she backed away, he grabbed her hand and said,""Not a leaf in this area moves without me. I'll have your newspaper shut down.""

Rajkumari left the office.

In the weeks that passed, she wasn't entertained by any official in the block, none of her requests for interviews or bytes were acknowledged. She slowly stopped reporting in the area.

Within a month, citing domestic reasons, Rajkumari left work again.

II. Seema*, 25, lawyer and activist

Dalit politics in Uttar Pradesh has been a dirty, petty thing, resulting in deep and complex shifts in caste dynamics and social structures in the region over the last three decades. One important historical factor was the establishment of the Bahujan Samaj party in 1984 by Kanshiram, and its mobilisation in Uttar Pradesh. Kanshiram's successor, Mayawati, played a key role in the grassroots mobilisation and spread of an empowering Dalit politics in the state. Increasing political awareness worked alongside policies (including affirmative action for 'other backward castes') that benefited the 'lower' castes in Uttar Pradesh, significantly differently from other north Indian states. Youth in Uttar Pradesh have grown up in this atmosphere of political and social opportunism and opportunity, both frustrated and buoyed at the promises of political emancipation, as well as disappointed by the poverty and unemployment that deep-rooted gender and caste based discrimination still has them trapped in.

Her Story

If I say that I was wrong, people will say I brought it on myself, through my own actions.

I can't name people in the party (BSP) who have abused me. It will give the party a bad name. But many have. They've posted abuse on Facebook, photos and comments. If they see this Dalit girl stepping beyond her boundaries, they do everything they can to pull you down.

Seema was married at 13, in a village that was shadowed by the threat of the notorious 'Babli Kol daku' of Bundelkhand. She is Dalit, and like many Dalit parents, hers brought her up to value education above anything else. She studied even after she was married, and despite resistance from her in-laws, got a job in the labour department in Chitrakoot. Her friendship with a distant relative proved to be a lifelong trauma for Seema, as the boy, observant of her ambitions and perseverance, took photos and posted them online, in the early days of Facebook, resulting in public shame and the end of Seema's marriage. He would call her from different numbers, blackmail her, even come to her home and abuse her. Work became more and more important for Seema to survive both personal strife and economic upheaval,""When I have scars, I lie and say I fell from the roof. Even though everyone in my mohalla knows I'm being harassed and abused, everyone knows I'm being used. Now if he says something or does something, I won't stay quiet. I will fight back. If I don't fight, what hope is there for the next generation? Even though I feel that I'm so aware, I've had to bear so much.""

Meera lives in the district headquarters now, and has been studying law and running her own practice in the district court in Chitrakoot. Over the years, to cope with public and domestic abuse, she has networked with women's groups, political parties and bureaucracy, to help her along the thorny path of a Dalit woman trying to get by in the world. The more mobile and aware she is, the more the forces seem to close-in to throttle her. The district court in Karwi, Chitrakoot, is a sea of upper caste men fighting to maintain the status quo, and make a quick buck as and when they can. ""You know how it is, when you should charge 50, they charge 100; when they should charge 500, they charge a 1000,"" she says. Enter Seema, young, slight, Dalit, smart and articulate.""When I go into the courts, and see women testifying about rape, and see what questions and comments they have to face, the filthy abuse, so loud and aggressive, I understand how someone would be driven to say, it didn't happen, I wasn't raped, I've filed a false case - even if that is entirely untrue. I've seen this happen.""

Last year, her Facebook account was hacked and controversial videos and posts were circulated from it, causing her great stress and public shame.""They plant their people in cyber cafes to watch which Dalit girls are coming and what their Facebook IDs are. And then they post objectionable videos and photos from your accounts. I couldn't eat for days, I was terrified my parents would find out, and commit suicide. But if you work in an office, you have to compromise. People will say, 'Bring us tea, if we come to your home, won't you serve us tea?' And you ignore them, else, how will you feed your children?""

Even as a politically conscious and mobile young woman, Meera is not enough for the forces of gender, caste and feudal power that conspire to hold her down in the world.

III. Susheela*, 53, Auxillary Nurse Midwife

The Auxillary Nurse Midwife or ANM is a permanent or contractual government health worker located in a village level sub-centre. She is responsible for catering to the basic healthcare needs as well as childbirth for a population of 5000. The ANM is a salaried worker, and has a joint account with the village pradhan, into which she receives a fund of Rs 10,000, for various equipment or tasks. The job of an ANM is a prestigious one. It also involves being beholden to a network of village and block level officials, health department staff and politicians. The ANM is crucial to the system of maternal and community healthcare, but is also a woman embroiled in the highly corrupt and chimerical world of local politics and bureaucracy.

Her Story

I was abused.

Let me tell you the story.

It was the 25th of September.

I was at the Panchayat Bhavan.

It's been four months, but every time I think of that incident and those people I become a mess.

It was evening, most people had left. I was waiting for my son to take me home.

My husband is dead, people know I am alone.

Susheela has worked as an ANM for the past 18 years in a remote area of Bundelkhand's Banda district, surrounded by mountains and forests, and regularly visited by dacoits.""You can go to any family in this area and ask about my credentials, if I have ever had a complaint against me,"" Susheela says. She does not stop weeping throughout our interview. Through her tears, Susheela explains the topography of her area of work, through the network of men she must 'work' with -- the sarpanch, local BJP leaders, the Chief Medical Officer, doctors, police superintendent, constables, and local thugs.

As a long-term government employee of the area, she is regularly asked to pay the pradhan ""for expenses of the party, I don't even know what the party is and what they want the money for"". The money that comes into her (joint) account, recently for sanitation tasks in the health centre, is paid to the pradhan. On the fateful evening she describes, Susheela was asking the pradhan to sign in her register to acknowledge she had given him the money -- Rs 8,000.""There were many people around, but I only recognised the three of them, the pradhan, his brother, and the (BJP) treasurer. They began to abuse me loudly, beat their chests. They grabbed my register and tore it, looked at me in a way that terrified me. So many people saw, but no one said a word. Isn't this molestation?""

Susheela went into shock, but later that evening, called the local police station.""They told me I should have dialled 100. I said I wasn't feeling well. Then I spoke to the CMO. Within a day, they had arranged to get me transferred. They don't want me creating trouble."" For months, Susheela resisted this transfer away from her family, her government housing and her familiar area -- at the age of 53.""They told me to go from one official to the other, one doctor to another -- each wants a cut. How can a woman be tormented like this? People ask me to pay them money, then circulate these rumours that I extract money from people. Ask anyone whether I ever did any wrong. The SP, DIG or the Mahila Aayog hasn't heard me out."" She went into a kind of trauma, still visible in her broken, rambling speech. She hasn't been paid a salary in four months, since the incident took place. She received death threats from the pradhan and his brother, and calls from the local police station -- ""Madam, thane mei aakar FIR kar dijiye"" -- calls she recognised as barely concealed threats if she didn't 'compromise'.""Why will I file a case? I need to live in this area. I want my posting cancelled.""

As of 19 December, her transfer has been nullified. She has been reinstated to the sub-centre where she has been working for 18 years, where she slowly adjusts to living in fear.""I haven't slept in four months. I feel like I should call the BJP (party workers, media) and kill myself in front of them.""

This is a list of ten articles that were read the most on The Wire in 2018. They were on topics as diverse as the depiction of women in Bollywood, media exposés, the PM's Research Fellowship and the realities of the education system in India. And they're worth revisiting on this last day of the year: for a snapshot of 2018's most popular preoccupations.

1. 'At The End of Your Magnum Opus... I Felt Reduced to a Vagina - Only'

In an open letter to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, actor Swara Bhaskar spelled out how his movie Padmaavat glorified Jauhar and Sati, and reduced women to simply being ""walking talking vaginas"". Condoning such practices at a time when 'honour' killings and the practice of Female Genital Mutilation only aid in propelling patriarchal, misogynist and problematic ideas is a mistake, she argues.

Practices like Sati, Jauhar, FGM, Honour Killings should not be glorified because they don't merely deny women equality, they deny women personhood. They deny women humanity. They deny women the right to life. And that is wrong. One would have assumed that in 2018, this is not a point that even needs to be made; but apparently, it does. Surely, you wouldn't consider making a film glorifying FGM or Honour Killings!

The context of art, any art is the time and place when it was created and consumed. And that's why this gang-rape infested India, this rape condoning mindset, this victim blaming society is the actual context of your film, Sir. Surely in this context, you could have offered some sort of a critique of Sati and Jauhar in your film?

2. Cobrapost Sting: Big Media Houses Say Yes to Hindutva, Black Money, Paid News

Second on the list is a deep dive into the Cobrapost exposé which revealed how some of the biggest names in the Indian media agreed to business proposals by an undercover reporter seeking the promotion of the Hindutva agenda.

For the sting, an undercover journalist, Pushp Sharma, posed as ""Acharya Atal"", a man who identified himself as a representative of an unnamed ""sangathan"", or organisation, but who gave the impression that he was a member of or close to the Nagpur-based Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).

The biggest name to be stung by Cobrapost was Times Group owner and managing director Vineet Jain. In a number of videotaped conversations, Jain and the group's executive president, Sanjeev Shah, can be seen and heard discussing the proposed deal in which Acharya Atal said he would pay Rs 500 crore in exchange for advertorials and events that that would be presented as programming on Krishna and the Bhagvad Gita but which would serve as a cover for Hindutva and its political agenda.

3. Why I Am Resigning From the BJP

In an open letter to the BJP, Shivam Shankar Singh, who worked on the BJP's election campaigns in the Northeast, broke down why he could not support the BJP any more even though he had believed Narendra Modi was a ray of hope in 2014.

Hindu khatre mein hai - they've ingrained it into the minds of people that Hindus and Hinduism are in danger, and that Modi is the only option to save ourselves. In reality Hindus have been living the same lives much before this government and nothing has changed except people's mindset. Were we Hindus in danger in 2007? At least I didn't hear about it everyday and I see no improvement in the condition of Hindus, just more fear mongering and hatred.

Speak against the government and you're anti-national and more recently, anti-Hindu. Legitimate criticism of the government is shut up with this labelling. Prove your nationalism, sing Vande Mataram everywhere (even though BJP leaders don't know the words themselves, they'll force you to sing it!). I'm a proud nationalist and my nationalism won't allow me to let anyone force me to showcase it. I will sing the national anthem and national song with pride when the occasion calls for it, or when I feel like it, but I won't let anyone force me to sing it based on their whims.

4. With Ministers Like These, Every Day Must Be Science Day

There's a lot that India can do to improve the cause of science within its borders and but doesn't because of the way it thinks about the subject. Perhaps the most notable example is Science Day itself - one day reserved to celebrating science when in fact that should be every day. Its historical basis doesn't inspire much confidence either.

We're not faced with a group of ministers bungling their jobs but a group that knows exactly what it's doing: angle for what they say is the 'national interest', and force everything else to tag along. By cornering our reasons to celebrate science into the confines of a single workday, we're at risk of abetting what our ministers are doing: abdicating responsibilities towards science on other days.

... Science is an everyday endeavour; celebrate it, scrutinise it, share it, demand it on every day of the year. Just the same way marking 'Earth Hour' is doing nothing to help Earth if you're not going to have environmentally conscious daily routines, you might as well not mark 'Science Day' if you're going to mark it on just one day.

5. Why Modi Walked Out in 2007 and the BJP Now Shuns Me

In the fifth spot is an excerpt from Karan Thapar's book Devil's Advocate: The Untold Story that told the complete tale of his infamous interview with Narendra Modi in 2007 where the future prime minister ended the interview abruptly when Thapar raised questions about the 2002 Gujarat riots.

'Why can't you say that you regret the killings that happened? Why can't you say maybe the government should have done more to protect Muslims?'

'What I have to say I have said at that time, and you can find out my statements.'

'Just say it again.'

'Not necessary I have to talk about in 2007 everything you want to talk about.'

'But by not saying it again, by not letting people hear the message repeatedly, you are allowing an image that is contrary to the interest of Gujarat to continue. It's in your hands to change it.'

Right through the two or three minutes this exchange lasted, Narendra Modi's face remained expressionless. But it was also clear he wasn't happy. His eyes were cold and hard. Perhaps he was making an effort to keep his face calm and steady. But now his patience or, perhaps, his resolve snapped. He had had enough and ended the interview. With the words 'I have to rest. I need some water' he started to take the microphone off.

6. Exclusive: Punya Prasun Bajpai Reveals the Story Behind His Exit From ABP News

In an explosive exclusive in August, former ABP News anchor Punya Prasun Bajpai wrote about the circumstances of his departure from the channel and the official diktats which preceded it.

Say, a channel does not confine itself to showing the Modi regime in a positive light at all times but occasionally includes stories with a negative tone or, on the basis of facts, shows the Modi government's truth to be a lie. Immediately, BJP spokespersons are told to stop appearing on those channels; that is, they do not participate in any political discussion conducted by that channel.

This started happening on ABP News from the last week of June this year - BJP spokespersons stopped appearing on its debates. A few days later, BJP leaders stopped giving bytes to the channel. The day the truth of the Prime Minister's 'Mann ki Baat' was outed on Masterstroke, RSS ideologues too were told to stay off the channel.

7. IAS Officer Being 'Taught a Lesson' for Taking on Modi, Says Family

At the seventh position is a story by Gaurav Vivek Bhatnagar that blew the lid off the harassment faced by an IAS officer in Gujarat for having acted against Narendra Modi.

IAS officer Pradeep Sharma spent another day in Sabarmati central jail in Ahmedabad on Friday even as his son is getting married in the United States since a special anti-corruption court in Bhavnagar on March 27 denied him bail - both regular as well as temporary for a week - to view his son's wedding from India via a video link, and the high court too refused an urgent hearing in the matter.

A close relative of Sharma insisted that the family was clear in its mind that Pradeep Sharma - who has seen 10 FIRs being filed against him over the last eight years - has suffered all these years ""because of that girl"" who is at the centre of what has come to be known as the Snoopgate scandal.

8. Can't Find 'Vikas' or #AccheDin? Check Narendra Modi's Twitter Timeline

Next is Karnika Kohli's unravelling of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Twitter feed and his conspicuous silences on issues that took the country by storm.

Like Manmohan Singh, Modi the prime minister has remained conspicuously quiet about issues that make his government look bad. While he is quick to wish his foreign counterparts on their birthdays - and express condolences after minor attacks in their countries - Akhlaq's brutal lynching, people who lost their lives waiting in queues after demonetisation, cow vigilantism, the Una lynching, the brutal rapes in Kathua and Unnao and many other incidents didn't make the cut.

Predictably, the prime minister has maintained a stoic silence on the police firing in which 12 people protesting the Sterlite unit in Thoothukudi were killed on May 22. People in the coastal Tamil Nadu town have been protesting for over 100 days, claiming that the unit is polluting the environment and has resulted in illnesses.

9. One Year On, the PM's Research Fellowship Is off to a Sputtering Start

The first year of the PM's Research Fellowship, already much criticised for severe conceptual issues, didn't help its cause. The MHRD awarded only 135 scholars with the fellowship out of a promised 1,000 and didn't clarify how the money allocated for the unselected 865 would be used. Together with a host of other issues, this only strengthens the impression that the government wanted to rebut in the first place: that the PMRF has been ""designed to pile privilege on privilege"".

The 1,800 students who applied from this pool of candidates were those who had already cleared many levels of implicit selection. An analysis of the student composition of IITs shows that not all economic and social backgrounds have equal representation in these elite institutions. There is a whole chain of filters based on economic and caste status, quality of schooling, the ability to afford the coaching required to clear the various entrance exams, and the ability to pay the prohibitively expensive fees that several of these institutes charge - along with hostel fees, mess fees and peer-pressured booze and pizza fees, which introduce inequality in the opportunity available to Indian students to avail a world-class education. It is only a half-joke that the IISc is often called the ""Iyer-Iyengar Institute of Science"".

10. A Sick Society That Manufactures Failures - the True Face of Education in India

In a scathing attack on the education system in India and how it destroys young minds, Avijit Pathak defines why the idea of 'success' has failed students.

Anyone familiar with school education in India knows how parents and teachers pressurise children to opt for science/commerce even if they are not inclined to it. In fact, many of them are never given the space to look at themselves, and understand their unique traits and aptitudes. This is the beginning of alienation in the child's life. This alienation is further intensified when the societal pressure restricts their imagination, and forces them to believe that life is necessarily dark and bleak without medical science/engineering/management.

In this reckless preparation for 'success' their alienated selves find no joy, no ecstasy; coaching centres have no humour, guide books are devoid of creative imagination, 'success mantras' require war strategies, not the spirit of wonder, and the joy of learning is replaced by the neurotic urge to be a 'topper'.

However, this 'success', as I wish to argue, has its own discontents. The reason is that, for most of them, it is an immensely alienating experience. It kills one's creativity; it makes one one-dimensional; it robs one of the spirit of positive life-energy."

The rice was stocked for sale in the open market.

While the raid was conducted on December 25, Kashimira police on Sunday arrested the owners of Mahadev Food Agro Mill, Narendra Rane, Dilip Thakkar and Ashok Thakkar on Sunday. Four other suspects are absconding.

Bhayander assistant superintendent of police Atul Kulkarni, along with his team, raided the godown and seized 12,035 gunny bags containing the foodgrain. Each 50 kg bag had the stamp of the Food Corporation of India (FCI), Punjab. The crop year mentioned was 2017-18.

Investigations revealed the rice was allotted under the MDM scheme. Instead of transporting it to the beneficiary schools, it had been offloaded at the mill. Around 10 trucks loaded with foodgrain, parked outside the mill, were also seized.

The owners claimed the rice had arrived at the mill for cleaning and polishing and would then be transported to the schools. The owners, however, were not able to give details of the schools where the rice had to be delivered. Police seized two machines used for cleaning and sorting the rice. Police said the mill did not have licence to store foodgrains procured from the FCI.

Police said the rice was polished and packed in fresh gunny bags to be sold in the open market.

The bench also directed the dean to ensure that the autopsy was videographed from various angles.

Justice B Pugalendhi, who took up the case at a special sitting, issued the directions after the deceased boy's mother moved the court on Monday raising doubts over his death. The teenager had attempted suicide last Wednesday by consuming rat poison and was undergoing treatment at GRH, where he died on Sunday. The boy, who was working as a labourer at a fireworks unit in Sivakasi, had first donated blood at the blood bank on November 30 without realizing that he was HIV-infected. This blood was transfused to the 23-year-old pregnant woman on December 3 and she also got infected.

In the petition, the woman stated that her son discontinued school in Class IX and went to work in Sivakasi in 2016 as a daily wage labourer. She said her son had to undergo a blood test for his job requirement abroad and the lab results showed him to be HIV positive after which he checked with the Sivakasi government hospital and found that his blood was transfused to a pregnant woman. ""In fact my son himself alerted the hospital officials about his infection after the private lab found him to be infected,"" the petitioner stated.

After it was ascertained that a pregnant woman was infected with HIV, pictures of my son were showed on some television channels leading to his identification. Upset over this and lack of counselling, he attempted suicide on December 26. The petitioner stated that after three days of treatment at Madurai GRH, her son was back to normal. However, on December 30, around 5 am, three doctors and a nurse arrived after he complained of pain in his private parts. Three hours later, her son was declared dead.

Stating that even the district collector was not informed of the boy's death until evening, the family raised suspicions over the treatment offered in the last hour leading to his death. When the petition came up for hearing, Justice B Pugalendhi granted the relief sought by the family. The court directed that the autopsy be conducted as per rules laid down and directed two assistant professors from either Sivaganga, Tirunelveli or Theni medical colleges to assist in the autopsy. The court also made it clear that the relief granted in this case could not be a precedent in cases of suspicious death and it was granted considering the special circumstances."

From the murder of a police officer in South Delhi to the molestation case of a teacher in the heart of the National Capital, such cases did grab headlines but have remained unsolved till now. Police officials claim that all possible efforts and measures were undertaken, despite that they have failed to get a breakthrough. In 2018 up to November 30, 2,25,123 cases were reported compared to 2,33,580 cases in 2017.

Following cases have continued to reach to definite conclusion:

Late on the night of September 11, a head constable of Delhi police, who had stepped out of his house to buy flour from the market, was shot dead by unknown assailants just 200 meters away from his house in South East Delhi's Jaitpur area.

The deceased Ram Awtar Kholwar, a 2003 batch officer was posted at the Ambedkar Nagar police station in South Delhi. He hailed from Karouli in Rajasthan.

Police said they are suspecting the involvement of some known person behind the attack or it could be that Awtar had spotted some persons carrying out suspicious activities in the area. He was shot at when he confronted the assailants. Ramavatar had suffered a bullet injury below his right ribs. ""there is no headway since the crime took place after dark and there were no CCTV cameras installed around the spot, police are trying to look for eyewitnesses but have not been able to find any. Several teams have been formed and we are hopeful to arrest the accused soon,"" said Chinmoy Biswal, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South- East).

More than 50 people have been rounded up to gather information in the case while an FIR under IPC Section 302 (murder) was registered at Jaitpur police station, police said.

Awtar had arrested around eight proclaimed offenders and contributed to investigations in several important cases. He was survived by his wife and two children aged 10 and 6. His elder brother also works with the Delhi police.

On September 22, a 65-year-old woman and her 42-year-old handicapped daughter were found dead inside their house in Paschim Vihar. The police has been probing the case from all angles while suspected the role of an unknown acquaintance. However, no arrest has been made so far.

Shashi Talwar lived with her mentally-challenged daughter, Nidhi in the first floor of a building ever since the demise of Shashi's husband. Shashi also has two sons, Vishal and Abhay living in Mumbai and Canada, respectively.

Nidhi's body was found on the bed in the first room. ""Her mouth was stuffed with a cloth, her hands tied and a pillow lying nearby on the bed,"" he said. ""Shashi's body was found with her throat slit in the kitchen,"" a police official said.

""Prima facie it appears that the culprit were known to the family as there were no signs of tussle at the entry gate. We are not ruling out any angle including enmity, burglary attempt, property dispute, etc. Investigation is underway but no arrest has been made so far,"" said Seju P Kuruvilla, Deputy Commissioner of Police, (Outer).

On December 1, 2017, a 32-year-old professor had to face a horrendous incident of molestation in Connaught Place (CP), the heart of the national Capital. A man groped her, unzipped his pants, and masturbated in front of her while she was taking a break from her work in a language school in CP.

The woman had gone to the terrace of the building when the incident took place. The accused, who is yet to be arrested, also snatched her phone before fleeing the spot.

According to the complainant, its been more than a year since the incident took place however, the cops have not been able to trace the victim and arrest him. She still recalls the trauma and remembers that during her break as usual, she went to the terrace of the building to smoke. A man in his mid 20s followed her to the terrace but she didn't pay much attention. The accused constantly stared at her while pretending to be on the phone. When she asked him whether there was a problem, he said there wasn't but did not move from the spot. Then he suddenly came in front of her and pointed at her breasts.

She pushed him and threatened to call the police. Instead of feeling deterred, he flashed at her. While she was trying to escape the spot he grabbed her and ejaculated.

""As there no concrete evidence of the man, we have not been able to trace anyone. Even in the CCTV footage seen, it shows that the man following the victim but his face was hidden by a hoodie,"" said a senior police officer.

On August 25, 2017, Shashwat Pande, a radiologist at the St. Stephen's hospital was found dead with his throat slit and multiple stab wounds inside the hospital's CT scan lab. The prime suspect in the case was another doctor Suyash Gupta who had allegedly been stalking the victim for the past two years.

Gupta was suspended by the hospital as well. Pande had several times complained to the hospital authorities about the behaviour of the accused and harassment he was facing. The accused has allegedly fled to Nepal.

After eight months, the Delhi Police have transferred investigation in the murder case of St. Stephen's doctor Shashwat Pande to the Crime Branch.

However, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was handed over the case which the Delhi Police was earlier investigating the case but failed to trace the prime accused, another senior doctor at the hospital, who has been absconding for almost a year now.

The police suspect that he might be hiding in Nepal but admitted that there are no significant clues that he might be living there. However, the Delhi High Court was hearing the petition moved by the parents of Gupta, seeking his whereabouts.

The police have hiked the reward amount for any information on Gupta, from Rs 50,000 to Rs1 lakh."

This came about after an in-house study by the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee (SCLSC), that concluded that poor litigants on death row or facing harsh punishments are getting a raw deal on account of poverty.

While this mechanism could take time to set in, two recent judgments by the apex court, both given in early December, did factor the poor socio-economic condition of prisoners while commuting their capital punishment to life term. One such case was death row convict Antony alias Antappan who wiped out six members of a family in Kerala in 2001. The other was Rajendra Wasnaik from Maharashtra, who brutally raped and murdered a three-year-old in 2007.

Quoting from the report prepared by the SCLSC in its judgment, a bench of justices Madan B Lokur (since retired), S Abdul Nazeer and Deepak Gupta said, ""The poor are more often than not at the receiving end in access to justice and access to remedies available, as is evident from a fairly recent report prepared by the SCLSC which acknowledges, through Project Sahyog, enormous delays in attending to cases of the poor and the needy.""

For 2019, the judges resolved, ""Quality legal aid to the disadvantaged and weaker sections of society is an area that requires great and urgent attention, and we hope that a vigorous beginning is made in this direction in the new year.""

For impoverished prisoners in the country, the court's judgment must come as welcome relief. Statistics compiled by the National Law University, Delhi, in its Death Penalty India Report based on interviews with 373 death row prisoners across the country, found out that three-fourths of these prisoners (numbering approximately 274) were economically vulnerable, with most of them being the sole or primary earners in their families. Even educationally, almost 225 prisoners didn't complete secondary schooling, while 84 never went to school at all. As trials in their cases progressed, they were forced to borrow loans or sell valuable assets in order to engage lawyers. By the time their appeals reached the high courts or the Supreme Court, they were financially drained and relied on anything the court gave by way of free legal aid.

It is this legal aid that the Supreme Court has targeted to improve in the new year as part of a systemic reform in the criminal justice delivery system. Judges were cautious to add that consideration of convicts' socio-economic condition does not mean disproving his/her guilt, but to help in awarding an appropriate sentence.

Article 39A of the Constitution promises free legal aid to all citizens. But 'Project Sahyog', a pilot venture of the SCLSC, upon analysis of 1,188 cases relating to poor convicts pending in the Supreme Court, found that in about 48 cases, the convict's appeal couldn't be listed for more than a decade for want of legal aid. Similarly, about 165 cases are pending since 2006 on account of the convict's failure to get legal aid. Of these, 776 were criminal cases and 412 civil matters."

The Congress, which hitherto used to be the main challenger to the Left Front in the State, lost ground and could not get even a single MLA elected to the 60-member House in the February poll.

Sudip Roy Burman, who headed the State Congress in the 2013 Assembly elections but switched over to the BJP this time, said, ""In 2013, the CPI(M) faced strong anti-incumbency but Congress central leadership had helped the CPI(M) in the State clandestinely for enjoying the party's support in Parliament.""

BJP workers celebrated the end of the red bastion in Tripura by bringing down a five-feet-tall statue of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin at Belonia town, the district headquarters of South Tripura district on March 4.

The BJP Government initiated several steps to erase the legacy of the long Left rule.

A week before Deb shifted to the Chief Minister's residence, the State Government changed the name of the road leading to it from 'Marx Angel's Sarani' to 'Dr Shyama Prasad Mookerjee Lane'.

After taking charge, Deb was in the news for the wrong reasons. He made several remarks that triggered widespread criticism - the Internet and satellite communication existed during Mahabharata era, civil and not mechanical engineers should opt for civil services, educated youths should set up paan shops instead of seeking government jobs and youths should explore a career in dairy field and keep cows.

He was also rapped for questioning the crowning of Diana Hayden as Miss World in 1997 and claiming that Rabindranath Tagore had rejected his Nobel prize in protest against the British Government.

The new government conducted by-elections to 3,386 seats of local bodies - 3,200 gram panchayat, 161 panchayat samiti and 18 zilla parishad - in September after these fell vacant following large-scale resignations of elected representatives of the Left parties.

The BJP won unopposed 96 per cent of the gram panchayat and panchayat samiti seats and all the 18 zila parishad seats in the polls. In November, the Tripura Government announced doing away with the school curriculum of the Left regime from next academic session and replacing it with CBSE syllabus and also decided introduction of NCERT books for students.

The shift of power witnessed violent clashes between the CPI(M) and the BJP at many places during 2018.

The CPI-M State secretary had on March 4 alleged that at least two persons were murdered and 240 leaders and workers of the party were injured in BJP-IPFT sponsored post poll violence in the State.

On April 10, CPI (M) leader Prakash Karat visited some areas in West Tripura district and said his party would not ""tolerate attacks on democracy"". While the BJP and the IPFT bonded to overthrow the Left Front from power, differences soon cropped up between them on several issues.

The IPFT fought election to three-tier local bodies separately but could not stop the BJP's forward march in the State. Soon after the publication of the final draft of the NRC in Assam on July 30, Deb said there was no demand for such a citizens' register. But the IPFT differed and demanded citizens' registration in the State.

On October 8, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Tripura Government in response to a writ petition seeking revision of the NRC.

Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi issued the notice to the State and Central Governments asking for their views.

In October, the IPFT renewed its demand for a separate Twipraland State for tribals to protect and safeguard their socio-economic and political interests.

The IPFT placed the demand to a high power committee set up by the Ministry of Home Affairs to probe the socio-economic, cultural and linguistic problems faced by Tripura's tribal communities.

As the year drew to a close, Tripura is set to get a waterways between Sonamura in Sipahijala district and Ashuganj port in eastern Bangladesh covering a distance of about 70 km. This would facilitate transportation of goods from Kolkata to Ashuganj and then to Sonamura by small ships. - PTI"

The failing grades of a seven-year-old boy was implied by the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) here that his word cannot be believed when he accused three of his seniors of sodomising him repeatedly in the school bathroom.

Unable to come out of the trauma of having been dubbed as a liar, the boy, now a 20-year-old man knocked the doors of the Delhi High Court challenging the acquittal of all three senior students in the case.

The incident allegedly happened when the victim was studying in Class III of a private school in north Delhi in 2005. When the boy told his teacher about it, she had instead beaten him up. Feeling afraid, he did not disclose the incident to anyone. Following this, the three seniors continued to subject him to similar acts of sodomy on several occasions with threats that they would throw him into a drain if he told anyone about the incident.

The mother had found the boy in a depressed state and after his father was also brought in the loop, the child spoke out. An FIR was registered on September 5, 2005, but the JJB took over six years to decide the case in favour of the three accused students.

The Board noted that the accused student's counsel was successful in creating a ""doubt"" that the complaint was filed by the victim's parents to save the child from getting dismissed from the school due to his poor performance. As the State did not challenge the Board's judgment, the victim moved a trial court here, which dismissed his plea in May 2016. He then moved the High Court.

The victim's grievance is that despite incriminating evidence against the three seniors, he was termed as a person whose word could not be relied upon. This, his plea said, was ""an insult to the injuries suffered"".

In its verdict, the High Court Bench of Justice R.K. Gauba said the Board failed to judge the case on the touchstone of the psychology of the child who may have suffered sexual abuse.

The judge remarked that the child's lack of interest in attending school, disinterest in studies and resultantly his poor performance, needs to be examined from all angles since it may conversely be indicative of trauma of the child due to the sexual abuse.

""A child victim of sexual abuse cannot be expected to conduct himself in a normal or healthy manner in school which, in his mind, is no longer a place of safety,"" the judge said. ""The manner in which the JJB in this case dealt with the responsibility of appreciating the evidence smacks of total disconnect with the specialized field of child psychology,"" the judge said.

The court remarked that only such Magistrates should be appointed as members of the Board who possess ""special knowledge or training in child psychology or child welfare"". It also directed the Board to re-open the case and decide afresh within three months."

Come the month of Markazhi and in the city of Chennai there is a veritable glut of music and dance programmes. Starting out with a lilt in your step as the season begins, hungrily taking in as much as one can, towards the end, it is not uncommon after days of bleary eyed auditorium hopping to look forward to some quiet and rest.

It is still the start of the season as one takes in bits of the 18th Natya Darshan Conference, titled Kadamba -- The flowering path, mounted by Kartik Fine Arts, savouring the performance aspects of Bharatanatyam, even as innovative minds enquire, interact and debate on where the art form is headed. Curated by Priya Murle, herself a teacher, choreographer and performer, the chosen theme conjures up strong associations of Krishna romancing with the Gopis and Radha under the Kadamba tree in the Vrindavan and Mathura gardens, romantic interludes under the shade of this tree described in Sangam poetry and of course the myriad references in mythology, and ancient paintings of the tree laden with the incessant bloom of leaves and flowers -- the ideal metaphor for natya's everlasting fragrance, amidst inevitable changes.

In the morning hours, at the Forum Art Gallery for the morning's show The Moving Canvas, which, portraying the Nava Rasas or the nine governing moods or states of being, or ""rasas""(aesthetic bliss) evoked through interpretative dance, one sees the intimate gathering of bright eyed, smiling expectant faces of the young dancers blooming in conjeevaram silks and jasmin flowers and jewellery, and one contrasts the crackling air of anticipation all round along with the criticism one hears of Bharatanatyam as an ""outmoded"", ""Brahminised"", ""irrelevant"", ""sanitised"" dance form, out of step with reality. Contrarily, the atmosphere in the Art Gallery represents a people with total faith and conviction in the art form -- passed on to them by their individual gurus, an art which is their passion and their life. Moving river art reflects in its entirety different streams, as the modern paintings all round the gallery show.

Simultaneously, with the dancers presenting fare, building up to an emotional state of being, capturing each mood of this moving canvas through the strokes of his palette was painter Ilango, while cartoonist Biswajit Balasubramaniam echoed the same moods through his art form. As a centre of contemporary art, photography and ceramics, the venue provides for an ideal coming together of different art forms.

Raising the curtain on this journey of Nava Rasa through sringaram, the king of rasas, was (ironically or fittingly), male dancer Sathyanarayana Raju from Bengaluru, a disciple of gurus Narmada and Subhadra Prabhu, proving that art has no gender. In the five to six minute cameos each dancer was featured in, Sathyanarayana's sringar herioned was Draupadi, with the long tresses which played such a predominant role in the Mahabharata -- tresses by which she was dragged to court by Dushasana, with her vow, (leading to the Kurukshetra war), never to put up her hair till it had been anointed with the blood of Dushasana. But here in a romantic interlude, Draupadi is portrayed with the prince she loved best -- Arjuna, lovingly coaxing him to be gentle while combing and putting her hair up in a bun, the tender exchanges and the final snuffing out of the lamp as she gets ready for bed, delicately echoing the sringar messages through the eye expressions of the dancer. Nandini Anand as vocal accompanist with Sruti Sagar on the flute provided evocative musical support.

Sangeeta Iswaran chose to pin her depiction of ""hasyam,"" the mood of mocking laughter and fun, on a straightforward Ninda Stuti, a genre of Indian literature which is replete with compositions wherein the devotee addresses the object of his love and worship in the language of anger and mockery. In this case it is Parvati addressing her Lord Shiva who is, for some unknown reason, annoyed with her. Why this anger against me? (""Yedu ittanai modittaan umakku endanmeedaiyya?"" set to raga Surutti). And like a needle piercing a banana smoothly, she asks ""Have I ever complained about your standing on one leg, dancing, or your going round with a begging bowl asking for alms?"" Did I say anything when you smilingly rendered to ashes the three cities of the three demon powers you destroyed? Nor have I ever complained about your eating raw flesh offered to you as prasad by Kanappa, or about you dancing amidst the ashes in the crematorium grounds? Have I ever mentioned your lack of connections and the fact that you are not even (as Ardhanari) fully male? Parvati's gentle raillery and mockery would suffice as a better response than anger. With her highly vivacious facial expressions and bodily attitudes Sangeeta packs a punch and what was particularly heartening was to see the expressional variety in asking in mock innocence, after each point if she had ever complained about anything. The dancer's abhinaya guru Kalanidhi Narayanan would have been happy at her disciple's presentation.

Compassion has been described in all literature as the greatest of qualities to possess. Dancer Roja Kannan, a senior disciple of Guru Adyar K. Lakshman, in the first part of her presentation used a line from the Papanasam Sivan's Nattakuranji Varnam ""Tamadam seyyade vandarul vai."" entreating the compassionate Lord to grant a glimpse of himself without delay. She chose two incidents to illustrate the mood, the first being of the great devotee of Tiruvorriyur Shiva, who, reduced to such penury that he could not afford to buy oil to feed the burning lamp for his God, decided to cut off his head and feed the lamp with his blood when the compassionate Lord appeared before him and blessed him. She ended with Vallalar's work exhorting compassion as the greatest virtue, for the world of nature, for those stricken by incurable diseases like leprosy and ostracised by society, and for all mankind. While the details in the strands were too many in a very short depiction, the dominant note of compassion was very strongly brought out, with the music also very evocative.

Poetry fears the woman scorned, and so it was in the case of Vidya Subramaniam trained under S.K. Rajarathnam Pillai and Kalanidhi Narayanan, and now based in the States, in her expression of Raudra or anger. Taking recourse to a Javali ""Muttavoddura"" in Saveri, the infuriated nayika keeps at bay the unfaithful suitor who comes to her with his body carrying the signs of dalliance elsewhere. ""Do not touch me,"" she flays the wayward lover . The attitude of the proud nayika, who wants nothing more to do with him, was tellingly brought out, with the attitude of turning her back on him with expressions showing the distaste for all the unmentioned failures and faithless acts. As somebody remarked, fury contains within it shades of derision and disgust too as she shows him the door.

Instead of the one dimensional treatment of Veeram or valour of the martial character defeating foes, one liked the approach to heroism being viewed from the point of moral courage as experienced in the presentation by Bengaluru-based Lakshmi Gopalaswamy trained under Padmini Rao, Narmada and professor M.R. Krishnamurthy. The music too, using Taanam and pure dance passages, was multitoned. Draped in a tiger skin while hiding like a coward inside his palace when danger strikes is not bravery. On the other hand, to acknowledge one's wrong doings, to return ill-begotten gains, to have the moral courage to die for a cause on the battle field is what real courage is about.

Well versed in Sanskrit and Bharatanrittam as a disciple of Padma Subramanyam, the famed Natya Shastra scholar/indologist and author and dancer/choreographer plus musician et al, Gayatri Kanan, who was also groomed in music under N. Rajam, functions currently as principal of Nrithyodaya. For her treatment of bhayanaka or the mood of fear, she depended on her illustrious guru who composed the music and dance. ""Acham, acham, acham."" went the words as Gayatri entered the performance arena casting looks of fear on either side, and made her exit with the same sideways terrified glances. Too much wealth and prosperity carries with it the fear losing it and of having to keep guarding it while fear of poverty conjures up images of living from hand to mouth. Fear as a negative state of mind if allowed to take the upper hand will overshadow the whole of life, sapping it of all happiness. Gayatri's was a presentation of fear and more fear.

Priya S. Dixit, now settled in Singapore running Silambam, an alliance of Shree Bharatalaya her alma mater under her guru professor Sudharani Raghupathy, was given the tricky task of evoking Bibhatsam, a feeling of disgust and revulsion. Her treatment was woven round the figure of Thataka dancing in her unseemly physical girth devouring raw flesh which for a demon is normal fare. The second part painted the entire scene, evoking a feeling of revulsion and disgust in the viewer. A character like Bhima for instance in red hot anger claws out the entrails of Dushasana, but what the gory scene evokes is disgust. Similarly the second part of Priya's treatment showed the feelings aroused while watching Thataka. Wisely realising that this is not a mood which can be held over a long period, she made her narrative brief and muted, without going over the edge.

Representing the Vazhuvur School of her guru K.J. Sarasa and the Vempati school in Kuchipudi as the disciple of latte Vempati Chinnasatyam, Sailaja based her entire treatment of Arbutam, the sense of wonderment, on an Annamacharya Kriti in raga Bouli, ""Oho entati vaade,"" exclaiming at the feats of the Lord in so many manifestations. The lyric refers to some of the dasha avatars, and other aspects like feats of Krishna as Govardhana Giridhari. The dominant state of wonder was paramount.

Shantam or the mood of utter tranquility was not earlier recognised as a mood to be evoked, because that represents the inner stillness and calm from which all dance has to emanate in order to preserve objectivity of what is not a personalised but universalised state of being created through the dance. This rasa was added to what was earlier ashta rasa or eight moods. Sreelatha Vinod a senior disciple of the Dhananjayans chose to base her attempt at evoking the mood on Tyagaraja's wonderful Keertanam ""santamu leka saukyamu ledu Sarasadala nayana"" in the raga Shyama, the most evocative of the mood of tranquility. Addressing the Lotus eyed Lord, the music prodigy states that even the performer of Yagnas, blessed with wife and wealth, and learning in the Vedas and acknowledged as a Bhagavatar, unless blessed with mental peace will never know happiness. And with what a quality of silence in Sreelatha's rendition! It was shantam all the way!

As a finale to the moving canvasses portrayed through expressional expertise, was the snippet shown by Parvathi Ravi Ghantasala groomed under several gurus like Smt. Krishnakumari Narendran, Smt. Kalanidhi Naryanan, and Bhagavatulu Seetaram Sharma. Her presentation of the verse ""Sringaradhra"" saw Parvati looking at Shiva while being overcome by myriad emotions, originating from the deep love (sringaram) she has for him. Each aspect of his get-up stirs in Parvati a certain feeling -- his ash clad body, and matted hair, the snake coiled round his neck, and the Ganga perched in his locks, the fire held in one hand, the other holding the spear and with one hand in the abhaya mudra spelling protection for the world. Parvati experiences all the moods in fleeting vignettes. Parvati as a seasoned dancer, did justice to the mukhabhinaya."

Heavy influx of tourists from neighbouring States and lack of infrastructure in the former French outpost to handle the traffic caused utter chaos in the city, leaving the police at their wits' end on Monday. Although elaborate arrangements were claimed to have been made, lack of adequate parking lots to accommodate vehicles transporting tourists compounded the situation.

The traffic police barricaded the Law De Lauriston Street and a few other streets in the White Town to ensure smooth flow of traffic.

But the police personnel posted at important junctions in the city could not regulate the flow of traffic, resulting in severe congestion all along the stretch from Mahatma Gandhi Road to Gingee Salai.

Barricades placed in various parts of the city were a major obstruction to senior citizens and tourists walking towards the Beach Promenade. They found it difficult to move through the stretch.

According to a police official, ""All tourist vehicles including buses and vans coming from the neighbouring states were directed to be parked at the old distillery and other designated parking spaces in the White Town. Similarly, for vehicles coming from the south side, parking space had been allotted at the old and new port grounds, Indira Gandhi Sports Complex and Petit Seminaire School."" The Tourism department has projected an increase in tourist arrivals to Puducherry for this New Year.

A majority of the hotels have recorded near total occupancy with rooms booked till January 4, while a few have blocked rooms for their regular corporate clients, an official said.

The rooms had been booked more than 15 days in advance. Popular spots including the Beach Promenade and Matrimandir in Auroville are teeming with tourists.

Lighting and reverberating music at hotels, clubs and resorts, which were decked up with festoons and lit up, provided a festive look.

The debut edition of the Catamaran Beach Festival 2018 on December 30 and 31 at Chinna Veerampattinam beach will feature a curated multi-genre line up of 18 performing artists with the music ranging across adrenaline-driven rock to Carnatic alternative, hip hop, EDM (a variety of afro, tribal, minimalist techno and reggae).

At The Storytellers Bar in The Promenade Hotel, partying guests were treated to rock hits from 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s presented by city-based Dhani's Trio and DJ iSean from Auroville. The hotel is also organising a fun 'Hangover Brunch' at the Blue Line restaurant on January 1.

The Old Port grounds featured the band Madras Mail and a couple of sets by DJs. The Art and Craft village in Murungapakkam, Seagulls restaurant and PY Cafe also hosted music-driven New Year parties. There were a few options for revellers who preferred to avoid the chaos in the city with popular haunts such as the Ashok Beach Resort which hosted 'Rock N Rolla 2019' featuring hip hop and EDM sets steered by DJs Balie, Moon and Yugi, St. James Court Beach Resort and Bonjour Bonheur Ocean Spray hosting New Year parties."

The BJP and the Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT) also differed sharply on the issue of a National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state like the one in neighbouring Assam.

Lotus bloomed in Tripura in March after which a nine-member ministry headed by Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb took oath in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Congress lost ground and could not get even a single MLA elected to the 60-member house in the February poll.

BJP workers celebrated the end of the red bastion in Tripura by bringing down a five-feet-tall statue of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin at Belonia town, the district headquarters of South Tripura district on March 4.

After taking charge, Deb was in the news for the wrong reasons.

He made several remarks that triggered widespread criticism -- the Internet and satellite communication existed during Mahabharata era, civil and not mechanical engineers should opt for civil services, educated youths should set up paan shops instead of seeking government jobs and youths should explore a career in dairy field and keep cows.

He was also rapped for questioning the crowning of Diana Hayden as Miss World in 1997 and claiming that Rabindranath Tagore had rejected his Nobel prize in protest against the British government.

The new government conducted by-elections to 3,386 seats of local bodies -- 3,200 gram panchayat, 161 panchayat samiti and 18 zilla parishad -- in September after these fell vacant following large-scale resignations of elected representatives of the Left parties.

The BJP won unopposed 96 per cent of the gram panchayat and panchayat samiti seats and all the 18 zila parishad seats in the polls.

In November, the Tripura government announced doing away with the school curriculum of the Left regime from next academic session and replacing it with CBSE syllabus and also decided introduction of NCERT books for students.

The shift of power witnessed violent clashes between the CPI(M) and the BJP at many places during 2018.

While the BJP and the IPFT bonded to overthrow the Left Front from power, differences soon started cropped up between them on several issues.

The IPFT fought election to three-tier local bodies separately but could not stop the BJP's forward march in the state.

Soon after the publication of the final draft of the NRC in Assam on July 30, Deb said there was no demand for such a citizens' register. But the IPFT differed and demanded citizens' registration in the state.

On October 8, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Tripura government in response to a writ petition seeking revision of the NRC.

Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi issued the notice to the state and central asking for their views.

In October, the IPFT renewed its demand for a separate Tipraland state for tribals to protect and safeguard their socio-economic and political interests.

As the year drew to a close, Tripura is set to get a waterways between Sonamura in Sipahijala district and Ashuganj port in Eastern Bangladesh covering a distance of about 70 km.

This would facilitate transportation of goods from Kolkata to Ashuganj and then to Sonamura by small ships. (PTI)"

The Delhi High Court has directed police to expeditiously probe the death of a 12-year-old girl, who committed suicide after allegedly being rebuked and humiliated by her teacher.

The girl was found hanging in the bedroom she shared with her lawyer-mother in a locality in southwest Delhi on December 1.

Naming the school, principal, class teacher and another teacher as party to the petition, the mother approached the court seeking a CBI enquiry into the child's death, alleging that police was not probing the case properly.

Justice Najmi Waziri, before whom the plea came up for hearing, asked the area's Joint Commissioner to personally look into the matter and take legal action against the culprits within 48 hours. The judge also directed police to lodge an FIR into the incident and file a status report before January 10, the next date of hearing.

Advertising

Advocate R D Rana, appearing for the mother, alleged the girl had told her friends she would commit suicide and not meet them again. The counsel sought protection for the students, studying at a private school, so they could depose without fear.

He further submitted the Class VII student wrote the teacher's name on her palms and hands and the reason for her extreme step. The ""suicide note"" had said: ""meri suicide ki khabar school tak zarur pahuchana."" She had also written: ""Bye world,"" and ""Jai Shri Krishna I am coming"".

The counsel for Delhi Police told the court, ""We are waiting for the autopsy report and are recording statements of victim's classmates.""

The woman, a single mother, said in her petition that her daughter had complained of relentless humiliation at her teacher's hands. She further alleged her daughter had been insisting on changing schools. ""I (mother) had not realised how extreme it has been and that she would commit suicide,"" the plea said, adding ""her teacher used to rebuke her for trivial issues"".

Besides a CBI enquiry, the plea also called for a probe by an independent agency as the school management was ""trying to cover up the case"".

Soon after the incident, the school in a statement had said, ""... Police are presently conducting an enquiry into the case. We, as a responsible institution, are fully co-operating with the investigating authority and are also conducting an enquiry internally... We stand in solidarity with the family of the student in this difficult time, and assure them our full support in the proper and fair investigation of the case."""

Among the first decisions taken by Ashok Gehlot's government after assuming power in Rajasthan was to scrap minimum educational requirements for candidates contesting local body elections. This is a progressive move and will restore the right to contest, at least in theory, to a large section of the population in the State, where the literacy rate, according to the 2011 Census, was 52% for women and 79% for men. The previous government headed by Vasundhara Raje had stipulated, first through an ordinance in December 2014 and then through the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj (Amendment) Act passed in 2015, educational prerequisites to stand for local polls. It was made mandatory for candidates contesting for the post of sarpanch to have cleared Class 8, and for those in the fray in zila parishad and panchayat samiti elections to have passed Class 10. The move was ill-considered from the very beginning. At the time, the amendment was seen as a bid by the then BJP government to lower the average age of those in the fray based on the assumption that its voters tended to be younger. It was, however, an act of paternalism that militated against the basic assumptions of a liberal democracy. It penalised the people for failure to meet certain social indicators, when in fact it is the state's responsibility to provide the infrastructure and incentives for school and adult education. And it defeated the very purpose of the panchayati raj institutions, to include citizens in multi-tier local governance from all sections of society. These requirements had the effect of excluding the marginalised.

The Rajasthan government's decision should also force a rethink in Haryana, where the newly sworn-in BJP government had, also in 2015, legislated a series of eligibility requirements for panchayat elections, including education levels and a functional toilet in the candidate's home. The Haryana Panchayati Raj (Amendment) Act, 2015 was upheld that year by the Supreme Court in Rajbala v. State of Haryana. And the temptation to expand educational eligibility requirements remains. Union Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi, for instance, has previously spoken of persuading other Chief Ministers to take the cue from Rajasthan and Haryana, as an incentive for women to study. The decision of the new Congress government in Rajasthan should force a recasting of the debate on finding ways and means by which elected bodies are made more representative. In a liberal democracy, governments must desist from putting bars on who may contest, except in exceptional circumstances, such as when a candidate is in breach of particular laws. To mandate paternalistically what makes a person a 'good' candidate goes against the spirit of the attempt to deepen democracy by taking self-government to the grassroots."

""Send to everyone in your list. Shame on all 90 Cr Hindus. Ayodhya Ram mandir Babri masjid online voting is going on. Supreme court of India have left the decision to the citizens, But till now there are more votes for Babri masjid. So kindly all Hindus vote for Rammandir to be built in Ayodhya.""

A Hindi version of this WhatsApp message, complete with a voting link, made Sachin Agarwal's phone beep one May morning in 2018. The 30-year-old Faizabad (now Shri Ayodhya) resident read it many times over before he pressed 'delete'.

Later that evening, at a routine meeting of a local traders' association, he discovered that the same message had reached many in the town. Like Agarwal, who lives and works with his businessman elder brother, most of his friends and acquaintances chose to delete the message. It was another matter that the link was a fake one -- as reported in several news publications.

More than seven months later, the same WhatsApp message has resurfaced. With the cry for Ram Mandir growing louder, the timing seems a calculated affair. However, in Ayodhya, less than 7 km from Faizabad, this appeal for votes has evoked little response or interest.

The town is quietly contemplating the burden the upcoming Lok Sabha elections have placed on its shoulders. It is the plank that might decide the fate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre. But no one can say what it will get in return.

At the centre of communal and polarisation politics since the 1980s, Ayodhya has lost more to the demand of a Ram Mandir than it can recover. From the time the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) started a movement for the building of the temple, with the aggressive support of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Ayodhya has tried in vain to emerge as anything but a disputed site that divides religious communities.

In December 1992, the town watched in silent trepidation as lakhs of saffron-clad kar sevaks trooped in. And when the Babri Masjid was demolished on December 6, Ayodhya looked as helpless as the police cordon that failed to control the mob at the site. The countrywide riots that followed hit home hard. The name of the town became synonymous with communal strife, despite the fact that Ayodhya hasn't really voted for religion over development.

Ayodhya comes under the Lok Sabha constituency of Faizabad, which is currently represented by BJP MP Lallu Singh. Until 1971, the seat had Congress MPs. It then saw a mix of MPs from the Congress, BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP). And CPI candidate Mitrasen Yadav won the seat in 1989, when the Ram Janmabhoomi movement was at its peak.

Even when it chose a BJP candidate, Ayodhya, with a population of close to five lakh, didn't fall for the mandir-masjid agenda.

""More than anything else, the people of Ayodhya-Faizabad need development -- education, healthcare, better roads and housing, employment, so that we have an identity that is new, modern and untainted,"" says Sharad Kapoor, owner of Shan-e-Awadh, the oldest hotel in Faizabad. Like his two sons, who have returned to Faizabad after higher education to help run the family business, Kapoor refuses to be swayed by the gaining momentum in the demand for Ram Mandir.

He also recognises the appeasement politics behind initiatives such as the renaming of Faizabad and the lavish Deepotsav, a pre-Diwali festival held in the first week of November. The historic ghats of River Sarayu in Ayodhya were given an expensive facelift, dancers and artistes were flown in from several countries, and over three lakh lamps were lit along the river to create a Guinness World Record.

""When we cast our vote, we think only of the future -- with important lessons from the past. We have suffered for letting things happen, we can't afford a repeat,"" Kapoor adds.

Despite Kapoor's firm belief that a religious structure won't break Ayodhya's spirit, the locals are nervously watching the repeated attempts by political parties to hold rallies around or visit the Ram Janmabhoomi. They are also against the fear psychosis that led to some of Faizabad's Muslim families leaving town during Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's visit in November-end.

Guide Dharmendra Pandey, an Ayodhya resident, doesn't have an issue with having another temple -- his livelihood depends on tourists who pour in to pray at the town's countless temples. But he is aware that some of his neighbours and former school friends, as trainees in tech companies in Gurugram, Noida and Faridabad, earn twice as much as what he takes home after paying a commission to local travel agencies.

Given a choice, Dharmendra -- or his siblings who are also tour guides -- won't visit temples on a daily basis.

But his childhood friend Raja Pandey, employed at a car manufacturing unit in Manesar, Haryana, likes to visit Kanak Mahal and Hanuman Garhi temples whenever he comes home: ""I draw my identity from these temples in Ayodhya. Growing up here, we didn't understand why or how this so-called Ram Mandir is special. If it's so special, maybe it will solve all our problems, and I can then come and live here again,"" Pandey says.

With that hope in heart, he plans to take leave from work in summer 2019, so that he can cast his vote -- his first for Lok Sabha."

The State Cabinet's prompt move has come in for praise from civil society groups.

The State Cabinet has taken a slew of decisions, ranging from the elimination of educational qualification for Panchayati Raj elections, the reopening of universities and removal of Deendayal Upadhyaya's logo from official documents to direct elections for Mayor's post and the appointment of a committee on eligibility for the waiver of farmers' loans.

Health Minister Raghu Sharma said after the Cabinet meeting here that the State government would review all the decisions taken by the previous government in the last six months. Minister of State for Education Govind Singh Dotasara has also announced a review of school textbooks and other reference materials that were revised by the BJP.

The State government has abolished the criteria of educational qualification of candidates for Panchayati Raj bodies, introduced by the BJP regime through an Ordinance in 2014, to ensure that each citizen gets the right to contest. The qualification of 'Class X pass' was set for the Zila Parishad and Panchayat Samiti polls, and 'Class VIII pass' for Sarpanch elections.

The People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) has welcomed the move, saying it had done away with a ""highly discriminatory"" provision that had led to the exclusion of 73% of the population above 21 years of age in rural areas. ""This was an elitist law, denying equal opportunities to citizens who did not have the means for securing education,"" PUCL-Rajasthan president Kavita Srivastava said here on Monday.

Ms. Srivastava pointed out that a special leave petition challenging the amendment to the Panchayati Raj Act was still pending in the Supreme Court. ""After the State government's decision, we will argue in the apex court that the right to contest elections ought to be recognised as a fundamental right,"" she said.

The Congress government has also ordered the removal of the logo of Bharatiya Jan Sangh's co-founder Deendayal Upadhyaya from the official letterheads of Ministers and government functionaries. Social activist Sawai Singh, president of Rajasthan Samagra Seva Sangh, said there was no justification for eulogising an Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue and undermining the significance of the Sarnath pillar as the national emblem.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has handed over the Congress party's manifesto to the Chief Secretary with the direction that it should be treated as the State government's policy document. A Cabinet committee will also be constituted to ensure its effective implementation.

Among other decisions, the State Cabinet has revived the Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Law University and Haridev Joshi University of Journalism and Mass Communication, which were closed by the Vasundhara Raje government.

On the social security front, the Cabinet announced an increase in the amount of pension paid to widows and elderly and disabled persons. The Congress had protested against the halting of pensions for eligible beneficiaries during the BJP's rule."

Recently, a friend of mine and I were having a conversation about how 2016 and 2017 were just bad years through and through, like if they were people I would be convinced that they were out to get us. But, 2018, on the other hand, has been kind to us. Of course, it has had its share of ups and downs, but looking back I have to say, it has been a GOOD GOOD year. I may be personally partial because I just can't seem to remember a year in the recent past where it just felt like life is going alright or that the odds aren't stacked against me. Of course, it could just be that I decided to have an attitude check in place early on this year or that I have made a conscious effort to not let the little things kick me down.

December is my favourite month for many reasons. The obvious one being that it is holiday season and it is just impossible to be unhappy with all that joy and mirth all around you. There is also the fact that there is the excitement and all the possibilities that the new year being brings with it. For me, December is also a month of retrospection. I think that is also why I love writing up these round-ups. Life can be really overwhelming and sometimes we get caught up in the details and the bad moments to appreciate that life has been good.

My latest binge has been The Cable Girls, a Netflix Original about a few girls who work as telephone operators in Madrid during the late 1920s. This was a time when women, while allowed to work, struggled for liberation. The law was on the man's side even if he was an abuser. A woman couldn't withdraw cash from the bank without her husband's permission, and women could be arrested for attending feminist meetings. Somewhere in the second season of the show, the plotline puts focus on one of the characters who confronts her identity crisis. She realises that she always felt like she was a man trapped in a woman's body. Her quest for answers takes her to a psychiatric facility. She is tricked into staying on and put into a ""gallery for deviants"", and is subjected to torture. She is ultimately rescued from the facility by her friends. This show in many ways portrays the reality of what it meant to be someone who didn't fit into the rigid brackets set by the society only 90 years ago. Yes, we have come a long way in such a short time. Spain, in fact, is considered to be one the most LGBTQ friendly countries in the world, today. But, another way to look at this is that only 90 years ago the world was a much harsher place for both, women and the LGBTQ community.

The fight for equality has been a strenuous battle. A few decades ago, people actually went to jail for choosing to be true to themselves, or for loving someone of their own choice. As the fight moves forward, and as the demands we place changes, it is important to remember the victories-big and small- so that we never for a second take the freedom we enjoy for granted. It is important to remember to never stop fighting, and to remember that there is a light at the end of every tunnel. 2018 has been a good year for the LGBTQ community worldwide and now that the year is coming to a close, let's take a moment to revisit all the milestones we have made as a community:

However, earlier this year, on January 11, while presenting the annual Budget, Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu announced that welfare measures for transgender people would be viewed as a separate category. Unless they demanded otherwise, he said, transgender people would be treated as being below poverty line, which would grant them free life and medical insurance as well as a monthly sustenance pension for those aged 60 and above and registered with the Social Welfare Department. He also suggested that the government would bear the cost of gender reassignment surgeries for those who wanted them and proposed ""an initial provision of Rs one crore for their welfare."" While there are provisions of the policy that is problematic, considering it asks medical boards to determine a person's gender and issue a ""transgender certificate,"" it still needs to be applauded for being a step in the right direction.

February 23: Winter Olympics sees gay athletes make strides

In the 2014 Winter Games, only seven openly gay athletes participated while the 2018 Winter Games saw 14 openly gay athletes. However, that's not where the achievements end. Adam Rippon not only became the United States' first openly gay athlete ever to qualify for any Winter Olympics, but also became the first openly gay U.S. athlete to win a medal at the Winter Olympics.

February 27: Hollywood gives us Love, Simon

Based on the novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda by Becky Albertalli, Love, Simon is an American teen rom-com that follows the life of Simon Spier, a closeted gay high school boy. The movie was the first film ever released by a major studio to focus on a gay teenage romance.. While we do live in a world where there are so many gay role models to look up to, very of representations in pop culture often fail the community. The movie did successfully not only for its humor, plotline and most importantly for being a refreshing and accurate change in its representation of LGBTQ members.

17 April: Theresa May expresses ""deep regret"" for Britain's role in imposing colonial laws that criminalize LGBT people across the Commonwealth

Colonialism may have ended on paper decades ago, but we are very much influenced by its effects in our daily lives. India was one of the 53 countries where the coloniser had imposed laws that criminalized homosexuality along with a legacy of violence and discrimination that continues to exist today. At the time of the apology, 36 of 53 Commonwealth countries still had colonial-era criminalization laws. May expressed her regret over the fact many of the current laws across Commonwealth countries that criminalised homosexuality were a direct legacy of British colonialism; and offered support to any government that wanted to reform its legislation.

1 May: A sitting judge in the United States identities himself as bisexual.

At a Stonewall Bar event speech, Judge Mike Jacobs, a Republican trial judge in the DeKalb County State Court in Georgia, decided to come out as bisexual. Until Judge Jacobs came out as bi, there were no out bi judges on the bench -- presiding over either state or federal trials or appeals in any courts -- in this country.

8 June: The Indian Psychiatric Society declares that homosexuality is not an illness

In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association made history when it declared homosexuality was not a mental illness or sickness. In 1992, The World Health Organization (WHO) followed suit. While it took almost 26 years, the IPS, India's largest body of mental health professionals with about 3,000 members, issued the new policy declaring that homosexuality should not be treated as an illness. ""Certain people are not cut out to be heterosexual and we don't need to castigate them, we don't need to punish them, to ostracize them,"" IPS' president, Dr Ajit Bhide revealed in a video on social media.

29 June: Spain gets its first ever openly transgender Miss Spain

One of the greatest contentions that have existed about beauty pageants have been the fact that it is built upon the rigid and unforgiving ideas of what constitutes feminine beauty. History was made when Angela Ponce was crowned Miss. Spain becoming the first transgender woman to win the title. She went on to represent her country at Miss Universe 2018, as the first transgender contestant competing for the title. While she failed to make the top 20 no one can deny the fact that as a world we are bending down to the diversity of beauty.

13 July: Assam gets its first transgender judge

After Bengal and Maharashtra, Assam became home to its first transgender judge. 26-year-old Swati Bidhan Baruah, founder of the All Assam Transgender Association, was appointed to the Guwahati Lok Adalat. Last year Baruah had filed a PIL in Gauhati High Court prompting the state government to create a policy for welfare of the third gender. This was after her effort in 2012, when Baruah moved Bombay High Court in 2012 after her decision to undergo a sex reassignment surgery was opposed by her family. Baruah underwent the operation after it was cleared by the high court.

6 September: India partially decriminalizes section 377

The Indian Supreme Court handed down the 495-page judgment that finally struck down the archaic, colonial-era ban on consensual gay sex. While changing law and changing mindsets are completely different things, no one can deny the deep joy that resounded across the country the moment the verdict was given. The verdict has not only allowed people the freedom to love freely and be themselves without qualms but has also opened the door for legislations that would allow the LGBTQ community to truly enjoy the same rights accorded to all citizens.

22 September: The first royal same-sex wedding

The world had been so caught up in the Meghan Markle-Prince Harry royal wedding to pay attention to another monumental wedding that took place within the family. Lord Ivar Mountbatten married his same-sex partner, James Coyle, on the 22 of September 2018, becoming the first member of the British monarch's extended family to have a same-sex wedding. Lord Ivar is a third cousin, once removed of Queen Elizabeth II.

20 November: The 2018 blue wave shows hues of rainbow

The 2018 elections showed a record number of LGBT candidates with over 400 candidates running for office -- from city councils members to governor. The elections show high-profile personalities -- such as infamous whistleblower Chelsea Manning, who will be contesting a Maryland Senate seat, and actor Cynthia Nixon, who is challenging New York's governor Andrew Cuomo to Lupe Valdez, the first Latina and lesbian to run for governor in the nation. The elections have resulted in the election of 134 openly LGBTQ state house members who will be taking office in January."

Though 2018, young with expectations and hope for development, began on a slow and steady note with projects like the Kochi Water metro and Smart City receiving a boost, tragedy struck by the middle of the year, after a school van carrying pre-school children of a playschool fell into a temple pond at Ayani in Maradu.

This was to be the first among the many disasters Ernakulam would witness in the coming months.

Hardly a month later, Kerala woke up to another rude shock, the death of SFI member and Maharaja's College student Abhimanyu, which sparked state-wide protest and unravelled a story of political vendetta.

Migrant labourers were brought under the scanner after 22-year-old Nimisha, a native of Malayidamthuruthu, was hacked to death in Perumbavoor.

And even as Kochi prayed for brighter days, bad times came visiting again after Independence Day, when heavy rains led to flooding, rendering many homeless and looking for shelter in relief camps. Homes in Aluva, Paravoor, Varapuzha went underwater spiralling peoples lives out of control.

If that was not enough, the factional feud began rearing its ugly head in municipalities in and around Ernakulam. The nuns' protest demanding the arrest of Jalandhar Bishop Franco Mulakkal gained prominence at Vanchi Square in High Court.

Another nail in the coffin was the death of Ebin Paul an IT professional, a native of Kochi in October, who was killed in a road accident along the pot-hole ridden Kakkanad-Palarivattom route. Yet, despite the tragedies, Kochi did have its share of positive moments.

The Cochin International Terminal attained the one crore passenger benchmark this year while authorities also opened its renovated domestic terminal on a budget of Rs 240 crore. The water metro received a boost while eight small bridges connecting tiny islands under the Goshree Islands Development Authority (GIDA) at an estimated cost of Rs 38.40 crore were thrown open to the public.

The much-anticipated City Gas Pipeline project gathered steam. Adding to Kochi's bag of happiness was the 'conditional permission' granted by the city council to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) for digging up roads to laying optical fibre cable(OFC) and drawing overhead lines for their ambitious project.

The Kochi Muziris Biennale also took off on December 12.

Student politics play spoil sport

The murder of 20-year-old Abhimanyu, a BSc Chemistry student of Maharaja's College, cast a pall of gloom on nearly all college campuses It brought to light the intrusion of fanatics into educational institutions. Debates raged over the validity of campus politics. This was also the year which saw two women vice chancellors stepping down from their offices after a successful and fruitful stint. J Letha of Cusat and Rose Varghese of NUALS, proved to tough nuts when it came to making their institutions premier ones.

The rains, bandhs and hartals wreaked havoc on the academic calendar in 2018. The playschool van accident at Maradu led to the death of three including two children. Guidelines to be followed by the schools with regard to school buses and vans were drawn. However, it was not all that bad for the education sector. The year saw a spike in the number of admissions in government schools. Around 1.85 lakh students had sought admissions in government schools all over the state and the numbers were significant enough in the district too.

Kochi metro gets a push

The Kochi Metro, which is now an integral part of City's transport sector, focused on brand building activities mainly in 2018 along with launching some key steps in connection with Water Metro, the formation of Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) and second phase expansion of the Metro to Kakkanad. It also actively associated the flood relief activities. The KMRL conducted free services thereby helping the rescue workers to reach Aluva and supply relief materials. The agency also The reconstruction of Champakkara bridge was also launched along with the preparatory work at Petta- SN Jn stretch

Sorrow of motorists

City roads turned death traps this year. Ebin Paul's death along the pot-hole ridden Palarivattom-Kakkanad route shocked the collective conscience of the city. Officials, who were till then in a state of apathy, woke up from their slumber. The inaction of the authorities catapulted protests. It was the private bus owners, backed by organisations like the Kerala Private Bus Operators Association, who first threatened to suspend services in the route.

Fall of the football hype

A host of events kept Kochi busy in the year that passed by even though Kerala Blasters, the city's most high-profile team, endured a torrid time. Blasters suffered their worst run in ISL history, with popular coach David James facing the axe last week. It followed the fans' boycott of the last three matches. But the football fans were treated to some quality action earlier in the year when Spanish premier league club Girona and Australian Melbourne City played friendlies with Kerala Blasters.

Year of factional feuds

The Congress party has become synonymous with factional feuds. Local bodies such as Thrikkakara, Kochi Corporation, Kalamassery Municipality and Maradu Municipality witnessed a year of ugly politics too. In Kalamassery municipality, Jessy Peter had to step down after KPCC helped the Congress I faction oust her from the post and appoint Rukiya Jamal, wife of former chairperson Jamal Manakadan, as the new chair. At Thrikkakara municipality, the LDF once again came to the front with the Congress rebel Sheela Charu shifting to the LDF and becoming elected as chairperson. However, the factional feud in the Congress party at Corporation reached nowhere, though a section of Congress workers pushed for Shiny Mathew as the Mayor candidate.

Floods

Aluva, Kalamassery, Paravoor, Angamaly were the constituencies which bore the major brunt of the floods in Ernakulam. Lakhs of people were shifted to relief camps. The Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) at Nedumbassery, was shut down due to flooding for several days. Approximately 2 lakh people were displaced in Paravoor alone, as 60,000 homes were inundated in the aftermath of the floods, said Paravoor MLA V D Satheeshan. The livelihood of agricultural and dairy farmers weavers, fishermen went for a toss. The Chekutty doll from Chendamangalam rose as the symbol of resilience.

Upbeat health sector

At least 300 cases of leptospirosis resulting in two deaths broke out in the district post-floods. H1N1 cases also reared its ugly head. The silver lining, however, was the introduction of the Ernakulam District Comprehensive Cancer Control Programme aimed at the early detection of cancer. On the infrastructure front, new blocks are under construction at the General Hospital, Ernakulam Medical College and Cochin Cancer Research Centre. The year also marked the fifth anniversary of the government takeover of Ernakulam Medical College. ""Despite the floods, the quality and availability of health care remained stable. This year, we also received a major boost in the implementation of Ardram project,"" said Dr N K Kuttappan, DMO, Ernakulam."

The BJP storming to power ending 25 years of Left rule was the major news in Tripura in 2018 which saw some cracks in the ruling alliance with the IPFT fighting the panchayat elections separately and also raking up its separate Triparaland demand.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT) also differed sharply on the issue of a National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state like the one in neighbouring Assam.

The Lotus bloomed in Tripura in March after which a nine-member ministry headed by Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb took oath in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Congress, which hitherto used to be the main challenger to the Left Front in the state, lost ground and could not get even a single MLA elected to the 60-member House in the February poll.

Sudip Roy Burman, who headed the state Congress in the 2013 Assembly elections but switched over to the BJP this time, said, ""In 2013, the CPI(M) faced strong anti-incumbency but Congress central leadership had helped the CPI(M) in the state clandestinely for enjoying the party's support in Parliament.""

The BJP government initiated several steps to erase the legacy of the long Left rule.

A week before Deb shifted to the chief minister's residence, the state government changed the name of the road leading to it from 'Marx Angel's Sarani' to 'Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee Lane'.

After taking charge, Deb was in the news for the wrong reasons. He made several remarks that triggered widespread criticism -- the Internet and satellite communication existed during Mahabharata era, civil and not mechanical engineers should opt for civil services, educated youths should set up paan shops instead of seeking government jobs and youths should explore a career in the dairy field and keep cows.

He was also rapped for questioning the crowning of Diana Hayden as Miss World in 1997 and claiming that Rabindranath Tagore had rejected his Nobel prize in protest against the British government.

The new government conducted by-elections to 3,386 seats of local bodies -- 3,200 gram panchayat, 161 panchayat samiti and 18 zilla parishad -- in September after these fell vacant following large-scale resignations of elected representatives of the Left parties.

The BJP won unopposed 96 per cent of the gram panchayat and panchayat samiti seats and all the 18 zila parishad seats in the polls.

In November, the Tripura government announced doing away with the school curriculum of the Left regime from next academic session and replacing it with CBSE syllabus and also decided introduction of NCERT books for students.

The shift of power witnessed violent clashes between the CPI(M) and the BJP at many places during 2018.

The CPI-M state secretary had on March 4 alleged that at least two persons were murdered and 240 leaders and workers of the party were injured in BJP-IPFT sponsored post-poll violence in the state.

On April 10, CPI (M) leader Prakash Karat visited some areas in West Tripura district and said his party would not ""tolerate attacks on democracy"".

While the BJP and the IPFT bonded to overthrow the Left Front from power, differences soon started cropped up between them on several issues.

The IPFT fought the election to three-tier local bodies separately but could not stop the BJP's forward march in the state.

Soon after the publication of the final draft of the NRC in Assam on July 30, Deb said there was no demand for such a citizens' register. But the IPFT differed and demanded citizens' registration in the state.

On October 8, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Tripura government in response to a writ petition seeking revision of the NRC.

Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi issued the notice to the state and central asking for their views.

In October, the IPFT renewed its demand for a separate Tipraland state for tribals to protect and safeguard their socio-economic and political interests.

The IPFT placed the demand to a high power committee set up by the Ministry of Home Affairs to probe the socio-economic, cultural and linguistic problems faced by Tripura's tribal communities.

As the year drew to a close, Tripura is set to get a waterway between Sonamura in Sipahijala district and Ashuganj port in Eastern Bangladesh covering a distance of about 70 km. This would facilitate transportation of goods from Kolkata to Ashuganj and then to Sonamura by small ships."

But the 'smooth-sailing' has already taken and continues to take a toll not only on the authority of the elected representatives and governance by the executive, but also freedom of speech, freedom of dissent and freedom of association.

While the role of an 'unseen' hand in Pakistan's politics is not a secret any more, the past few months have witnessed it further creeping in and taking over the areas believed to be the sole domain of the elected authority. Regulating the media, for example, has also been virtually usurped by that very hand.

In the same token, the judiciary has overstretched its involvement from taking suo motu notices ranging from rates of daily commodities to observing water schemes, raiding hospitals, deciding school fee, ordering removal of illegal encroachments from markets and roads, and playing an overactive role in long-term projects such as developing and expanding the country's water resources by generating funds for the construction of dams.

One wonders what is left for the elected government to do. The forward push by the two major state institutions has forced the executive and legislature on the back foot while the fifth pillar, a free and independent media, has already resorted to the worst-ever self-censorship under pressure from losing corporate interests.

Journalists raising questions and criticising the prevailing situation are being forced out of the pages and their television programs either censored or shut down to end criticism.

Recently, the Pakistan military spokesperson, addressing a news conference, asked the media to report positive news for six months. Days later, the country's media supervisory body, called Pakistan Media Regulatory Authority or PEMRA, circulated an order titled ""advice"", asking the media offices not to report sexual abuses and crimes, etc, because, this is allegedly creating a negative image of Pakistan abroad.

Eighteen international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) have already been asked to close their offices, web pages of the Voice of America Pashto and Urdu language services have been blocked, while other media groups, both local and global, are under severe scrutiny for whether they are reporting ""positives"" and avoiding ""negatives"".

The latest step to achieve the goal of ""positive image"" includes strict surveillance of social media accounts with a focus on Facebook and Twitter. Reports and personal experiences shared by social media activists suggest their activity on the sites is closely monitored and often bombarded by trolls for raising voices against the faux pas of the newly elected government.

Pakistani authorities have already written letters and sent notices to Twitter about social media activity by a number of organisations and individuals. One must remember that YouTube had already gone through a ban in Pakistan. Under fear of intimidation, even common people think twice before posting on social media.

But where does all this lead to? Can Pakistan afford 1949 China-style ""thought reforms"", re-education of people through ""xinau"" or brainwashing to know the ""right ideas and the right questions and answers"" and to convert themselves into the ""New People""?

Notwithstanding the ideas of ""New Pakistan"" and ""tabdilee"" or change, by Prime Minister Imran Khan, the answer, to any sane mind, would be a certain 'no' because Pakistan is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural society with people strictly bound to their religions, faith and ideologies, and any adventure to put them in a single frame will not be without repercussions.

Keeping in view the worsening relations with the United States, long-term disputes with much bigger neighbour India, an unending war in Afghanistan, terror threat in the tribal territory, an insurgency-like situation in Balochistan and the emergence and expansion of new religious extremist groups in the mainland Pakistan, one may gauge the level of concerns in the security circles. But warding off such threats by favouring some and bashing and side-lining others will only exacerbate the problems.

From the pre-election season to election day in May this year followed by the formation of the new government, a majority of the political parties have expressed serious reservations about the whole process. Except for the ruling Tehrik-e-Insaaf party of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the rest have lodged their protest, raising accusing fingers at the security agencies.

Now, that the formation of the new government is over and the country's ""most favourite"" prime minister is in the driving seat, the opposition parties are still feeling the heat of being pushed to the corner through what they call ""a discriminatory attitude"".

The former ruling party, Pakistan Muslim League, is in hot water due to unproven cases of corruption and misuse of authority by the anti-graft National Accountability Bureau, or NAB. Ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam, the two most vocal leaders against the judicial activism and military's role in politics, were swiftly put behind bars days ahead of the election. The duo is now free but still facing the courts and maintaining a meaningful silence.

Another top leader, former president Asif Ali Zardari, who is also co-chairman of his late wife's Pakistan Peoples Party, openly expressed his anger against the judiciary and the army without naming a particular individual or institutions.

In a thinly veiled reference to the military, Zardari said those who have a fixed service tenure of three years have no right to take decisions about the future of the country. And in yet another line the same day, he warned the hyper judiciary against involvement in matters relating to the executive or parliament.

Nawaz Sharif, the three-time elected prime minister, when questioned by a journalist about his silence and that why he does not smile during his court appearances, replied that ""What can we say about smiling, we can't even cry if we want to"".

Be it politicians, journalists or common Pakistanis, there exists a sense of frustration the way they are losing their group and individual freedoms.

Whether this effort on curbing individual and group freedoms is planned or otherwise, the more likely result will be more dissent and polarisation in the society which has already witnessed an unprecedented level of schism during the May 2018 election.

Telgi died at a hospital in Bengaluru on October 23, 2017. He was suffering from brain fever.

It is alleged that between 1993 and 2002, he cultivated officers in the government security press in Nashik and purchased machinery at government auctions to print counterfeit stamp papers.

Telgi was arrested several years back in connection with the multi-crore fake stamp paper racket. He was convicted in several cases of counterfeiting.

Telgi's mother was Shariefabee Ladsaab Telgi, and his father was an employee of Indian Railways. His father died while he was young. Telgi paid for his own education at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya Khanapur, an English medium school, by selling fruit and vegetables on trains. Eventually, he moved to Saudi Arabia. Seven years later, he returned to India, at which time he allegedly began a career in counterfeiting, originally focusing on fake passports.

Telgi was alleged to have moved to more complex counterfeiting when he began to counterfeit stamp paper. He appointed 350 people as agents who sold the fakes to bulk purchasers, including banks, insurance companies, and stock brokerage firms. The size of the alleged scam was estimated to be more than Rs 200 billion (US$3.1 billion). One aspect of the scandal that caused much concern was that it required the involvement of many police officers and other government employees.

On 17 January 2006, Telgi and several associates were sentenced to 30 years rigorous imprisonment. On 28 June 2007, Telgi was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 13 years for another aspect of the scandal. He was also fined Rs 10 billion (US$160 million). The Income Tax Department requested that Telgi's property is confiscated to pay the fine. He had been in jail for 13 years. Mudrank (The Stamp) was a film based on the stamp scandal. It was finished in 2008, but Telgi filed legal challenges to prevent its release. Telgi alleged that the details covered in the film would damage his legal appeals."

2018 was a year of many firsts and records in Indian sport. While MC Mary Kom went on to win her sixth world title on home soil, teenagers like Sourabh Choudhary, Manu Bhaker, Anish Bhanwala and others took the shooting world by storm, winning medals at the Commonwealth and Asian Games and also at the ISSF World Cups.

On the cricket field, the Virat Kohli-led Indian side is on the brink of registering their first series win in Australia and the rise of Hima Das on the athletic track has made the world stand up and take notice of the talent that stormed to a World Under-20 Championship gold in what was her first full year on the international circuit.

Not to forget the exploits of Neeraj Chopra in Javelin Throw, success of Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat on the wrestling mat and the consistent performances of PV Sindhu which culminated in her winning the BWF World Tour Finals to sign off the year in style.

And the success of the Indian Table Tennis contingent at the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games. While India has been winning medals at the Commonwealth Games, the two bronze medals in Jakarta was one of the biggest success stories in Indian sports given the level of competition.

But none of the successes in sports come overnight and the seeds of the results -- positive or negative -- are always sown in the decisions or incidents that take place in the past.

For example, the rise of Das can be trailed back to two coaches in Assam identifying the raw talent of a girl in the local meets and India's sprint coach Galina Bukharina making her shift from the 100 and 200 metre events to the 400 after she joined the national camp.

Similarly, the seeds of success for the Indian teenage shooters were sown about three years back when the National Rifle Association of India launched its junior program under Indian coaches Jaspal Rana and Deepali Deshpande and their efforts finally bore fruit in 2018.

Here is a look at a few decisions or incidents which could shape the direction Indian sports could take in the coming years.

Opinions are clearly divided on the need for the Khelo India School Games (KISG) given that the School Games Federation of India (SGFI) and the National Sports Federations have been conducting age group events for years now to identify and nurture talent. The idea behind KISG stems from the Gujarat Government's Khel Mahakumbh experiment which over the years has managed to broaden the base of children taking up sport and nurturing sporting culture in the state.

The KISG, however, did not follow that model in the strictest sense and made it an event for elite athletes, raising questions about whether spending crores of rupees on yet another inter-school tournament was worth it.

The implementation and approach towards the program can be debated at length but there is no doubt that this is high time, the focus of Indian sports ministry and all stake holders shifted towards grassroot sports and nurturing talent from schools and junior colleges.

This year over 1500 students were selected under the talent identification scheme for support with almost two dozen academies identified for training of these selected athletes. The government also plans to support a few universities to create sports infrastructure in the coming years and hopefully build a robust school and college sports program that can consistently produce talent.

Ask any yesteryear's sports star about their journey to the top and they would credit the Inter-University tournaments as their stomping ground. But over the years, the All India Universities -- the parent body to conduct Inter University tournaments -- has been in doldrums and the haphazard ways in which the SGFI and AIU have been conducting their meets, the structure definitely needs a overhaul.

One can only hope that KISG evolves over the years and actually contributes to talent development and nurturing sports culture at the school or college level, failing which a lot of money would just go down the drain.

One of the major criticism about the National Sports Federations have been their reluctance to turn professional and over-dependence on the sports ministry for funding. There is a long way to go for this to change and sports federations to be self sufficient, but the NRAI and Wrestling Federation of India have shown the way with their strategic partnerships.

The Wrestling Federation has signed a long term deal with the Tata group while the JSW Group has pledged support to the shooting federation till the 2024 Paris Olympics.

The direct financial support in these deals may not be exponential but the Wrestling Federation has already introduced a Central Contract system on the lines of the Indian Cricket Board while the shooting federation plans to utilise the money to pay the Indian coaches better remuneration, a move that they believe can help end India's dependency on foreign experts in the next few years.

The Wrestling Federation which has been struggling to convince the Sports Ministry about the need for hiring foreign coaches for over a year now, has decided to hire a few experts on their own thanks to the support from their corporate partners and the players believe that such a move could actually give them and the federation more freedom to choose coaches and support staff of their choice.

In all the muddle created by infighting between two Committee of Administrators appointed to implement the Lodha Committee reforms, the fact that BCCI's new constitution has been made and cleared by the Supreme Court has been lost. According to the time line submitted by the CoA to the court, elections under the new constitution have to be held by March 2019 and though many state associations are resisting the change, they will sooner or later have to fall in line and implement the reforms if not in toto.

A similar exercise was undertaken in the Archery Association of India where Administrator S Y Quraishi conducted elections under the new constitution which he has drafted. The new constitution debars public servants from being part of the federation and gives a lot more representation to players.

The Indian Olympic Association and even the federation has decided to oppose the new constitution but if the Court puts its weight behind Quraishi's draft, then it could change the face of Indian sports administration.

There are many in other federations who are waiting with baited breath to move the courts seeking change and over throw the incumbents, who have run the federations as their fiefdom for decades.

The popular theme in all these proposed reforms is a bigger role for former players in administration. The argument that players are best placed to run sports federations efficiently is flawed given the fact that administration is a completely different ball game and not all players are competent enough to handle the job.

Most of them who are currently in administration have little or no formal education in administration and are basically functioning at the whims and fancies of their political masters or are merely surviving on their stature as elite sportspersons.

Internationally, many sports federations are run by former athletes but almost all of them have gone back to academics at the end of their playing careers to complete management degrees and rise through the ranks. May be, the amended constitutions will inspire more sports persons in India to take that route.

Age fraud has been an open secret in Indian sports but most federation would prefer to bury their head in the sand and pretend that the problem doesn't exist rather than take the bull by the horns and curb the menace.

Thanks to the sports ministry forcing their hand a few years ago, most of these federations have taken a few cosmetics steps like conducting random age verification tests but the results of which are hardly made public and the federations avoid taking any action against those found over age, hiding behind the argument that the results of the medical tests are not 100% correct.

But the social media outrage over Gourav Mukhi becoming the ""youngest goalscorer"" in the Indian Super League at 16 and the cognisance taken by the international media and hopefully by the international federations should be enough to wake the federations up from their slumber.

Over the last few years, as India has started performing on the international stage in age group tournaments, the chatter around the over age menace has been on the rise even internationally and the Mukhi controversy should be an indicator that in the age of social media and legally aware parents, they can't just ignore the problem.

If the Mukhi case actually leads to a proper system of investigating age fraud and curbing the menace, Indian sports would be indebted to the Jamshedpur FC striker, who is difficult to miss with his trademark moustache that belies his registered age with the AIFF.

The Indian anti-doping program came under scrutiny when the World Anti-Doping Agency decided to pick a considerable chunk of samples that were reported ""negative"" by the National Dope Testing Laboratory and over half a dozen of them came positive in retesting, including those of quartermile Nirmala Sheoran, middle distance runner Sanjivani Jadhav and others.

While the world body has the right to ask for any sample for retesting, what has surprised many is the number of samples WADA took for re-testing to their Montreal lab, clearly indicating lack of faith in the methods employed by the Indian lab.

There is a growing feeling that the National Anti Doping Agency has been far more lenient on top athletes in the past few years as they want to prove that doping incidents have reduced in India and a RTI by the Indian Express shows how the agency hardly tested the big names in the run up to the Asian Games.

But with WADA watching, NDTL runs the risk of losing its accreditation if it doesn't get its house in order. Hopefully that would be a good enough incentive for NADA to get the anti-doping program back on track and for the federations and Sports Authority of India to educate the medical staff attached with the teams on how to tackle the menace."

Delhi's oldest Ghazipur landfill and Asia's largest dumping ground - Deonar in Mumbai, continued to gather waste despite the Supreme Court ordering a closure of these landfills. Meanwhile, Delhi's biggest garbage dump- Bhalswa landfill caught fire that took three days to douse. Recently, Mumbai's second largest dumping ground - Mulund landfill was permanently closed after it reached its saturation point and then there was the fire at Ahmedabad's sole landfill site at pirana, where fumes emitting from garbage are a common sight for passersby.

While landfills continue to be an eyesore in the urban landscape and a crisis that most cities are grappling with, there were a few notable exceptions - Indore, and Ambikapur that declared themselves landfill free and emerged as benchmarks that others can follow.

According to the Central Pollution Control Board report of 2015-2016 which have the last collated figures on the implementation of Solid Wastes Management Rules, 2016, over 1.3 lakh (1,35,198.27) tonnes of solid waste is generated per day in India. Of the total waste generated, while over one lakh tonnes per day (1,11,027.55 TPD) is collected, only a fraction - 25,572.25 TPD is treated and 47,415.62 TPD is landfilled.

To make sure cities go waste free, government also introduced seven star-rating under Swachh Survekshan - a pan India exercise to assess cleanliness in urban India. The seven star rating is the first-of-its kind rating tool for assessing cleanliness of cities and towns in India, designed on a SMART approach that stands for Single metric, Measurable, Achievable, Rigorous verification and Targeted towards outcomes. The criteria to achieve seven star rating is 100 per cent door-to-door waste collection, 100 per cent waste treatment and waste free local water bodies.

The Current Status: The national capital Delhi is home to three of the biggest landfills namely Ghazipur, Okhla and Bhalswa, which have out lived their life and are now unable to take the burden and collapsing under the weight of the waste. A fact that is borne out by the recent events with the Ghazipur dump yard collapsing in 2017, claiming two lives and Bhalswa and Okhla landfill smouldering continuously. The sad part is, despite all this, little to nothing has been done in 2018 to improve the status of landfills with 60-70 metre high mountain of garbage.

All kinds of waste that is wet, dry and toxic is collected together and dumped at a landfill. Once wet waste starts rotting and decomposing then you have formation of methane gas which is not only a toxic greenhouse gas, but flammable also. Because of the same, landfills are always under fire. It is just sometimes it is huge and someone passing sees it, makes a video and posts it on social media and it becomes news, says Chitra Mukherjee, Head of Programmes, Operations, Chintan.

""In Delhi, till date, about 10,500 tonnes of waste is collected per day. 6,100 TPD still goes to waste to energy plant and this is all mixed waste. Only 200 TPD gets composted"", says Swati Singh Sambyal, Programme Manager, Waste Management, Center for Science and Environment.

The Problem: Currently, a portion of collected waste is dumped at some or the other landfill and remaining is treated at waste-to-energy (WTE) plants at Sarojini Nagar, Narela-Bawana, Ghazipur and Okhla. But are these WTE plants effective? Will they solve the problem?

Municipalities keep talking about WTE plants, but honestly they are pathetic, because all kinds of waste goes into it and is burned. WTE plants are neither meeting emission norms, nor helping in waste segregation and then recycling, says Chitra.

The problem in Delhi is lack of accountability and enforcement of Solid Waste Management Rules (SWMR) of 2016. It has been two years and not even single law has been implemented so far, reason being, as East Delhi Municipal Corporation says, lack of funds to provide vehicles and other necessary things to waste pickers. As part of SWMR, waste should be segregated at source and if not then defaulters will be penalised, but according to experts, not even single case has been registered.

Also Read: Swachh India: Guide To Solid Waste Management Rules 2016

Segregation of waste at source ensures that biodegradable waste like kitchen waste is composted, waste like plastic that can be recycled is sent to relevant facilities and only what remains make it way to the landfill. Unlike now where bulk of the waste is piling up at these landfills.

The Solution: To deal with the humoungous amount of waste, earlier this year Supreme Court asked Lieutenant Governor of Delhi to form a committee and come up with solutions. A 24 member team comprising children, civil society members, RWA (Resident Welfare Association) representatives, municipalities and others was formed and the committee is expected to submit its report in the first week of 2019.

Also Read: Despite New Waste Management Rules, Delhi's Ghazipur Landfill Grows 15 Metres In A Year

The committee is of the opinion that effective enforcement of SWMR of 2016 will help in managing the waste and making municipalities accountable. Being a member of the committee, Chitra knows the on ground issues and says,

The problem is citizens do not connect their responsibility with the landfill. Lot of people complain that we segregate waste at home, but waste pickers mix it. So, who is at fault? Of course, the municipalities as they do not have a dedicated stream for segregated waste.

For remediation that is to stop the environmental damage being caused by Bhalswa landfill, lifespan which lapsed in 2009 and yet it continues to be in use a decade later, a nine member Scientific Advisory Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Dr. Manoj Dutta, Professor, IIT Delhi. According to the committee's recommendation, adoption of landfill mining (process of excavating landfilled solid wastes and processing it) is not a viable option. In the first stage, the committee has asked the municipal corporation to carry out site characterisation under which it needs to collect data on the quantum of waste under and above the ground, type and quality of waste, and other parameters for assessing the current state of the landfill. Once it is done, the nine member committee will prepare the design of the work to be done at the Bhalswa landfill site. While the investigation and design of the project is under progress, execution of plan is scheduled for March 31, 2020 which is still one and a half years from now. If that works well, similar steps can be taken for Ghazipur and Okhla landfill, maybe.

The Experts Opinion: Talking about the steps taken in 2018 and the way forward to deal with active volcanos in the city, Chitra says,

Nothing has happened in 2018, apart from passing the buck. With the committee submitting its report to the apex court, we hope municipalities to take some action in 2019, implement waste segregation, and especially SWMR.

The Current Status: Maharashtra's capital Mumbai is a densely populated city that generates 7,000 metric tonnes of waste per day that directly goes to two dumpyards - Deonar (holding city's waste from over 9 decades) and Mulund and to scientific landfill - Kanjurmarg. After observing the condition of the Deonar and Mulund dumping grounds and noting how they have reached their saturation points, in February 2016, the Bombay High Court had ordered the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to close down the two dumping grounds. It is in October this year that Mulund dumping ground was finally closed permanently, but Deonar continues to function way past its lifespan.

Also Read: Landfill Crisis: Garbage Dumping Ground At Mulund In Mumbai Permanently Shut

There is no such saturation point for landfills. As far as Deonar is concerned, there is still some space as we have started processing waste and have more plans to manage the waste effectively in the days to come, says BMC official.

While bio-mining and capping (a containment technology that forms a barrier between the waste and the ground, shielding humans and the environment from the harmful effects of its contents) is being practised at Mulund landfill, bio-reactor (under which liquids are added to help bacteria break down the waste) and composting has been adopted at Kanjurmarg. But the question is, are these solutions sufficient and effective?

The BMC's Opinion: ""The process of bio-reactor is useful for mixed waste as well, so the good thing here is we don't have to pay heed to waste segregation. But it is not that we are ignoring waste segregation at source"", says BMC official.

With increase in waste load, BMC plans to increase the processing of waste at Kanjumarg by March end. The plan is to treat upto 5,800-6,000 metric tonnes of waste at Kanjurmarg and leave only 1000-1200 metric tonnes per day at Deonar.

Also Read: After Delhi's Ghazipur Tragedy, Is 90-Year-Old Mumbai's Deonar Landfill To Face The Same Fate?

While 5,000 tonnes will be treated via bio-reactor, 1,000 tonnes will be composted. We are strengthening the segregation activity which will further reduce the total generation and load on Deonar, says BMC official.

The Problem: Until October, of all the waste generated, 1400-1500 metric tonnes was dumped at Mulund dumping ground, every day. Now the same waste is being shared by Deonar and Kanjurmarg landfill, increasing the waste burden on already overstretched landfills. Deonar which expired back in 2009 is still being used recklessly and the result is constant fumes emerging from garbage, leading to instances of fires.

Though BMC has plans to treat waste on a daily basis, but what comes up as a major problem is the legacy waste. Lack of waste segregation at source comes up as another issue as without segregation the amount of waste reaching the landfills cannot be reduced.

The Solution: As experts say, decentralised process and segregation is the key to manage the mammoth waste and BMC is currently focusing on segregation. Shedding light on the same, BMC official says,

We have floated the tender, asking for vehicles with compartments to collect the segregated waste. 40 per cent of the requested vehicles are already in action and the remaining will be up soon. This will of course ease the entire process as dry waste will further get segregated into e-waste, plastic, paper, and others and treated accordingly.

Steps Taken By BMC In 2018: BMC has made it mandatory for bulk generators to treat wet waste at source. The ones failing to do so will be penalised as per the law. For residents and small scale waste generators, awareness camps, exhibitions and activities are being organised. People are being educated about the process of wet waste management at home and encouraged to practice the same.

Until and unless waste generators take the responsibility, we cannot do much. If at home you will segregate the waste, it will be easy for us to treat it as centralised processing centers cannot segregate the 7000 tonnes of waste. It has to start from your own home, building, society and colonies, says BMC official.

The Experts Opinion: ""I agree that waste generators need to take action, but decentralised process is pivotal. Like authority cannot lie in an individual's hand, entire waste cannot be managed in one way. Different kinds of waste need to be treated in different way and for the same we need different strategies"", says Chitra.

Earlier in 2013-2014, the waste load on dumping ground in Mumbai used to be 9,400 tonnes which has now come down to 7,000 tonnes and BMC further plans to bring it down to 6,000 tonnes. Can this be achieved? Given the scale of the crisis, the city sure will have its fingers crossed.

Bengaluru, the IT capital of India, is infamous for its garbage crisis and holds the title of 'garbage city of India'. A city with a population of 1.23 crore generates 4,000 metric tonnes of waste on a daily basis. The waste is majorly categorised into dry, wet and sanitary waste. While the dry waste is collected and taken to 164 dry waste collection centers, wet waste is sent to eight processing units, together capable of treating 2,300 tonnes per day and sanitary waste is being treated by a private company.

Along with this, we have organic waste converter (treatment and recycling of solid and liquid refuse material) of capacity 1500 tonnes. 30 per cent of apartments in the city are doing composting on site. Also, we have a learning center where we give lessons on how to do composting, manage waste and other things. Main aim is to encourage waste segregation at source, Sarfaraz Khan, Joint Commissioner, Solid Waste Management, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).

As far as mixed waste is concerned, it is simply dumped at scientific landfill - Bellahalli in the city, which came into existence around three years ago. In November, the orders were given to close Bellahalli landfill within 90 days, but civic body has decided to use the landfill for six more months and then convert it into a motor racing track. As part of the functioning of scientific landfill, currently, at frequent intervals, waste is covered with a thick layer of mud.

Earlier the city of Bengaluru was known as the garbage city, but today we are proud to say that this tag does not belong to us, Sarfaraz Khan.

The reason Mr Khan proudly says this is how in past a quarry turned into landfill was transformed into a beautiful park. Few years ago, the stone quarry at Bagalur was abandoned, after which it had become a dangerous spot due to the 200 feet deep pit. Slowly and gradually, the site turned into a dumping ground, raising concerns among villagers. It is three years ago, BBMP noticed the site and claimed it for a scientific landfill site. The scientific landfill would intake 300-400 tonnes of mixed waste everyday. After every 8 - 10 feet of garbage, 8 feet of mud capping was given. This way, by August 2017, quarry was filled and saplings of neem and amla and flowering plants like crotons were planted on it.

BBMP has done a lot in 2018 to improve waste management in the city. There is a new 'Swachagraha Kalika Kendra', a composting learning center for home and community, Bengaluru is the only city to collect sanitary waste separately, black spots are being cleaned. A lot has been done, but there is still a long way to go. We have infrastructure and policies, but what is lacking is the implementation and streamlined waste collection system. I feel citizens working with officials and elected representatives makes a good combination and together they can solve the crisis, says Nalini, co-founder, Hasiru Dala.

Madhya Pradesh's Indore has managed to grab the title of India's cleanest city for two years in a row. To maintain the lead in Swachh Survekshan 2019 as well, the city took some stringent steps this year with regards to waste management. From implementing 100 per cent door-to-door waste collection, source segregation, scientific land filling, to eliminating decade old waste from landfills, the city has done it all. It is not just focusing on treating household waste, but plastic and construction and demolition waste management as well.

Indore city generate 1100 metric tonnes of waste per day and we cannot leave this enormous amount of waste just like that. To manage the waste, a decentralised waste treatment system exists at each and every hospital, school, RWA, and other such places which make waste treatment possible at source only. The waste which is not treated goes to centralised waste treatment system handled by IMC and there it is taken care of, says Asad Warsi, Swachh Bharat Mission Consultant.

20 metric tonnes of waste generated in fruit and vegetable mandi (market) is used to power its public transport buses. A bio-mechanisation plant is installed in the market which ends up generating three types of gases from the waste generated in the fruit and vegetable market - Methane, Carbon dioxide (CO2), and Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S). Methane is separated, cleaned, purified and compressed and then converted into bio CNG which can fuel 20-25 buses every day.

Can waste generate wealth? Yes, as ambikapur proves it by earning lakhs. Chhattisgarh's Ambikapur has a population of 1.45 lakh and generates 52 metric tonnes of waste on a daily basis, but instead of dumping it on some or the other dumpyard, the city converts waste into wealth and makes Rs. 20-25 lakh per month.

In the year 2015, the municipal corporation made it compulsory for citizens to segregate the waste at source. Since then, every morning, 447 sanitation workers go out, collect the segregated waste which is further segregated at 17 secondary segregation centres within the city. The segregated waste is then sent for recycling, composting and other kinds of processing, depending on the of waste.

Because of the same, the city was awarded as one of India's best city in 'Innovation and Best Practices' (population 1 - 3 lakh) category in Swachh Survekshan 2018.

The state of Chhattisgarh, which got third rank in Swachh Survekshan 2018, is on the way of following Ambikapur's zero waste model to become India's first zero-landfill state. If Ambikapur can do it, other cities of Chhattisgarh can think of doing it, then why not rest of India?, says Suryakiran Tiwari Agarwal, Municipal Commissioner of Ambikapur.

The success story of Indore, Ambikapur, and especially Kerala's Alappuzha which was even recognised by the United Nations Environment Programme for being exceptional in addressing the garbage crisis, show that managing waste effectively is possible. Decentralised system with segregation at source is a viable option and the way forward, according to experts."

After forming government in Assam last year, the BJP stormed to power in Tripura and ended 25 years of Left rule the the state.

The BJP storming to power ending 25 years of Left rule was the major news in Tripura in 2018 which saw some cracks in the ruling alliance with the IPFT fighting the panchayat elections separately and also raking up its separate Triparal and demand.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT) also differed sharply on the issue of a National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state like the one in neighbouring Assam. Lotus bloomed in Tripura in March after which a nine-member ministry headed by Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb took oath in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Congress, which hitherto used to be the main challenger to the Left Front in the state, lost ground and could not get even a single MLA elected to the 60-member house in the February poll.

Sudip Roy Burman, who headed the state Congress in the 2013 assembly elections but switched over to the BJP this time, said, ""In 2013, the CPI(M) faced strong anti-incumbency but Congress central leadership had helped the CPI(M) in the state clandestinely for enjoying the party's support in Parliament.""

BJP workers celebrated the end of the red bastion in Tripura by bringing down a five-feet-tall statue of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin at Belonia town, the district headquarters of South Tripura district on March 4. The BJP government initiated several steps to erase the legacy of the long Left rule.

A week before Deb shifted to the chief minister's residence, the state government changed the name of the road leading to it from 'Marx Angel's Sarani' to 'Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Lane'. After taking charge, Deb was in the news for the wrong reasons. He made several remarks that triggered widespread criticism -- the Internet and satellite communication existed during Mahabharata era, civil and not mechanical engineers should opt for civil services, educated youths should set up paan shops instead of seeking government jobs and youths should explore a career in dairy field and keep cows.

He was also rapped for questioning the crowning of Diana Hayden as Miss World in 1997 and claiming that Rabindranath Tagore had rejected his Nobel prize in protest against the British government. The new government conducted by-elections to 3,386 seats of local bodies -- 3,200 gram panchayat, 161 panchayat samiti and 18 zilla parishad -- in September after these fell vacant following large-scale resignations of elected representatives of the Left parties.

The BJP won unopposed 96 per cent of the gram panchayat and panchayat samiti seats and all the 18 zila parishad seats in the polls. In November, the Tripura government announced doing away with the school curriculum of the Left regime from next academic session and replacing it with CBSE syllabus and also decided introduction of NCERT books for students. The shift of power witnessed violent clashes between the CPI(M) and the BJP at many places during 2018. The CPI-M state secretary had on March 4 alleged that at least two persons were murdered and 240 leaders and workers of the party were injured in BJP-IPFT sponsored post poll violence in the state.

On April 10, CPI (M) leader Prakash Karat visited some areas in West Tripura district and said his party would not ""tolerate attacks on democracy"". While the BJP and the IPFT bonded to overthrow the Left Front from power, differences soon started cropped up between them on several issues. The IPFT fought election to three-tier local bodies separately but could not stop the BJP's forward march in the state. Soon after the publication of the final draft of the NRC in Assam on July 30, Deb said there was no demand for such a citizens' register.

But the IPFT differed and demanded citizens' registration in the state. On October 8, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Tripura government in response to a writ petition seeking revision of the NRC. Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi issued the notice to the state and central asking for their views. In October, the IPFT renewed its demand for a separate Tipraland state for tribals to protect and safeguard their socio-economic and political interests.

The IPFT placed the demand to a high power committee set up by the Ministry of Home Affairs to probe the socio-economic, cultural and linguistic problems faced by Tripura's tribal communities. As the year drew to a close, Tripura is set to get a waterways between Sonamura in Sipahijala district and Ashuganj port in Eastern Bangladesh covering a distance of about 70 km. This would facilitate transportation of goods from Kolkata to Ashuganj and then to Sonamura by small ships."

The statement is rooted in the belief that iPhones are so expensive that you will need to sell your organs to buy one. However, a new story shows how such a measure could lead to tragic turn.

According to Oriental Daily, a Chinese media platform, Xiao Wang went to such extremes and sold one of kidney to buy iPhone 4 almost seven years ago. Call it Wang's ill fortune, the decision did not work out the way he would have anticipated. The report states that when iPhone 4 was launched, Wang was only 17 and at that time, the iPhone 4 was described as a ""must-have"" device in this school. In fact, those who owned one were treated differently and Wang, now 24, decided that he needs to have one as well.

In his quest to own iPhone 4 whatsoever, Wang realized that his family's financial situation would not allow for him to buy Apple's shiny new smartphone. He then started looking for ways to procure additional cash needed to buy the iPhone 4 and eventually he was informed about an underground operation where he could sell his kidney for cash.

Wang's decision was supported by information that he needed only one kidney to survive. An underground hospital that he found offered him an estimated RMB 22,000 (around Rs 223,300 or $3,200), which was more than enough to buy the newest iPhone from Apple. Wang did not think through and sold his kidney. At the time of operation, Wang was told that he would be able to lead a normal life after a week of recovery. However, what he did not know back then was that the operating environment was not sanitized properly, leading to infection on his wound.

""Worse still, his parents were kept in the dark about this major operation and only found out when the teen became terribly sick from the infection,"" the report mentioned. By the time Xiao sought proper treatment from a proper hospital, the function of his single kidney had deteriorated to an extent that he has been forced to bed for the past seven years and his family was pushed into financial crisis due to expenses incurred for dialysis and other treatments.

The report notes that both the arbitrator and the illegal hospital which performed the process on Wang were brought to justice. Xiao's family reportedly received ""sufficient"" monetary compensation from the court. However, the ordeal has been so long and so hard that Wang has already lost his youth and dialysis is only expect to further complicate his ideas of leading a normal life. It is one of the many stories of a desire to own Apple's flagship product taking a catastrophic turn.

Unravelling the mystery behind the deaths of 11 members of a family in Burari, naming Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a charge sheet in the chief secretary assault case and cracking the CBSE board papers leak case were some of the cases that kept Delhi Police busy in 2018.

The year also saw Delhi Police concluding its investigation in the Sunanda Pushkar death case as it filed a nearly 3,000-page charge sheet in a city court in May accusing senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor of abetting his wife's suicide.

Ever since Pushkar was found dead in the suite of a south Delhi hotel on January 17, 2014, the case remained in news and the police also earned criticism for its probe.

The uneasy relationship between the AAP dispensation and Delhi Police continued as the police filed a charge sheet against Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia naming them as accused along with 11 AAP MLAs in the assault on chief secretary Anshu Prakash in February.

The AAP ministers dubbed the police charge sheet as ""bogus"" and said it was another example of a witch hunt by the Modi government. Delhi Police again came in for criticism from the government for its ""lax security"" after a man threw chilli powder at Kejriwal outside his office in the Delhi Secretariat in November.

The Delhi Assembly adopted a government resolution claiming that the city has become the ""national crime capital"" which was met with rebuttal by the police which said it was incorrect as the number of heinous crimes declined this year from that in 2017.

The Crime Branch and Special Cell of Delhi Police had a busy year as they worked on many cases that were transferred to them from the local police.

While the Umar Khalid attack case was transferred to the Special Cell which said the attack on the JNU student leader in August was carried out by cow vigilantes, the Crime Branch was tasked with investigating the flight attendant suicide case as her family felt the local police was carrying out a ""biased"" probe.

The Special Cell had some big catches which included the arrest of Bilal Ahmed Kawa, suspected to be involved in the 2000 Red Fort attack, and Abdul Subhan Qureshi, known as 'India's Osama bin Laden' who was wanted for being the main conspirator of the 2008 Gujarat serial blasts.

The unit was also involved in busting the ""self-styled"" vigilante group Kranti Gang, in June after several months of tracking.

Touted to be one of the biggest encounters by the unit, gangster Rajesh Bharti and his three associates were killed while eight police personnel were injured in south Delhi's Chhatarpur.

The year also saw several gunfights among gangsters. In north Delhi's Burari area, two criminal gangs opened fire at each other in June, killing three persons, including a woman passer-by.

The bloodbath was a result of the gunfight between the Tillu and Gogi gangs, believed to be involved in cases of extortion and murder in the city.

Few days after this incident, Burari was in the news again as 11 members of a ""prosperous"" and ""god-fearing"" family were found dead.

While bodies of 10 members of the family were found hanging with their hands and feet tied and their mouth gagged, the matriarch was found dead in a separate room.

The discovery of 11 registers, which had notings about a set of rituals to be carried out to appease God lifted the mystery off the deaths and a psychological autopsy revealed that the 11 members did not commit suicide, but it was an ""accident that occurred during a ritual"".

Before the Crime Branch got into solving the Burari case, it handled the CBSE papers leak case.

Fate of lakhs of students was put at stake after an Una-based teacher allegedly leaked CBSE Class 12 economics paper and Class 10 Mathematics paper in March.

Crime against women continued to be on the rise with 1,983 cases of rape reported till November 30.

Cases of child sexual abuse underlined how vulnerable are the children in the spaces usually considered safe for them.

From an eight-month-old girl being raped by her cousin in northwest Delhi's Subhash Place to a Class 2 student of a New Delhi Municipal Council-run school being raped in the upscale Gole Market area by an electrician on the institute premises in August, police officers grappled with cases of sexual abuse that demanded utmost sensitivity from them.

Among the 459 cases of murder that were reported until November 30, some of the sensational ones included the killing of Ankit Saxena by the family members of a woman whom he was in love with since they belonged to different communities.

In June, the killing of an Army Major's wife by a fellow officer since he was obsessed with her grabbed headlines.

The police had their plate full as they also solved cases which drew the social media ire after videos of some incidents went viral.

A Delhi policeman's son was arrested after a video in which he could be seen brutally thrashing a woman went viral, prompting the Union Home Minister to tweet that he had directed Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik to take action in the matter.

Another video that shocked netizens was one in which Ashish Pandey, son of a former BSP MP, could be seen brandishing a pistol at guests at a five-star hotel in October."

She has attended two street rallies already, but has almost a dozen more houses to visit and distribute pamphlets before calling it a day. ""This is the need of the hour,"" she says, walking past houses, tea-shops, libraries, among others in her neighbourhood, where, like during the historic floods in August, all discussions have converged into a single topic: a wall.

In this, one might say, Kerala, the seat of the only elected communist government in India, may have unwittingly found something in common with United States, the first country of the liberal capitalism, where President Trump's proposal to build a wall has generated a heated debate.

Geetha is one among the millions of women who are canvassing people to join a symbolic wall Kerala's Left Democratic Front administration is building on 1 January, expected to be one of the biggest demonstrations in the state in the recent past. But, like in the US, the wall has also become a most polarised idea in Kerala.

Titled 'Vanitha Mathil' (Women's Wall), the idea is to have more than one million women join hands along multiple national highways, all the way from Kerala's northern tip called Kasargod district to its southern capital Thiruvananthapuram, as if in an unbroken chain of bricks in a symbolic wall.

While many women agree with the wall's official motive, to feature Kerala's renaissance history and women empowerment credentials, many others, like actor Manju Warrier, have backed out citing its political overtones, especially its relation to the Sabarimala issue.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has posited the wall as a signature campaign to prevent the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s biggest expansion yet in Kerala using the Sabarimala issue. Over the last few months, the BJP has been at the forefront of several agitations in Kerala, to prevent women's entry in Sabarimala against the Supreme Court's decision to cancel a ban on women of childbearing age in the temple. In December, the party also created a national cell in an attempt to take the campaign against the Left at a national level.

Some others who would have otherwise joined a pro-left rally have also backed out, like writer Sara Joseph, who do not see the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), CPM, or the chief minister as a credible agent of renaissance, especially after a party legislator P K Sasi was not asked to resign, even though suspended, after a woman within the ranks raised a sexual assault allegation. Dalit leader Sunny M Kappikad has also backed out citing Vijayan administration's non-committal stand on provide security to women who want to visit Sabarimala bracing right wing protests.

However, the CPM is leaving no stones unturned in its efforts to make the campaign a major success. ""Three women for each meter, that's our calculation. Kerala's road-length is about 490 km, so we shall have 1.64 lakh women. In districts such as (hilly district) Idukki, where the wall is not passing by, we have arranged about 200 buses to ferry women to nearby Ernakulam district,"" said a CPM leader, requesting not to be named.

The CPM also has the backing of other 200 odd organisations whom the administration sees as the legacies of the renaissance movement, including dominant leader of the lower caste Ezhava community, Vellappally Nateshan, who is an ally of the BJP but has a blow-hot-blow-cold relationship with the saffron party.

""What is going on right now is a political battle in view of the coming election,"" said BRP Bhaskar, veteran journalist and a political commentator. ""The reason why the BJP and the RSS have not able to get a foothold here yet is that there is a voter in Kerala which is a product of its renaissance period. At this moment, regardless of its motive, people are forced to take a side in the fight between these two parties, otherwise it means a recession of renaissance and a victory for the pro-temple side. Our choices are always very limited."""

This was a year for consolidating the gains that have accrued from major policy decisions taken in the previous four years, a time for monitoring of ongoing projects, tackling road blocks and adding to the already impressive pace of work achieved last year. The Ministry took a decision to complete all ongoing projects that had been awarded upto 2015-16, and placed the highest ever target of constructing at least 12,000 kms of national highways as against 9829 kms achieved during 2017-18, and make special efforts to take this length to 16000 km. Overall, more than about 61,300 km length of road projects, costing more than Rs. 6.48 lakh crore, are in progress at present. The balance ongoing works (which have been awarded, appointed dates declared and works going on at sites) are more than 30,200 kms during the year. In the first nine months of FY 2018-19, 5,759 km has been completed in 18-19 against 4,942 km up to same period in last year.

1.2 In order to achieve this target the Ministry brought in policies, guidelines and practices for expediting pre-construction activities and bringing in more efficiency and transparency in the process. The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS)was developed to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC Mode. BhoomiRashi portal is being used extensively for expediting the process of notification for land acquisition. The portal BIMS and BhoomiRashi portals have further been linked with Public Financial Management System(PFMS) to facilitate real time payment to beneficiaries.

1.3 On the finance front too, National Highways Authority of India did a successful financial closure of its first project under Toll- Operate -Transfer this year andoffered 586 km of national highways under the second bundle. The first TOT bundle of 9 projects, totaling approximately 681 KM of roads in two states of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, was awarded earlier during the year for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the Authority's estimate. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) also got an unsecured loan of Rs 25,000 crore from State Bank of India for 10 years with 3 years of moratorium on repayments. This is the largest amount of loan to have been sanctioned to NHAI in one stroke by any institution. This is also the largest long term unsecured loan sanctioned by SBI at a time to any entity.

A two days long exercise was conducted to review of over 700 ongoing National Highway projects in the country, and over 300 projects were identified to be completed by 2019 achieving the highest ever construction in financial year 2018-19.

The table below details the trends of NH construction over the years.

This is the umbrella program for the highways sector unrolled in 2017-18, that aims to optimize the efficiency of road traffic movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. 34,800 km of National Highways are to be constructed under the Phase-I of the programme between 2017-18 to 2021-22 in a phased manner at a cost of Rs. 5,35,000 crore. This includes 5,000 kms of the National Corridors, 9000 kms of Economic Corridors, 6000 km of Feeder Corridors and Inter-Corridors, 2000 kms of Border Roads, 2,000 kms of Coastal Roads and Port Connectivity Roads and 800 kms of Green-field Expressways.

Projects for 6,407 km road length have been awarded under the BharatmalaPariyojana(including residual NHDP) till the end of October this year. DPRs are being prepared for projects for the balance length. De- congestion projects have been completed for 13 out of 191 congestion points identified, and are under progress for de-congestion of 80 other points. In addition, DPRs are being prepared for 93 congestion points.Out of the 35 locations identified for Multimodal Logistics Parks, DPRs have been initiated for 7 locations and availability of land parcels is being confirmed with State Governments for the rest of the locations.

In order to ensure safe and smooth flow of traffic, Ministry has envisaged a plan for replacement of Level Crossings on National Highways by ROBs/ RUBs under a scheme known as SetuBharatam. Under this programme, out of 174 ROBs/RUBs which are to be constructed, 91 have been sanctioned with an estimated cost of Rs.7,104.72 crore. Out of 91 sanctioned, 59 ROBs/RUBs have been awarded which are in various stages of progress.

The project envisages development of easy access to the four prominent Dhams, namely, Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedranath and Badrinath, situated in the state of Uttrakhand. These four Dhams are prominent pilgrimage centres. The project entails development of 889 km of roads with configuration of two-lane with paved shoulders at an estimated cost of about Rs. 12,000 crore. The projects are being taken up on EPC mode and the programme is targeted for completion by March, 2020.

The two projects of Peripheral Expressways around Delhi, comprising 135 km Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), and 135 km Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE) connecting NH-1 and NH-2 from Western and Eastern side of Delhi was completed this year and inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May 2018 and November 2018 respectively. The EPE was constructed by NHAI and WPE by Haryana Government. The two expressways were envisaged with the twin objectives of decongesting and de-polluting the national capital by diverting the traffic not destined for Delhi.

The EPE stretches from Kundli on NH 1 to Palwal on NH 2, and was constructed at a cost ofRs. 4617.87 crore, in addition to Rs. 5900crorewere spent on acquiring 1700 acres of land. It was completed in a record time of about 500 days against the scheduled target of 910 days. It is a fully access-controlled six-lane expressway with a closed tolling system. The expressway has an iconic toll plaza equipped with electronic toll collection infrastructure, ITS control system of the entire EPE and a digital art gallery, with holographic models of major structures and making of the EPE. Weigh-in-Motion equipment at all 30 entry points, solar power on the entire length, eight solar power plants with a capacity of 4000 KW, rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation and 36 replicas of monuments depicting Indian culture and heritage are major features of this expressway. This project has generated employment opportunities of about 50 lakh man-days.

The 8.36 km long Package -1 of the projects was inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May this year. It is a 14 lane, access-controlledsection stretching from Nizammudin Bridge to Delhi UP Border, and was completed in a record time of 18 months as against the earlier expected construction period of 30 months, at a cost of about Rs. 841.50 crore. This is the first National Highway in the country with 14 lanes, and has several features that would help reduce pollution. These include a 2.5-metre-wide cycle track on either side of the highway, a vertical garden on the Yamuna Bridge, solar lighting system and watering of plants through drip irrigation only.

Package II from UP Border to Dasna(19.28 km), Package -III - Dasna to Hapur( 22.27) km and Package -IV - Green-field Alignment from Dasna to Meerut -(31.78 km) are under construction and are likely to be completed by March 2019.

The 473 km expressway will link Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway to Mumbai-Pune Expressway thus providing Expressway connectivity from Ahmedabad to Pune for a length of about 650 Km.

This 1250 km Expressway is being developed along a new alignment between Delhi and Mumbai, which passes through backward and tribal districts of Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat.

The reasons for delay were identified and policy interventions undertaken to address the same.

The Ministry is monetizing its road assets constructed with public funds through Toll-Operate-Transfer (ToT) scheme. The scheme envisages bidding of bundled national highways for a concession period of 30 years. The first bundle comprised 9 projects, totalling 681 km of roads in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. It was awarded in 2018 to Macquarie for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the NHAI's estimate.The second bundle comprises over 586 kms spread over four states - Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal and Bihar. The offer has 12 toll plazas across four highways.

TheNational Highways Authority of India (NHAI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding(MoU)withtheStateBankofIndiatoreceiveRs.25,000croreasa long-term,unsecuredloanfor10years.Thisisthelargestamountofloantohavebeen sanctioned by the SBl in one go. This is also the largest ever fund that NHAI has ever received in one go.

The Ministry has issued detailed guidelines for determination of proper alignment of NH projects, advising executing agencies to examine the feasibility of a green- field alignment, especially in the case of economic corridors, instead of widening existing highways. This has been done because widening involves acquisition of land for Right of Way (RoW), shifting of utilities and demolition of built up structure, all of which involves a lot of time and cost. Also, earlier highways were largely planned to be serpentine, linking all possible towns in the vicinity. This road geometry has been found to be sub optimal, especially in case of economic corridors. BharatmalaPariyojanaalso calls for a corridor approach for economic corridors. It has also been found in a few test cases that it is feasible to acquire a RoW of 60 to 70 mtrs for a green field road project at the same cost as involved in the expansion of an existing road, especially when the associated costs and time taken in utility shifting, tree felling, additional compensation for demolition of structures coming in the RoW under expansion are taken into account.

AWebUtilityhasbeendevelopedwherebythelandacquisitionprocedureforthe NH projects, including processing of all LA related gazette notifications, are being done through a common platform called ""BhoomiRashi"". The Utility has been linked with the e-gazette platform of the MinistryofUrbanDevelopment,GovernmentofIndia,forpublicationofGazette Notifications.TheuseofBhumi Rashi has helped in cutting down the processing time from 2 to 3 months earlier to one to two weeksnow.

BhoomiRashi has also been integrated with the Public Financial Management System(PFMS)platformoftheMinistryofFinancefordepositofcompensationin theaccountsoflandowners/interestedpersonsonarealtimebasis, instead of being parked with CALA.

The Ministry has developed a Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC mode for all NH works and centrally sponsored works.BIMS acts as a data base for allbasic details of bidders like civil works experience, cash accruals and network, annual turnover etc,. This allows quick pre-qualification assessment of bidders based on evaluation parameters like threshold capacity and bid capacity from already stored data. Technical evaluationcantherefore be carried out faster using this information.

To improve ease in licensing, this Ministry has simplified the driving license application form. Four forms i.e. (a) Learner License, (b) Driving License, (c) Renewal of License, and (d) updation of Address - all have been consolidated into one. The new form will enable Aadhar based verification of the applicant's identity to provide online services for renewal, change of address etc. Another highlight of the new form is that it would capture an applicant's willingness for organ donation.

The permissible safe axle weight of goods vehicles was revised and increased by about 15% to 20 % for different configurations of axles. The decision was taken with a view to help in increasing the carrying capacity of goods transport vehicles and bring down logistics cost. The amendment will increase the carrying capacity of goods vehicles by about 20-25 % and lower logistics costs by about 2%. It will also bring down the incidence of overloading. While automobile technology and road construction quality have improved greatly over the years, the axle loads have remained the same since 1983 when they were last notified. There was a felt need to harmonize the axle load with international standards.

NHAI has developed a matrix-based methodology to rank the Fee Plazas on parameters such as electronic tolling, time taken in clearance of FASTag lanes, display panels, staff behaviour, cleanliness, etc. The data for the matrix is to be collected by the Regional Officers who will use the same to rank the Fee Plazas under their jurisdiction.

Prime News, Nation, (New Delhi), December 31:-The government has appointed four new Information Commissioners in the Central Information Commission which was functioning with just three of them as against a sanctioned strength of 11, including the Chief Information Commissioner.

President Ram Nath Kovind has approved the appointment of former IFS officer Yashwardhan Kumar Sinha, former IRS officer Vanaja N Sarna, former IAS Neeraj Kumar Gupta and former Law Secretary Suresh Chandra as Information Commissioners in the Central Information Commission, a government order accessed by PTI said.

Sinha is a 1981-batch Indian Foreign Service officer who was the High Commissioner of India in the United Kingdom.

An alumnus of St Michael's High School in Patna and St Stephen's College in Delhi, Sinha had served a number of important postings in the Ministry of External Affairs including the crucial Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran Division, which he headed for four years as Additional Secretary.

The only woman in the CIC will be Sarna, a 1980-batch Indian Revenue Service (Customs and Excise) officer, who was the Chief of Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC).

Neeraj Kumar Gupta, a 1982-batch IAS officer, was Secretary in the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management.

Chandra, an Indian Legal Service officer, retired as Union law secretary this year and was also private secretary to the then Law Minister Arun Jaitley between 2002 and 2004.

All the bureaucrats appointed by the government have retired this year.

After recent retirements of Chief Information Commissioner R K Mathur and Information Commissioners Yashovardhan Azad, Sridhar Acharyulu and Amitava Bhattacharyya, the Commission, the highest adjudicating authority in RTI matters, was left with three Information Commissioners, prompting activists to approach the Supreme Court on the issue of vacancies.

The Supreme Court had asked the Centre and states to maintain transparency in appointments of Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners and upload the details of search committees and applicants on website.

Commenting on the appointment process, Commodore Lokesh Batra, one of the petitioners in the case, said the government has failed to comply with the Supreme Court directions of posting the details on website.

""As my gut feeling said, the government did not comply with the Supreme Court directions viz transparency as it did not post details on its website,"" Batra told PTI.

During the hearing, the Centre had told the top court that the search committee has shortlisted names for the post of CIC and a final decision will be taken soon.

A bench of Justices A K Sikri, S Abdul Nazeer and R Subhash Reddy asked the Centre to put on the website details of search committee for CIC and ICs.

Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand, appearing for the Centre, had informed the court that a total of 65 applications were received for the CIC post and 280 applications for the post of four ICs in the Central Information Commission.

She had said that after these posts are filled up, notification will be issued for inviting applications for remaining posts of ICs.

The Centre seems to have ignored plea of former Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu who had called for adequate representation of non-bureaucrats in the Commission in accordance with the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

Citing Section 12 (5) of the RTI Act, he had written to the President that the Act provides for selecting people of eminence, having experience in law, science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass media or administration and governance."

Criminal gangs in the Maldives have a quota to nominate judges to the criminal court, the chair of a presidential commission formed to investigate unresolved murders and enforced disappearances alleged Sunday.

""No matter how well we investigate and send cases, I don't believe we could have justice with the current judges at the criminal court. I think that's the view of the whole legal community,"" Husnu Suood told the press at a briefing at the president's office.

Judges have used some gangs for their private security and the gangs were also connected to criminal court staff, who have revealed the identity of secret prosecution witnesses, he alleged.

A complete overhaul of the judiciary was necessary to reform the institution, the former attorney general added, echoing a campaign pledge of President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih.

Suood also alleged that in some cases gangs reached ""out-of-court settlements"" while assault trials were ongoing. Rival gangs made peace and ""fixed"" witness statements to acquit the defendant.

He also criticised the court over murder trials that remain stalled for years.

As pledged before his election victory in September, President Solih formed two inquiry commissions on his first day in office to recover missing funds and find the truth behind high-profile murders and the abduction of a journalist.

The commission on murders and enforced disappearances was mandated with conducting ""a free, independent and trustworthy investigation"" into cases between January 1, 2012 and November 17, 2018 that were ""not properly investigated for various reasons.""

At Sunday's briefing, Suood announced plans to conduct public inquiries with live telecasts on at least two cases. After inviting the public to submit cases and share information, the commission has launched probes into 24 cases, he noted.

As significant progress has been made, Suood said the commission would be able to conclude some cases by April 2019, well ahead of the previously estimated two years.

Experts from the FBI will arrive next month to provide assistance with crime scene investigation and data and audio-visual forensics, Suood said.

The commission has also accepted services offered by the Western Australia Police Force and an international NGO as well as Hassan Ugail, Professor of Visual Computing at the School of Engineering and Informatics at the University of Bradford.

Without disclosing details, Suood revealed that the commission has established links between the murders of lawmaker Afrasheem Ali and liberal blogger Yameen Rasheed and the abduction of Maldives Independent journalist Ahmed Rilwan.

The three cases were connected and followed ""the same pattern,"" he said.

Dr Afrasheem, a moderate religious scholar, was stabbed to death at the stairwell of his home on the night of October 1, 2012. Police claimed the killing was politically motivated but no charges have been raised over the alleged funding.

Hussain Humam, a young man charged over the murder, is the only person convicted so far.

Yameen Rasheed, an IT professional and satirist, was killed by a radicalised group of young men who believed he was guilty of insulting Islam, according to police. Six suspects were charged with murder and preliminary hearings were wrapped up in October.

Yameen's family questioned the ability of the police to conduct an impartial and credible investigation due to the failure to convict or arrest suspects in the abduction of journalist Rilwan and the near-fatal attack on blogger Hilath Rasheed.

Days before the fourth anniversary of Rilwan's disappearance in August, two suspects were acquitted with the judge blaming glaring investigative and prosecutorial failures.

The missing journalist's family said the not guilty verdict showed ""at minimum state complicity and, at worst, active involvement in Rilwan's abduction and disappearance."""

Now Aryan Pasha, India's first transman to win a prize at a bodybuilding contest, is helping others struggling with their identities.

Pasha was born a girl, Nyla, in 1991. Now, the 27-year-old wants to start a shelter home for transgenders in India. His journey hasn't been easy. He said, ""When a child is born he/she doesn't know the difference between a girl and a boy. The realisation of me being different from other boys came after I hit puberty. As a kid I enjoyed everything that a boy does at that age.""

At the age of six, when he was in class 2, Pasha told his father he was not comfortable going to school in a girl's uniform. ""I joined a new school where I wore a boy's uniform. For the first time in class 10, my teacher realised that I was not a boy as my documents still identified me as a girl,"" he said.

During his childhood, he used to be depressed and feel isolated. He hardly spent time with his family and was found mostly in the playground with other boys. Pasha said, ""My friends then were very comfortable with me because they didn't know that I was not one of them. But at home, I mostly stayed in my room.""

Pasha's mother was the first one to discover that he was a boy trapped in a female body. ""While my mother understood my situation, father said this was just a phase. But my mother convinced him,"" he said.

It was Pasha's mother who had told him about sex-change surgery when he was 16. ""It was the happiest day of my life when I got to know of this,"" he added.

In 2011, at the age of 19, Pasha underwent sex-change surgery in a hospital in NCR. ""After the transition, I became so comfortable in my body and it started showing in everything I did. I had always been an average student but after the transition I topped my school in Class 12,"" he said. He then got himself identified as 'male' in all his documents and got a new name: Aryan.

After one of the premier universities in Delhi refused to admit him for an undergraduate course, he joined Mumbai University and studied law.

""It was tough as there was no law to help us then. The National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) versus Union of India judgment came in 2014. I never wanted to study law. I was interested in sociology. But now my law studies help in my LGBTQ activism,"" Pasha said.

The Supreme Court in 2014 introduced the third gender status for transgenders. The apex court had asked the Centre to treat transgenders as socially and economically backward.

Pasha used to work for Multiple Action Research Group (MARG), an NGO where he used to impart legal training to other social activists. On December 1, Pasha became India's first transman to compete in Musclemania India, a bodybuilding event, in the men's category. He placed second.

Pasha sometimes gets 'weird' questions from people. ""Some people ask uncomfortable questions, like menstruation. I am lucky to have a very supporting mother, father and siblings. When your family stands with you, one can deal with thousands of stupid questions. I just wish everybody in my situation has a family like mine,"" he said.

Twenty-year-old Mohul Sharma, born as Megha Sharma, works at a prominent hotel in New Delhi underwent sex change surgery 4 months ago. He said, ""My teachers used to comment on the way I used to walk, talk and dress. Things became worse after I hit puberty. The story of a transwoman, Ghazal Dhaliwal, a scriptwriter in Bollywood inspired me a lot. After that I also wanted surgery. Telling my family about it was the biggest challenge and I didn't get much support from friends either.""

""It is very difficult for transgender people to get a job. As my documents still identify me as a woman, many companies rejected me after meeting me,"" Sharma added.

Rudrani Chhetri, 41, who started the first modeling agency for transgenders in Delhi said, ""I was born male. If my parents didn't support me fully, they were also not opposed to the idea of transition, which happened after I completed education."" She did not opt for surgery which was expensive for her then, but said her self-image was more important than physical attributes."

On 12 October (late Friday), the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) had issued a circular to entities operating in the e-payments space to completely halt the use of Aadhaar e-KYC (electronic-know your customer).

Mr. A, the founder of an e-wallet company, who was not able to get clarity from regulators on the usage of Aadhaar post the Supreme Court's verdict, finally got clarity from the circular. But the scramble had only just begun. Life in a world without e-KYC had to be figured out, at least for the time being. But the senior executive team of the e-wallet firm was to get together only on 14 October (Monday) to hash out a way forward.

Three weeks earlier, like most people in the country, Mr. A was glued to his television set from 10.30am, switching from one news channel to other. It was unlike him to be watching TV in the office that early on a weekday, but the day was momentous.

It was 26 September -- the day the Supreme Court weighed in on the fate of the Aadhaar unique identity project. Mr. A recounts how anxious he had become as he waited for the court verdict. ""What happens if Aadhaar-based customer acquisition is banned? What happens to my business model? What happens to all these years of efforts?"" were some of the thoughts that crossed his mind. And then, around 12.30pm, the Constitution bench's verdict was finally out.

While affirming the constitutional validity of Aadhaar, the apex court had said Aadhaar can only be used for welfare schemes and for delivering state subsidies. It had barred private companies from using Aadhaar data for authenticating customers. Also, in order to address privacy concerns, the court said it was not mandatory to link Aadhaar with bank accounts or mobile phone numbers.

For Mr. A and his team, making sense of the 1,448-page judgment itself took time. They brainstormed about the many possible interpretations of the judgment for more than five days, trying to somehow figure out a way to save the business from collapsing. He also did not know when exactly to stop customer verification through the Aadhaar-based mechanism. ""The judgment was not 100% clear on whether it had to be stopped on the same day,"" he said.

While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had updated its KYC guidelines in April 2018, all eyes had been on the Supreme Court. In the meantime though, e-wallet firms had already gone ahead with customer verification models based on Aadhaar. It was just cheaper and far more convenient. But on 14 October, in the internal meeting at Mr.A's company, the top management decided to completely roll back Aadhaar-based customer verification until further clarity came from the regulators. It was a sudden and unexpected speed bump in the path of India's booming fintech industry.

Impact on industry

Like Mr. A, most fintech companies, telecom operators and payment banks had built their business models based on the unique biometric number in order to deliver services in a paperless, cashless and presence-less manner.

""All the pillars of financial inclusion have been impacted with the restricted use of Aadhaar,"" said Suresh Sethi, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), India Post Payments Bank (IPPB). ""It was being used for not only banking and account opening, but other efficiencies were getting introduced -- like the whole concept of instant loans and insurance, and also the ability to invest immediately,"" he added.

IPPB, which used Aadhaar-based e-KYC to verify customers, has not been able to on-board new customers in the last two months. Only customers seeking direct benefit transfer (DBT) have been able to open accounts through Aadhaar-based e-KYC, said Sethi. ""Currently, the account opening per day is 15-20% of what we were doing earlier. The pace of acquisition has slowed down by 75-80%.""

Similarly, other payment banks have also confirmed that they have not been able to on-board new customers other than those seeking DBT as they all use Aadhaar-based KYC to verify customers.

IPPB has been incorporated as a public sector company under the Department of Posts with 100% government equity and is governed by the RBI. The bank was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 1 September to increase access to banking services in rural areas. The postal agents provide doorstep banking and account opening facility using a hand-held device, mobile phone, and a biometric reader.

According to Mr. A, the prepaid payment instruments (PPI) industry caters to around 250 million customers annually and the average cost of doing a physical KYC for each customer is around ₹100. The total cost of verifying these customers physically would be around ₹2,500 crore to the industry.

Even if other forms of identification were listed during customer verification, most customers would voluntarily opt for Aadhaar and this was also easier for us as the customer would be verified on a real-time basis, said Harshil Mathur, CEO and co-founder of Razorpay Software Pvt. Ltd, an online payment solutions company.

Since Aadhaar-based verification is not possible anymore, around 30-40% additional customers have to be physically verified which has significantly ramped up the operational costs for the company.

If the e-KYC suspension was not the only cause of worry for the fintech industry, e-sign based e-mandates used for automated collection of loan payments was also suspended in November by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the umbrella organization for all retail payments in the country. It resulted in even higher operational costs for digital lenders.

According to a circular issued on 23 November by NPCI to banks, the e-sign based e-mandate product has been suspended with effect from 26 November in compliance with the judgment of the Supreme Court.

""A lot of mutual funds and digital lending companies which were moving from physical mandates to Aadhaar-based mandates had to go back to physical mandates which is expensive and inefficient,"" said Mathur of Razorpay. ""For customers too, this is very inefficient. Instead of auto debit every month, customers will have to come and make payments now.""

Some of the fintech firms are now using net banking-based mandate, which is currently live with only five banks. NPCI has plans to launch a debit card-based eNACH which might offer some respite for these companies. A recent report by Omidyar and the Boston Consulting Group said that digital lending to micro, small and medium enterprises in the country is projected to increase between 10-15 times by 2023 to ₹6-7 trillion.

Consumer concerns

The Aadhaar judgment has been lauded as a pro-consumer move by most critics of the project. It has definitely eased the lives of the common people who would get calls and emails from banks, insurance companies, lending companies and telecom operators to update their Aadhaar details. Before 26 September, Aadhaar was mandatory for almost everything including school and hospital admissions. With the Supreme Court doing away with the mandatory linking of Aadhaar, most consumers that Mint spoke with feel that they have finally gotten a chance to decide for themselves and use Aadhaar voluntarily.

Anirudh Sharma, a 32-year-old mechanical engineer recounts how he would get notifications from Paytm every day in July to complete his full KYC. ""I was not able to send money to my friends and family in their Paytm wallets. So, the only option left was to get my full KYC done,"" he said. However, when the Paytm executive came to his doorstep to do his full KYC, he was told that only Aadhaar-based KYC would be possible. The executive was carrying a biometric reader and a mobile phone to complete the process. Despite the quick and easy verification experience, Sharma said, ""I should be the one choosing which identity proof I want to give or not give.""

Similarly, Seema Vashisht, a 46-year-old designer, who runs her own fashion store, said she got her Reliance Jio SIM card a few months ago through Aadhaar e-KYC. She too never got an option to exercise her choice while submitting identity proof documents. ""After getting a mobile phone number based on my Aadhaar number, how can they ask me to link my mobile phone to Aadhaar? Isn't it a two-way process? Why does it involve one process after another?"" she said.

In the absence of a digital fix, which bypasses the bar on e-KYC, the offline process for acquiring a new phone number could take between 24 to 36 hours. In this nebulous sweet spot between convenience and privacy rights, the future of Aadhaar's use by the private sector will be decided. Some experts say the top court judgment requires the use of Aadhaar to be purpose-limited, legally-backed and privacy-protected. They say there may still not be a problem if a person volunteers to give his or her Aadhaar card as proof of identity.

According to a 27-year-old civil services aspirant, who did not wish to be named, every state and the central government entrance exam still lists Aadhaar as the first option among the many documents admissible as a form of identity proof. ""Before the judgment, Aadhaar would be marked compulsory, but now only the word 'compulsory' has been removed. The rest is the same. Aadhaar still is the topmost option in the list of documents and while verification, the examiners also emphasize on Aadhaar for establishing identity when I go to take the test.""

Regulatory uncertainty

Sethi of IPPB said the bank is actively in talks with the regulators to get an alternative KYC process in place. ""We have made various representations to the government and we have very clearly heard from the government that they are working towards finding a way which involves voluntary usage of Aadhaar e-KYC.""

UIDAI has recently introduced an XML-based protocol, which they have shared with RBI, he said. ""RBI is reviewing it to see if it can be a surrogate, paperless process. It basically means that you get on to a portal and you get your Aadhaar data downloaded in the form of an XML file and that file will have all the information needed for opening an account.""

However, the proposed process will depend on the accessibility to the internet. ""Under the new mechanism, a customer will have to go to the bank or kiosk to get the sourced data, which is going to be a bit of a barrier, especially for the segments we are targeting. If we expect them to download and create this file, or go to an enrolment centre and get the file, there are going to be barriers,"" Sethi said.

Mr. A said he has also approached the Payments Council of India (PCI), the industry body for prepaid payments, for exploring all the possible options to be able to conduct his business -- including video-based KYC and artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions.

The AI-based application being considered will help customers send their identity proof over the web, enabling their facial images to be captured by the app from different angles to ensure liveliness. (Liveness is the ability to check whether it is a photograph before the camera or an actual human being). The use of 'offline Aadhaar', which relies on QR (quick response) code instead of biometric e-KYC for customer verification, is also being considered by the central bank, said a person familiar with the development.

But despite the many rounds of meetings and consultations, no clear path forward is yet in place.

The way forward

On 17 December, the government for the first time laid out its cards in the open, with the Union cabinet giving a go-ahead to amend existing laws in order to give legal backing to the voluntary use of Aadhaar. But the regulatory space will continue to be a muddle for quite some time. Any changes in legislation would require parliamentary approval and with a general election in sight, the time available for piloting any amendments through parliament is rather limited. The related big-ticket item of a personal data protection law is also pending.

The Congress, on its part, strongly opposes the use of the biometric ID by private entities. Thus, what's in store seems to be months of uncertainty and impasse.

The prevailing state of affairs has pushed some industry voices to question the logic of a government-mandated standard to begin with. ""What if multiple solutions were encouraged originally?"" asked Ashish Aggarwal, senior director and head of public policy at Nasscom. Instead of getting into how exactly private companies verify their customers, the regulators should just focus on common standards, interoperability, and portability. The market can come up with ideal solutions to solve issues of operational nitty-gritty, Aggarwal said.

Caught up in these larger debates are ordinary people like Mr. A and millions of India's fintech users. Their wait continues as the country's e-wallet boom looks to push past the e-KYC hiccup."

In the two-day period, including Christmas day, 75 people were arrested for driving drunk. In 2017, the number was over 100 in the same period.

At least nine crossings -- including Park Street-Russell Street crossing, Park street-Chowringhee Road crossing and Mayo Road crossing -- have been identified where traffic officials will put up points to check drivers with breathalyzers. A detective department team in plain clothes -- specially tasked with prevention of drink-driving -- has already been deployed since Christmas.

Rogue bikers, too, will remain firmly on the cop radar. Special attention will be on the bikes with more than one pillion rider. ""We will start keeping tabs on the movement of two-wheelers from as early as 4pm,"" said an official with Kolkata traffic police.

Flyovers across the city will be kept out of bounds for twowheelers between 10pm and 6am to prevent accidents involving rogue bikers who speed across them. Police said that after any arrest, those detained must obtain bail from court the next morning. ""No spot fines or bail will be given by on-duty policemen. These must be obtained from court. We will not dither from lodging serious penal offences if the crime is grave,"" an officer said.

Park Street and the adjoining areas have already been divided into seven zones to make the security arrangements smoother. Park Street, Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Little Russell Street, Russell Street and Middleton Street will be kept oneway from 4pm and at least 10 DCP-ranked officers will monitor the area round-the-clock. A total of 21 divisional mobile vans will make rounds of the city and 13 Quick response Teams and 14 Heavy Radio Flying Squad vans will also be deployed.

While cops will depend on electronic surveillance for the most part, watch towers and police kiosks are also being set up at the party zones. Additional cameras have also been installed, said sources.

Over 50 police assistance booths have been set up along Park Street, Free School Street, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, Camac Street, Russel Street and Loudon Street. Additional force will be deployed to ease out the movement in areas near Alipore zoo, Maidan, Victoria Memorial and Millennium Park as well.

""Revellers start thronging these places since the morning and these spots become a major concern,"" said an officer."

The Pakistan Prime Minister grabbed the headlines with: ""We will show the Modi government how to treat minorities.""

Persecuted in Pakistan for decades, for Ahmadiyyas, Khan's ""grand claim"" was nothing but hypocrisy. Community welfare committee vice president Pervez Ahmed and the missionary-in-charge Arif Khan in Mumbai called it ""a strange paradox"".

Ahmed said Pakistan under Gen Zia-ul-Haq robbed Ahmadiyyas of their religious identity by declaring the community as non-Muslim apostates through the second amendment to the constitution in April 1984. ""Ahmadiyyas have been killed in Pakistan from the 1953 riots. Whether the 1974 anti-Ahmadiyya riots (over 1,000 killed) or the May 2010 attacks on mosques, which killed 84, repeated attempts have been made to wipe out the community,"" he said. ""Daily subjugation and persecution and organised attacks aren't possible without the state's active collusion.""

Arif explained why Sunnis target his community. ""We follow teachings of our sect founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad who follows after the Holy Prophet."" He says, ""The Pak PM must ensure equality if he truly believes Islam.""

The duo cited the handling of Atif Rehman Mian's appointment to the PM's Economic Advisory Council to call the bluff on Khan's doublespeak.

Khan invited Mian, a Pak-American economist (professor of economics at Princeton, director of the Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy & Finance at Woodrow Wilson School, and the first Pakistani among IMF's top 25 economists) to join the EAC, only to quickly rescind the invite following threats of a massive protest.

If fellow-Muslims face such treatment, what about other minorities, they asked. The Jews who helped build Karachi are a case in point. Anti-Semitism in the wake of increasing tensions between the Arab world and Israel has ensured only 748 families are left behind. Even when the Pakistan Cricket Board roped in a German, Jew Dan Kiesel, as a physiotherapist, it led to widespread protests.

Christians, who comprise 1.6 per cent of Pakistan's population, have been attacked in various cities. Most Pakistani Christians are descendants of Dalit Hindus, converts from the British era and are among the poorest. ""Accusations of blasphemy make it easy for Islamist mobs to attack us, while authorities look away,"" said Ashiq Masih, the husband of Asia Bibi, a ""blasphemy convict"" on death row since 2010.

A caste row on June 14, 2009, saw Bibi accused of blasphemy by her Muslim majority village of Ittanwali. She was arrested, tried and sentenced to death under blasphemy laws.

Both then Punjab Governor Salman Taseer and Shahbaz Bhatti, Pakistan's Minister for Minorities, were killed for speaking in her favour in 2011.

Later, the Supreme Court acquitted her. ""We hoped our troubles would end but mobs are baying for our blood,"" wept Masih.

Right-wing groups such as JUD, Jamaat-Ulema-e-Islam, Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan want a public killing of Bibi. Khan's government has said Bibi (who's sought asylum) cannot leave the country.

Bibi's is not the only one. An attack on a Quetta church (December 2017) killed nine and injured 57; a suicide attack on Easter at a Lahore playground (March 2016) left 70 dead and more than 340 wounded; twin bomb blasts at churches in Lahore (March 2015) killed 14 and hurt more than 70; twin suicide bomb attacks at a Peshawar church in 2013 left 80 dead; nearly 40 houses and a church were burnt by a mob in Punjab's Gojra town (2009), with eight burnt alive and churches and Christian schools were set ablaze by a mob, in Faislabad (2005).

""If fellow Abrahamic faiths aren't spared, imagine what happens to Hindus,"" said a prominent Karachi Zoroastrian academic who requested anonymity. ""Hindus are accused of working for India and dragged into any condemnation of our neighbour. Atrocities in Kashmir or anti-Muslim riots in India are used to justify such attacks. Since the very identity of this country is based on opposition to a 'Hindu India out to annexe Pakistan,' this plays out as socio-cultural/political oppression and subjugation.""

It seems difficult to believe but the increasingly Islamicised and homogenous Pakistan was once diverse, she says. ""Minorities who were 15 per cent of the population during Partition now account for less than 4 per cent now. Unless Imran Khan demonstrably takes steps to address their concerns, there might be no minorities to speak of.""

Pakistan under Gen Zia-ul-Haq robbed Ahmadiyyas of their religious identities by declaring the community as non-Muslim apostates through the second amendment to the Constitution in April 1984, said Ahmadiyya welfare community vice-prez Pervez Ahmed."
"83","1029640842","2018-12-30","https://scroll.in/article/906846/what-a-honduran-teens-trauma-says-about-tackling-of-sexual-assault-cases-in-us-immigrant-centres","What a Honduran teen's trauma says about tackling of sexual assault cases in US immigrant centres","Scroll.in",FALSE,"A World Cup soccer match was playing on the shelter's TV when the two older teenagers tackled Alex on July 1 and dragged him into the empty bedroom. Wrestling him onto his stomach, one of them, a tattoo on his forearm, got on top. As Alex struggled to move, he said he could feel the teen's penis grinding against his butt.

""Take off his shorts!"" he heard the other teen, who'd bragged he'd been a gang member in Honduras, shout. ""Let's get him naked!""

Just 10 days earlier, Alex, 13, had been caught by the Border Patrol after traveling from Honduras with his 17-year-old sister and five-year-old stepbrother, to flee the country's gang violence. Now, they were being held at Boystown outside Miami, one of more than 100 youth shelters in the government's sprawling system meant to provide a temporary haven for migrant children caught crossing the border.

The two teens had been taunting Alex since he'd arrived at the shelter, making crude sexual jokes about his pregnant sister. Now, in the bedroom, Alex said, they yanked down the front of his shorts.

""At least your sister has already tasted a man,"" he heard one of them sneer. ""But you haven't even tried a woman.""

Alex said he fought as hard as he could, somehow managing to pull up his shorts and kick until he broke free. As he lay on the floor catching his breath, he said, the boys fled, warning him to keep his mouth shut.

Over the past six months, ProPublica has gathered hundreds of police reports detailing allegations of sexual assaults in immigrant children's shelters, which have received $4.5 billion for housing and other services since the surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America in 2014. The reports, obtained through public records requests, revealed a largely hidden side of the shelters - one in which both staff and other residents sometimes acted as predators.

Several of the incidents have led to arrests of shelter employees or teenage residents. And in one particularly heinous case, a youth care worker was convicted in September of molesting seven boys over nearly a year at an Arizona shelter. The employee had worked for months without a full background check.

Coverage of such incidents by ProPublica and other media triggered demands for investigations.

Arizona's governor ordered a statewide inspection of the shelters, leading to the shutdown of two centers run by Southwest Key after the nonprofit failed to provide proof that its employees had completed background checks.

And late last month, federal investigators warned that the Trump administration had waived FBI fingerprint background checks of staffers and had allowed ""dangerously"" few mental health counselors at a tent camp housing 2,800 migrant children in Tornillo, Texas.

But ProPublica's review of the hundreds of police reports showed something else about the assaults. Something that went beyond background checks. Kids at shelters across the country were, indeed, reporting sexual attacks in the shelters, often by other kids. But again and again, the reports show, the police were quickly - and with little investigation - closing the cases, often within days, or even hours.

And there are likely even more such cases. ProPublica's cache of records is missing many police reports from shelters in Texas, where the largest number of immigrant children are held, because state laws there ban child abuse reports from being made public, particularly when the assaults are committed by other minors.

Now, as the immigration system struggles to house and care for 14,600 children - more than ever before - an examination of how federal and state authorities investigated the assault against Alex, one of those children, reveals startling lapses.

For a few days, Alex said, he didn't report his assault, heeding his attackers' warning, worried that speaking up would delay his release from Boystown. But as they continued to harass him, he decided to tell his counselor.

The counselor told him that a surveillance tape had captured the teenagers dragging him by his hands and feet into a room, and that there might have been a witness.

But Alex's report did not trigger a child sexual assault investigation, including a specialized interview designed to help children talk about what happened, as child abuse experts recommend.

Instead, the shelter waited nearly a month to call the police. When it finally did, a police report shows, the shelter's lead mental health counselor told the officers ""the incident was settled, and no sexual crime occurred between the boys like first was thought among the staff.""

And instead of investigating the incident themselves, officers with the Miami-Dade Police Department took the counselor's word for it and quickly closed the case, never interviewing Alex.

A spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Miami, which received $6 million last year to care for about 80 children at Boystown, said it handled Alex's case correctly, blaming him for any delays. In response to questions, a Miami-Dade police spokesman said the department was reopening the case.

An examination of Alex's case shows that almost every agency charged with helping Alex - with finding out the full extent of what happened in that room - had instead failed him.

The police closed Alex's case 72 minutes after responding to the call.

Alex's mother, Yojana, had just gotten off work on July 27, bone-tired after another hot day installing swimming pools in southwest Missouri, when the call came from Boystown. She'd been expecting her regular chat with her children, so when her cellphone showed a Florida number, she answered excitedly.

Yojana had left them behind in Honduras four years earlier to seek a better life in the United States. Now after a month in the shelter, they'd soon be reunited.

But instead of her children, she heard the unfamiliar voice of a shelter staff member. Something had happened to Alex.

There was surveillance video, the woman said, showing two older teenagers grabbing Alex, throwing him to the floor and dragging him into a bedroom.

""But there are no cameras in the room,"" she said, ""so we couldn't see the rest.""

The woman passed the phone to Alex, who sobbed as he told his mother what happened in the bedroom.

When she hung up, Yojana was furious. The attack had happened more than three weeks ago. Why was she only finding out about it now? Where was the staff? Why wasn't anyone watching them? And what if the attack had been worse than Alex said?

As a mother, Yojana said her instincts were to go to the police - to break down any door she had to - to make sure the shelter and the teens were held accountable. But she knew that in the United States, she wasn't just any mother. She and her husband, Jairo, had separately crossed the border illegally several years earlier and had been living in the country without permission ever since. The family agreed to let us tell their story as long as we didn't use their last names.

Yojana had reason to worry. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been arresting parents and family members, or members of their households, who are in the country illegally when they come forward to claim their children. This month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it had arrested 170 such sponsors, or people connected to them, between July and November; 109 of those people had no criminal record.

If Yojana and Jairo went to the authourities, or pressed too hard, they could risk everything they'd worked for.

Weeks earlier, Alex had started on a path he thought would lead to help. Four days after the attack, he finally got up the courage to report it to his counselor. ""She told me it was very sad what happened to me and that she was very sorry,"" Alex recalled. His counselor took him to the office of her supervisor, Marianne Cortes, where he repeated his story.

Then, he said, Cortes told him that she and his counselor would watch the surveillance video and ""if it's like you told me, we'll put in a report."" After they watched the video, Alex said, his counselor told him that there was something else on the tape, something he hadn't realised during the attack. There'd been a witness.

""In the video, my counselor told me there was another boy in a window,"" he said.

But then, after those revelations, nothing happened. There was no further investigation.

In an interview, archdiocese spokeswoman Mary Ross Agosta said at that time there was no reason for one. Alex ""was interviewed by staff, and he claimed it was verbal harassment, sexual gestures and teasing about his sister, but no nudity,"" she said.

The staff had reviewed the surveillance footage, she said: ""They did grab him by his hands and feet and take him in the room."" But, she said, it was ""humiliating,"" not criminal.

The shelter reported the incident to federal regulators as sexual harassment. Staff didn't call the police, she said, ""because there was no sexual contact or inappropriate behavior - other than making fun of him.""

Waiting three weeks to call Yojana was ""an oversight,"" Ross Agosta said, which Cortes noticed when she prepared to call Yojana to begin the reunification process.

It wasn't until July 30, she said, that Alex told staff that something sexual had happened. But Alex said by that time, Cortes knew the full story. He'd told her when he first reported it in early July and she heard it again as she stood by while he told his mom on July 27.

On July 30, Ross Agosta said, the shelter called the Miami-Dade police and the Florida Department of Children and Families.

Child abuse experts say waiting in such a situation goes against best practices. Regardless of what Alex revealed the first time, they said, counselors who work with children should know that it's common for assault victims to withhold details initially.

""Sometimes it can be overwhelming,"" said Chris Newlin, the lead author of a US Justice Department report on best practices for interviewing children in abuse cases. Young victims may be unsure of what to do, what will happen if they tell or how the system works, he said. They may have been threatened or they may be traumatised.

Newlin said a child in Alex's situation would be even less likely to report because of his immigration status. That's why it's critical, he said, for staff members to take every case seriously and look for signs of trauma.

Ross Agosta said the police came to the shelter on July 30 followed the next day by Department of Children and Families investigators. And both agencies, she said, determined there ""was no sexual assault.""

After the call from Alex, Yojana and Jairo dropped everything and started driving across the country to Boystown. It was supposed to be a happy time, but now they were filled with worry.

Yojana, 33, had come to the United States from Honduras in 2014, leaving behind Alex, then 9, and his sister, Yemerly, 13. She joined a sister in southwest Missouri and found work at a chicken plant, packing frozen pieces on the graveyard shift.

She kept up with her kids through video chats and posted pictures on Facebook of Alex's face painted like a clown at a birthday party she missed.

The money she sent to Honduras allowed Alex and Yemerly to attend private school, a rare privilege she hoped would insulate them from the country's gang violence. Yojana hadn't made it past the sixth grade, but Yemerly was studying to be a civil engineer.

But that display of economic success made them vulnerable to kidnappers, she and Jairo said. One night, after not hearing from Yemerly for several days, Yojana saw a TV news report about five young girls being kidnapped and decided it was time.

""If we didn't send for them to come, we might regret it for life,"" Jairo said.

Alex, Yemerly and their stepbrother Amahury set off from Honduras in June with their 8-year-old cousin. They traveled in a packed refrigerated trailer through Mexico and, 11 days later, crossed the Rio Grande in a green inflatable raft. They were quickly caught by the Border Patrol and taken to Catholic Charities' Msgr. Bryan Walsh Children's Village - a facility most people call Boystown.

Five weeks later, on the day they were finally reunited in the Boystown cafeteria, photos show Yojana didn't even stop to put her handbag down before hugging her children tightly to her. Alex was now taller than her with a new haircut, a thick wave of black hair on top with the sides shaved to a point in the back like the soccer stars he worshipped. Yemerly cried in her mother's arms.

""Right there, in that moment,"" Yojana said later, ""it felt like the children that I left in Honduras had come back to life.""

But, she said, she could feel a part of Alex was closed off. The kids wouldn't be released for two days, so when Alex called her at the hotel, Yojana decided to press for more details about the attack and record it on her phone.

During the call, Alex told her the police were coming and he'd been told they ""are going to interview me."" But he was scared that anything he said could interfere with his getting out. ""I just don't want to be here anymore.""

Yojana urged him to tell the truth. ""When the police arrive, you tell them the exact same thing you told me,"" Yojana said. ""Don't be afraid of what those kids did. You must tell them what happened.""

Yojana could hear the staticky sound of a walkie-talkie in the background.

""Hold on,"" Alex said, ""the counselor is coming for me.""

What happened next is disputed. Alex said after he hung up he was never interviewed by police or anyone else.

The Miami-Dade police initially told ProPublica it couldn't find any reports about an alleged sexual assault at Boystown despite being provided with Alex's full name, the shelter's address, the date and a description of the incident.

After culling through a log of 145 calls the police had received from the shelter since 2013, we found it under the vague label ""Conduct Investigation.""

According to the report, Miami-Dade police officers arrived at Boystown at 4:42 p.m. on July 30 and completed their investigation at 5:54 p.m. The report doesn't describe what they did for that 72 minutes. The narrative is three sentences long.

Cortes, it said, had called the police ""to advise that on the listed date and approximate time"" Alex had ""an incident"" with two other boys. But she ""advised the incident was settled and no sexual crime occurred between the boys like first was thought among the staff.""

That was essentially it. The police left. There was nothing about a surveillance video. They didn't interview the teenagers or the potential witness. They didn't talk to Alex. There was no mention of how Boystown had come to its conclusion - or why the police believed it.

Under ""Case Status,"" an officer had typed ""CLOSED.""

In a brief phone call, Cortes said she couldn't discuss how she and others in the shelter responded because of privacy rules and referred questions to the archdiocese.

""The only thing I could tell you is that we advocated the most for him and his care,"" Cortes said. ""Anything that happens with any child there that might be a trauma, we take it for face value. We don't minimise it. We take everything very serious.""

Detective Alvaro Zabaleta, a Miami-Dade police spokesman, said he didn't know if the officer who responded had been told there was video. But he didn't want to second-guess his judgment in not interviewing Alex.

Shelter staff members, Zabaleta said, are trained to work with immigrant children and the issues they face. So when ""you're dealing with kids and you have their counselor,"" he said, ""they become their voice, and they're there to look out for the best interest of the child.""

But the officer's decision not to interview Alex struck child abuse experts we spoke with as unusual.

""How can you possibly conduct an investigation without getting input from the one person who you think can be your most credible witness about what may or may not have happened?"" Newlin said. ""How do you know who to talk to? How do you know what evidence to possibly look for if you don't obtain a statement from that individual?""

Mike Haney, who formerly oversaw abuse prevention and intervention at Department of Children and Families and the Florida Department of Health, said the state developed its model for abuse investigations in 1978 when it created ""child protection teams"" made up of pediatricians, social workers and child psychologists. The teams work with local law enforcement agencies and DCF [Department of Children and Families] to assess child abuse reports, provide services and conduct what are known as ""forensic interviews.""

Haney said such interviews should occur ""as soon as it's reasonably appropriate for the child,"" but generally within 24 to 48 hours. That's because children come under a lot of pressure when a report is made to law enforcement and Department of Children and Families, he said.

""For an officer to respond to that type of allegation and not interview the kid, I'm not sure what the officer was thinking,"" Haney said. ""And if the clinician said, 'I talked with the kids, they said this,' I'd want to know that the child gave me the same story.""

Still, under Florida law, Haney said, the officer was under no obligation to call in a child protection team to conduct a forensic interview. That's because the law only requires such interviews when the child alleges abuse by a parent or caregiver. And what Alex says happened to him is what's known in Florida as a ""child on child.""

""In my opinion, we should be referring any child if there's an allegation of sexual abuse for a professional assessment,"" Haney said. ""But that becomes a resource issue, a funding issue, a staff issue. That's the biggest reason. There would be a significant cost increase if we make it available to any child.""

The hundreds of police reports reviewed by ProPublica revealed many hastily dismissed incidents like Alex's in immigrant youth shelters.

In 2016, a staff member at a shelter outside Phoenix observed one boy making hip-thrusting movements on top of another boy with a blanket in between them. The victim couldn't stop crying and wouldn't speak to the staff member. A police officer took a report and the case was closed.

A year earlier at the same facility, a youth care worker walked in on a boy who had his shorts partially down and was standing behind another boy who also had his pants down and was bending over a bed. The next day, during a medical exam, the boy told a nurse that one of his roommates had held him down while the other raped him. Five days later, however, when he was finally brought in for an official interview, the boy denied that anything had happened. That case, too, was closed.

In March 2017, a 16-year-old Honduran boy told a shelter employee in New York that his roommate had raped him while he'd been at a shelter in Renton, Washington. After nearly two months of back-and-forth, a detective finally interviewed the teen. But by that time, the boy no longer wanted ""to do anything about it."" Like the others, the case was closed.

In many cases, the responding officers simply filed brief information reports about the incidents, without investigating them as potential crimes.

Critics say this highlights a flaw of the system. Because immigrant kids are typically only in the investigating agencies' jurisdictions for a few weeks, even if a detective wanted to pursue a case, it wouldn't necessarily be easy. Kids get moved around a lot in the shelter system, sometimes without warning or in the middle of the night. When they're released, they're often sent out of state to live with parents or relatives who might want to avoid interactions with police because they're undocumented themselves or living with someone who is.

When Boystown finally released Alex and his siblings on August 1, they handed Yojana a folder. It contained Alex's intake papers, vaccination records and blood tests. There was information for Yojana about how to be a good sponsor and how to follow up with immigration court. But there wasn't anything, not even an incident report, about what happened to Alex.

When Jairo asked to see the surveillance video, a staff member informed him that the security cameras were on a loop.

""They said that after 30 days, the video is erased, and much to our regret, today is the 31st day,"" Jairo said. ""How convenient.""

But in that moment, he and Yojana didn't want to press. They had their children again. And for the first time in their lives, they could step outside and into America together.

After leaving Boystown, the family huddled at a nearby Honduran restaurant to decide if they should go to the police or if they should just get home.

They'd only been given a few days off work, and Jairo felt pressure to get back. On the other hand, somebody should pay for what happened to Alex, if not for his sake, to prevent other children from being harmed in the shelter.

Then again, the shelter said it filed a police report. Even if Alex hadn't been interviewed yet, surely an officer would follow up.

""I wanted to grab my phone and break it because I couldn't stand it anymore - the pressure,"" Jairo said. ""I have so many responsibilities on my shoulders and this was another on top of that. Plus, we already had our children, and that was good.""

They decided to leave.

Back in Missouri a few days later, Alex squeezed into the backseat of Jairo's pickup, tagging along on a swimming pool job.

As they drove east on Interstate 44, passing the exit-ramp oases of Waffle Houses, Best Westerns and Flying J truck stops, Alex stared out the window silently, occasionally resting his head on the window or running his fingers nervously along the seams of his jeans.

For days, Yojana and Jairo had been wavering between wanting to seek justice but feeling powerless over how to go about it. Jairo said he had a business card for a lawyer in Kansas City who could take Alex's case and maybe get to the bottom of what happened. But Jairo and Yojana hadn't called for an appointment.

There was a lot they were trying to sort out. They weren't sure if Alex was telling the whole story of what happened at Boystown or keeping something even worse from them. Yojana said she'd tried to broach the subject, but Alex told her not to ask him about it anymore.

Alex said that on the day the police came, he and his counselor ""were waiting for the police to talk to me, but Marianne Cortes spoke with them, and then my counselor told me they didn't need to interview me anymore.""

Alex said he was left confused. He'd wanted to tell the police what the two boys did to him and didn't understand why the shelter had talked to the police on his behalf.

When asked what he wanted to happen, Alex was unequivocal. ""I want to report them,"" he said. ""To go to the police.""

In mid-August, Department of Children and Families released a report citing Boystown for three violations of the state's rules regarding residential child care facilities.

The report said the shelter had been understaffed. It had failed to report suspected child abuse in a timely fashion. And it had failed to notify a child's parents or legal guardian after a critical incident.

The records didn't mention Alex or describe what prompted the investigation. But they show that on August 16 - a little over two weeks after Alex was released - Boystown agreed to a ""corrective action plan."" It promised to retrain employees and file biweekly reports that would allow the state to check that Boystown had enough staff to supervise the kids.

Department of Children and Families spokesman David Frady said he couldn't speak about Alex's case or even confirm that there'd been an incident at Boystown because of privacy concerns.

""I'm not able to confirm or deny whether or not we've spoken to an alleged victim,"" he said.

Miami-Dade police denied a request to interview the responding officers and refused to release body-camera footage of their visit to Boystown. Of the 17 minutes of video and audio that exists, the department said only 12 seconds was public because Florida law prohibits release of any body-cam recording taken within a ""private residence.""

ProPublica challenged the decision, but the department said the conversation occurred in an office, a place where the social worker could expect privacy.

However, after receiving our questions about the handling of the case and reviewing the incident, Zabaleta said, the department had assigned an investigator to take a second look - effectively reopening the case.

The department then said it wouldn't even release the 12 seconds of footage because the case was still under investigation.

The federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, which funds and regulates the shelters, said that after the incident, Boystown transferred the ""perpetrators"" to a different dorm. But the agency declined to answer questions about whether Boystown had handled the incident properly or what, if anything, ORR had done in response.

""Our focus is always on the safety and best interest of each child,"" spokeswoman Lydia Holt said in an email. ""We have no additional information to share regarding this case.""

Today, Alex's case remains in the hands of the state attorney's office. But child abuse experts say the likelihood of learning the truth of what happened to him in the bedroom at Boystown grows dimmer every day.

This much is clear: If Alex's case is any guide, the thousands of children passing through the nation's overburdened shelter system - understaffed and increasingly akin to long-term orphanages - should not expect a rigorous investigation if they suffer abuses in the shelters.

""Somebody has to pay for these mistakes because these are monstrous things,"" Jairo said. ""It can't go unpunished. If it stays that way, in many centres, this is going to continue to happen."""

Pushed into commercial sex work for no fault of theirs, a group of rescued minors pursue education without any hassle, thanks to the Mothers Committee, constituted by HELP-Girls Advocacy Alliance(GAA) here.

But this was not before the NGO partner of Childline India Foundation intervened and helped the girls, who were without any age proof, get the much-needed birth certificate insisted upon by school authorities for admission.

Those who took care of the rescued girls in the age group of eight to 12 ran from pillar to post for months as it proved to be a big challenge for them in getting the all-important document without knowing parentage of the children.

The NGO which works actively among survivors of human trafficking took up the matter with the Ongole Municipal Corporation, revenue officials at various levels and the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) for over a month. The sustained efforts paid dividend with the five of them joining a municipal school here and three others a private school close to their dwelling after the civic body issuing the certificate, says HELP Programme Officer B.V. Sagar. In the case of children of sex workers, they have a problem in declaring the name of father.

After due proceedings conducted by revenue officials from the level of Revenue Division Officer down to the Village Revenue Officer and based on declaration made in court, the girls were issued birth certificates, according to Ongole Municipal Commissioner S.Venkatakrishna.

Rehabilitation of girls forced into flesh trade continues to be a big challenge even now as compensation under Andhra Pradesh Victims Compensation Scheme is provided only in cases registered under IPC 376 (rape), HELP Director N.V.S. Rammohan says, while pleading for decriminalisation of sex work and survivor-centric approach.

Even those booked under Immoral Traffic Prevention Act should be provided compensation so that they could lead a reformed life. Families of rescued girls who were pushed into commercial sex work should be given livelihood support, he added."

In yet another violation of Juvenile Justice Act, a young boy has been slapped with Public Safety Act (PSA) for allegedly organising anti-state demonstrations in 2016 when he was a minor.

Hailing from Rampora Qaimoh Kulgam, Khalid Nazir Wagay has been serving detention for past more than a year on the charges of unlawful activities. The boy is presently detained in Central Jail, Kote-Balwal Jammu since October 2018. He has now been booked under PSA for a case of 2016, when he was barely 17 years old. Khalid was born on August 28, 1999, as per his school certificates and aadhar card, copies of which lie with this reporter.

""Even though he is major now, he has been booked under a case of 2016 when he was a minor, which is illegal, for a minor cannot be detained under PSA,"" stressed Advocate Mir Shafkat Hussain, who is pleading his case at Jammu and Kashmir High Court.

To mention, detention of minors under PSA is a sheer violation of an amendment to the Act, which prohibits the detention of persons below the age of 18 years in police custody or interrogation centre. The amendment was made in April 2012 following strong criticism from local, national and international human rights organisations, for PSA allows the police to arrest any suspect and keep them in jail for two years without trial.

""Like in other cases, in this case too PSA has been misused by the police. They have been placing him in illegal detention,"" said Advocate Hussain, adding that the District Magistrate Kulgam has signed his detention orders at the behest of police ""without applying his own mind.""

A student of Bandipora Polytechnic College, who had visited his home during vacations in December 2017, was detained by local police along with some other boys after an untoward incident took place in his village.

""He has never been involved in any unlawful activity and has always been focused on his studies. It is just that false charges have been levelled against him,"" said Nazir Ahmad Wagay, Khalid's father and a government school teacher. ""My son should be released soon and his PSA must be quashed. He is innocent,"" he pleaded.

Khalid's family has been suffering like anything for past one year. ""His mother is not able to control her tears since his detention, while his grandmother's health has deteriorated due to this distress,"" said Nazir Ahmad.

As per his family and lawyers, even as he was repeatedly granted bail by the court of law, he was never released by police but was instead shifted from one police station to another till PSA charges were brought against him.

As per the petition filed in J&K High Court, Khalid was arrested on December 28, 2017 and was detained in police station Qazigund where he was implicated in a case under FIR 313/2017. Even after he was granted bail by the High Court on July 20, 2018, he was not released by police and was instead shifted to police station Kulgam under FIR vide 183/2016. The detenue again applied for the bail and was granted the same on September 1, 2018. But instead he was detained in Kulgam police station under FIR 191/2016.

Later, his family once again applied for the bail, which he was granted. However, once again he was not released from police custody but was instead shifted to police station Qazigund under FIR 314/2017.

Among the charges mentioned on the District Magistrate Kulgam's order that have been made grounds for the PSA against Khalid include organising an anti-state procession at Qaimoh on August 10, 2016 and unfurling Pakistani flags on August 21, 2016, when Khalid was a juvenile and a 10th standard student. ""The perusal of the said dossier also reveals your involvement in case FIR No. 191/2016 U/S 13 ULA (P) Act P/S Kulgam, which reveals that you have been found involved in provoking the mob led by you and your associates to continue the processions till the state of Jammu and Kashmir is seceded from Union of India and they also unfurled Pakistani flags on 21/08/2016 at Turk-Tachloo Qaimoh,"" the order reads."

Much of the series' meat and juice come from its source material, the novel by Aravind Adiga. This is the epic story of the migratory translocation of two young boys Radha (Yash Dholye) and Manju (Mohammad Samad) aged 15 and 16 from rural Maharashtra whose tyrannical trashy father drags them to Mumbai for a life of cricket.

Udayan Prasad and his writers(Marston Bloom, Karan Aggarwal, Sumit Arora) have dug deep into the class differences at the turf level.

There is a remarkably subtle homo-erotic attraction that grows between Manju and an upperclass Muslim boy Javed(Karanvir Malhotra). That young Samad happens to be an actor of phenomenal sensitivity helps give the content a quicksilver immediacy and warmth. Converging gently on Samad, the series becomes the saga of Manju's journey from patriarchal tyranny to sexual and spiritual freedom.

The series is bankably buoyant and breezy without trivializing the issues that concern the theme, such as a young mind's right to follow its own dream. There is a subplot about an over-ambitious realtor (Akshay Oberoi) trying to get a wily wizened but impish real-estate owner (Ratna Pathak Shah) to part with her property. Oberoi and Shah play against each other with a flirtatious malevolence bringing to the table the mood of tragic travesty that has overtaken the metropolitan psyche.

Ratna Pathak Shah, Mahesh Manjrekar(as an aging cricket coach who rediscovers his mojo) , Rajesh Telang are brilliantly in form. Akshay Oberoi brings a subtle sliminess to his suave wheeler dealer's role. Here is an actor who deserves to be on top of the game. Sacred or otherwise. And I was delighted to see the accomplished Geetanjali Kulkarni(last seen as a prosecutor cutting vegetables on the train back home from court for the family dinner in the Marathi film Court) playing Mahesh Manjrekar's ailing but smiling wife.

But it is Mohammad Samad whose performance anchors the series. He plays the reluctant cricketer with a just the right amount of angst and assuredness. My favourite sequence in the series is the one where the principal of the school Ratna Pathak Shah punishes Samad by banning him from playing cricket for a week.

""But that's not a punishment,"" smiles Samad with such understated relevance; it shows we are looking at an actor with a very bright future. Ditto the series.

Brimming with an all-knowing wisdom that never grows cocky Selection Day has me hooked. I can't wait for Season 2."

""The police have refused permission to conduct the public meeting in Worli and thereafter Chandrashekhar Azad and other party workers have been detained by the police and they are not allowed to move anywhere, they are not allowed to go and pay tribute to Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. They are not allowed to go to Bhima-Koregaon to pay tribute to the martyrs,"" Satpute told ANI.

The Bhim Army was slated to hold public meetings at the Jambori Maidan in Mumbai's Worli area and at the Shri Shivaji Preparatory Military School (SSPMS) ground in Pune, ahead of the January 1 anniversary of the Bhima-Koregaon violence.

However, in a letter on December 29, the All India Shri Shivaji Memorial Society (AISSMS), which runs the SSPMS, had denied the Bhim Army permission to hold a public rally at the ground.

Satpute further said that the Bhim Army had sought permission from the police to conduct meeting in Pune in October, adding that the police have not replied to the application yet.

""They have not allowed or denied the permission. Today the meeting was scheduled. The Bhim Army is in an ambiguous state. They are not aware if they can conduct the meeting or not. The police are confusing the Bhim Army and are implicating its workers in false cases,"" Satpute added.

He added that this was a ""clear-cut case of the violation of the fundamental rights"" guaranteed under the Article 19 of the Constitution and that they have moved a writ petition in the Bombay High Court regarding the same.

The 10 crew members, including three from Tamil Nadu, are living on hope with minimal provisions and without passports, which were taken by the UAE Coast Guard after the vessel was detained by an Ajman court.

They are among 40 crew members of three Dubai-based Elite Way Marine Services EST vessels that have been detained by UAE. Thirty-eight of the crew members are Indian, MV Azraqmoiah Captain Ayyappan Swaminathan, a native of Nagapattinam, told Express in a telephonic conversation. Express' efforts to contact Elite Way Marine Services EST for a response were in vain.

Swaminathan said the crew was stuck on the vessel as the company had not signed them off by paying their salaries.""We have been asking the company to sign us off since January 2018... Till November, the company has to pay us a minimum of 15 months of salary,"" said Swaminathan, whose hometown was hit by the recent Cyclone Gaja.

""We approached UAE's Federal Transport Authority, Indian consulate in Dubai, and ITF London. FTA banned the company's vessels from commercial operation... It has filed a case against the company in a Dubai court,"" he said. The Indian Consulate has been giving food and other provisions to the crew. ""They said they could not intervene as the matter is sub-judice,"" he said.

The crew wants high-level government intervention. Officials at the Ministry of External Affairs told Express the Indian embassy in Abu Dhabi and consulate in Dubai were working to resolve the issue at the earliest.

Without a penny to send home, the crew is not ready to vacate the ship till they are paid. ""We did not get any salary from the company for the last one year. And with the natural disaster affecting my native place, the pending salary is more important to me,"" he said.

According to Swaminathan the vessel's cook has been working onboard for 33 months. ""Recently his father passed away. We informed the company about the situation and urged them to clear him and send him back home immediately. But it failed to take action to do so. As a result, he couldn't attend his father's funeral ceremony,"" Swaminathan said.

""They never help us in any emergency situation. We are very unsafe onboard. If anything happens to us, who will be responsible? They are not treating us like fellow humans... Not only are we struggling onboard, our family is struggling in our country without us and our salary... Passing each day onboard the ship is tough and the situation is getting worse,"" he said.

P Muthuswamy, an advocate at Madras High court and legal coordinator, Sailors Helpline, says the crew members were recruited by a Navi Mumbai-based firm which is a Recruitment and Placement Services Licence (RPSL) holder. ""The recruiting agent has moral responsibility to see that the crew is paid and ensure their safety. Since the recruiting firm failed, the Directorate General of Shipping should take stern action and the deposit amount with the RPSL agent, should be recovered and given to family members,"" he added.

Manoj Joy, Community Development Manager, Sailors' Society, said the immediate concern was the families of the crew members. ""Our communication is open with some family members who require medical assistance. We will be providing them with basic emergency relief as early as possible,"" he said.

A Menaga, Swaminathan's wife, highlighted the struggle of the families.

""We have a child studying in standard 1. We have a lot of commitments from paying house rent to school fees and other expenses for our survival. We are really struggling for everything. Recently, our property was destroyed due to cyclone Gaja. We also have a housing loan and have to pay EMI which we cannot now. The salary is very important for us. It is hard-earned money,"" she says.

Cook onboard 33 months, missed dad's funeral

According to Swaminathan, the vessel's cook has been onboard for 33 months. ""Recently his father passed away. We told the company but it failed to clear him. He couldn't attend the funeral,"" he said."

The case was filed by Assistant Commandant Venkatesh who had approached the high court for promotion to the rank of Deputy Commandant.

According to senior advocate Ankur Chhibber, his client Assistant Commandant Venatesh was posted at the CRPF Counter Insurgency and Anti-Terrorist (CIAT) School at Silchar in Assam in 2013 when his left eye was hit by a shuttlecock while playing badminton with his troops.

After sustaining the injury, the officer received medical treatment at AIIMS in Delhi and later returned to his unit situated in Silchar to resume his duties within a month. Over a period of time, his medical category also improved to E-2 from E-3 in a few months.

Meanwhile, a Court of Inquiry (CoI) was initiated into the incident following which it was ordered that the CRPF officer's treatment will be done on government expenditure as he sustained the injury during government duty.

However, when the officer's batch was considered for promotion to the rank of Deputy Commandant, he was denied promotion due to his low medical category despite his claim that he was eligible for relaxation in promotion as he sustained injury while on duty.

The CRPF told the officer that the relaxation in medical category for promotion will be admissible only to those personnel only who are wounded or injured during wars or while fighting against the enemy/militant/intruders/armed hostiles/insurgents due to an act of these in India or aboard and officers/men who are wounded/injured during field firings/accidental firings/explosion of mines or other explosive devices and due to accidents while on active duty in India or abroad.

Due to protests government machinery of some states came to a halt. Protesters vandalised government buses, vehicles, shops and they even school buses. These protests also led to the loss of lives. Taking cognisance of the loss of property in violent protests, in October, the top court said that if the protesters turn violent and vandalise property their leaders must present themselves for questioning before the police within 24 hours.

The protests which brought the nation to a halt are:

Bhima-Koregaon Protest: Bhima Koregaon case refers to the violence that broke out during the gathering in Shanivar Wada in Pune to celebrate the 200th battle of Bhima Koregaon on January 1. The interference of the upper case Maratha on the Dalit gathering resulted in the violence. In the protest, one person died and over 30 people injured. Police have detained more than 300 people, after this, a Maharashtra bandh was called by Dalits on January 3, 2018. Protests were staged all over Maharashtra. In Mumbai, suburban trains were affected due to which Dabbawalas suspended their services. In some areas protests were turned violent.

Padmaavat Protest: Karni Sena and other Rajput organisation protested against the release of Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor starrer movie Padmaavat. Deepika played the role of Queen Padmavati in this movie. Padmaavat, which was earlier scheduled to release as 'Padmavati' on December 1, faced the wrath of Karni Sena and other Rajput groups. The protesters alleged distortion of history by the filmmakers, claiming that Padmavati, a 13th century figure considered as deity by a section of Rajputs, has been defamed. In a very shameful act during the series of protests, even school bus was attacked.

SC/ST Protest: Various Dalit groups protested on April 2, against the ruling of the apex court on the SC/ST Act which prevents immediate arrest without verification. Dalit groups consider this verdict will dilute the SC/ST Act. More than nine people were killed and several lefts injured in violence that erupted across several states as protestors blocked trains, clashed with police and torched private and public properties, during a nationwide bandh.

Sterlite Protest: On May 22, people of the Thoothukudi district of Tamil Nadu protested against the construction of a copper plant, claiming that it was polluting groundwater, and was hazardous for the environment. The protests took a violent turn when 13 people were killed and more than 60 were injured in the police firing during the protest. The police fired at a crowd of 20,000 protesters. However, months after the protest, the autopsy report has confirmed that 12 out of 13 protesters died as bullets - fired by police - hit them either on the chest or head.

Maratha Agitation: The Maratha community has been demanding 16% reservation in jobs and educational institutions for a long time. Its agitation took a violent turn in July and August this year. The Maratha Kranti Morcha, an umbrella body of various community bodies, had called for a two-day state-wide bandh in July to press for their demand across Maharashtra. In Mumbai, Protesters took to streets and blocked the Eastern Expressway. The Sion Panvel highway was also completely blocked. Several BEST buses were vandalised, and railway tracks were blocked as Maratha protesters to enforce the day-long bandh.

Sabarimala Protest: On September 28, a five-judge constitution bench headed by then Chief Justice Dipak Misra, in its 4:1 verdict, had cancelled all ban on the entry of women of all ages into the Sabarimala Temple of Lord Ayyappa in Kerala. Around 69 people were arrested in November after they allegedly violated Section 144 imposed in the vicinity of the temple. A string of protests has been witnessed in the state after the Supreme Court's verdict.

Farmers' Protest: The farmers, thousands in number, began their agitation on September 23 at Haridwar in Uttarakhand. Violent clashed erupted between farmers and the Delhi police at Delhi- Uttar Pradesh border in Ghaziabad on October 2 as they were Farmers were marching towards Kisan Ghat.

In contrary, farmers of Maharashtra set an example the way they organised their protest in March. The farmers marched from Nasik to Mumbai to gherao the Maharashtra state assembly demanding complete loan waiver and increase in minimum support price. They reached Mumbai early in the morning so that student who were to give their board exams should not face any difficulty. In November also they conducted a similar type of long march."

The rumbling controversies and divisive trends of 2018 erupted in a perfect storm of chaos at the year's end with parts of the US government paralysed by a showdown between President Donald Trump and the Democrats, while senior officials quit, foreign and strategic policies fell into disarray, and the stock markets tumbled.

Chief of Staff John Kelly and his Defence Secretary, Jim Mattis havr quit, and so has Nikki Haley, his United Nations ambassador and the first Indian American to serve on the US cabinet, along with several other officials.

Adding to his sense of isolation, Trump lost control of the House of Representatives, the lower house, to the Democrats in the November mid-term elections (even though his Republican Party strengthened its hold on the Senate).

""I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,"" Trump tweeted on Christmas Eve, a picture of isolation.

He lacked the votes that are required beyond a simple majority to pass budget legislation in the Senate to include funding his $5.6 billion demand for building a wall along the Mexican border to prevent illegal immigration, which was one of his election pledges.

He stood firm on not accepting a budget without the funding for the wall and the Democrats were equally defiant about not providing for it, leading to the government running out of funds and causing the shutdown.

Illegal immigration was one of the flashpoints this year as Trump moved to curb the inflow of migrants - many of them economic migrants or those upset by gang-violence and seeking to claim refugee status.

To discourage parents and others who bring children with them to claim sympathy and lenient treatment, he ordered the separation of children from parents citing a President Barack Obama-era court order against keeping children in custody for more than 20 days.

It became a public relations nightmare for Trump and under a new court order, he had to reunite them.

Meanwhile, more than 10,000 Central Americans came in a convoy in November to the Mexican border hoping to enter the US by the sheer force of their numbers.

Trump mobilised the military to back up the border patrol to stop them. After some unsuccessfully tried to attack border patrol personnel and rush through the border, they are now camped out in Mexico awaiting their turn to appeal for asylum and posing a problem for both countries.

This opens the way for Israel's and the Saudi's nemeses Turkey, Iran and Syria (and, by extension, Russia) to increase their influence in different areas of the region - upending the core of US policy that relies on Riyadh and Jerusalem.

The withdrawals from Afghanistan will likely have an impact on South Asia and affect India.

The troops pullback led to the resignation of Mattis, who opposed the pullout from Syria, and to criticism from many Republicans and conservatives.

A positive development in 2018 - though still clouded by uncertainties - is Trump's North Korean diplomacy that led to a summit between him and Kim Jong-un, the Pyongyang strongman, after Trump's characteristic blasts of insults and threats.

They agreed in principle to denulearisation of the Korean Peninsula and North Korea has begun dismantling its missile production and test facilities while there has been no progress on nuclear disarmament.

On the economic front, Trump, who had promised to tackle the trade deficits and bring back manufacturing jobs, took on Mexico and Canada and reworked the trade agreements to reflect what he considered a fair deal for the US.

While India and other countries were in his sights as tried to lower trade deficits, he launched an almost full-fledged trade war of tariffs against China, which retaliated. It has added to the uncertainty from the budget battle and the US central bank policies and wiped out all the gains the stock markets made this year. Wall Street indices ended in the red for 2018, even though by most measures, especially the low unemployment, the economy was strong.

With their control of the House, Democrats, who are smarting from the 2016 election defeat that they blame on Russian interference, will be pushing harder for investigations into Moscow's role and into whether Trump collaborated with the Russians, as well as into various allegations against him and his family.

So far the 18-month investigation by a special counsel has only trapped people connected with Trump campaign, including his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, on charges like lying to investigators and bank fraud.

A significant reflection of the nation's political divide is gun control, which the Democrats overwhelmingly support and Republicans oppose, and that will be a key issue as the nation gears up for the 2020 elections.

This year saw at least four incidents of mass shootings, including one at a Florida school that killed 17 and at a Jewish temple that took 11 lives in Pennsylvania.

Trump is crossing the half-way mark of his four-year term and will be in full campaign mode in 2019 as all parties start preparing for another polarising election in 2020.

Short of an impeachment or evidence of direct collusion with Russians or a major criminal case, Trump will be his party's candidate.

For the Democrats, the test will be to come up with a charismatic and unifying leader and a coherent policy alternative, which they did not manage in 2018.

But, it's not what you think it is. The original paintings are appreciated because of their naturalistic qualities. In the 17th century, when an artist decided to paint fruit, it was quite exceptional, because fruit in itself is not so special.""

Crazy fan accounts and paparazzi photographers, are fuelling his celebrity status. They stake out his haunts, and post details about his outfits. There is even an Instagram account dedicated to his nanny. With Taimur returning the love, the New Year is going to be special.

If Hannah Gadsby's stand-up special Nanette was radical, our comedians from the LGBTQI community aren't too far behind.

One of India's greatest abstractionists, who passed away in 2018, Mehlli Gobhai's canvasses showed little but spoke a lot. Shireen Gandhy's Gallery Chemould will be presenting a retrospective of his works in March 2019, along with curators Nancy Adajania and Ranjit Hoskote at the NGMA.

They are artistes who are all about the littlest of details. Their palm-sized collectibles are not only cute, but explore new materials and the need to innovate. In 2018, internationally, and in India, works by miniature artistes -- everything from food to TV show memorabilia -- became the new hip collectibles to go online shopping for. In a time and society, where extra large is the order of the day, and miniature art is a refreshing genre, 2019 promises to see more of it.

The aim of The Hope Circuit is to ""give corporate bands the limelight they deserve,"" says musician Howard Pereira, the man behind the initiative, where a corporate band opens for a well-established band at Hard Rock Cafe every month. The bands that play are from all corporate sectors, banking being the most popular one. Most have learnt music growing up and gave it up for many reasons, monetary being the primary.

For the last few years, 30-year-old Vashi resident Arvin David, who runs the music company Connect, has been introducing students with hearing loss to the beats of the djembe -- a rope-tuned goblet drum with origins in West Africa. To accomplish this, he invented the ""vibration box"" -- a two-seater box, made with wood of a particular thickness and width, inside which speakers are placed. David's djembe is connected to the speakers via a wireless microphone. He is not alone. Breach Candy resident Nicole Fernandes recently started an electronic keyboard tutorial on YouTube, Music For The Deaf.

Kirsten Varela has turned his backyard into a no-frills calisthenics park and christened it Elysium, a place of perfect happiness. ""The best part about calisthenics is that it's mainly 90 per cent upper body,"" he says. ""Calisthenics is mixing your body with movements like mobility, stability and just trying to create a beautiful movement.""

This year saw the launch of apps like Delta, which are LGBTQ friendly, and Tinder also opened up its platform to be more inclusive. As they opened up to us, members of the LGBTQ told us why dating apps, which helped them personalise their needs, gave them an opportunity to look for exactly what they want.

If your grandparent or relative lived in pre-Independent India, and had interesting stories to share from that era, it's time you nominate them for the Citizen Archive of India's Generation 1947 project. The project will record and archive stories of Indian citizens who've witnessed India through two centuries, using oral history and material memories.

They are very young, but that doesn't stop them from giving their thousands of followers advice on issues ranging from exam stress to mental health to suicide. India's young Instagrammers, themselves vocal about their problems, make themselves relatable to their followers. They address the fans' issues through their posts, live streams (where they take questions), YouTube channel, and also private messages. As we enter 2019, they get even more important than ever before.

Punyakoti -- the first crowdsourced attempt at making a full-length 2D animated film in Sanskrit -- has reached its post production stage and will release in 2019. Over 100 people from across the country have collaborated on the project, including actor Revathi, music maestro Ilaiyaraja, National award-winning editor Manoj Kannath and puppeteers Anupama and Vidyashankar Hoskere.

Sensing the growing homophobia in schools, former student Kabir Karamchandani formed a support group titled Garv in February to address the issue. While the 20-year-old may be miles away, pursuing his higher education in Oberlin, Ohio, his legacy is being carried forward by a dedicated team of 'woke' boys and girls. Interestingly, the Garv initiative might be included as a case study in a large scale survey conducted by Humsafar Trust on bullying in schools.

In October, the Diss track trend hit India when Mumbai underground rapper Emiway took on popular singer Raftaar. When rapper Raftaar said in an interview that there was no money to be made in underground rapping and named Emiway, the 22-year-old Mumbai rapper released a diss track called Samajh Mein Aaya Kya trying to address the issue. Then Raftaar released a song, then Emiway released another... well, you get the drift. What makes it good for you is that you can follow them and enjoy some quality music.

One man's problem could well be another man's opportunity. And entrepreneurs Ameya Davda and Devak Davda's startup, Space Valet, know that well. This year, they launched a service that aims to be a one-stop storage solution that offers private, lockable and secure self-storage units of various sizes to stash your belongings. You browse the website and find a suitable storage plan, then order as many boxes as you need, and then pack and label your belongings.

What is it about Ludo King that has made it beat Temple Run, Candy Crush and Pokemon Go, to become the No. 1 free game on both Google Play Store and App Store? We dug deep to find out how this trend has seamlessly penetrated the lower rungs of the socio-economic segment, galvanising a strata that hadn't warmed up to digital games. Raamesh Gowri Raghavan, an ancient Indian games researcher and professor of archaeology at Mumbai University, believes the game has an innately competitive element which makes it addictive.

The portraits are of friends and celebrities, and showcase the deft ways in which a line can twist and turn continuously.

This year, Pramod Rathi picked up Miko, an emotionally intelligent robot, at the IIT-B Techfest to address the relentless questions fired by his kids. His review? ""My children took to Miko immediately. Also, unlike its Chinese counterpart, Miko has an adorable voice that's not robotic. We can relate to it."" Miko is built to engage children between five and 12 years of age. To ensure an age appropriate discussion, it comes with a filter that ensures the answers are child-safe.

Go-to sculptors Mingleshwar and Benzoni Sequeira are breaking new ground in design while ensuring that their three-generation-old skill retains its traditional origins.

Technocrat Ankur Puranik is spearheading an initiative mooted by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region to create a grid of mini-weather stations by roping in other weather enthusiasts. The weather bureau currently receives updates only from Santacruz and Colaba. But the new initiative will allow every area in the city to have its own weather station.

For the last 27 years, Maharashtra Andha Audyogik Utpadak Sahakari Sanstha (Maryadit), a Maharashtra-based cooperative society run by the visually impaired, has been maintaining and manufacturing furniture at all state government-run institutions. Their handcrafted cane chairs and tables, and upholstery can be seen at the BMC office, Bombay High Court, sessions court, sales tax, excise and police departments. If recruitment is through word of mouth, so are contracts, which means you can order from them, too.

Makarand Deshpande, the maverick playwright, finished his 50th original script, Epic Gadbad, marking a milestone in a glorious journey onstage. A farce, it is a conclusion to his previous play, Shakespearecha Mhatara, which was a hilarious take on King Lear. While it was first staged at Prithvi Theatre in July 2018, the playwright has plans to bring it back to the city in 2019 as well.

In 2018, the iconic theatre group Awishkar Theatre brought Aranya Kiran directed by Ajit Bhagat. The play, staged 10 years after the death of its late director-playwright Chetan Datar, is set in the Mahabharata. It revolves around a self-questioning Lord Krishna (played by Sushil Inamdar) in Dwarka. The string of monologues with various lead characters -- wife Rukmini, brother Balaram, foster parents Nand and Yashoda and lastly, mother-like Gandhari -- interrogate Krishna's trickery, political moves and worldview. The play is still being staged and the next show is in January itself.

A publishing house that started a reading movement back in the '70s, is set for a new innings to revive the language of its people. The publishing house was launched in 1974 by journalists Ashok Jain, Dinkar Gangal, Arun Sadhu and Kumar Ketkar, who created an informal organisation to spread the culture of reading among Marathi speakers. Over the years, it has seen several members come and go and even survived a slump.

Samir Bharadwaj conducts paper workshops across Mumbai where he teaches how to neatly slice paper, and fold it just right, so that you can create your own automatons and pop-up books. Even if you don't become skilled at it, hand-eye coordination in adulthood is good for you.

Kahaani Designworks has culled 26 letters of the English alphabet of the original Art Deco typeface by looking at the buildings. Ruchita Madhok, principal designer, says, ""They are all geometric, not cursive, resembling the style of the building.""

When Aneesh Bhasin, co-founder at Svami, told us his tonic water has 50 per cent fewer calories than Schweppes, its main competitor, we knew the way we had our gin and tonic was going to change forever. Made from quinine sourced from Congo, cucumber and lime from India, and grapefruit from the US, Bhasin has increased the carbonation over the months because ""Indians like their fizz"". Svami is getting ready to launch more flavours, and a ginger ale by February.

The backstory behind booze

What and Where: White Lady cocktail at The Bombay Canteen; Chanel No. 6 at House of Nomads; Sherlock In A Pickle at London Taxi; and Red Monsoon at Hakkasan

This year, Yash Bhanage, co-owner at The Bombay Canteen, and his research team soaked themselves in the history of single screen theatres as inspiration for cocktails. Not just them, several other bartenders tried to create a story out of their cocktails. For instance, Jiaan Kris J Lam, House of Nomads, created Chanel No. 6 (in pic) as an ode to the fashion house, and Ami Shroff at London Taxi, whipped up a Sherlock-inspired drink which stood out for its prominent notes of gherkin, tea and rose. Order a glass.

At, Harajuku, on Chapel Road, co-owner Saleha Bawazir wanted to bring the street food of Harajuku to Mumbai. So, the restaurant offers a wide range of sweet and savoury crepes; Dorayakis, palm-sized treats comprising a sweet filling sandwiched between two round cakes, among other things. Vikram Khatri, executive chef at Hello Guppy, also overhauled the menu to introduce a range of new items including caramelised popcorn with crispy bacon, beetroot rice cracker and tuna nachos pizza. ""Everybody knows about sushi and ramen. It was time to educate people that there's a lot more that comes from Japan,"" he says.

Inspired by the legendary wrestler, Mini Punjab introduced The Dara Singh thali on its menu this year. Not for the weak-hearted, it packs in the best of unlimited eating. It features 33 items, and includes aloo paratha, chur chur de naan, makki di roti, murg mussalam rice, lamb yoghurt curry, chicken Amritsari and more. If you're in for a man-versus-food contest, here's your best bet.

Development consultant Ragini Kashyap, who started Third Culture Cooks -- a multinational supper club -- likes to tell a story with a bite. Her venture, Bordered dinner, explores border conflict by pairing food with peoples' stories and history. We sampled the Tamil-Sinhala conflict in Sri Lanka, and returned knowing a lot more about our neighbour's culinary diversity.

If you are severely intolerant to gluten, there is a chance you have stayed away from vodka, which is made from wheat, barley, or rye. Well, Tito's Handmade Vodka that is produced in Austin at Texas's oldest legal distillery is now available in Mumbai. The drink is made using corn. Tito Beveridge, who came up with the recipe, distilled the corn mash six times, because it was believed that corn retains some of its smoothness even after distillation. The process of making the corn-based vodka is similar to that of the making of single malts and high-end French cognacs.

It's not every day that you come across pepper in your pannacota, which is why pastry chef Husna Jumani's timut-infused creamy Italian dessert is noteworthy. It's the pronounced flavour of the Nepalese pepper -- spicy with hints of grapefruit -- that propelled her to pick this as the hero ingredient. However, it is an acquired taste, she warns.

The ingredients of Du Rhone might be a well-kept secret, but not its stellar reputation. So when the 140-year-old gourmet chocolate brand opened their first store in May this year, we were the first to rush for a blind tasting evening. Our favourite was the Coline which is a dark ganache with 70 per cent cocoa beans from Brazil and Papua New Guinea.

The last one year saw a rise in the number of gourmet delivery joints in the city. The menu at these kitchens range from Bento Buddha bowls to coconut-panko crusted shrimps with orange and ginger dips. The food, then, is the biggest selling point. We'd recommend the Mis Malaysian Seafood Bisque from Hello Green.

The wandering Maharaj is invited for weddings and funerals, casual get-togethers and Diwali dos, any affair in which the party size is too significant for a regular cook, and when guests need to be impressed. Om Maharaj specialises in sweets, such as rasgulla and ghevar; and Lallan Maharaj, who has also trained in restaurants and five-stars for 13 years, can be trusted to pull off Italian and Chinese dishes convincingly. Lallan says, ""In this line of work, the person who knows his job, doesn't need the title. I have not kept my name maharaj. It's all of you who call me maharajji. So, now, it has become a surname.""

From kombucha to vegetable broth, mixologists discuss what you can replace your calorie-laden mixer with. The almond milk soda cocktail at Colaba's Bombay Vintage has an interesting backstory. Here, Sean Pereira, bar operations manager, uses doodh soda consumed by farmers in Peshawar to keep themselves hydrated.

A food service in Bandra has been made special by autistic students, who have donned chefs' hats to make the lunch break worthwhile. The students belong to the Support for Autistic Individuals (SAI), a charitable trust set up by Kamini Lakhani and her husband, Anil. The young autistic cooks need a fair amount of support. ""It will take them anywhere between one and eight months for them to understand all the steps,"" says Lakhani.

What can you expect when the power couple behind The Table teams up with the boys behind The Woodside Inn? Miss T, a gastro Asian cocktail bar and restaurant. Every cocktail we sampled was characterised by an adventurous, refreshing and comforting tag. The Quixotic (R850) came with peanut butter-infused Jim Beam bourbon, hints of saffron and orange bitters. In the food menu, we liked the chicken and tender coconut curry (R900) that came with pandan rice. The curry was light without lacking depth. We liked the food for its simple execution of flavours and lack of pretentiousness, which is just what an Asian meal should be.

One of Goa's most loved restaurants, House of Lloyd, made its Mumbai debut this year. We met the chef for a taste of the Goa-inspired menu. He has selected the choicest of dishes including rassa omelette, pork chops and clams masala. Now you know where to head for a susegad experience.

Chef Scott Linquist (who runs the Miami favourite Coyo Taco) and Jason Hudanish introduced chapulines or grasshoppers as an off-the-menu dish at Mexican restaurant Xico. The grasshoppers don't have a distinct taste and the texture is close to crunchy prawns. A rich source of protein, you can either eat the dried grasshoppers directly, or on tortilla.

Shunned by society, trans-women have found jobs sans judgment at Third Eye Café. We visited the restaurant to find a place that serves decent food, and the opportunity to the third gender to lead a respectable life. Spread over eleven pages, the menu offers Italian, Oriental and Indian cuisine.

A hoppumm is a marriage between Sri Lanka's hoppers, a type of fermented pancakes, and South Indian appams, and three school friends from Bombay Scottish brought it to Bandra this year. Hoppumm is a 15-seater restaurant, exuding architectural influences from Sri Lanka. The highlight is the bowl-shaped Sri Lankan pancakes filled with a range of fragrant curries. To make it flexible, they offer combinations where you can pair a base staple -- hopper, string hopper (idiyappam), neer dosa, paratha or kothu roti -- with a flavourful filling.

Mastani is a milkshake that comes topped with a dollop of hand-churned ice cream. Some people also add fresh cut fruits, dry fruits and whipped cream. It is believed that when guests tried it for the first time, they would exclaim 'masta'. It has become a part of Pune's food heritage, and you can now try it at a tiny dessert parlour in Vile Parle called Karandikar Mastani House. A simple store with a couple of chairs, this Mastani house offers eight flavours starting from mango to the interesting Irish pudding Mastani.

Chembur, the eastern suburb which last made headlines for a culinary reason in November 2016 when Matunga's iconic eatery Mani's Lunch Home moved here, is now in the midst of a hospitality boom. Want to spend a day indulging your cravings? Do it with as few steps as possible as you start off with Pot Pourri, Theobroma, then 99 Pancakes, Keventers, London Bubble Co, The Koffee Works, Wok Hei and then China Villa.

Did you know that the hair dryer, apart from blowing hair, can be used to relight charcoals on the grill, soften chocolate and frost cake? Chefs across Mumbai are putting non-kitchen items to good use. The stand out was Empresa Hotel chef Ajay Chopra's ingenious hack of using a coal iron to press a quesadilla. Book a table to see for yourself."

According to police complaint, convict Salim Chhelawala had molested the girl while he was driving her towards her school in Karelibaug. On reaching the tobacco shop on the morning of September 17, 2016, Chhelawala asked the girl to sit on the front seat. He later touched the girl inappropriately and molested her.

The girl was shocked at Chhelawala's act and when she got down on reaching the school, Chhelawala even threatened to beat her if she told her parents about the incident. However, the girl informed her parents and Chhelawala was booked for molestation, criminal intimidation and violation of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act at City police station.

Following an FIR, Chhelawala was arrested. During the trial Chhelawala's lawyer argued that the complaint against his client was registered two days after the said incident which makes it a planned FIR with some intentions. However, the court upheld arguments of additional public prosecutor N U Makwana and convicted Chhelawala.

""The girl's statement was registered before a magistrate under section 164 of criminal procedure code which made it important evidence. During the hearing of the case too, her testimony and her father's testimony were also important,"" said Makwana.

Besides sentencing him to jail, the court of additional sessions judge A A Nanavati also fined Chhelawala of Rs 10,000."

and her evidence considering her duty is very important. Admittedly, she

is Incharge of birth and death register. Therefore, her evidence regarding

taking of the birth entry and its being maintained at her office would

have great significance in this case. She had brought abstract of birth

and death register's relevant page. This page is at Exh.145.

At Sr.No.13

at Exh.145,

there is an entry regarding birth of one female on 1.10.1994

with accused No.7 and 8 having been shown as father and mother.

Name of the child is not mentioned therein and the relevant column has

been left blank. No reason has been given by this witness for leaving

blank the column of name of the new born, though we do not find

anything amiss in it as it would be too naive to expect that any parents

would assign a name to an infant immediately on birth and without

completing customary rituals, which have a customary day fixed to

follow. Nevertheless, she has deposed about making of corrections later

on at the behest of accused Nos.7 and 8. There is no dispute about the

fact that these corrections were sought and granted by the Municipal

Council, Chandrapur after registration of crime against the accused

persons in the present case. By these corrections the name of the child

i.e. victim came to be entered in the birth register and also in the birth

certificate issued by the Municipal Council, Chandrapur. Along with the

name of the victim the nick name ""Mondi"" of accused No.8, has also

been inserted in this document. This was done, according to evidence of

PW 16 Vasanti, by following the due procedure of law in the sense that

proper verification on the basis of such documents as PAN Card, Aadhar

Card, Ration Card, and affidavit was carried out and the claim made by

the parents of the child was found to be correct. Now, the question

would arise as to whether or not any reliance could be placed upon

evidence of this witness and the document that has been proved by the

prosecution through her evidence.

13. The question has been answered by the learned Sessions

Judge in a negative manner. She has rejected the evidence of PW 16 on

the ground that all these corrections were made after the offences in the

present case came to be registered. We find that the ground taken by the

learned Special Judge for discrediting PW 16, Vasanti, is not borne out

from the record and also agitates against the own case of the

prosecution.

14. If we take a careful look at the evidence of PW 16 Vasanti,

we would find that this witness was examined as a prosecution witness

and we do not know as to what made the prosecution examine this

witness as it's own witness, at least this is what appears from the

recorded deposition. After having examined its own witness and after

having not declared the witness with the permission of the Court as

hostile to the prosecution, it is not permissible under the law for the

prosecution to disown its own witness. It is also not permissible in law

for the Court to say that the witness of the prosecution having gone

against the prosecution cannot be believed when the Court has not found

any element of hostility in such a witness. The prosecution has also not

brought on record through the evidence of this witness that the correct

date of birth was either 15.5.1999 or 15.3.1999 and the date of birth

shown in Municipal Council record as 1.10.1994 to be incorrect. No

suggestion in this regard appears to have been given to PW 16 by the

learned A.P.P. Rather, she has been examined as a prosecution witness in

such a manner as to create an impression that the prosecution desired

more strongly to prove the date of birth of the victim to be 1.10.1994

than anything else. There is absolutely nothing in the entire evidence of

PW 16 to find that this witness has spoken some falsehood on oath

before the Court.

15. If such is the impression which one gets logically on reading

the evidence of PW 16 Vasanti, we doubt, if such a witness could be

declared as untrustworthy just because she has stated a different date of

birth of the victim which was not in accordance with the expectations of

the Court. However, this is how the evidence of PW 16 has been

appreciated by the learned Special Judge and we find, with due respect

to the learned judge, that the inference drawn by her cannot arise

logically on assessment of the evidence of PW 16 Vasanti. We are also of

the opinion that there is nothing in her evidence to doubt what she has

stated about the date of birth of the victim and taking of entry (Exh.145)

in the birth register showing the date of birth of the victim to be

1.10.1994. Accordingly, we find her evidence and Exh.145

as reliable.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT BOMBAY

NAGPUR BENCH, NAGPUR

CRIMINAL APPEAL No.740 OF 2018

Vimalbai Manohar Doballiwar Vs The State of Maharashtra,

CORAM

: S.B. SHUKRE AND

S.M. MODAK, JJ.

DATE : 19 th DECEMBER, 2018.

ORAL JUDGMENT : (Per : S.B. Shukre, J.)

1. These appeals are being disposed of by common judgment as

they arise out of the same judgment and order dated 30th May, 2018

rendered by the learned Special Judge, Chandrapur in Special POCSO

Case No.62/2015.

2. For the sake of convenience, the parties to the appeal i.e.

appellants and respondent shall now be referred to as the accused in the

same order as they are arraigned in the criminal trial held against them

and the respondent respectively.

3. Facts of the case stated in brief are as under :

The accused No.1 Rameshwarlal Hemram Jat (Choudhary) is

the person with whom marriage of victim, alleged to be child at the time

of her marriage, has been performed with the aid and instigation of the

remaining accused, i.e. accused No.2 to 8.

It has been alleged that at the time of marriage, which was

solemnized on 8.4.2015, the victim was aged about 15 years and

studying in 9th standard in an Ashram Shala, situated Kawathala, Tq.

Korpana, District Chandrapur, while her parents i.e. accused Nos.7 and 8,

resided at Chandrapur. They earned their livelihood by dint of their

labour work. The accused No.7 finding it difficult to make both ends

meet, thought that her burden would be lessoned if her daughter, victim

of crime, was married off as she had already, in their opinion, come of

age. With this aim in mind, she used to broach the subject of marriage

with the victim but the victim used to stoically refuse the proposal saying

that she was more interested in her studies. It appears that accused

No.8, father of victim, was initially on the side of the victim, but later on,

perhaps on the influence of his wife, had changed his mind and also

accepted the proposal of his wife.

As the days passed by, an opportunity for fulfilling the wish

of the parents presented itself to accused Nos.7 and 8. Accused No.2, a

neighbour of accused Nos.7 and 8 informed the parents of the victim that

one eligible boy having good financial background was available and

with the consent of the boy and the girl their marriage could be

performed. In order to take this proposal forward some negotiations

were held and ultimately, the marriage of the victim was solemnized

with the accused No.1 who was then aged about 29 years. According to

the victim, this was against her consent, but she had no other alternative

than to bow before the wishes of her parents. However, her dislike

towards the accused No.1 and her displeasure with the remaining

accused continued. Soon after the marriage, accused No.1 consummated

the relationship and started living with the victim as her own husband.

There was hardly anything which the victim could do to resist the

accused No.1 and his advances towards her. The physical relationship

between the two thus went on unrestricted. However, within her mind,

the victim had always wanted to play rebel. Meanwhile, the accused

No.1 had also taken the victim to his native place in Rajasthan and there

also, both of them lived as husband and wife. While in Rajasthan, the

victim stole an opportunity of running away from the house of accused

No.1 on the pretext of celebrating her birthday at her parental house.

The victim returned to Chandrapur and without losing time

registered F.I.R. against her parents, accused No.1 and all those including

her neighbours, who were involved in solemnizing her marriage with

accused No.1 without her consent. Offences punishable under Section

376 Indian Penal Code (in short, ""I.P.C.""), Section 4 read with Section 3

of the Protection of Children from sexual Offences Act, 2012 and Section

9 and 10 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 were registered

against all these persons and investigation was carried out. These

accused persons were ultimately chargesheeted

by Police in the Special

Court constituted under the provisions of the Protection of Children from

Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (in short, ""PoCSO Act, 2012""). They were

prosecuted for offences punishable under Section 376(2)(n) I.P.C.,

Section 4 read with Section 3 of the PoCSO Act, 2012, Sections 9 & 10 of

the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 and Section 3(1)(xii) of the

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,

1989 (in short, ""Atrocities Act, 1989""). On merits of the case, learned

Sessions Judge found that offences punishable under Section 376(2)(n)

I.P.C., Section 4 read with Section 3 of PoCSO Act, 2012, Section 9 of

the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 and Section 3(1)(xii) of the

Atrocities Act, 1989 were proved as against accused No.1. Learned

Sessions Judge further found that an offence under Section 376(2)(n)

I.P.C. and also an offence punishable under Section 10 of the Prohibition

of Child Marriage Act, 2006 were proved against the accused Nos.2 to 8.

Having recorded such findings of guilt as against accused

No.1 and the remaining accused persons, by the judgment and order

dated 30th May, 2018, the learned Special Judge of PoCSO Court

convicted all the accused persons and awarded them different sentences

ranging from rigorous imprisonment for life for remainder of natural life

of accused No.1 to 14 years, 5 years, 2 years together with separate

sentences of fine and default sentences. Being aggrieved by the same

these accused persons are before this Court in this bunch of appeals.

4. We have heard Shri Mahesh Rai, learned counsel for accused

Nos.1, 3 and 6, Shri A.A. Dhawas, learned counsel for accused No.2,4,5,7

& 8 and Shri N.B. Jawade, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the

respondent/State. We have carefully gone through the record of the case

including the impugned judgment and order.

5. In this case, the prosecution has examined as many as 16

witnesses and also adduced in evidence some documents in order to

prove the age of the prosecutrix as below 18 years.

6. The PoCSO Act, 2012 is a special Statute enacted in the year

2012 with a view to protect the children from offences of sexual assault,

sexual harassment and so on and so forth and also provide a separate

mechanism for trial of the offences against these children. It defines a

child to be a person below the age of 18 years. In the present case, the

accused No.1 has also been charged with offences punishable under

Sections 4 and 12 read with Section 3 of the PoCSO Act, 2012 and,

therefore, definition of the child as given in the PoCSO Act, 2012 would

be relevant. At the same time, the remaining accused have also been

charged not under the PoCSO Act, 2012, but for an offence punishable

under Section 376(2)(n) I.P.C. Additionally, accused No.1 has been

charged for offences punishable under Sections 9 and 10 of the

Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 and remaining accused are

charged for an offence punishable under Sections 10 of the Prohibition

of Child Marriage Act, 2006 in which the same definition of the child as

has been given in the PoCSO Act, 2012 has been prescribed.

7. It is the contention of the learned counsel for the accused

persons that in the present case the age of the victim has not been proved

in any manner by the prosecution and according to them, the victim was

well above the age of 18 years at the time of marriage and there being no

dispute about solemnization of the marriage with accused No.1, the

whole edifice of the case has crumbled and, therefore, all the accused

persons are entitled to be declared innocent in the present case. This is

however, strongly disagreed to by the learned A.P.P., who submits that

even though there are at least two dates of birth which have appeared on

record from the evidence of the victim (PW 2), it becomes quite clear

that at the time of the incident she was about 15 years, 11 months and

23 days old and therefore, no interference with the impugned judgment

and order is warranted.

8. Considering the fact that the main issue involved in this

petition is that of the age of the prosecutrix/victim and also the settled

law that no conviction under PoCSO Act, 2012 can be sustained unless

the prosecution discharges it's burden to prove that victim was a ""child""

on the date of incident as held in the case of Ravi Anandrao Gurpude

vs. State of Maharashtra, reported in 2017 All MR (Cri) 1509) it would

be useful for us to first consider the evidence of the prosecution on this

aspect of the matter.

9. The victim (PW 2) has stated her date of birth to be

15.3.1999 and the date of incident to be 8.4.2015. As regards the date of

incident, there is no dispute but, about the date of birth there is indeed a

dispute. The date of birth so stated by the victim has been seriously

disputed by the accused persons. This could be seen from a specific

suggestion given to her during the course of the crossexamination.

According to this suggestion, the accused persons suggested that date of

birth of the victim was 1.10.1994. Of course, the suggestion has been

denied by the prosecution. But, the fact remains that the date of birth as

stated by the victim has not been accepted as it is by the accused persons.

Therefore, it has become necessary for the prosecution to discharge its

burden regarding proving of date of birth and resultantly the age of the

victim at the time of the incident beyond reasonable doubt.

10. It is seen from the evidence available on record that the

burden has been sought to be discharged by the prosecution through the

documents adduced in evidence and testimonies of PW 9 Sudhakar, the

Headmaster of Ashram Shala, Kawathala, PW 16 Vasanti Bahadure, the

employee of the Chandrapur Municipal Council and Incharge of birth and

death register and PW 6 Dr. Ritesh Rane, Medical Officer, General

Hospital, Chandrapur who had examined the Xray

report taken out as a

part of ossification test of the victim.

11. PW 9 has deposed that the date of birth of the prosecutrix

was not 15.3.1999, but was 15.5.1999. He has stated that an entry in

this regard has been taken by him in the school register, but he admits

that the basis of this entry was not the birth certificate of the victim, but

a certificate issued by a Ward Member of Muncipal Council, Chandrapur.

With this admission, the birth entry taken by PW 9 in the school register

has been rendered baseless and, therefore, as not admissible in evidence.

For the same reason, the school leaving certificate (Exh.89)

which

records the date of birth of the victim as 15.5.1999 can also not be relied

upon. The evidence of this witness on the aspect of age of the victim at

the time of the incident deserves to be rejected as not worthy of credit

though, it appears to us that it has been accepted as reliable, without

considering the vital admission given by this witness and quite

erroneously by the learned Special Judge.

12. PW 16 is an employee of the Municial Council, Chandrapur

and her evidence considering her duty is very important. Admittedly, she

is Incharge of birth and death register. Therefore, her evidence regarding

taking of the birth entry and its being maintained at her office would

have great significance in this case. She had brought abstract of birth

and death register's relevant page. This page is at Exh.145.

At Sr.No.13

at Exh.145,

there is an entry regarding birth of one female on 1.10.1994

with accused No.7 and 8 having been shown as father and mother.

Name of the child is not mentioned therein and the relevant column has

been left blank. No reason has been given by this witness for leaving

blank the column of name of the new born, though we do not find

anything amiss in it as it would be too naive to expect that any parents

would assign a name to an infant immediately on birth and without

completing customary rituals, which have a customary day fixed to

follow. Nevertheless, she has deposed about making of corrections later

on at the behest of accused Nos.7 and 8. There is no dispute about the

fact that these corrections were sought and granted by the Municipal

Council, Chandrapur after registration of crime against the accused

persons in the present case. By these corrections the name of the child

i.e. victim came to be entered in the birth register and also in the birth

certificate issued by the Municipal Council, Chandrapur. Along with the

name of the victim the nick name ""Mondi"" of accused No.8, has also

been inserted in this document. This was done, according to evidence of

PW 16 Vasanti, by following the due procedure of law in the sense that

proper verification on the basis of such documents as PAN Card, Aadhar

Card, Ration Card, and affidavit was carried out and the claim made by

the parents of the child was found to be correct. Now, the question

would arise as to whether or not any reliance could be placed upon

evidence of this witness and the document that has been proved by the

prosecution through her evidence.

13. The question has been answered by the learned Sessions

Judge in a negative manner. She has rejected the evidence of PW 16 on

the ground that all these corrections were made after the offences in the

present case came to be registered. We find that the ground taken by the

learned Special Judge for discrediting PW 16, Vasanti, is not borne out

from the record and also agitates against the own case of the

prosecution.

14. If we take a careful look at the evidence of PW 16 Vasanti,

we would find that this witness was examined as a prosecution witness

and we do not know as to what made the prosecution examine this

witness as it's own witness, at least this is what appears from the

recorded deposition. After having examined its own witness and after

having not declared the witness with the permission of the Court as

hostile to the prosecution, it is not permissible under the law for the

prosecution to disown its own witness. It is also not permissible in law

for the Court to say that the witness of the prosecution having gone

against the prosecution cannot be believed when the Court has not found

any element of hostility in such a witness. The prosecution has also not

brought on record through the evidence of this witness that the correct

date of birth was either 15.5.1999 or 15.3.1999 and the date of birth

shown in Municipal Council record as 1.10.1994 to be incorrect. No

suggestion in this regard appears to have been given to PW 16 by the

learned A.P.P. Rather, she has been examined as a prosecution witness in

such a manner as to create an impression that the prosecution desired

more strongly to prove the date of birth of the victim to be 1.10.1994

than anything else. There is absolutely nothing in the entire evidence of

PW 16 to find that this witness has spoken some falsehood on oath

before the Court.

15. If such is the impression which one gets logically on reading

the evidence of PW 16 Vasanti, we doubt, if such a witness could be

declared as untrustworthy just because she has stated a different date of

birth of the victim which was not in accordance with the expectations of

the Court. However, this is how the evidence of PW 16 has been

appreciated by the learned Special Judge and we find, with due respect

to the learned judge, that the inference drawn by her cannot arise

logically on assessment of the evidence of PW 16 Vasanti. We are also of

the opinion that there is nothing in her evidence to doubt what she has

stated about the date of birth of the victim and taking of entry (Exh.145)

in the birth register showing the date of birth of the victim to be

1.10.1994. Accordingly, we find her evidence and Exh.145

as reliable.

16. Now, the position is that the date of birth of the victim has

been proved to be of 1.10.1994 and so we see no difficulty to find that on

the date of incident, that is 8.4.2015, the victim had completed her 20

years of age and thus was not a child as defined under the provisions of

the PoCSO Act, 2012 as well as the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act.

The evidence of PW 16 having been found to be reliable and directly

proving the date of birth of the victim, we see no reason to consider the

result of the ossification test as opined by PW 6 Ritesh Rane. The

ossification test would come into picture only when the documentary and

other evidence brought on record by the prosecution does not

convincingly or beyond reasonable doubt establish the age of the victim,

wherever it is relevant. In this regard, we rely upon the law settled by

Hon'ble Apex Court in the cases of i) Mahadeo s/o. Kerba Maske vs.

State of Maharashtra, reported in (2013)14 SCC 637 and ii) State of

Madhya Pradesh vs. Anoop Singh, reported in (2015)7 SCC 773 That

being not the case here, we do not think it necessary to consider the

evidence of PW 6 Dr. Ritesh.

17. Even otherwise, Dr. Ritesh has opined that according to him,

the ossification test result shows the victim to be not less than 15 years of

age and not more than 16 years of age with margin of error on both sides

to be of 2 to 3 years. If such evidence is taken as reliable, the inference

regarding age of the victim would not be any substantially different from

what we have concluded in the previous paragraph. This way, the

evidence of PW 6 Dr. Ritesh, we would say, supports the case of the

defence that at the time of incident, the victim was not a child but a girl

who had attained majority having crossed 18 years of age.

18. With these conclusions we find that whole basis of the

prosecution case has met the dust and that would obviate the need for us

to consider other evidence. Then what would follow would be the

admitted fact which shows that the victim, a major girl, was given away

in marriage by her parents, to accused No.1 with whom the girl

cohabited as his wife. PW 2, the victim of crime, has given several

admissions which indicate that while she was cohabiting with accused

No.1, she really did not object to all that the accused No.1 did to her and

that she also did not raise any protest when various post marriage rituals

were performed at different places including those in Rajasthan during

which several villagers were invited and had participated. Such conduct

of the prosecutrx would only bolster up our conclusion that the victim

was a girl of majority at the time of the incident and this would give rise

to another inference that the marriage could not have been performed

without active or passive consent of the victim. It is a different matter

that the victim changed her mind later on perhaps due to the admitted

fact that since before her marriage, she was already engaged in a love

affair with another boy. So, the offences relating to rape and child

marriage with which the accused are charged herein stand not proved.

19. Accused No.1 has also been convicted for an offence

punishable under Section 3(1)(xii) of the Atrocities Act, 1989. However,

we do not see even an ioto of evidence to prove guilt of the accused for

this offence. There is no caste validity certificate adduced in evidence by

the prosecution. There is not even a whisper on the part of any of the

prosecution witnesses that the accused being in dominating position over

the victim, used that position to sexually exploit the victim on the ground

of family members particular caste. We find that even this offence has

not been proved by the prosecution.

20. It is seen from the impugned judgment that all the aspects as

pointed out above have not been considered in any manner by the

learned Special Judge and, therefore, the result is of erroneous

conclusion regarding establishing guilt of all the accused persons for the

offences with which they have been charged in the present case.

Accordingly we find that the prosecution has failed to establish beyond

reasonable doubt all the offences with which the accused persons have

been charged in the present case and it follows that all the accused

persons deserve to be acquitted of the same by interfering with the

impugned judgment and order.

21. The appeals are allowed.

22. The impugned judgment and orders are quashed and set

aside.

23. The accused No.1 is acquitted of 376(2)(n) of the Indian

Penal Code and also under Section 3 and 4 of Protection of Children

from sexual Offences Act, 2012, Section 9 of the Prohibition of Child

Marriage Act, 2006 and Section 3(1)(xii) of the Scheduled Castes and

Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and remaining

accused Nos.2 to 8 are acquitted of offences under Section 376(2)(n) of

the Indian Penal Code and Section 10 of the Prohibition of Child

Marriage Act, 2006.

24. If the fine amounts have been paid, they be refunded to the

accused persons.

25. The accused Nos Nos.1,4,7 and 8 are in jail. They be

released forthwith, if not required in any other crime.

26. The bail bonds of the remaining accused persons stand

discharged.

27. The Muddemal property being useless be destroyed in

accordance with law.

Daily Excelsior takes its readers through the events that unfolded during the year, and made it a year of happenings.

Jammu and Kashmir witnessed unprecedented political upheaval after decades, first six months witnessed the see saw balancing between alliance partners BJP and PDP, both testing each other's patience with administration at stand still and finally after one month of reshuffle in ministry along with BJP getting a new State Chief- Ravinder Raina, first woman CM of J and K, Mehbooba Mufti lost power as BJP withdrew its support and Governor rule was imposed. Alliance

Government faced multiple problems, some self made and others beyond their control. PDP tried to put Centrally RUSA funded UIET engineering college under State Government's control, vociferously opposed by students and ultimately restored back after Governor intervened. Similarly Nowshera, Sunderbani, Kalakote were on boil over the issue of ADC with Nowshera, constituency of State BJP President Ravinder Raina, witnessing complete shutdown for almost two months over demand of district status. Kathua region witnessed turmoil over the issue of Rasana rape case with people migrating from there alleging discrimination by Crime Branch and demanding CBI enquiry. In the whole process two BJP ministers, Ch Lal Singh and Chander Prakash Ganga, lost their ministry, BAR Association Jammu jumped into the controversy but was ultimately made to retract as Supreme Court intervened and transferred trial of the case to Pathankot for trial on day to day basis. For the first time in history of Jammu and Kashmir NC MLA, Mohammad Akbar Lone shouted pro Pakistan slogans inside the Assembly and Assembly also witnessed breach of protocol controversy between Speaker and Deputy CM. Governor N.N. Vohra got replaced with SP Malik, ending his long tenure in Jammu and Kashmir. To strengthen the administration, CS and one advisor from outside state were appointed.

On terrorism front, continuing from where they had left, terrorists struck on the first day of the new year in South Kashmir at CRPF camp and the encounters continued throughout the year in the valley as terrorists even attacked Military Station Sunjwan at Jammu, again

struck at Jahajjar Kotli Jammu and assassinated BJP leader Anil Parihar and his brother at Kishtwar. Kidnappings / killings of belt men and their relatives were a common phenomenon throughout the year, be it the occasion of Diwali or Ramzan. On one hand school bus got stone pelted while on other hand a young Chennai tourist lost his life in an unfortunate stone pelting incident. FIRs were also registered against army men despite AFSPA. Jammu bore the brunt of across the border shelling as the entire IB and LOC was active throughout the year with Indian army / BSF giving Pakistan a befitting reply from time to time. With missing bunkers, crumbled health services, thousands migrated from borders in peak summer.

Another area of tragedy was repeated major accidents on Ramban, Doda, Kishtwar, Bhaderwah highway along with Poonch - Rajouri highway. Among the dead were pilgrims of Amarnath and Chandi Mata. Eight local tourists also lost their life as huge boulder fell on them at Siar Baba water fall. All the accidents once again exposed the state of trauma centres along with district hospitals though work on five new medical colleges was taken up a step forward with appointment of principals. J and K also witnessed Basant mania for a brief period with IGP Traffic becoming hero for some while villain for others and finally got transferred.

Power segment remained affected throughout the year as Jammu division suffered in summer and Kashmir in winter with no serious efforts by the authorities to upgrade the infrastructure despite repeated reminders/ reprimands from Central PMDP team. On the development front historic Raghunath Mandir and Mubarak Mandi projects proved hype only along with Smart City projects as no substantial progress could be noticed this year. Baramullah to Kupwara railway line got approved and the first phase of the survey for the Bilaspur-Manali-Leh railway line project also got completed as initial estimates put the cost of the 465 km line at ?83,360 crore and even Jammu-Rajouri-Poonch railway line got approved .

Karan Singh retired from Rajya Sabha and Gulam Nabi Azad was declared best parliamentarian for the year 2015. Mehul Chowksi defrauded J and K Bank of 152 crores. Both JU and KU got their new VCs but simultaneously SKUAST(J) rating nosedived from 15 to 24.Aircel and Reliance Communications shut down their operations leaving lakhs of subscribers high and dry. This year, FM Drabu's statement on Kashmir situation cost him his ministry. BJP blocked revised militant rehabilitation policy though it diluted its stand on Article 370 and 35 A. J and K's KAS exams adopted UPSC pattern and 23 ETT colleges were sealed in the this year. Deficit of IAS, IPS continued and even judges' strength of HC reduced to 50% despite J and K getting its first woman Chief Justice Geeta Mittal. Daughter of soil, Professor Neelu Rohmetra, Director IIM Sirmaur, HP received the 'First Ladies Award' for being the first woman to head an IIM.

This year also NIA kept its pressure on hawala operators and even raided central jail Srinagar from where number of mobiles, SD cards and other material got recovered. For a change 150 bungalows by politicians also got vacated this year. Print media also suffered this year as Shujat Bukhari, Editor in Chief of Rising Kashmir, was shot dead by terrorists. Chief Secretary BB Vyaas got the extension but later on under Governor's Rule was appointed as an Advisor to Governor, later on as member UPSC. DGP SP Vaid was replaced by Dilbagh Singh under Governor's Rule. Border residents got major relief as reservation was extended to residents of IB on the pattern of LOC residents.

In last six months with new Governor came the fresh breeze, things started rolling as long delayed projects like AIIMS, Jammu-Akhnoor road widening got much needed flip, corruption was taken seriously by new Governor with the cancellation of state employees insurance with Reliance as well as talks with AFCONS for two 10 kms tunnels for 1000 MW Pakal Dul hydro-electric project were shelved. Panchayat and Municipal elections were successfully conducted despite boycott by both NC and PDP and power equations took interesting turn with NC rebel spokesperson Junaid Azim Mattu got elected as Srinagar Mayor with BJP support. Final tally of both Jammu and Kashmir were very interesting , out of total 1144 seats BJP got 312 (Jammu 212, Kashmir-100), INC 267 (Jammu-110, Kashmir -157) and independents whopping 363 ( Jammu-185, Kashmir-178). Three candidates got elected with lottery system and Soura in Srinagar had a distinction of not casting a single vote though 11,265 voters were there with three candidates in fray. On the similar pattern Panchayat polls were also successfully conducted leaving a big question mark on boycott call of NC and PDP. Under the Governor SAC took some long awaited decisions like increase of honorarium of thirty thousand SPOs, setting up Anti Corruption Bureau, damage to horticulture sector due to untimely snowfall causing hundreds of crore loss as such was declared natural calamity, reservation for disabled, scholarship for specially able students to name a few. Major inter-state agreement of Shahpur - Kandi was signed this year. Ujh multi-purpose project also got cleared. Valley saw its first ever mass wedding as 105 tied knot at one place.

Kashmir got new IGP in SP Pani and many prominent terrorists were eliminated including Naved Jat , killer of Shujat Bukhari but the most disturbing news was arrest of engineering students with arms and ammunition from Punjab colleges, PhD scholars joining militancy under the influence of radicalization. CEC LAHDC, Dr Sonam Dawa Lonpo , passed away and Ladakh MP, Thupstan Chhewang resigned from Parliament as well as BJP on account of alleged neglect by BJP on issue of UT status. Initiative of 23 GW ultra mega solar power project got a flip as under phase one of the project, 2,500 MW Solar PV Capacity for Kargil region and 5,000 MW for Leh district got sanctioned. Prime minister once again visited Jammu and Kashmir for stone laying of Zojilla tunnel project and also dedicated the 330-MW Kishenganga Power Project constructed in Gurez area of Kashmir to nation.

Jammu and Kashmir was fined one lakh rupees by Supreme Court for not furnishing details on mid day meal scheme in the state and noticeably two from our state got Sahitya Academy Award, Dogri writer Inderjeet Kesar for novel 'Bhagirath' and Mushtaq Ahmad Mushtaq for his collection of short stories 'Aakh'. Ladakh got its first University after 71 years and J and K got Special Industrial Package. HC directs removal of encroachments and illegal constructions in and around Tawi river from Nagrota to Mandal Phallian.

With President's rule now prevalent in State, administration is in full throttle, daily reformative progressive decisions taken, one can feel the much needed flip of development which people of Jammu and Kashmir hope will continue in the ensuing year and on this positive note we wish all our readers 'A Happy New Year'."

Twenty-one years after a trial court acquitted a man for raping a minor, the Bombay High Court recently quashed the order and convicted him.

A Division Bench of Justices Indrajit Mahanty and V.K. Jadhav said, ""The trial court acted in a casual or cavalier manner in determining the victim's age to be that of a major."" The Bench was hearing an appeal filed by the State government challenging the order passed by the additional sessions judge in Nashik acquitting Macchindra alias Babdu Gangadhar Sonawane on July 24, 1997.

On December 1, 1996, the 11-year-old victim was alone at home and had a severe headache. Even though she did not have money, the girl went to the village grocery shop owned by the accused and requested him for some medicine. The accused instead shut his shop and took the victim home and raped her. The accused then threw the girl out of his house and she walked back and sat in front of her house.

When the girl's father returned, he found blood on her clothes and took her to hospital. After a medical examination, it was learnt that she had been raped. The victim then informed her mother that Sonawane had raped her. The accused was then charged under Sections 376 (punishment for rape) and 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code.

However, the trial court acquitted him as there was no birth certificate or school leaving certificate to prove the victim's age. Based on a medical check-up, the trial court held her age to be 16 years. The court also observed that the girl gave consent to the act as no injuries were found on her body.

The trial court said, ""It is not possible to believe that against her will or without her consent this act was committed. In the absence of any bites, scratches and resistance, it is apparent that the child did not make any attempt to run away or shout for help. Therefore, she had given her 'consent' for sexual intercourse.""

However, the High Court, in its 35-page order, said, ""The age determination test shows that the victim was less than 16 years of age on the date of incident and is about 14 years."" The court quashed the trial court's order and said, ""Absence of any injury on the body of the victim cannot lead to a conclusion that she had given her consent. All that it indicates is that she did not put up a resistance. Lack of resistance or absence of injury on the body of the victim are of no consequence vis-a-vis the issue of consent."""

The government is working on a mission to bring down the drop-out rate to zero in the coming years, he said, laying the foundation stone for Anjuman-e-Islam's educational complex expansion project at the Dr. MIJ Girls High School & Junior College, Bandra.

The minister said for the first time since Independence, the NDA government has expanded development programmes for minorities from existing 100 to 308 districts, for providing basic amenities to ensure educational empowerment of girls of minority communities.

The government has launched schools, colleges, polytechnics, girls hostels, skill development centres to ensure employment-oriented development of the minorities, especially the girls, Naqvi said.

On its part, the ministry is committed to '3E' strategy of Education, Employment and Empowerment and in past two years thousands of minority-run educational institutions, including madrasas, have entered the education mainstream by connecting them with '3Ts' - Teacher, Tiffin and Toilet', said Naqvi.

He said in the past four years of the NDA, more than 2.11 crore students of minority communities, including 60 per cent girls, have been provided scholarships.

""This year, a National Scholarship Portal Mobile App has been launched to ensure smooth and hassle-free scholarship system for poor and weaker section students. The scholarship amounts are given directly into the bank accounts,"" Naqvi pointed out.

Besides, he said 5.43 lakh youth and 1.50 lakh artisans have been provided employment opportunities through job-oriented schemes at various levels, indicating the government's efforts for educational empowerment of all weaker sections, including minorities, have shown results on the ground.

Present on the occasion were Anjuman-e-Islam Chairman Jahir Kazi, Maulana Azad Education Foundation Vice-Chairman Ashfaq Saifi and Secretary R. Rehman.

The 144-year-old Anjuman-e-Islam was founded by Dr. Badruddin Tyabji in 1874, who was the third President of Indian National Congress, and the first Indian Barrister to practise law at Bombay High Court, where he rose to become the first Acting Indian Chief Justice.

Starting with a solitary school then, today it has mushroomed into a mega-educational institution running around 90 schools, colleges, professional courses colleges and sports complexes in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra benefitting over 1.10 lakh students of all communities.

The following article is from the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation's bi-monthly Foundation Action Newsletter, November/December 2018 edition.

Foundation staff attorney William Messenger argued Janus at the Supreme Court. The Foundation's victory must be vigilantly enforced.

SPRINGFIELD, VA - Since the 2012 passage of Right to Work legislation in the Wolverine State, Foundation staff attorneys have provided free legal assistance to Michigan workers in more than a hundred cases. With 41 ongoing cases and another 61 closed as of the publication of this article, Michigan cases continue to make up a disproportionate amount of the Foundation's caseload of approximately 220-230 active cases at any given time. Developments in Foundation legal cases in recent months show that despite dozens of victories for workers, Michigan union bosses continue to attempt to force workers to pay dues despite the Right to Work laws.

These federal lawsuits are among dozens of legal actions workers have pursued, with the assistance of Foundation staff attorneys, to enforce the Supreme Court's Janus ruling. As decades of Foundation litigation has amply demonstrated, without relentless enforcement, Big Labor ignores precedent and violates the rights of rank-and-file workers.

In California, Foundation staff attorneys are assisting Mark Smith, a court worker in Contra Costa County, who attempted to exercise his new protections days after the Janus decision.

Mr. Smith submitted his resignation from membership in American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 2700 and told union officials they did not have his authorization to deduct union dues from his paycheck.

AFSCME officials continued siphoning Mr. Smith's hard-earned money without his consent and despite his multiple attempts to resign. When Mr. Smith sent his resignation via certified mail, postal service records show union officials left the delivery unclaimed.

After his requests were repeatedly ignored, Mr. Smith came to Foundation staff attorneys for free legal aid in filing a federal lawsuit against AFSCME officials and his government employer.

In the complaint, Mr. Smith challenges union officials' violation of his First Amendment rights and a California law requiring public employers to deduct dues at the union's request, even if the worker revokes authorization. This egregious law, enacted mere hours after the Janus decision, also blocks public employers from informing employees of their Janus rights.

In Pennsylvania, school bus driver Michael Mayer attempted to exercise his rights under Janus just weeks after the ruling. He resigned his membership in the Teamsters union on July 20 and hand-delivered a notice in August demanding that his employer stop deducting membership dues from his paycheck.

However, Teamsters Local 312 officials refused to honor his resignation, and his employer, Wallingford-Swarthmore School District, continued withdrawing union dues from Mr. Mayer's hard-earned wages.

Teamster bosses claimed Mr. Mayer only had a 15-day window to escape from the union's new monopoly bargaining contract under a section of Pennsylvania's Public Employee Relations Act (PERA). Such a policy directly conflicts with the Supreme Court's Janus ruling, which held that dues taken without workers' clear and knowing affirmative consent violate the First Amendment.

When dues continued to be seized from Mayer's paycheck in September, Foundation staff attorneys filed a federal lawsuit against the Teamsters union and the school district for violating his rights.

The lawsuit seeks a refund of the dues that the Teamsters conspired to take without his consent after his resignation and asks the court to rule that the PERA violates his First Amendment rights by restricting his ability to resign union membership and stop paying dues.

""Unfortunately, though not surprisingly, rather than work to earn the voluntary support of the workers they claim to represent, union officials coast-to-coast are resorting to illegal schemes to block workers from exercising their rights under the Janus decision,"" said Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Foundation. ""These cases likely won't be the last challenging attempts to prevent workers from exercising their Janus rights."""

The drop-out among Muslim girls, which was as high as 70 per cent, has been reduced to 35-40 per cent due to awareness and educational empowerment programmes of the government, Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said here on Saturday.

The government is working on a mission to bring down the drop-out rate to zero in the coming years, he said, laying the foundation stone for Anjuman-e-Islam's educational complex expansion project at the Dr. MIJ Girls High School & Junior College, Bandra.

The minister said for the first time since Independence, the NDA government has expanded development programmes for minorities from existing 100 to 308 districts, for providing basic amenities to ensure educational empowerment of girls of minority communities.

The government has launched schools, colleges, polytechnics, girls hostels, skill development centres to ensure employment-oriented development of the minorities, especially the girls, Naqvi said.

On its part, the ministry is committed to '3E' strategy of Education, Employment and Empowerment and in past two years thousands of minority-run educational institutions, including madrasas, have entered the education mainstream by connecting them with '3Ts' - Teacher, Tiffin and Toilet', said Naqvi.

He said in the past four years of the NDA, more than 2.11 crore students of minority communities, including 60 per cent girls, have been provided scholarships.

""This year, a National Scholarship Portal Mobile App has been launched to ensure smooth and hassle-free scholarship system for poor and weaker section students. The scholarship amounts are given directly into the bank accounts,"" Naqvi pointed out.

Besides, he said 5.43 lakh youth and 1.50 lakh artisans have been provided employment opportunities through job-oriented schemes at various levels, indicating the government's efforts for educational empowerment of all weaker sections, including minorities, have shown results on the ground.

Present on the occasion were Anjuman-e-Islam Chairman Jahir Kazi, Maulana Azad Education Foundation Vice-Chairman Ashfaq Saifi and Secretary R. Rehman.

The 144-year-old Anjuman-e-Islam was founded by Dr Badruddin Tyabji in 1874, who was the third President of Indian National Congress, and the first Indian Barrister to practise law at Bombay High Court, where he rose to become the first Acting Indian Chief Justice.

Addressing the Collectors' conference here on Saturday, he said there was a shortage of accommodation during Visakha Utsav. He directed the tourism officials to make available one lakh rooms to improve the service sector. The improvement in tourism would help increase the economy of the region, he said asking the officials to prepare an action plan right from the village level for the development of the service sector.

Referring to Janmabhoomi-Mavooru programme early January, the Chief Minister said the programme should be conducted in a festival atmosphere. Debates should be held in a big way during the programme on white papers released by the State government, and the officials should bring awareness among people on the achievements of the government.

He said the Janmabhoomi programmes should be used as platforms for preparing vision documents and stressed the need for bringing more awareness among people on zero-budget natural farming. Some 635 awards received by the State indicated the development in the State, he noted.

The Chief Minister alleged that the Centre bifurcated the High Court without giving time for the government and employees. Citing the indifferent attitude of the Centre, he stated that cancelling permission for air show during 'Visakha Utsav' reflected the Centre's partisan attitude towards the State.

He said Polavaram project would be completed by 2019, and if the Centre extended its cooperation, the State would be able to complete the project early. Despite non-cooperation from the Centre, the State government was able to achieve 10.52 per cent growth rate and the income of farmers was doubled. He said Anantapur district topped in horticulture. Pattiseema Lift Irrigation Scheme helped stabilise the ayacut in Krishna and Guntur districts, he stated.

175 MSME parks

The Chief Minister said 175 MSME parks would be developed in all constituencies on par with Medtek park. R&D, product testing, marketing and warehousing would be developed in 200 acres. There was no dearth of natural resources, and the available resources should be utilised. He said AP was ahead in growth rate for the past four and half years. Despite deficient rainfall, a good growth rate was achieved in agricultural and allied sectors. Houses would be sanctioned to eligible people in the Janmabhoomi programme, he said and directed the officials to improve services in health and nutritious food sectors.

He asked the Collectors to initiate steps to improve satisfaction levels of people on the public distribution system. He said people should not be inconvenienced while availing ration.

Commissioner of Civil Supplies B Rajasekhar said 61 ration shop dealers were suspended. The officials said Krishna district topped in public satisfaction on PDS with 85 per cent, followed by West Godavari and Guntur districts (84 per cent) and the lowest is in Anantapur, Srikakulam and Kurnool (74 per cent).

The Chief Minister said the government procured 17,15,571 tonnes of paddy and paid Rs 2,640 crore to farmers. Rajasekhar said the government was distributing millets through fair price shops in accordance with the changing food habits and preferences of people.

Naidu directed the officials to distribute pensions to all the eligible by clearing the 2.65 lakh applications and asked the officials to release Rs 100 crore meant for school sanitation."

The year started with a remake, Brihaspathi, and ends with a romcom in Ananthu v/s Nusrath, which brings the total released films this year to 230 films -- which is definitely on the higher side for the industry.

Of these, about 20 films have stood out, including KGF, Tagaru, Sa. Hi. Pra Shaale: Koduge Ramanna Rai, Raambo 2, Ayogya, Gultoo, Aa Karala Rathri, Victory 2, The Villain, and Orange.

Cream of the crop

One of the year's biggest hits has turned out to be a recent release. KGF, starring Yash and directed by Prashanth Neel, chronicles the life of its protagonist, Rocky, across thirty years, and is set in the backdrop of the Kolar Gold Fields. Aside from Yash's show-stopping performance, highlights of KGF include cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda, art by Shivakumar and music by Ravi Basrur. While KGF had great buzz preceding its release, an unlikely blockbuster this year came in the form of Sa.Hi. Pra Shaale: Koduge Ramanna Rai, directed by Rishab Shetty and produced under his home banner. The film, set in Kasargod, sensitively portrays the issues faced by a school near the border and details the language struggles faced by young students. The director was inspired by a real-life incident that took place in 2007, which is relevant even today. With a cast comprising primarily of children, a highlight of the film was Anant Nag's performance. Another major hit of the year was Tagaru, directed by Suri, who had earlier helmed films like Duniya, Anna Bond, Jackie, Kaddipudi and Kendasampige. The hard-hitting A-certified film saw Shivarajkumar playing a cop and Dhananjay, in a breakout performance, portraying a new-age villain. Tagaru, which also stars Manvitha Harish, Bhavana and Vasishta Simha, was noted for several of its elements including characterisation, screenplay, cinematography, background score and stunts.

A year of firsts

With Kannada films facing stiff competition at the box office from other language films, which are getting increasing number of screens -- and the industry fighting against the dubbing of these films -- KGF made history by becoming the first Kannada film to get a simultaneous release in five languages. The film is made in two parts, and KGF Chapter 1 got a pan-India release on December 21. The makers of Avane Srimannarayana, Muniratna Kurukshetra, Pailwaan and Udhgarsha are all now planning for multilingual releases of their respective films. KGF also made history by becoming the first Kannada film to join the 100-crore club. The film, which collected more than 100 crore in its 7 days, is still going strong. The film has also become the all-time no. 1 Kannada grosser in the US. The year also marked the first collaboration of two superstars in Kannada industry, Shivarajkumar and Sudeep, who came together for Prem's directorial, The Villain. The CR Manohar-production also marked the Kannada debut of Amy Jackson. The re-release of classic, Nagarahavu (1972), was another first for the industry. The Vishnuvardhan-starrer, directed by Puttanna Kanagal, was re-released in a cinemascope 7.1 format by Eshwari Production.

Digital revolution

With OTT services increasing their clout, several Kannada films joined the library of Amazon Prime Video as well as other digital platforms like Netflix and Hotstar, which are all looking to expand their regional selection. Currently, the new Kannada films up streaming on Prime video are Humble Politician Nogaraj, Katheyondu Shuruvagide and Sankashta Kara Ganapathi. OTT platforms are also said to be in talks with big filmmakers for rights to their work.

The tragedy

The demise of Rebel Star Ambareesh shocked the industry this year. Others from the industry who left us in 2018 included Kashinath, Chandrashekar of Edakalu Guddada Mele fame, directors CV Rajendran, PN Satya, MS Rajashekar, and AR Babu, producer Bhakta Vatsala, senior actor Sadashiv Brahmavar, cinematographers Kumara Chakravarthi and KM Vishuvardhan.

New directors in the rise

The year saw several debutant directors making a mark, starting with Saad Khan, who made his debut with Humble Politician Nogarj. We then had Janardhan Chikkana, who made Gultoo. Rishika Sharma, grand daughter of ace director, GV Iyer, helmed a film titled Trunk. S Mahesh Kumar, a protégé of Yogaraj Bhat, made a smashing debut with the blockbuster, Aygogya. Gurudatha Ganiga, who became one of the youngest directors in the Kannada industry, had the privilege of helming the last film starring the late Ambareesh, Ambi Ning Vayassaytho.

Other debutants include Sunil Bheemrao (Onthara Banagalu), Arjun Kumar (Sankashta Kara Ganapathi), Raghu Shivamogga (Churi Katte), Devaraj Pujari (Kinaare),Raveen Kumar (Naduve Antharaviralli),Champa Shetty (Ammachi Yemba Nenapu),Karthik Saragur (Jeerjimbe), Kushal (Kannadakagi Ondanu Othi), and actor Vijay Raghavendra (Kismat).

The let-downs

The year also had its share of films that created much hype before release, but failed to live up to the promise. Rajaratha, Kanaka, Prema Baraha, Preetham Gubbi's Johnny Johnny Yes Papa, Bacckaaasura, Bhairava Geetha and Thayige Takka Maga can all be said to fall under this category.

The #MeToo movement

The MeToo movement, which started abroad and made its way to India, had an impact in the Kannada film industry too. While actor Sangeetha Bhat kicked off the movement here, it was Sruthi Hariharan's allegations against south Indian actor Arjun Sarja which made headlines at the national level. The case went up to the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce, and some senior actors from the industry, including Ambareesh, tried to solve the issue to no avail. The matter is now at the court. Actors Shraddha Srinath, Samyuktha Hegde, Neethu and Avantika Shetty expressed their support for Sruthi on social media.

Emphasis on strong women and remakes

2018 also saw the release of several women-oriented films, such as Savithribhai Phule, Hebbatu Rammakka, MMCH, The Terrorist and Hegondu Dina. The year also had its fair share of remakes, including Brihaspathi (VIP - Tamil), Samhara (Ade Kangal - Tamil), Huccha 2 (Raam - Tamil), Dwaja (Kodi - Tamil), Amma I Love You (Pichaikaaran - Tamil), Kumari 21 F (Kumari 21 F - Telugu), Ambi Ning Vayassaytho (Pa Paandi - Tamil), Naduve Antharariralli (Adaal Kadeyil Severiyil - Tamil), Jaggath Khiladi (Chaduranga Vettai - Tamil), 8MM (8 Thotekal - Tamil) and Hottegagi Genu Battegagi (The Intern - English).

Missing stars

Despite the large number of releases, some stars failed to have any films coming out this year. The list of actors who did not have a release in 2018 includes Darshan, Puneeth Rajkumar, Sriimurali, Dhruva Sarja, Rakshit Shetty and Upendra. While Darshan completed shooting for his 50th film, Muniratna Kurukshetra early in January, the film, which is to be released in 2D and 3D, is still stuck in post-production. The actor has also completed shooting for Yajamana, and is currently on the sets of Odeya, with all films expected to get a release next year. Puneeth Rajkumar only worked on a film, Natasaarvabhouma, which is slated for release in 2019. Sriimurali, who has lined up a couple of films, is busy shooting for Chetan Kumar's Bharaate. Upendra, who took a break from films to focus on politics, returned to cinema, and has completed shooting for Home Minister and I Love You. Rakshit Shetty's next after Kirik Party will be Avane Srimannarayana, which is being filmed. Dhruva Sarja had signed Pogaru, but the Nanda Kishore-directorial did not go on floors in 2018."

On Thursday the police claimed that the girl was hurt due to falling from the bicycle. Girl child has also stated this in the court about falling from the bicycle. The police also claim that after the medical examination of the minor girl, the doctor has not even confirmed the rape.

On the other hand, the questions are being raised on police on being registering the case hastily under serious offences and the action taken by the police with the suspected minor in this case reflects the sensitivity of the police against children. Counselor's help was also not taken in this entire case. ASP Dinesh Kaushal told that on Tuesday evening, when the minor girl was cycling, she fell and was injured.

On Wednesday morning when mother was making her daughter bath, only then she saw signs of injury. When mother asked about the injury from daughter, she took the name of one of her classmates. After this the kin had taken the girl for treatment in AIIMS.

There the doctor also interrogated the child. But the doctor was also surprised by hearing that an 8 year old boy kidnapped her. But when she was asked about someone else's involvement in the incident besides the classmate, the baby girl shook her head.

Finally the case reached the police station. Then police had registered a case under various sections on 10 years old boy and on another. In the night, the girl's classmate was interrogated but he was unaware of the crime.

Doctor did not give clear arguments:

DIG Dharmendra Chaudhary had formed the SIT for the investigation of the incident. The SIT took the statements of the girl and her father and with the suspected minor boy, in which there was no proof of the molestation has come out.

Suspected child denied the crime. In the medical report of the child, the doctor did not give a clear argument about being raped. The doctor had written in the report that there was no injury marks found in the private part of the girl.On this basis the police took again the statements of the girl. In which she informed that she fell down from bicycle. After this, the police have recorded statements under Section 164 in the court on Thursday.

According to ASP Kaushal, this case will not be concluded now. The whole matter will continue to be investigated closely. Since there was talk of involvement of an adult accused in this case, the police had immediately registered an FIR under serious sections.

Counseling was to be done, minor boy felt mental trauma

Archana Sahay, the director of the child line, says that in this case both the children had to be counseled. The big question is how can eight years old girl can allege about molestation, when she was injured after falling from bicycle?

Why did she take the name of her old classmate? At the same time, the 8 years old child also got hurt with mental trauma when he had been brought for brought for the interrogation on allegation of molestation.

Emergency numbers should be written at public places

MP Child Rights Protection Commission has taken cognizance in the case of rape with an eight year old girl on Thursday. The Commission has instructed to write emergency numbers on schools and school buses and public places, in view of the growing molestation of girl child in the state capital. The Commission has written a letter to the State Education Center, School Education Department and Transport Department for this.

These numbers are:

A defunct government school at the remote Mallapur village in Raichur district in north Karnataka is now abuzz with activity, thanks to the efforts made by Deputy Director of Public Instruction (DDPI) B K Nandanoor. The school, which had shut its doors in August this year, started operating from December 18, and at least four children have resumed studies.Setting an example of a grassroots initiative, Nandanoor got the government school reopened after residents approached him.The school was shut after a teacher was suspended and the students dropped out, even though a new teacher was deputed. Nandanoor swung into action at once on December 17. Nandanoor says,""I read the admission list of the school and then set a target for visiting the students' houses. I visited all the houses.""

Karnataka High Court: Makeover moves for B'luru

Bengaluru's aesthetic beauty has been restored, city roads are free from potholes, and cleanliness has improved -- all thanks to the Karnataka High Court, which woke up BBMP from slumber. Acting on a batch of PILs, a division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari directed BBMP to preserve the city's visual appeal by removing illegal hoardings, flexes and banners. Due to this, new bye-laws are being evolved to regulate hoardings. BBMP officials even registered an FIR against Minister D K Shivakumar for not removing an unauthorised ad, despite being given time. Citizens also got relief from pothole-riddled roads and garbage piles in public areas. The court availed the assistance of Army engineers to check the quality of work done by BBMP.

Nanditha: The power of one student

Nanditha (11) gets the undivided attention of her teacher every day. The resident of Obenahalli in Kolar is the sole student in the Government Primary School. The school, which was shut down at the start of the year 2016-17 after most students left it for private institutions, was reopened on the insistence of Nanditha, her parents and well-wishers. Komala GK, Nanditha's teacher, recalled how her parents, who work as daily wage workers, came looking for her all the way to the new school where she was posted. ""I could see anger, fear and sadness in them. They asked me what their daughter should do with the school closed."" The government was forced to reopen the school at the start of the 2017-18 year and admit Nanditha. Now even when her teacher takes leave, another one is deputed.

Namma Thambis: Green warriors of Ulsoor Lake

On October 10 this year, over 1,000 Thambis of the Madras Sappers waded into the waters of Bengaluru's Ulsoor lake and fought a war against an invasion, and won it. The battle was against water hyacinth, a weed. Ulsoor lake, situated in the heart of the IT City,is also used by the Sappers for training. Tired of seeing their lifeline being suffocated owing to pollution, the Sappers took matter into their own hands. The soldiers,on boats, pulled out the waste using their bare hands. They also removed plastic waste, household rubbish and other garbage. At the end of the day, the Army also issued a wake-up call in their signature fashion, blunt and to the point: ""People should understand that it is not the business of the Army to become garbage cleaners.""

Ananya:Hero in the hills

Ananya Vasudev RM saved 15 families of Karike village in Kodagu district during this year's floods and subsequent landslides. Ananya Vasudev,an assistant lecturer of Geology at the National Institute of Technology, received a WhatsApp video from a friend which showed loud sound emanating from the ground. Ananya Vasudev asked his friend to send another video. After seeing the fresh video, he was sure the sound was due to soil piping and the area could see a landslide. Soil piping is a formation of voids within soil which causes internal erosion and seepage. He immediately spoke to Kodagu Deputy Commissioner Sreevidya who sent a team to the village and evacuated the families. As predicted by Ananya, the area saw a huge landslide a few hours later.

S B Vastradmath: Speedy justice his goal

Chitradurga district court judge S B Vastradmath has done his bit to ensure that the public reposes its faith in the judiciary by delivery of quick judgments. Recently, he was in new for sentencing a man who killed his wife to life imprisonment within 13 days of the crime. He pronounced another judgment within 11 days of the crime. In September, the judge delivered 153 judgments in 22 days without taking a day's leave. He has broken his own record of achieving 70 points in a single calender month, which was earlier set by him during his tenure as the Civil Judge (Jr division) at Molakalmuru. In the system to evaluate judges, a point is awarded for each judgment where the maximum is 70 points irrespective of the number of cases. Vastramath says awarding death penalty to 3 men accused of rape and torture of a woman in Kolar was his most memorable judgment.

Anita R:Lighting up cells

Inmates of Dharwad Central Jail have smiles on their faces now -- thanks to Jail Superintendent Anita R.Reason: She ensures that they, especially women, don't waste their time feeling guilty or unworthy. She has ensured that the inmates exhibit their talent and also earn some money when confined within the four walls of the jail. Each month, Anita comes up with unique programmes. From making diyas to undertaking a beautician's course to knitting winter wear, her ideas keep the inmates occupied. Men are sent to work in fields and run a vegetable shop within the Dharwad jail premises. They are taught baking too. Anita's measures have yielded results, with many inmates confessing that they have shown behavioural changes. Anita has more things planned for the inmates in 2019.

Ayub Ahmed: Dignified farewell mission

Meet Ayub Ahmed, who uses his own resources to shift unidentified and unclaimed bodies, and performs their last rites. This 38-year-old Mysuru resident has been carrying out this job for the past two decades. As soon as members of the public, hospitals or even the police inform him about unclaimed bodies, Ahmed reaches the spot in his old Ambassador car and takes the body. He works as a loader at the Mandi Mohalla Market in Mysuru. Though Ahmed has not kept an official count of the bodies that he has buried or cremated so far, Ahmed puts the figure at about 10,000. Ahmed posts photos of the bodies on his Facebook page in the hope of reaching out to the kin of the deceased. In absence of claims, he gets the paperwork done, after which he takes the unclaimed bodies to the graveyard and performs the last rites as per their religion.

Krishna Byregowda:Crusade against plastic

At a time when plastic water bottles were the norm in government offices, Rural Development Minister Krishna Byregowda decided to do away with them at his offices and meetings. He replaced the plastic bottles with glass tumblers and reusable water bottles. Byregowda even carries a personal water bottle to the Assembly and Council to avoid using plastic or paper cups. Each person who visits the minister's office is served water in a glass tumbler, unlike the popular practice in most government offices where water is given in plastic or paper cups. Such was the impact of his approach to the matter that the CM asked officials to refrain from distributing water in plastic bottles at all government events.

Randeep D: Official in public demand

That good work seldom goes unnoticed was proved in the case of IAS officer Randeep D, who was brought back as the Additional Commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) owing to public pressure after being shunted from the position. Randeep was transferred by an order signed by Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy as the Commissioner of Social Welfare Department. However, he had earned the confidence of waste management activists for his attempts to reform the ill-managed system in the city. Randeep was credited with setting up the Solid Waste Management control room, bringing proposals of GPS tracking of auto-tippers and compactors, and updating the microplan. Activists pointed out his role in implementation of standard operating with regarding BBMP's Animal Husbandry Department. This led citizens to launch an online campaign to demand his reinstatement. After the campaign got the support of about 1,000 people, Kumaraswamy had to take a relook at his decision.

Kempaiah: BEO answers the call

An inspiring act by the Block Education Officer of Bangarpet Taluk went a long way to show how personal involvement can improve the learning ambience for children. Kempaiah shocked the school administration authorities, as well as teachers and students during a visit to a Kannada Higher Primary School in the district -- he cleaned a blocked toilet. Kempaiah had decided to visit the school to see the conditions for himself after he received several complaints from parents about the unhygienic conditions in the classrooms and toilet. While checking the toilets, when he saw it blocked, he got to his knees and started cleaning it with a brush. He had expressed to TNIE that it was unfortunate that the teachers and anganwadi workers had not kept the school clean. The girls in the school were forced to walk to their homes in the village for toilet breaks during class hours.

Inscription Stones of Bangalore: Documenting city's history

A civic activism project, ""Inscription Stones of Bangalore"" aims at creating awareness about and protecting ancient stone inscriptions (shila shaasanas) found in the Bengaluru region. The group has discovered several new inscription stones and restored the neglected ones by relocating them to a respectful place. They have educated citizens through postcards, public talks, school visits, poster presentations and other group- funding initiatives. With the help of latest technology, they have created 3D models of critically-endangered stone inscriptions. This project follows in the footsteps of B L Rice, who between 1894 and 1905, documented the stones in his 12-volume book, Epigraphia Carnatica. The project also acts as a platform for interested Bengaluru residents to work towards conservation of these ancient stones, which speak a lot about the Garden City's rich cultural past."

In 1885, at the first session of the Indian National Congress, Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee, an eminent lawyer, was chosen as its president.

In the party's 133-year history, Bonnerjee, a nationalist and advocate of the Swadeshi movement, remains one of the youngest presidents of the Congress.

On his 173th birth anniversary, ThePrint takes a look at the life of one of the pioneers in modern Indian politics.

Bonnerjee was born on 29 December 1844, in the Kidderpore area of Calcutta (now Kolkata) into a family of two successive generations of lawyers.

He attended the Oriental Seminary and Hindu School in Calcutta. However, before he could write his class 10 exams, his father got him articled to a local attorney, W.P. Downing, in 1861. And thus began his journey as a lawyer.

A year later, he started working as a clerk at the office of lawyer W.F. Gillanders. Bonnerjee learnt the art of writing deeds and pleadings here.

In 1864, Bonnerjee moved to London after he won the R.J. Jijibhai scholarship for his education. During his time in London, he studied under two prominent lawyers, T.H. Dart and Edward Fry. He also took part in establishing the London Indian Society in one of his earlier political efforts.

Three years later, Bonnerjee was invited to the Calcutta Bar. On his return in 1868, he started practising at the Calcutta High Court and fought his first case from his father's firm. With support from Sir Charles Paul, Barrister-at-Law of the Calcutta High Court and J.P. Kennedy, Bonnerjee established himself in the high court.

The turning point in Bonnerjee's career came in 1883, when he defended politician Surendranath Banerjea in a contempt of court case in the Calcutta High Court.

He was appointed a fellow of Calcutta University and became president of its Law faculty in 1886. He also represented the Calcutta University in the Bengal Legislative Council in 1894 and 1895.

Bonnerjee was the first Indian appointed as a Standing Counsel, and not just once but thrice -- 1882, 1884, 1886.

In 1901, he retired from the Calcutta bar.

Bonnerjee presided over the first session of the Indian National Congress in 1885 -- the biggest highlight of his career. He was 41 at the time of his unanimous election as the president of the party in the Bombay session.

He again presided over the Allahabad session of INC in 1892.

As part of his work for the Congress, Bonnerjee proposed the formation of standing committees of the party in every province for better coordination in work. He also proposed limiting party activities to just politics, and not indulging in social reforms.

Bonnerjee also strongly condemned the British Salt Tax, saying it was an unjust tax on ""almost the chief necessity of life"" in a poverty-stricken land.

Like other nationalists of the time, he favoured industrialisation of the country and advocated the Swadeshi movement.

In 1902, Bonnerjee moved back to London with his wife Hemangini Motilal and three children.

In London, due to his strong affinity towards his birthplace, Bonnerjee named his Croydon residence after Kidderpore.

On 21 July 1906, Bonnerjee died of prolonged sickness at the age of 62."

When he finally reached Dharamshala, the residence of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, on January 5, 2000, ""His Holiness received me with his great love and affection. My joy knew no bounds,"" he recounts in a personal blog.

Though many in the Indian government suspected him of being a Chinese plant, he was granted temporary shelter at Gyuto Monastery in the suburbs of Dharamshala. His predecessor, the 16th Karmapa had set up his exile seat in Rumtek in Sikkim, one of the richest monasteries outside Tibet. But a court case by another claimant to the title has barred both from visiting Rumtek.

Now, after more than a year abroad, mostly in the US for medical treatment, the Lama, now 33, claims that the Indian government is blocking his return. ""Let's be clear. The government of India does not recognise Ugyen Trinley Dorje as the 17th Karmapa Lama. There are other contenders,"" said a senior source, privy to the government's position on the issue. ""He came to India on his own volition, and has been living in India as a Tibetan refugee, as have some 140,000 or more such refugees who have come since 1959 including his holiness the Dalai Lama.""

According to the source, ""We are aware he has secured a foreign passport from the Commonwealth of Dominica, a tiny Caribbean island not to be confused with the Dominican Republic. He did not share this information with the Government of India. We have conveyed to him repeatedly that we are prepared to give him a visa on his Dominica passport, but while claiming that we are denying him a visa, he has not approached any of our missions abroad for one.

There are specific motivations by certain quarters to put a certain spin on this. He is free to come to India, but he must formally apply for a visa first.""Author and columnist Claude Arpi, who has written several books on Tibet, said, ""It is not healthy for secular state to enter into the issue of reincarnation. Also, Ugyen appears to have been poorly advised.""

Who's the Karmapa?

Ugyen Trinley Dorje, who escaped from Tibet to India in early 2000, is recognised by both the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama as the 17th Karmapa Lama, or the head of the Karma Kagyu school. He is also the head of the extremely influential and wealthy Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim In 1998, Thinley Thaye Dorje also staked claim to the title, and filed a case in the SC seeking a bar on Ugyen's claim to Rumtek. That case is still pending. While both claimants are barred from visiting Rumtek, Ugyen was given the Identity Certificate (IC) issued to mostly to Tibetans in India, which allows him to travel abroad"

(HT File)

With some school headmasters (HMs) dragging their feet over paying penalties for allegedly inflating attendance of students, the Bihar government has finally decided to recover fines by deducting the amount from their salary.

The HMs allegedly spiked attendance of students to claim more funds under the mid-day meal(MDM) programme.

Though the government received reports of irregularities long ago and imposed financial penalty on HMs, the fines could not be fully recovered. Many of the HMs moved court for relief citing their unwanted involvement in non-academic work, while others were just indifferent.

The government has ordered the recovery of a Rs8.68-crore penalty from HMs. Of which, Rs 4.21-crore (48%) has been recovered. More than 1,000 HMs have allegedly fudged the data since 2013, when the idea of penalty was first mooted by the state education department.

RK Mahajan, principal secretary of the department of education, recently directed all district programme officers (DPOs) to deduct the penalty amount from headmasters' salary in five instalments over as many months.

""The DPOs must ensure a monthly deduction from all those who have not deposited the penalty amount within a month of the receipt of the letter, except those who have got stay from the court,"" stated a letter by Mahajan.

""During inspections, the attendance of that particular day in the school and the average of the previous week is matched. If the deviation is within 10%, there is no issue. However, if the deviation is above 10%, a penalty equivalent to the amount given in the last three months is imposed on the headmaster,"" said Vinod Kumar Singh, director of the mid-day meal programme, .

Another official said that in several cases, the accused HMs with the help of their association approached the Patna high court or the Lokayukta, claiming that they were overburdened with non-academic work like management of MDM. The court has also asked the government to find an alternative to free teachers from MDM responsibilities.

Though the Bihar government tried to hand over MDM to NGOs or self-help groups (SHGs) and also ran pilot projects, a viable alternative has not been found because of the scale of the programme. In Bihar, despite a drop in enrolment numbers, 1.20 crore students from Class 1 to Class 8 are estimated to avail MDM daily.

In a Niti Ayog meeting a few months ago, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar advocated the direct benefit transfer for the centre's flagship MDM programme to plug leakages. ""Cooking in schools has a direct bearing on education. Instead of centres of learning, schools are viewed as centres of food. Poor quality and unhygienic conditions often lead to unpleasant incidents,"" he had said.

However, to achieve this, the Centre would have to change the policy at the national level, which seems unlikely. Bihar, on its part, has been seriously mulling the option of handing over MDM to women SHGs, which are 8 lakh in the state, the highest in the country. A pilot project has been launched in one block each of Jehanabad and Muzaffarpur to assess the feasibility."

Period.","http://outlookindia.com/",FALSE,"Besides the lasting damage it causes to clusters of created memory that move and endure in society's neural pathways, fake news can at times become a collective Freudian slip -- an introduced error in the news cycle can reveal something society has actually tried to hide all along. One such instance broke into view, with some attendant verbal violence, during the recent Sabarimala temple entry flare-up. What has always been invisibilised, suppressed in visual form, came out in words. A local TV channel flashed the news that a young woman activist planned to desecrate Ayyappa's shrine by smuggling in a sanitary pad soaked in menstrual blood in her pilgrim's holy kit. The premise was extended when, based on this newsflash, textile minister Smriti Irani said ""one would not take a sanitary pad soiled in blood to a friend's place"". There you had it: two things were revealed at once. One, it put its finger on the nub of the male fear at Sabarimala. But more than that, this spoke the unspeakable. This was the exact thing that had all along made us resort to a whole bag of censoring ruses­ -- to evade, elide, skirt around. Be it in the blue ink metaphor of sanitary pad ads or the uncountable euphemisms used to refer to womens' monthly cycle of bleeding in all of world's languages. Now, 'sanitary pad soaked in blood' became a national meme. These were mere words, but they carried an unmistakable graphic quotient -- meant to repulse, almost weaponising the blood-soaked pad, an everyday object of women. The activist was imagined as planning an attack into an exclusionary sacred space, smuggling a pad like a gun or a grenade.

Is just the mention of that visual so explosive for the public space? Recent fantasies, or rather anxieties, around the idea of the 'feminazi'­ -- casual, misplaced epi­thet -- may have something to do with it in this case. Imagine, then, an activist-trooper armed with a bloody pad, ready to breach fortress Sabarimala! For, the celibate male deity had by then been granted a citadel wall of 'non-menstruating humans'.

Blood Prints

Even outside of that festival of anxieties, the landscape over the past couple of years has been marked by a series of visual detonations. Each one confronted, in its own way, the unconscious codes that govern what is kosher and acceptable when it comes to menstruation, that universal, biological, 'living' topic that remains taboo in various spaces, in equally varied ways. In each case, repression begat a defiant mini-INS­urrection. The urge to break the suppressed sil­ence visually always existed, of course, as with Judy Chicago's 1971 art work 'Red Flag' (see It's Bloody Art, Isn't It!), but with the coming of the digital age, new spaces have opened up, well beyond the art world. This is especially so in India's context. You can see the dots link up in our overlapping maps of multiple realities: Instagram, Facebook, India's streets and universities, the PM's postbox, and as far afield as New York's subways.

The first noticeable 'detonation' came rather innocuously, in March 2015, with an Instagram upload by Indian-origin Canadian poet Rupi Kaur. A click from her photo-series titled Period, which depicted stains of menstrual blood -- on a woman's clothes and on her bedsheet -- was taken down twice by Instagram because it supposedly violated its community standards, which generally pertain to nudity, gore and violence -- that's when people realised the menstruation taboo even existed on that visual platform for Generation Z. The inevitable happened: the silencing itself made a loud sound. After critical headlines, Instagram restored the image, with an apology to Kaur. The image has since gone viral, spilling to Ted talks, magazines and blogs, becoming a constant internet footnote on the subject.

Rupa Ganguly in Rituparno Ghosh's Antarmahal (2005)

Part of a college project, Kaur's photo-series had meant to resist the visual taboo. But all she was exp­ecting was the usual backlash from trolls. But the episode actually reaffirmed the value of the image, for her as for everyone else. Instagram, a platform that is said to induce 'pressurisingly pretty' pictures, itself had to rectify its initial discomfort with the topic.

Back home, in 2016, the spiralling debate around that viral Rupi Kaur post was to emb­olden another online end­eavour. ""I now felt social media was a good medium to make an impactful statement,"" says Nikita Azad. Thus began her #HappyToBleed campaign on Facebook -- irked by some atrocious comments by a Travancore Devaswom Board official about the des­irability of a machine that could scan women for 'purity', i.e. to see if they were menstruating or not. Nikita invited women to post pictures holding sanitary pads with rebellious messages against the taboo. Hundreds of women joined the campaign; virality was again at hand. Azad, then a student at Punjabi University, Patiala, eventually became one of the petitioners in the case in the Supreme Court.

Since all debates are nat­ional debates these days, the Sabarimala issue, spilling past the local, has exh­umed many anxieties around menstruation at a time when the space for discussions, of all political colours, is opening up. Interestingly, it has been an enabler of sorts, prompting people to visibilise menstruation in their own way.

Padmini Ray Murray's game Darshan Diversion

Padmini Ray Murray rem­embered the temple board official's comments during a game jam in 2016, an annual event where she and her team had to make a video game, the theme being 'ritual'. Thus came about Darshan Diversion, a game where women try to climb up floors to reach the temple top, the passage blocked by priests ready to send them back if they are menstruating, indicated by a blinking red light. ""This could be fun, I thought,"" says Ray Murray, who also teaches at the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology, Bangalore. The game wasn't meant to be very public -- you can't buy it online. But it was showcased this October in the Bangalore edition of We The Women, a show created by journalist Barkha Dutt. Dutt tweeted about it, bringing it out in troll territory. ""I also started getting trolled on Twitter after that,"" says Ray Murray. The game had to be pulled out of the Mumbai edition of We The Women in November as things got volatile, both on Twitter and at Sabarimala.

But November saw the battle joined on anot­her front. Standing in front of a red stage in Ernakulam, a few hundred people gave the cry Arppo Arthavam! (Malayalam for 'Hurray Menstruation!') The protest visuals included a wing-shaped flag made of sanitary pads. ""The visuals were important, since the experience is always been kept in the dark,"" says Malayalam writer C.S. Chandrika. Arppo also bec­ame a hashtag under which women were invited to share their stories about the stigma. In response, and complementing the celebratory aspect of the protest, young artists like Shehi Shafi drew the artwork this issue is using on the cover.

From the #HappyToBleed campaign

Away from the confrontations, we all have been witness to the visuality of menstruation evolving at its own pace, mindful of the reigning, and changing, not­ions of acceptability. ""The idea introduces itself very casually in the household space,"" says filmmaker-­writer Paromita Vohra about sanitary pad ads on TV. ""They help prompt a discussion without really putting anyone in a spot. In this sense, it's interesting how the blue liquid on TV actually un-taboos menstruation."" Vohra thinks the coded, allusive visuality of these ads makes the idea more accessible to people by keeping things within the comfort zone.

The Sabarimala issue exhumed anxieties around menstruation. It has been an enabler, prompting people to visibilise the issue.

The themes are broadening too, after almost two decades of the post-liberalisation ads: Whisper's 2014 'Touch the Pickle' campaign, for inst­ance, addresses a common menstruation myth. Then you have something like Padman, the Akshay Kumar starrer inspired by the innovation of Arunachalam Murugananthan. That also brought discussions to the most unusual of places -- such as reality TV, during the film promos.

""There are also spaces like Menstrupedia, which further relax things,"" says Vohra, of a website that seeks to spread awareness and break taboos around the subject with videos, posters and, recently, a comic book. ""We are trying to change the narrative by portraying periods in a positive light,"" says Aditi Gupta, Menstrupedia's founder. ""Since our visuals are positive, we don't shy away from showing blood either,"" she adds.

So, spaces for discussion are opening up in non-confrontational ways too. But stigma has a way of cornering your everydayness, alm­ost demanding and in turn generating a mass of critical response: Kaur's post was a regular one until Instagram made it the issue; Ray Murray's game was a fun, critical take in internal gaming circles that got pulled into the Twitter troll vortex and the often-outrageous comments around Sabarimala prompted protests like #Happytobleed and #arppoarthavam.

""Women will make art out of the materiality of their lives,"" says Vohra. She ref­ers to the 'pads against sexism' protest in Jamia Milia Islamia in March 2015, where students wrote anti-­sexist comments on sanitary pads and stuck them around the campus. ""As you get into spaces where you can be more vocal, your level of engagement bec­omes more detailed,"" adds Vohra.

Visuals also set precedents. When the government imposed a luxury tax on sanitary napkins in their initial GST policy, university students wrote messages on pads and mailed them to the PM and the FM. That was about economic policy interfering in everyday reality. The next one that tries to suppress this evolving narrative will eng­ender another form of visible resistance. Watch out for these spaces, and junk the squirmy taboo pickle."

The four-day festival sees the worship of a ­yoni-like stone that represents 'Mother Shakti', known popularly in this form as the 'menstruating goddess'. And yet, when Mumbai-based artist Aniket Mitra shared his artwork on social media depicting a sanitary napkin with a red, bleeding lotus on it, surrounded by a chalchitra -- an artistic rendition that traditionally backgrounds Durga in certain representations -- he was abused and threatened, and the piece was taken down.

It seems that our patience and tolerance for menstruation is selective and temperamental. Despite the growing dialogue on the topic, in many sections of ­society talking about periods still makes people turn a shade of red that could very well match Mitra's bleeding red lotus. In India especially, there's been an overpowering silence around this natural female process, cloaked in shame and a lack of awareness. On the other hand, like Mitra, a ­growing number of artists and activists across the country are turning to various forms of artistic ­expression to create discourse on the normalisation of menstruation.

It's not surprising that people have turned to art -- when words and debates turn into screaming matches of who can be the loudest, art serves as a powerful tool to make people introspect, spark conversations and broaden mindsets on stigmatised subjects. With a growing ars­enal of mediums like painting, zines, installations, photography and digital art, more and more people have found solace for their frustration as well as power in this form to create an impact. 20-year-old Priyanka Paul is no stranger to using her art­istic talents to fight the good fight. Paul, better known by her digital moniker 'Artwhoring', doesn't shy away from using her platform to call out society on its misgivings and regressive beliefs, be it in the space of race, caste, gender, sexuality or, in this case, menstruation.

From a menstruation zine to a satirical horror-thriller film poster titled The Bleeding, Paul doesn't hold back when it comes to calling out the hypo­crisy of Indian society and the media for their perpetuation of the stigma. One particular photograph is a top shot of a stark white toilet splattered with blue ink. ""Dear Pad Ads, I'll bleed like you want me to. In blue,"" she writes about the image on her Instagram page, alluding to the blue and green liquids that depict menstrual blood in adv­ert­isements and campaigns.

Graphic designer Bansri Thakkar too addresses the role of the media in her zine Silence of the Cramp, breaking up her project to address three important aspects when it comes to the dismantling of the menstrual taboo -- taught silence, hiding, media and silence. A graduate of the Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Thakkar elucidates on the subject in each section of her project through stories, anecdotes and experiences of people of all ages and genders.

Menstrual blood has become a ­pigment in the palettes of many global artists, ­including ­Jaipur-based Lyla FreeChild.

Both Paul and Thakkar have contributed to the work done by social enterprise Boondh. Thakkar was a part of 'The Crimson Wave', a first-of-its-kind travelling art exhibition showcasing works in various mediums that address menstruation, and some even done with menstrual blood. Menstrual blood has become a pigment in many global artists and activists' palettes, including Carina Úbeda Chacana, Zoe James and Lani Beloso. Be it as a way to protest, normalise menstruation, or shock people into dialogue, Menstrala, a term coined by artist Vanessa Tiegs to be the title of her own series of works, is slowly growing into a movement of its own.

In India, it is perhaps only Jaipur-based artist Lyla FreeChild who has used menstrual blood in her paintings. It started in 2014 when she made the switch to using menstrual cups and continued to work with Boondh, creating a larger cup-shaped art installation out of menstrual cups at Prayag, the first 'Grand Digital India Mela' that was hosted in New Delhi. She also fashioned them into earrings for herself, using her work to draw attention to the increasing amount of waste that disposable ­sanitary products create, and the impact this has on the ecosystem.

Equated with other 'waste and discarded materials' of the human body, the use of menstrual blood in art throws people off but for many women, it's about breaking the stigma and connecting with their own bodies. In a country where young girls drop out of school when they start menstruating, shopkeepers wrap up sanitary pads in brown paper bags faster than you can pull out the money to pay for it, and where the majority of the female population doesn't have access to low-cost sanitary napkins, falling prey to deadly diseases and infection -- what role does such artwork play? These artists are among a growing number who aren't in it just for the shaming of people with preconceived notions about menstruation. More than mere lip service, they are working ­towards normalisation, and calling for others to own up and work towards the same.

However, it's debatable whether the blood and sweat of artists putting hours into creating 'menstruation art', and then days trying to ensure its survival in the real world, is creating effective, practical impact. Are we just progressive people discussing progress with our progressive friends?

On the one hand, there are still 'well-to-do and educated' households where a girl's menstruation is hushed up and myths of touching pickles and impurity survive. Sexist jokes about PMS and hormonal women make up a chunk of many comedy routines and conversations amongst the country's youth. But at the same time, we've witnessed some une­xpected and hard-earned victories, from growing online conversations and awareness initiatives to on-the-ground achievements like the removal of GST on sanitary products. The Supreme Court's rejection of the restrictions on menstruating women entering Sabari­mala temple in Kerala came as a breath of fresh air for a country that seems to be moving backwards in many ways.

Maybe change is happening at its own pace, but it is when the work of artists, activists and org­anisations seep through the intersections of society that we will truly break the stigma.

Taking to Twitter, the women and child development minister said she had reached out to Reshma Azeez's and requested details of the case.

""My ministry @MinistryWCD has taken up case of #TripleTalaq on absolute priority. The first instance post the passing of the bill, criminalising the act of instant divorce in the Muslim community will be dealt with and we shall ensure that justice is done,"" she said.

Reshma had married Javeed Khan, a surgeon by profession, in 2003, and trouble started within six months. In the initial days of the marriage, the couple lived in UK and then moved to the US. Last month, Khan brought Reshma back to Bengaluru. He later returned to the US, taking all her documents along.

""He started abusing me emotionally and kept insulting me,"" Reshma said in a police complaint. She also alleged that Khan never asked for a legal divorce, but had been asking her to leave.

Khan had allegedly told her that he wanted to resolve the issues between them after speaking with the families. The couple have two children aged 13 and 10.

""Once we reached, he left with his family, while I was stranded at the airport. He had taken away my passport, academic certificates and other identity cards. On December 4, a day after I filed the police complaint, he sent me talaq on WhatsApp,"" Azeez told News18. She hasn't been able to contact him since.

The message from Javeed, which was also sent to their family group reads, ""TALAQ I am sending this message in my full sense and I am not under any influence of anger or intoxication. ALLAH as my witness. I, Dr. JAVEED KHAN (dob 01/19/1976), son of late Taj Ahmed pronounce TALAQ (Divorce) to RESHMA AZEEZ (dob 12/06/1978), daughter of Mr. Azeezuddin, according to ISLAMIC LAW OF SHARIAH, Meher has been completely fulfilled [sic]"".

The children continue to live with Khan in Illinois, while he has allegedly cut off all communication with his wife. ""I speak to my children through their school staff now,"" Reshma said.

Reshma had has alleged that her email accounts and bank cards have also been blocked. A senior police officer said Khan was out of the country by the time the complaint was lodged. The airport authorities would inform them once he returns. The officer also said that the police are not aware of the WhatsApp talaq as it may have been given after the complaint was filed.

In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court had struck down the validity of instant triple talaq among Muslims, following which the government had brought in an ordinance to criminalise the offence. A bill to replace that ordinance was passed by the Lok Sabha on Thursday amid a walkout by opposition. It now awaits the Rajya Sabha test."
"133","1028739977","2018-12-29","https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/aByTuTxrmGIKUIcdnmk9LO/The-year-of-collective-action.html","The year of collective action","http://www.livemint.com/",FALSE,"A sea of women is gathered in protest, wielding placards, banners and babies. The toddlers have been given placards too, as many as their fingers can hold. There is a cascading effect to the demonstration, almost as if the multitude threatens to spill out of the frame.

The energy in the photograph is palpable, possibly fuelled by anger and hope. It's from 1981 -- a protest against the rape and murder of two school-going girls, sisters Namita and Sunita Bhandari. In the kingdom of Nepal, these women's marches had deep political ramifications as the murder suspects were members of the royal family, and investigations were headed nowhere. An echo from this was felt this year, when mass demonstrations and candle marches took over Nepal to demand justice for the rape and murder of 13-year-old Nirmala Panta in July. On Twitter, under the hashtag #JusticeForNirmala, people across Nepal started pressurizing the government to pin down the suspect.

Photographs from the 1981 women's demonstration were part of a travelling exhibition this year, called The Public Life Of Women: A Feminist Memory Project, shown in Patan, Nepal, and Delhi. One of the curators, NayanTara Gurung Kakshapati says the exhibition had been in the works for a while, but gained strength from the #MeToo movement. The conversations on sexual harassment and gender-based violence definitely had something to do with the urgency of this exhibition, she says.

This is what the social media-driven #MeToo movement in India this year must have looked like on ground. Screenshots and social media posts became protest banners. Whether the women chose to reveal their identities or stay anonymous, their posts became formidable documents and evidence that forced men accused of sexual harassment, many of them in influential positions, to step down.

Like #MeToo, significant mass movements unfolded in India all through the year, evolving as part of a continuum. From the farmers' marches to Delhi and Mumbai to those organizing relief for Kerala floods victims; from the Supreme Court verdict scrapping Section 377 to its verdict that upturned prohibitive gender traditions at Sabarimala -- this was the year when people banded together to sound a clarion call for the rights of the individual.

But, protest rallies, hashtag movements and vigils are not new. What made 2018 different?

The year of the collective rests on a paradox, almost along the lines of Newton's third law. Globally, we have been seeing the effects of divisive politics. Take Trump's support for increased border wall funding and family separation policy, for instance. As if in response to his anti-migrant policy, a slow-moving caravan of 3,000 refugees is headed for the US, and is finding strength in numbers, much like a shoal of fish. The caravan originated in Honduras, fleeing extreme street violence and drug cartels. Time reported, ""...the migrant caravan shouted to their companions squatting on the international bridge. 'Venganse,' they chanted, come on over.""

In India, caravans that emulate this spirit have emerged. This August marked the first anniversary of Karwan-e-Mohabbat, human rights' activist Harsh Mander's response of solidarity against hate politics and communalism. New ones that are slowly burrowing through deep patriarchal structures have been initiated too. Instagram account Scene and Herd posts on sexual harassment and abuse in the Indian art world. Leading contemporary artist Subodh Gupta was outed on one of the recent anonymous posts on the account, which currently has a following of 4,100. Gupta later denied the allegations.

In Kerala, new groups are addressing the Sabarimala row, allegations of rape against priests of the Catholic and orthodox churches, and sexism in the film industry. Save our Sisters (SOS) Action Council was formed in September, three months after a Catholic nun alleged that she was raped multiple times by Bishop Franco Mulakkal of the Jalandhar diocese from 2014-16. Despite the initial silence of the Catholic Church, the nun found that many were ready to lend a voice to her cause, right from sending a letter to the Vatican to filing a petition in the Kerala High Court. Among those who saw that the nun's immediate concerns were symptomatic of a larger issue, was the Kerala Catholic Reformation Movement. The group championed her cause through hunger strikes and appeals, and went on to form SOS Action Council in order to make a lasting change in the Church. SOS has about 30 representatives from across Kerala, formed specifically to raise awareness about violence against women in the Catholic Church. Since its formation, SOS has been instrumental in getting Mulakkal arrested (he was later let out on bail).

Sandhya Raju, a Kochi-based lawyer volunteering with SOS Action Council, says the group's members are not limited to human rights activists. There are environmentalists, trade unionists and feminist thinkers, too. ""It was the first time that the nuns had come out to publicly protest the rape, and they had people supporting them. The whole world was looking at these protests,"" she adds.

SOS knows that these allegations are not isolated incidents -- these are structural, running deep and gaining legitimacy through patriarchal practices. In the case of the Sabarimala row, where devotees protested the Supreme Court's verdict in October to allow the entry of women of all ages into Kerala's most famous pilgrimage centre, SOS exists in its parallel avatar -- a collective called Arpo Arthavam (""glorifying the period"" in Malayalam). The collective has been following the case of activist Rehana Fathima, who had attempted to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the Sabarimala temple in October, and was arrested through the intervention of the Kerala government after temple authorities complained.

The agrarian crisis has also led to new collectives, such as the online campaign Dillichalo.in, formed in November. The website was launched as a response to the farmers' march to Delhi in November, in which they demanded that the centre address key issues such as credit crisis, farmer suicides, and rights of landless labourers.

Farmer movements in the country have been on the rise since the late 1970s . They have been spurred on by the increasing stakes against the rural sector as well as the need for agrarian mobilization by political parties. But the movement had largely been viewed as an event happening on the sidelines of the country, and mainly as an exercise by the Left. The divide between the urban elite and the rural and Adivasi famers was always there, but 2018 blurred the boundaries. Over the year, three farmers' marches made national headlines -- the Kisan Long March from Nashik to Mumbai in March, the Bhartiya Kisan Union in October, and the All India Kisan Sabha in November.

P. Sainath, award-winning journalist and founder of the People's Rural Archive of India stated in an interview to a magazine that the Nashik-Mumbai march was inspiring because it was the first time in the last 36 years in Mumbai that he saw the middle classes show up in large numbers to support the farmers.

There were theatre actors and musicians who walked with the farmers as they entered the city; residents from a Mumbai suburb who showered them with flowers; lawyers who offered to file PILs on their behalf. Dillichalo offered a direct line of support to the November march, and, in the website's own words, it is ""not the culmination but the beginning"" and ""a response to the need for new radical forms of urban and rural solidarity"".

The social network

The agrarian crisis rippled into our living rooms, right from the moment a video of the farmers holding red flags and streaming down Kasara Ghat en route to Mumbai was circulated on social media. That video, shot by Dr Ajit Navale, secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha, was the turning point; it laid bare a collective stride for a common cause.

The impact of social media was also seen in the environmental disaster that was the Kerala floods. Relief and rescue efforts poured into the state, largely because social media made viewers feel that something had gone horribly wrong right in our neighbourhood rather than in one of India's faraway, southern states.

A networking app called QKopy, for instance, helped host the Kozhikode traffic police on its platform, so that users could get accurate information and curb the spread of fake news during the floods. The app was originally launched in May to achieve a similar end during the Nipah virus outbreak. Rajiv Surendran, one of the co-founders of QKopy, says that it's important that tech start-ups help build a responsible social culture. It's a warning against social media frenzy, such as the nation-wide lynching trend this year that got fanned by WhatsApp rumours.

While #MeToo raised concerns about how its second wave wasn't inclusive enough or intersectional enough, social media continued to play a pivotal role. The movement picked up pace in its second wave this year, after the hashtag was first used in 2017 by the bahujan law student Raya Sarkar who kick-started the Indian arm by publishing a list of alleged sexual predators in academia (Sarkar later deleted the list). But, it was this year that many realized the movement needed more than firsthand accounts. They needed a support system as well. Professionals came forward to offer their services, for free, to survivors who sought legal help or trauma counselling.

Scherezade Sanchita Siobhan, a Mumbai-based clinical psychotherapist and practising psychologist was among those who volunteered. Her number was added to a crowdsourced list of free services available to survivors. Siobhan says she was already aware of some of the stories before they were posted on social media. ""What made me want to jump in was that I had clients who had the courage to go public with their stories. That was the tipping point -- that they would speak about it publicly. This was bound to occur, for the simple reason that with social media people had access to a non-hierarchical way of expression,"" she adds.

Siobhan also observes that as a woman, you are expected to be binary -- you either agree or you don't, and if it's the latter, then you are labelled an anti-feminist. ""There were many who didn't pick a side, especially older women. #MeToo should continue being democratic, without centres of power, but there must be on-ground work, too,"" she says.

Whether it was #MeToo or the Kerala floods, this was the year we saw the power of the collective play out in full public view and in real time.

In Nepal, women activists held a peaceful semi-nude anti-rape demonstration in August. They gathered at Maitighar Mandala in Kathmandu, one of the several public grounds where the Nepalese government had banned protests. All the women were arrested. In light of this, Gurung Kakshapati points out that in the last century, not all women's movements were ""successes"". ""But, that's not the point,"" says Gurung Kakshapati. The point, as she phrases it, is to remember them, and to celebrate them"

In the infamous Unnao rape case that involves Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, based on orders of the court, an FIR has been registered against the victim, her mother and her uncle for producing a forged age certificate to prove she was a minor.

The court ordered registration of a case against the three on a complaint by the father of another rape accused Shubham, who is in jail, said SP Harish Kumar Thursday.

He said complainant Harpal Singh had alleged that the victim, her uncle and mother had procured a forged age certificate to implicate his son Shubham in the rape case, said Kumar.

The police said the case was registered at the Makhi police station on court's December 17 order against the family members for various alleged offences of cheating and forgery.

Complainant Singh had moved the court saying the school transfer certificate, purportedly made by Raebareli school and produced as the age certificate, was forged to frame his son, police said.

The victim's uncle is presently in jail in connection with another case.

Harpal Singh's wife Shashi and son Shubham are accused in the rape case and have been in jail since April along with the main accused, BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

Sengar, a four-time MLA, was charged by the CBI with raping the girl at his residence in Makhi village on June 4 last year.

The girl was again abducted and raped by a separate group of accused, allegedly including Harpal Singh's son Shubhan Singh, his driver Naresh Tiwari and one Brijesh Yadav between June 11 and June 20, 2017.

But in his complaint, Harpal Singh alleged that the victim had an affair with a man named Awadesh Tewari, with whom she had eloped in September 2017, only to return sometime later.

After her return, her family had begun persuading his son Shubham to marry her, alleged Harpal Singh in his complaint.

When Shubham refused to marry her, the family filed a case against him and his mother on charges of kidnapping as well as various offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, alleged Haripal Singh.

He also alleged that the victim's kin had forged her age certificate with a fake date of birth, purportedly issued from a school in Raebareli as proof.

The certificate purportedly had the signatures of the Basic Shiksha Adhikari of the district and the school principal.

Singh claimed both the education department official and the school principal have denied signing the certificate.

The victim had alleged that she was raped by BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar at his residence on June 4, 2017, when she had gone there to meet him along with Shashi Singh, Shubham's mother, to seek a job.

In February, the girl's family had moved the court for inclusion of the MLA's name in the case.

The state police registered a case on April 12, 2018, on the day of handing over the probe to the CBI.

Meanwhile, the victim's father was booked by the police under the Arms Act on April 3 and put in jail on April 5 where he died on April 9, 2018.

A video, purportedly showing the victim's father before his death accusing the MLA's brother of assaulting him had then gone viral.

Sengar's brother Atul Singh, was arrested along with four others, by the UP Crime Branch, for allegedly thrashing the victim's father.

Frustrated with the alleged police inaction and coercion from influential people, the minor victim had attempted self-immolation in front of Chief Minister yogi Adityanath's residence on April 8, 2018.

The Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government's ""inaction"" against the party MLA had drawn scathing criticism from the Allahabad High Court.

The state government had subsequently transferred the case to the CBI nearly 10 months after the commission of the alleged crime. Sengar was arrested by the CBI on April 13 and has been in judicial custody since then.

A second arrest in the case was made on April 14 when Shashi Singh, who had taken the victim to Sengar's house, was held."

On 28 December, Jantar Mantar in Delhi witnessed transgender activists from across the country observe a 'National Day of Rage.' Their demand being that this bill not be introduced in the Rajya Sabha and instead be referred to a Select Committee in the Upper House. Despite its name, the bill does not protect but actually violates the rights of the transgender community, they say.

According to the proposed law, transgender people would be 'inspected' to confirm that they are indeed transgender. It also makes gender affirmation surgery or sex reassignment surgery compulsory for those who identify as transgender. Begging would be criminalised although no reservations are provided in work and education for transgender people. Moreover, if transgender people are disowned by their families, they would be sent to rehab.

""We are here because of the recently passed (in Lok Sabha) Transgender Persons Bill, 2018, which is extremely bad. The government is trying to show that they are protecting us. But in the name of protection, they are trying to abolish us and again criminalise us. So, we will never let this become law. We know how to fight till the end.""Raina Roy, a transgender activist and one of founders of Amra Odbhuth, a queer cafe in Kolkata

Because it all comes back to everybody. All the rights violations, that we're seeing, are connected. That's an important thing to recognise.""Manav

""Basically, everyone is being denied the right to self-determination. It is not just about the transgender community. When the government decides who can speak as what and who will be counted not in their language as what they are, then it's a violation of all of us. This government has been doing that for various people. With the transgender community, they are basically saying that a group of experts, precisely the people who violate us in the most intimate ways - counselors, doctors, etc - will decide who is trans and who is not. It's a basic attack on democracy, fundamentally.""Vikramaditya, Independent researcher on gender and sexuality

""My personal experiences don't really count much because I am a very privileged person. I'm here because you enter a race and you're already told that you're going to come 'third' - transgender people are born and live their entire lives knowing that is their position in the course of things. That is why I think everyone is here, because my community is always 'third'.""Subham, Visual artist and graphic designer

""It's a very, very draconian bill that basically ignores all the suggestions and work done by the transgender community over the past three years on this bill. All of those suggestions were replaced by something the Lok Sabha came up with on its own and passed the bill in a very big hurry. And those provisions of the bill that are supposedly for the protection of transgender people's rights, actually violate a lot of our rights.""Rushaan Kumar, Assistant professor of Feminist and Gender Studies at Colorado College

""According to this bill, transgender people cannot identify themselves as transgender men or women. They must go to a doctor or psychiatrist who will remove their clothes completely and identify them as just transgender - not man or woman.

Let's please talk about inclusive politics of the nation which is what the Indian democracy stood for. Transgender people matter in society and our lives also matter so much. The bill must be deferred to the Select Committee, which should function in a democratic way. If not, I reject the bill.""Dr Akkai Padmashali, Founder, Ondede organisation.

""Even without the screening committee, already we have to take off our clothes when we go to see a doctor to take hormones. We ask our doctors the same question, why are you making me take off my clothes? Why should only our identity be tested? Cisgender people's identity should be too. After this bill, Modiji should also be checked to ensure if he is 'definitely a man' or 'definitely a woman'.""Christy Raj, Media Out

""It feels like this bill is being used to make up for Sec 377. On one hand, you have given us freedom. On the other hand, you are trapping us. So, you want to kill us before you leave. Even banning begging - whom will it affect? Demonetisation, GST - they are all affecting the working class. Will banning begging affect the upper classes?""Christy Raj

""We opposed the bill from the beginning and submitted suggestions and demands to the BJP government. We met Standing Committee MPs. Standing Committee also gave their recommendations. This government declined all recommendations. This shows that the BJP government constantly oppresses minority groups such as trans, Dalit, Adivasi, Muslim. Please then openly say you do not want us to live in this country. Announce us as refugees.""Grace Banu, Founder and Director, Trans Rights Now Collective and India's first transgender engineer

Akash, 16, from Sharada School, was playing with classmates at the time of the incident.

According to police, Akash, son of Ramesh and Shobha and a resident of Janatanagar, was running back after a ride and hit the wall that's less than 2ft from the kabaddi circuit. He suffered grievous injuries on the back of his head. School authorities led by headmistress Bharathi and other teachers rushed to the boy to a hospital where he was declared brought dead. The school management met the boy's parents and assured them Rs 3.5 lakh in compensation.

Police sources said the school had called in a physical education teacher from another school to conduct kabaddi games in a professional manner, but the teacher allegedly didn't provide enough space between the kabaddi court and the school building which has windows with iron mesh. The kabaddi court was marked with an iron pole well within the play area.

The bill passed in the Lok Sabha is clearly aimed at protecting the rights of married Muslim women who face the threat of illegal abandonment from their husbands. Imagine throwing a person out of the house just by pronouncing the word 'talaq', three times.

The process of divorce was so arbitrary that the Supreme Court had to strike it down, calling it unconstitutional. It had asked the Centre to come up with a law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims. The Opposition parties' argument that marriage is a contract between two adults comes a cropper due to the inherent gender bias in the concept of instant talaq where the right to divorce rests solely with the husband.

Forget a nuanced discussion and debate, the bill is being targeted by the political opposition for its alleged bias against the Muslim man. Section four of the Muslim Women (Protection on Rights on Marriage) Bill states that any Muslim husband who pronounces talaq referred to in section 3 upon his wife shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine. It is said that the BJP has deliberately criminalised the act in order to curry favours from Muslim women. And the BJP has projected the bill as a matter of 'Insaaniyat aur Insaaf'.

This sort of partisanship will only end up queering the pitch for the bill in the Rajya Sabha where political adversaries of the BJP will most likely stall the legislation's passage. This means that the fate of crores of Muslim women will become uncertain.

Moreover, since the bill also makes it mandatory for Muslim men to give financial assistance to their wives whom they had divorced through oral talaq, the opposition parties' stubbornness will directly impact poor women. Apart from being extremely discriminatory, triple talaq was a violation of human rights. It cannot remain cushioned by the fact that it is enshrined in the Hanafi Islamic school of law, which most Muslims in India follow.

If Muslim personal laws go against the rights of Muslim women in matters of divorce, marriage, and inheritance and thereby violate the principles of social and gender equality, they need to be suitably amended keeping in mind the zeitgeist.

The Muslim community is at the bottom of social and economic indicators and the women are the worst sufferers. Little wonder that an overwhelming majority of Muslim women who have come to know of the government's efforts to ban this form of talaq has expressed support. One of their main grouses was that none of the Quranic guidelines of discussion, arbitration, witnesses, specified time period or even a genuine attempt to resolve differences were being followed. They were not the only ones vulnerable because the kids suffered too since there was no option for child support. Given the helpless condition of so many Muslim women, the political opposition should behave responsibly."

The two were awarded rigorous imprisonment of 10 years and were slapped with fines of Rs 30,000 and Rs 12,000.

M Rajkumar, the former DMK legislator, and Jaishankar were charged with kidnapping, sexually assaulting and murdering the girl, aged 15, in 2012. She worked as a domestic help at Rajkumar's house. On Friday, special judge A Shanthi found Rajkumar guilty of conspiracy, rape and culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Although Jaishankar was not involved in sexual assault and death of the girl, the judge observed that he had an active role in the conspiracy.

CB-CID police registered the case and conducted investigation after it was transferred from the local police in Perambalur. They submitted a voluminous chargesheet including vital evidences and witness accounts against Rajkumar.

The judge acquitted other five suspects -- Mahendran, Anbarasu, Panneerselvam (now dead), Vijayakumar and Harikrishnan -- citing that the prosecution had failed to prove their involvement.

The girl, daughter of a labourer couple from Kerala, joined Rajkumar's household in June 2012 as a help. She was brought by agents who promised her parents that she would be sent to school. However, a few days after joining work, she called her parents and told them that she did not wish to continue. On June 29, 2012, her father was informed that his daughter was unwell and that she was admitted to a private hospital.

The girl's parents rushed to Perambalur and shifted her to another hospital. She was moved to the Government Medical College Hospital in Theni on July 4 where she died two days later.

After her parents took the body to Kerala, they found that she was sexually assaulted. They filed a complaint with the police in Kerala who initiated a second autopsy there and intimated their counterparts in Perambalur."

Trump's campaign to cripple Iran economically by imposing harsh economic sanctions and force either changes in Iran's regional policies or even better, regime change, have gotten off to a relatively slow start. With much of the international community pledging to salvage the 2015 international agreement that curbed Iran's nuclear program after Trump withdrew from the deal in May, the United States is discovering that enforcing the sanctions that aim to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero, cripple its shipping industry, and cut the Islamic republic out of the international financial system is easier said than done. While Iran will likely feel significant pain, Europe, China, and Russia have pledged to soften the blow to the degree possible by continuing to purchase Iranian oil, invest in the Islamic republic and create mechanisms to do business in currencies other than the US dollar.

The jury is out on whether that persuades Iran that the advantages of sticking to the nuclear agreement outweigh the disadvantages. That in turn could depend largely on Europe's ability to ensure that Iran is not excluded from the Brussels-based Society for the Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) international financial messaging system used by more than 10,000 banks worldwide for their more than 30 million transactions a day or is able to create one or more special purpose vehicles to which China, India, South Korea, Japan, and Turkey, who accounted for 70 percent of Iran's oil exports in 2017, would have access.

A Stuttering Start

President Trump's severe economic sanctions appeared to be manoeuvring an obstacle course even before they kicked in on November 5 despite US estimates that the measures had already led to a reduction of Iranian oil exports from 2.7 million to 1.6 million barrels a day. The impression that the sanctions were getting off to a modest start was reinforced by the fact that the United States gave eight countries, including the major importers of Iranian oil -- China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - 180-day waivers that, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, had already reduced their purchases from the Islamic republic. China, India, South Korea, Japan, and Turkey accounted for 70 percent of Iranian oil exports in 2017.(3) Earlier the US Treasury issued a license that allows an Iranian-backed gas field in the North Sea that accounts for three percent of Britain's gas supply to keep operating.(4)

Pompeo said the waivers were designed to ""ensure a well-supplied oil market."" He mentioned two of the eight countries had pledged to reduce their imports to zero within the six-month period of the waiver, while the other six had agreed to ""greatly reduced levels.""(5) Trump defended the waivers, saying he was going slow on the imposition of the sanctions to prevent shocks in the oil market and a spike in prices. ""I could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately, but it would cause a shock to the market. I don't want to lift oil prices,"" Trump told reporters.(6)

The United States has also trumpeted the fact that the sanctions sparked the collapse of the Iranian currency, the rial, wreaking havoc on the average Iranian. Unemployment is shooting up, especially among the country's youth, inflation is spiralling higher because of the cost of imported goods, and there have been water and power shortages due to a lack of infrastructure investment after years of on-again, off-again sanctions.(7) Raising fears that Iran would ration fuel and hike prices, the government in December reintroduced fuel cards to put a halt on smuggling of up to 40 million litres a day.(8) Smuggling of other subsidized goods such as pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs as well as non-subsidized items like textiles has reportedly increased sevenfold in recent months.(9)

The Trump administration hopes the sanctions will complicate the Iranian support for groups like Lebanon's Hezbollah Shiite militia and the Houthis in Yemen, as well as its military operations in Syria by forcing the Islamic republic to reduce military spending. It bases its hope on the fact that in the decade prior to the lifting of sanctions as part of the 2015 nuclear agreement, Iranian military spending dropped by 30 percent, ""one of the highest percentage decreases in military spending globally,"" according to Iranian researchers Sajjad F. Dizaji and Mohammad Farzanegan.(10)

The researchers argued that the difference in the sanction regime prior to the agreement and the current US measures is that the Trump administration's sanctions are unilateral rather than multilateral. ""While unilateral sanctions are not shown to influence Iran's military burden significantly, the impact of multilateral sanctions is negative and statistically significant,"" Dizaji and Farzanegan said. Military expenditures, moreover, account for only three percent of Iran's gross domestic product.(11) Even so, the International Crisis Group concluded that the period of multilateral sanctions and reduced military expenditure ""coincided with what many consider the most significant expansion of Iran's military intervention in the region.""(12)

Reality Kicks In

The implication of Trump's and Pompeo's remarks on waivers was that increased production by suppliers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, while compensating for the reduced Iranian oil sales, could spark a fight for market share, which could fuel price increases. They also suggested that the United States believed that there was currently not oil in the market to replace Iranian crude. The United States' assumption appears to be that Iran, a country with a long experience in circumventing sanctions, may have an oil industry that remains robust despite its travails.

The waivers recognized that the countries involved had no immediate alternative sources for oil. Three of the eight waiver recipients -- Greece, Italy and Turkey -- are members of NATO. Japan and South Korea have mutual defense treaties with the United States and play key roles in the North Korea denuclearization initiative. India, the world's largest democracy, is crucial to the administration's Indo-Pacific strategy, which seeks to unite countries in the region to counter China's growing assertiveness. China is the largest importer of Iranian oil. Forcing it to seek alternatives would have sparked shock tremors in the market.

US officials attribute their apparent success in already reducing Iranian exports to the strength of their alliances and the fact that countries and companies do not want to risk being barred from access to US markets.(13) Japan and South Korea stopped buying Iranian crude ahead of the sanctions. Japan nonetheless negotiated a waiver for 100,000 barrels per day, down from the 165,000 barrels it was buying prior to the threat of US measures while South Korea was granted a quota of 200,000 barrels a day.(14) The two countries said they were looking to renew imports in January.

India is officially asserting that it is importing at the agreed rate of 360,000 barrels per day.(15) By the same token, Indian claims that it had significantly reduced imports prior to the waiver are countered, says energy analyst Ellen R. Wald, quoting TankTracker com. The online monitor of oil tankers reported that Indian oil imports from Iran remained virtually unchanged in recent months. Iranian exports are frequently hidden by tankers that make stops at multiple Gulf ports and at times shut down their responders to camouflage their movements. ""The data on oil movements show conclusively that Iran's oil exports have not decreased nearly as much as the media narrative has suggested... Oil speculators and the Trump administration have been led to believe that the threat of impending sanctions on Iran's oil is removing so much from the market that oil prices could skyrocket to $100 per barrel this year. The actual data on Iran's oil exports contradict this,"" Wald said.(16)

Moreover, relatively unnoticed was a non-oil related waiver granted to India that allows it to maintain its infrastructural investment in the Iranian port of Chabahar on the shore of the Arabian Sea, a mere 70 kilometres from the Chinese-backed Pakistani port of Gwadar.(17) The port would facilitate Indian links to Central Asia by bypassing arch rival Pakistan, contribute to economic development in Afghanistan and pre-empt Chinese efforts to gain a foothold in Chabahar. Similarly, there is no indication that the US will sanction Russian, Chinese, and European companies assisting Iran with its nuclear sites, Fordow, Arak, and Busher.(18)

China is one joker in the pack. It negotiated a waiver for 360,000 barrels per day but retains the right to production from fields in Iran in which Chinese companies have a stake. They include China National Petroleum Corp's (CNBC) 75 percent stake in Iran's MIS and the North Azadegan oilfield. China moreover has a history in busting sanctions against Iran. In the years prior to the nuclear agreement, China used the Bank of Kunlun, established in 2006 in its troubled, oil-producing north-western region of Xinjiang as its handler of Iranian oil payments in violation of US and UN sanctions. The bank was sanctioned by the US Treasury for its business with Iran, including transferring funds to Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps. Kunlun in October halted yuan and euro denominated payments from Iran in anticipation of the US sanctions.(19)

Turkey is another joker. Refusing to bend to the US sanctions would enhance its goal of exploiting its geography to become a gas and oil transit hub. To do so, Turkey will have to extend its current gas agreement with Iran that risks losing its Turkish market share to producers like Qatar, Russia Azerbaijan and the United States. The question is whether Iran can make a gas agreement sufficiently attractive in terms of pricing as well as facilitating Turkish objectives in Syria where it is determined to stymie Kurdish aspirations.

Payments and pricing are but one, albeit the most immediate issue. Longer term, Iran will face significant difficulty if it can't secure the technologies to enhance production from its predominantly mature oilfields. Iran currently uses out-of-date technologies like pumping natural gas into the old oil fields to produce ever-dwindling amounts of oil. That is likely to become untenable with retail, commercial and industrial gas consumption on the rise. Countries like China and Russia are unlikely to meet standards of technologies developed in the United States and Europe."" As long as Washington can prevent it from obtaining vital enhanced oil recovery technologies, Iran's economy will become increasingly fragile,"" said energy scholar Micha'el Tanchum.(20)

The November sanctions constituted round two. Earlier sanctions imposed in August targeted Iran's steel, aluminium and auto sectors by limiting access to raw materials and essential parts. They prompted together with the prospect of the November sanctions major European companies like Total, A.P. Moller-Maersk, Peugeot, Renault, Airbus, Alstom and Siemens to withdraw from Iran. ""There is a primacy of the (US) political system. If that primacy is 'This is what you are going to do,' then that is exactly what we are going to do. We are a global company. We have interest and values and we have to balance both,"" said Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of German industrial conglomerate Siemens.(21) Put more forcefully, Pompeo's special advisor on Iran, Brian Hook, quipped: ""If you are the CEO of a European company and you are given the choice between doing business in the United States market or the Iranian market, that is the fastest decision you will ever make as CEO.""(22)

With Iran pushing Europe to put in place mechanisms to counter the US sanctions, European leaders are struggling to neutralize the measures while ensuring that European entities are shielded against being barred from the US market for doing business with Iran. European authorities have so far to convince the continent's companies that they are able to do so.

Walking a Tightrope

If the withdrawal of European companies is one indication of the difficulty in countering sanctions, SWIFT, the financial messaging system, is another. SWIFT is caught between a rock and a hard place. The Trump administration has so far refrained giving it a waiver. As a result, SWIFT's board of directors made up of representatives of major international banks risk being slapped with travel bans and asset freezes if the organization continues to do business with Iran.

To counter the US threat, the European Union invoked in July a blocking statute that makes US court decisions and administrative actions regarding sanctions on Iran void in Europe. It also prohibits Europe-based firms from discontinuing their business ties to Iran due to foreign sanctions.(23) The blocking statute was intended to not only shield European companies but also convince Iran that it was in its interests to remain committed to the nuclear accord.

""It's a difficult exercise because the weight of the U.S. in the global economy and financial system is obviously relevant. But we are determined to preserve this deal,"" said European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.(24) How difficult is evidenced by the fact that European measures have so far failed to produce convincing results. Without referring to the US sanctions, SWIFT said in early November that it was disconnecting an undisclosed number of unidentified Iranian banks.(25) Some 30 Iranian banks are connected to SWIFT. The impact that a disconnection from SWIFT would have was evident in 2012 when SWIFT complied with UN and EU sanctions. The disconnection wiped off almost half the value of the Iranian oil sector reducing revenues from oil exports from US$92.5 billion to USS52 billion.(26)

The odds in a US-EU battle over SWIFT are, however, not unequivocally in Washington's favour. US sanctions would significantly impact the global financial system and threaten America's dominant position. ""We must increase Europe's autonomy and sovereignty in trade, economic and financial policies,"" said German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.(27) Europe appears to be putting its money where its mouth is by developing a system of its own that would handle financial transactions with Iran and be immune to US sanctions. Dubbed a special purpose vehicle, the system would be open to Russia and China, both of which are signatories to the nuclear agreement, as well as other countries. European officials were also looking at a barter system that would allow Iran to sell oil and use the proceeds to purchase goods or technology from Europe.(28)

The special purpose vehicles would be designed to reduce the number of financial transactions with Iran by bundling them and to shield commercial banks by limiting their role. The advantage of multiple vehicles would allow sanctions busters to differentiate between sanctionable and non-sanctionable transactions. They could also cater to different business segments including small and medium-sized enterprises that often have no exposure to the United States, the oil industry, as well as sectors like automotive and aviation. European officials privately concede that oil traders are unlikely to avail themselves of the special vehicle(s).

The vehicles could be stand-alone state-owned banks or clearing houses for companies that transfer money to Iran, repatriate funds from the country, or engage in barter trade with it.(29) The vehicles would avoid cross-border transactions that would be easier to monitor by US authorities by arranging that a European importer of Iranian goods gets paid by a European exporter. They would further coordinate payments in ways that exporters would be paid from funds outside of Iran while importers would be paid by funds within Iran.

Iran scholar and media company owner Esfandyar Batmanghelidj and policy analyst Axel Hellman argued that Europe could kickstart its vehicle initiative with one is that is focussed on the humanitarian sector that is not included in the sanctions regime. ""Companies active in food and pharmaceuticals...have the longest-standing and arguably most important presence in Iran. Companies like Nestle, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, and Unilever -- which sell the high-volume packaged foods, cleaning products, and medicines that households depend on -- are at the heart of the most important commercial ecosystem in Iran, which includes Iran's private sector and its vibrant consumer class... Despite the exemptions for trade in food, medicine, and many consumer products, Iran's trade in these goods is restricted by the limited number of European banks willing to receive payments from Iranian importers. The SPV would serve to increase the volume of trade that can be conducted given the current state of banking ties,"" Batmanghelidj and Hellman said.(30)

The European initiative is but one effort fuelled by the threat of sanctions against SWIFT to develop alternative systems including ones using blockchain, a technology that uses cryptography, that is already being considered by Russia and Iran.(31) Russia already uses a significantly cheaper alternative to SWIFT for domestic payments and is marketing it to foreign institutions.(32) China is developing a similar system.(33)

Conclusion

The jury is out on the likely effectiveness of crippling sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States aimed at forcing the Islamic republic to alter its regional policy. Similarly, the fate of the 2015 international agreement that curbed Iran's nuclear agreement hangs in the balance after the US withdrew from the deal and re-imposed sanctions. The success of US policy and the agreement's continued viability depend on the ability of Iran's oil buyers and world powers, including Europe, China, Russia, India, Japan and South Korea to cushion the impact of the sanctions. They also depend on the degree to which the United States is forced to allow exemptions to the sanctions in its effort to balance its harsh approach towards Iran with its other geo-political concerns. The record so far suggests that Iran will endure significant pain but like in the past will be able to maintain its policy. The question is whether an opening for renewed negotiations that would address the concerns of the United States and its allies and cater to Iranian aspirations and needs will occur only when US President Trump leaves office or whether Trump may ultimately decide that talks are in the interest of both parties.

Director Rohit Shetty has always pandered to pathetic, almost cliched, male complexes rather proudly. Crouching inside many big boys are little boys with big penis issues, and that's been his target audience. His mission has been to get those wimps to fantasise about posturing as alpha males. That he inadvertently, but in a darling assertion of the sub-conscious, also creates very campy, homoerotic scenarios where big-big boys only like to be around other big-big boys -- as besties, adversa-ries, chelle chakare -- would have been mildly interesting if the gay love, often in full bloom, was at least self-aware, if not acknowledged.

But that's too much to ask of a director who only likes to talk of the commercial underpinnings of his movies, and on the telly screams about physical courage while the camera caresses his bulging biceps. It can't get creatively and intellectually more effete than that, and yet it has.

Simmba, a movie based on the 2015 Telugu hit Tem-per (starring Jr NTR, i.e. N.T. Rama Rao's grandson), is a crass, cynical, coldly-manipulative, morally-repugnant enterprise that uses a rape to carve out a hero by giving him raison d'etre.

The movie doesn't just use a rape. It uses the December 2012 Nirbhaya rape case with all its specific, emotive details.

Simmba's story is pivoted on the rape of a moonh-boli-behen, but not as a crime to be dealt with, by the cops and the courts. It is simply grist for a cowardly, corrupt man to kick-start and rouse his conscience. It exists as a trauma for the hero, to go crunch some bad skulls and bones and turn into the saviour of ladies log ki izzat and abroo.

The film screams ""rape"" so often, that you'd think that's all that happened. The girl is also killed.

But that, in Rohit Shetty and Simmba's world view,doesn't really matter. It's just a silly little fact that complicates things and is best left out. Rape in this world is much, much worse than getting killed. And that, apart from other things, is what made me run to have a bath after watching Simmba.

It made me feel very dirty.

Simmba, written by the all-male team of Vakkantham Vamsi (Temper), Yunus Sajawal, Sajid Samji and Fardah Samji, opens with a young orphan learning the ways of the world when money changes hands in a police thana and the beating stops.

It's simple: Vardi means power. And so he sets out to earn a living in the day by selling cinema tickets in black and attending night school run by sweet Gayatri Didi. All along, Ajay Devgn's voiceover provides us with some unnecessary gyaan.

Cut to a few years later when the film welcomes full-grown Sangram Bha-lerao aka Simmba (Ranveer Singh), in a very colourful and pretty setting as he chases after some senior citizen goons. The movie wears a festive look as Simmba arrives, in slow-mo, to run around long, hanging strips of cloth in rainbow colours while women slap wet yardage on hard stone. The film watches lovingly as crystal droplets bounce around and on Simmba, and throws in some rousing chanting as well.

What got my attention in this sequence was how much Simmba was grinning. Nice, white teeth and all, but a bit too familiar, I thought.

We've only just met, dude.

In the first five minutes or so of the film we get two songs, yet there's also non-stop talking. Simmba is given to breathless chatter, with some marginally funny one-liners. It's too much, too soon.

Simmba likes kicking bad butt because these bruised butts want out, and he's happy to oblige, for a price. The obliging, pliable cop is transferred to the ""gold mine"" thana, Miramar, with instructions -- do not mess with Durva Ranade (Sonu Sood).

In this thana, which has some vague connect to Singham, the happily corrupt cop finds many like-minded, ghoos-khor cops, and just one rigid, lone voice of honesty. Head constable Nityanand Mohile (Ashutosh Rana) who won't salute his corrupt senior.

But Simmba is not too bothered because across the road is Good Food Catering run by pretty Shagun (Sara Ali Khan). And then there's Akruti Dave, a medical student who teaches orphans in her spare time on the steps of a church.

Awwww. Like my Gayatri Didi, he goes.

That Akruti has come to complain about drugs in the school bags of her students is lost on him.

Corrupt cop, chhoti behen, bad goonda log who use little kids to sell drugs. You join the dots.

Simmba has a decent cast. Sara Ali Khan is confident, efficient and almost there. All she needs is a little more experience and she will come into her own.

Sonu Sood is good, as usual.

Ranveer Singh may well be a better actor than most burlies who have graced Rohit Shetty's sau-crore-toh-pakka enterprises before, but he doesn't have what Ajay Devgn has.

Though in melodramatic situations he is not bad, he is not able to project power and anger the way action heroes need to.

For one, he's very verbose, his high-energy is neither exciting nor impactful.

The film does its damnedest to create an action hero of him with genuflecting camera angles and slow-mo, but as the film's tedious idiotic crawl to the climax gets unbearably dull, it has to summon Singham to get the job done.

In fact, Simmba's dialogue there is a telling: ""Aapne sab sambhal liya. Thank you, sir.""

Admittedly, I have issues of my own and that's why I enjoy taut revenge/rape-revenge thrillers. By definition, it's an exploitative genre, often with pornographic undertones.

They are base, manipulative fantasies that are uniquely gratifying for those harbouring delusions of grandeur.

I clearly see that they are a celebration of patriarchy, that they reiterate a world order as penis-swinging men see it -- a world where all male izzat is linked to the bodies of their women. And if that is violated, it means the other man has announced that he has a bigger one. The women are incidental in this clash of penises. Sadly, I still enjoy them.

Most of them have a three act plot-line and, yet, the good ones, like The Virgin Spring, Charles Bronson's Death Wish, Kill Bill, Oldboy, Django (original), Irreversible, Insaf Ka Tarazu, Eye For an Eye... and others, create unbearable dramatic tension that must, inevitably, lead to violence that's a gory art form for the big catharsis.

Over the years, we have learnt to suffer certain things in Rohit Shetty films.

He will repeatedly assert a very masculine, militant, chauvinistic Maratha identity. So, endless haughty dialogue in Marathi with no sub-titles, and the war bugle.

His films also reinforce a worldview that appeals to old prejudices and mindsets, never once challenging them.

There are also big, burly dudes crashing their big, colourful cars in plots that are formulaic to an unbelievably imbecile level. But here it's gotten worse.

Simmba's screenplay is so badly written and so terribly scant that often scenes are stretched like chewing gum, ready to tear.

At one point the movie gets so dull and boring that the only way Shetty can throw in some excitement is by making a speeding van crash through a massive glass window.

That apart, there's moral confusion. At first, when Simmba is corrupt, the film celebrates him as a fun guy and paints honesty as an annoying, depressing, pointless burden.

Later, when he turns a page, honesty is embraced with tears.

Though Simmba is about a rape, there is hardly any connect between the so-called bhai-behen. Simmba and Akruti barely exchange a few words, and yet, for him, her rape suddenly becomes so significant and powerful.

But all these are minor problems compared to how Simmba tackles the issue of rape.

For a film that wants to sit on high moral ground preaching about how India treats its women, Simmba shamelessly exploits every nugget from the Nirbhaya case.

It's creepy how Rohit Shetty and his writers have trawled through the details of that real-life incident to pick some bits to make their own enterprise commercially viable.

Disturbing details of her medical condition are used as gore to amp up Simmba's anger. Her hanging innards are treated as the noose he must use to kill the rapists.

I though at one point I saw irony stand up in the aisle of the theatre and stare google-eyed at the screen.

The film screams rape so many times, over and over, but hardly ever talks about Akruti's death, because, well, a woman's honour is supreme. Not her life.

And even there, instead of treating rape as a crime that a cop must meticulously investigate and present to the court, it looks at it only from a male, patriarchal perceptive and makes it all about honour-dishonour.

The things that get said around it -- to settle scores -- are insufferably insensitivity. At one point there's talk of mardangi in the context of rape, and then the cop asks women what do they want, as badla.

Since the film has already made up its mind that rape is worse than death, badla means the rapists have to die.

Sometimes, there just isn't enough vomit in the world. Not for Rohit Shetty's Simmba."

Weighed down by exposes, scams and controversies in the law and order sector, not to mention heinous crimes across the State, 2018 staggers to a close. What bring a measure of relief are a few instances where justice, long overdue, was served and the wrongdoers were brought to book.

In Chennai, the year began on a good note as the police gatecrashed a birthday party organised by gangsters for their leader and nabbed over 75 history-sheeters as well as notorious goon Binu Papachan.

The conviction by the Chengalpet Mahila Court of Daswant on charges of kidnap, rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl was another piece of good news. The accused had also murdered his mother.

These apart, the year witnessed police commissioner A.K. Viswanathan pushing to bring the entire city under CCTV camera coverage.

In the middle of the year, the news about the serial rape of a young hearing impaired girl in Aynavaram came as a shock. The girl was raped for seven months and the police arrested 17 men.

The year also saw ministers and police officers being drawn into controversy after the CBI's anti-corruption wing raided residences of Health Minister C. Vijaya Baskar, DGP T.K. Rajendran and former city commissioner of police S. George in connection with the gutkha scam. Subsequently, five persons, including Madhav Rao, the owner of the gutkha company, were taken into custody.

In November, the Madras High Court appointed A.G. Ponn Manickavel, Inspector General of Police, probing idol theft cases in Tamil Nadu, as a special officer for a period of one year to continue the probe. This order was given on the day of his retirement. Early in the year, the Mr. Manickavel had seized antiques and antiquities from a few eminent personalities in the city.

As the year drew to an end, the police stumbled upon a case in which one Sampath Raj had hidden cameras in the bathrooms and bedrooms of a women's hostel he owned. His arrest set the government machinery working and steps are being taken to regularise private hostels.

Besides, police claimed to have busted an illegal immigration racket with the arrest of a Mumbai-based woman at the Chennai airport recently.

The districts too saw their fair share of major crimes. In November, five teenagers, all school students, plotted and executed an honour killing in Veeravanallur police station limits in Tirunelveli.

In Sivaganga district, communal tension raised its ugly head after a lull in Katchanatham village. Three persons were hacked to death in the incident.

In Coimbatore, the death of a college student during a disaster management preparedness drill conducted by a fake NDMA trainer made headlines.

Madurai was at the epicentre of a controversy that shook the State. An audio clip of a phone conversation between an assistant professor Nirmala Devi and her girl students was leaked on social media in mid- April. It was about luring students into providing sexual favours to higher officials of the university. The temple town also saw the arrest of uniformed personnel in connection with a dacoity reported in a doctor's house in Melur in December."

Later in the year, the government was forced to own up to the responsibility of protecting lakes in the city, though the progress on that front has been debatable.

News of the fire caught the attention of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in New Delhi, which had taken up a suo moto case after a similar fire in 2017.

An evidently irked NGT took the Karnataka government to task over recurring fires and froth in Bellandur. Slamming the State government for not taking preventive measures, a bench, headed by NGT acting chairperson U.D. Salvi, directed the government to submit a time-bound action plan by the end of January.

Within days, the government got its act together and formulated a holistic and time-bound action plan. But, the NGT expanded the net of scrutiny to include Varthur and Agara lakes, and asked the State government to come up with plans for their revival as well.

Also, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) was directed to carry out a pilot study on the macrophytes.

The NGT further made it clear that the 99 apartments in the Bellandur catchment area, which were served notices before, must install sewage treatment plants.

Going a step ahead, in April, the NGT constituted a panel comprising a professor from the IISc., the commissioner of the civic body, secretary of Bangalore Development Authority and senior scientists from central and State pollution control boards, to inspect the Bellandur, Agara and Varthur lakes.

'Shut down industries'

In one of its strictest orders, the NGT, in a follow-up hearing in April, directed shutting down all industries around Bellandur and announced that anyone polluting the lake would have to pay an environment compensation of ₹5 lakh. The government was directed to take up one-time cleanup of the lake in a month. The government failed to meet the deadline and asked for more time.

In a further rap to the government for its poor management of Bellandur lake, the commission, directed to monitor the cleaning operation, submitted a scathing report in June stating that the de-weeding activity was not only futile, but could further harm the water body. The committee also put the spotlight on Varthur lake and called it an aggravated calamity.

Hefty penalty

In its most recent order on December 6, the NGT again came down heavily on the State government for failing to protect Bellandur, Agara and Varthur lakes. It directed the government to transfer ₹500 crore to an escrow account to utilise for execution of the action plans to clean the lakes. The green body also directed the government to deposit ₹50 crore with the Central Pollution Control Board as environment compensation, and the BBMP was told to pay ₹25 crore.

Another panel, headed by former Supreme Court judge N. Santosh Hegde, has been set up to monitor implementation of the action plans.

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has decided to appeal against the NGT order in the Supreme Court.

While the cases will continue to be heard by the NGT, the saga of fires, froth, and indiscriminate dumping of garbage and sewage in the city's lakes continues.

Some lakes spring back to life

While Bellandur, Varthur, Agara, Kalkere, Kaggadasapura and Mestripalya lakes were in the news for all the wrong reasons, there was a glimmer of hope for Madiwala, Hebbagodi and Jakkur lakes.

Madiwala lake underwent a massive transformation. The 272-acre water body in BTM Layout, which was under development since the end of 2016, became home to many native species of flora and fauna. The transformation was the result of a proposal by the Karnataka Knowledge Commission to develop the lake into a unique biodiversity park. The developed lake now has an open butterfly park, conservatory of insectivorous plants and orchids, cycad and palm grove, herbal garden, an island ecosystems and a scented garden.

A CSR initiative saw the revival of Hebbagodi lake, off Hosur Road near Electronics City. It has a new embankment with a fence, increased water holding capacity and a waste segregation yard. The work was carried out by Biocon Foundation, the CSR arm of Biocon Ltd. and Syngene International Ltd.

A collaborative project by students of Srishti School of Art Design & Technology and artists from Germany led to the creation of a floating island made out of waste at the Jakkur water tank, next to the lake. The island is expected to serve as a platform to connect the community with the lake.

Threat of green cover receding

From trees making way for 'developmental projects' to allegations of illegal mining in a forest, Bengaluru's green cover continued to face threats from multiple fronts.

The year began with thousands of citizens raising their voices against quarrying and mining around Bannerghatta National Park. They pointed to environmental violations in the buffer zone of the park and mining in eco-sensitive elephant corridors.

A new draft notification for BNP by the Ministry of Environment and Forests signalled further danger to the ecology of the forest. The draft trimmed down the Eco-Sensitive Zone around the park from 268.96 sq.km. to 169 sq.km. This means opening up more area for mining and commercial development.

The new year may not hold any good news either. The coalition government's big ticket infrastructure project -- elevated corridors -- announced this year, is expected to result in the axing of as many as 3,000 trees, and pruning of another 2,000 in various parts of the city. Citizen groups are awaiting public consultations to put forth their objections."

The shortlisted agencies would become 'Monument Mitras' through the innovative concept of 'Vision Bidding', which will give them the opportunity to associate their CSR activities with a heritage site if the Vision Bid is selected.

What is it? The 'Adopt a Heritage Scheme' of Ministry of Tourism was launched on World Tourism Day i.e. 27th September, 2017. This project is a key initiative of Ministry of Tourism in close collaboration with Ministry of Culture and Archeological Survey of India (ASI), to develop the heritage sites / monuments and making them tourist-friendly to enhance the tourism potential and their cultural importance in a planned and phased manner.

How it works? The project plans to entrust heritage sites/monuments and other tourist sites to private sector companies, public sector companies and individuals for the development of tourist amenities. The project aims to develop synergy among all partners.

Monument Mitras: Successful bidders selected for adopting heritage sites / monuments by the Oversight and Vision Committee shall be called as Monument Mitras. The basic and advanced amenities of the tourist destinations would be provided by them. They would also look after the operations and the maintenance of the amenities. The 'Monument Mitras' would associate pride with their CSR activities.

Adopt a Heritage project is meant to address the challenges that the Archaeological Survey of India and other government bodies are facing in operating tourism infrastructure at heritage sites. By allowing private players to build, operate and maintain ""tourist-friendly"" and ""world class amenities at these sites, the expectation is that the project will boost domestic and international tourism.

The Bill makes instant triple talaq void and illegal. It seeks to make the practice of instant triple talaq a punishable offence with imprisonment of up to three years.

The case dates back to 2016 when the Supreme Court had sought assistance from the then Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi on pleas challenging the constitutional validity of ""triple talaq"", ""nikah halala"" and ""polygamy"", to assess whether Muslim women face gender discrimination in cases of divorce.

Opposing the practice of triple talaq, the Centre told the top court that there is a need to re-look at these practices on grounds of gender equality and secularism.

The Supreme Court later announced the setting up of a five-judge constitutional bench to hear and deliberate on the challenges against the practice of 'triple talaq, nikah halala' and polygamy.

The issue gained political momentum on March 2017 when the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) told the Supreme Court that the issue of triple talaq falls outside the judiciary's realm and that these issues should not be touched by the court.

However, on August 22 this year, the Supreme Court set aside the decade-old practice of instant triple talaq saying it was violative of Article 14 and 21 of the Indian Constitution.

In September, the government had proposed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill in the Parliament and sought to make triple talaq a punishable offence under the law.

At first, the Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha but it failed to secure a majority in the Rajya Sabha. The Bill was postponed till the winter session of Parliament. Following this, an ordinance was issued by the government after the bill failed to get cleared in Rajya Sabha amid protests by the Opposition.

The Bill makes all declaration of talaq, including in written or electronic form, to be void (i.e. not enforceable in law) and illegal.

Definition: It defines talaq as talaq-e-biddat or any other similar form of talaq pronounced by a Muslim man resulting in instant and irrevocable divorce. Talaq-e-biddat refers to the practice under Muslim personal laws where pronouncement of the word 'talaq' thrice in one sitting by a Muslim man to his wife results in an instant and irrevocable divorce.

Offence and penalty: The Bill makes declaration of talaq a cognizable offence, attracting up to three years' imprisonment with a fine. (A cognizable offence is one for which a police officer may arrest an accused person without warrant.) The offence will be cognizable only if information relating to the offence is given by: (i) the married woman (against whom talaq has been declared), or (ii) any person related to her by blood or marriage.

The Bill provides that the Magistrate may grant bail to the accused. The bail may be granted only after hearing the woman (against whom talaq has been pronounced), and if the Magistrate is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for granting bail.

The offence may be compounded by the Magistrate upon the request of the woman (against whom talaq has been declared). Compounding refers to the procedure where the two sides agree to stop legal proceedings, and settle the dispute. The terms and conditions of the compounding of the offence will be determined by the Magistrate.

Allowance: A Muslim woman against whom talaq has been declared, is entitled to seek subsistence allowance from her husband for herself and for her dependent children. The amount of the allowance will be determined by the Magistrate.

Custody: A Muslim woman against whom such talaq has been declared, is entitled to seek custody of her minor children. The manner of custody will be determined by the Magistrate.

Time has come to put an end to the suffering of Muslim women who have been at the receiving end of instant talaq for several years. More than 20 Islamic countries have already banned the practice.

Mains Question: The triple talaq Bill is a classic example of executive-legislative-judicial collaboration towards ensuring social justice. Critically comment.

Context: The Centre has given an extension of six months to complete the ongoing exercise for updating the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam by June 30.

On December 6, 2013, the government issued the first notification setting a deadline of three years for completion of the entire NRC process. Since then, five extensions have been given by the government. The draft NRC was published on July 30 and included the names of 2.9 crore people of the total 3.29 crore applicants.

Officially, the NRC process will address the issue of illegal migrants, specifically from Bangladesh. The National Register of Citizens was first published in 1951 to record citizens, their houses and holdings. Updating the NRC to root out foreigners was a demand during the Assam Agitation (1979-1985).

There have been several waves of migration to Assam from Bangladesh, but the biggest was in March 1971 when the Pakistan army crackdown forced many to flee to India. The Assam Accord of 1985 that ended the six-year anti-foreigners' agitation decided upon the midnight of March 24, 1971 as the cut-off date.

The Citizenship Act of 1955 was amended after the Assam Accord for all Indian-origin people who came from Bangladesh before January 1, 1966 to be deemed as citizens. Those who came between January 1, 1966 and March 25, 1971 were eligible for citizenship after registering and living in the State for 10 years while those entering after March 25, 1971, were to be deported.

Mains Question: Throw light on the nature of migration in Assam. Examine whether the National Register of Citizens will address the issues arising thereunder?

The couple was married for 15 years.

In 2003, Azeez was married Javeed Khan, a surgeon by profession. The skirmishes between the couple had started only after six months of marriage.

""He started abusing me emotionally and kept insulting me,"" Azeez said in a police complaint. She also alleged that Khan never asked for a legal divorce but had been asking her to leave.

In the initial days of the marriage, the couple lived UK and then moved to the US. Last month, Khan had brought Azeez back to Bengaluru. He later went back to the US, taking all her documents along.

Khan had allegedly told her that he wanted to resolve the issues between them after speaking with the families. The couple have two kids, aged 13 and 10.

""Once we reached, he left with his family, while I was stranded at the airport. He had taken away my passport, academic certificates and other identity cards. On December 4, a day after I filed the police complaint, he sent me talaq on Whatsapp,"" Azeez told CNN News18. She hasn't been able to contact him since then.

The message from Javeed, which was also sent to their family group reads, "" TALAQ I am sending this message in my full sense and I am not under any influence of anger or intoxication. ALLAH as my witness. I, Dr. JAVEED KHAN (dob 01/19/1976), son of late Taj Ahmed pronounce TALAQ (Divorce) to RESHMA AZEEZ (dob 12/06/1978), daughter of Mr. Azeezuddin, according to ISLAMIC LAW OF SHARIAH, Meher has been completely fulfilled [sic]"".

The children continue to live with Khan in Illinois, while he has allegedly cut off all communication with his wife.

""I speak to my children through their school staff now,"" said Azeez.

Azeez had has alleged that her email accounts and bank cards have also been blocked. A senior police officer said Khan was away from the country by the time the complaint was lodged. The airport authorities would inform them once he returns. The officer also said that the police are not aware of the Whatsapp Talaq as it may have been given after the complaint was filed.

On Thursday, the Lok Sabha passed the Triple Talaq Bill, aimed to make the Triple Talaq a criminal offence with a jail term of upto three years for the husband."

The report even notes, ""we respect the privacy rights of fake people."" The Senate Select Committee investigating Russian interference with the 2016 elections commissioned this and another report, and released them on December 17.

Why do we, and why should we, ""respect"" ""fake people""? On a deeper level, why would we accept the epidemic of false and hidden identities that have spread not only misinformation, but also hate, anger, and fraud, all over today's primary communications medium?

It all goes back to different times and different circumstances, when a right to anonymous speech was first recognized. That right was later broadened, and then applied to the new circumstances of the Internet.

In colonial times, some of our founding fathers used pseudonyms. Benjamin Franklin used the pseudonym ""Silence Dogood;"" Hamilton, Madison, and Jay published the Federalist Papers under the pseudonym ""Publius."" In constitutional law, we tend to revere practices associated with the founders in colonial times.

So, after Los Angeles enacted an ordinance restricting civil rights protesters from circulating handbills with ""fictitious names,"" the Supreme Court, in Talley v. California, found that law unconstitutional. In that 1960 decision, the court noted the history of pamphleteering as a way in which ""persecuted groups and sects from time to time throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices and laws."" Such groups, it said, had to speak ""either anonymously or not at all.""

The court referred to the pseudonym used for the Federalist Papers, and gave other examples of dissenters who wrote anonymously or with pseudonyms, including famous dissenters like John Lilburne of England, New England Puritan ministers John Penry and John Udal, and various ""Revolutionary War colonial patriots."" And it relied on another famous Civil Rights Era decision, NAACP v. Alabama, which it recognized ""that identification and fear of reprisal might deter perfectly peaceful discussions of public matters of importance.""

The Supreme Court again considered anonymity in 1995, in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission. There, a state law prohibited distribution of anonymous campaign literature. The Supreme Court, relying on Talley, struck down the law as unconstitutional.

The plaintiff in McIntyre was a dissenter, like the plaintiffs in Talley. Margaret McIntyre, as an individual, composed, printed, and distributed handbills opposing a school tax increase. The Supreme Court in McIntyre, as in Talley, noted the benefits of anonymity to dissenters: ""The decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official retaliation [or] by concern about social ostracism.""

But the court then went further, endorsing as well ""a desire to preserve as much of one's privacy as possible."" The court then held that ""whatever the motivation,"" there is a public interest in allowing anonymous speech, and the First Amendment therefore protects ""an author's decision to remain anonymous."" Thus, McIntyre, though arising from the situation of a lone dissenter, led to a ruling that seems to recognize a First Amendment right of anonymity for anyone, anytime. McIntyre clearly suggests that American law ""respects the privacy rights of fake people.""

A series of lower court rulings have followed McIntyre's principles in imposing procedural protections for anonymous speech on the Internet, although most of those cases arise, like Talley and McIntyre, from comments by minorities and dissidents who fear retaliation.

But the two Supreme Court decisions and the lower court rulings leave many questions unanswered. They have dealt with anonymous speech, or obvious pseudonyms, not with fake names that likely deceived readers into believing that they were real people. They dealt with true contributions to public debate, not fictitious posts designed to undercut the democratic process, or fictitious names used for commercial fraud. And other situations of anonymity, like those involving reporters' confidential sources and the recent New York Times op-ed by an anonymous Trump administration official, involve vetted and verified speakers, and thus much different policy considerations.

All of these considerations suggest anonymity and fictitious names raise many important issues that need individualized attention. But a simple rule of absolute protection of all anonymity seems to be the prevailing interpretation of McIntyre, and, judging by that decision's broad language, maybe even the Supreme Court's intent.

But because Ms. McIntyre was a dissident, the language in McIntyre about extending protection for anonymity to all circumstances (""whatever the motivation"") may be legal dictum -- a statement that goes beyond the circumstances of the case, and hence need not be followed. And both Talley and McIntyre recognize room for state laws to combat fraud. Justice Harlan, concurring in Talley, suggested that a ""substantial showing"" of fraud or other misconduct could overcome the First Amendment right to anonymity. Thus, there is a reasonable basis for looking more closely at today's broad use of anonymity and false identities, not only by the Russians, but also by perpetrators of many kinds of fraud and wrongdoing on the Internet.

On a daily basis, individuals and businesses are attacked and deceived by Internet activities of people shielded by false identities; indeed, false identities are the baseline tools for most Internet frauds. The Senate consultants caution that Russian interference in U.S. elections and public opinions continues on a large scale, using false identities. And people write with more anger, and foment more hate, when their identities are shielded. In these circumstances, a lot will ride on what happens whenever the McIntyre protection for anonymity is tested against the realities of the modern Internet."

Present at the inauguration were Swami Maheshananda (Chairman Kaivalyadhama), Dr DR Karthikeyan (Former Dir CBI and Member of Kaivalyadhama Advisory Board), Justice (Retd) BN Shrikrishna (former Judge of Supreme Court of India and Chairman Kaivalyadhama Advisory Board), PN Ranjit Kumar (Jt Secretary Ministry Of AYUSH, Government of India), Dr Pradeep Vyas (Principal Secretary - Public Health department Government of Maharashtra), Prof Rajan Welukar (Vice Chancellor Raisoni University, Member Advisory Board Kaivalyadhama), and OP Tiwari (Secretary Kaivalyadhama).

Speaking on the same, Subodh Tiwari, CEO Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute said; ""Over the next few days, brilliant minds from all over the globe will come together to discuss the place of yoga in the realm of healing. Through multiple academic plenary sessions and panel discussions, our endeavour would be to delve deeper into the intricate aspects of understanding yoga as a therapy. At Kaivalyadhama, we believe that we can set the proper context for conversation and truly be able to recognise that yoga, unlike many other disciplines, provides an all-encompassing method for therapy.""

The aim of the conference is to understand the evolution of yoga as a form of therapy, both historically and in the current context. To add, the discussions will set the tone about the future scope of yoga therapy, studying its place in various fields: academia, modern medicine, and yoga teaching.

Some of the topics discussed at the conference were - evidence-based yoga and its integration into professional therapy practice - the Western scenario, the future roadmap - integrating yoga as complementary therapy into mainstream medical and mental healthcare, and yoga as therapy in women's health.

Dr Satbir Singh Khalsa, PhD, Assistant Professor of Medicine at Hardvard Medical School, USA mentioned during the inauguration ceremony - ""Today, there is a disconnect. We've taught dental hygiene, but not mental hygiene. Now, through the lens of yoga, as a form of healing, both from the scope of prevention and cure, we must ask ourselves how do we go from where we are now to where we need to be? I believe this conference will help answer this question and establish a roadmap for the practice and discipline of yoga therapy.""

Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute's 'International Yoga Conference - Yoga as Therapy - Scope, Evidence and Evolution' saw illustrious names from various fields - yoga, general and holistic medicine, surgery, eastern philosophy, Sanskrit, psychology and other various academic fields - come together to discuss and dissect the current definition of yogic therapy as well as synthesise evidence-based research.

Some of the eminent international names at the conference were Dr Sat Bir Singh Khalsa (Asst Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, USA), Göran Boll (Yoga teacher, therapist and Founder of Medi Yoga, Sweden), John Kepner (Executive Director, IAYT, USA), Dr Arthur Brownstein (Assistant Clinical Professor of Medicine, USA), and Dr Luciano Bernardi (Professor of Internal Medicine, Italy) amongst others."

The civil supplies department, set up in 1918 when thousands of people fell victim to frequent episodes of famine, completed 100 years in August. The landmark event, though, went completely unnoticed. There were occasions when several pockets of princely Hyderabad state ran out of food stocks. Rice supplies, then, were rationed at 50 grams per head per day and it was increased to 100 grams only in 1950.

The pandemic flu of 1918 resulted in the decline of Hyderabad city population by 9.4% -- the population of Hyderabad state in the 1921 census was lower than that of 1911. There were more deaths than births and the decadal population dropped from 1.33 crore in 1911 to 1.24 crore in 1921. The flu which struck in September 1918 killed 46.5 people per 1000 that month and the death toll increased rapidly to 464 deaths per 1000 by Octoberend. Two per cent (3.50 lakh) of Hyderabad's population had been wiped out within a month.

2018 was also the year when the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), set up as Beri-Beri Enquiry Unit at Coonoor in Tamil Nadu, turned

100. It was shifted to Hyderabad in 1958.

Also completing a century was the Hyderabad Currency Act 1918 which introduced paper money for the first time. Earlier, only coins were in use. The Act came into force on June 4, 1918.

The Osmania University was also set up in 1918 though the institute celebrated the centenary in 2017.

While exams went online, campuses erupted with unrest and agitation

From reforms to resentment, 2018 was a mixed bag for students and parents. After almost two decades since its inception, common entrance tests such as Eamcet, ICET among others went online for those seeking admission to various professional courses.

In a major development, Telangana joined the national pool for medical courses by earmarking 15% of MBBS seats and 50% of postgraduate medical seats to students from other states.

What rocked Hyderabad this year was a string of student protests reported from top institutions such as Birla Institute of Technology Science, Tata Institute of Social Science, apart from other engineering colleges such as Vasavi College of Engineering, Chaitanya Bharati Institute of Technology etc. Their demands ranged from fee regulation to continuation of courses.

Those in school found no respite from the spiralling fee structure as the state government for the first time ordered school managements to maintain status-quo on the fee hike and issued an admission notification. Subsequently, on January 22, the Hyderabad High Court issued an interim order allowing schools to hike fee, leaving parents fuming. It was only closer to the end of year that the Delhi Public School, Mahendra Hills, decision to slash fee by 50% brought them some hope.

Apart from fees, two alleged cases of sexual abuse of primary students reported from a private school in Tolichowki, added to the angst of parents who demanded better surveillance in educational institutions.

City set to get an AIIMS, but will H1N1 deaths stop?

Right at the beginning, the government found itself in a spot with maternal deaths showing a three-fold jump since 2016-2017.

The core Hyderabad district itself reported as many as 105 maternal deaths compared to just 31 in 2017.

A worried healthcare department put all heads together and managed to bring things under control by strengthening government hospitals and introducing several health schemes, including KCR Kits, where pregnant women were given financial assistance in instalments towards the end of the year.

Fee regulation among several other issues triggered protests from students at top institutes such as TISS, BITS and many others

The maternal mortality rate (MMR) now stands at 70 female deaths per 100,000 live births. But right through the year, the government struggled to contain the deadly swine flu (H1N1) virus, with 154 deaths officially recorded till October this year and with 90% cases reported in Hyderabad city itself. If the battle to control the mutated virus was an uphill task, the dengue virus with 2,700 deaths and malaria with 1,500 deaths, underscored the government's failure to tackle diseases in Hyderabad. The health department also struggled to create more jobs and depute doctors and other necessary staff to rural areas, forcing patients to flock to Hyderabad's hospitals.

On a positive note, the decision to renovate the heritage block of the iconic Osmania General Hospital and build a new hospital premises, came as a welcome move. On December 20, Telangana received happy tidings, when the Union cabinet finally clearing the decks for the establishment of a new All India Institute for Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bibinagar, at a cost of Rs 1,028 crore. The new prestigious facility spread over 200 acres will also have 100 MBBS seats.

The act requires covered employers to provide paid sick leave to many of their Michigan-based employees. Below are answers to frequently asked questions about the new law.

A: Persons, firms, businesses, educational institutions, nonprofit agencies, corporations, limited liability companies, government entities, and other entities that employ 50 or more individuals are covered employers. The act does not apply to the United States government, other states, or political subdivisions of other states.

Q: Which workers are eligible to use paid sick leave under the act?

A: The act defines an eligible employee as ""an individual engaged in service to an employer in the business of the employer from whom an employer is required to withhold for federal income tax purposes."" As a practical matter, this excludes independent contractors from eligibility under the act.

Q: Are there any employees who are not eligible to take leave under the act?

A: The act has 12 specific exemptions. Employees within any of these exemptions are not eligible for paid medical leave. These exemptions include (1) employees exempt from statutory overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) because they are employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, or in the capacity of an outside salesman as defined by the FLSA; (2) employees in the private sector who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that is in effect; (3) part-time workers (those ""who worked, on average, fewer than 25 hours a week during the immediately preceding calendar year""); and (4) seasonal workers (those employed for ""25 weeks or fewer in a calendar year for a job scheduled for 25 weeks or fewer"").

Q: When may an eligible employee start to accrue paid medical leave under the act?

A: ""Paid medical leave . . . shall begin to accrue on the effective date of the act, or upon commencement of the employee's employment, whichever is later.""

Q: When may an eligible employee start to use paid medical leave under the act?

A: ""An employee may use accrued paid medical leave as it is accrued, except that an employer may require an employee to wait until the ninetieth calendar day after commencing employment before using accrued paid medical leave.""

Q: How does paid medical leave accrue?

A: Employees will accrue paid medical leave at a rate of one hour for every 35 hours actually worked. However, employees cannot accrue more than one hour in a calendar week or more than 40 hours per benefit year. The act defines a benefit year as any 12-month period used by an employer to calculate an eligible employee's benefits. Hours worked does not include hours taken off work by an eligible employee for paid leave, including paid vacation days, paid personal days, and paid time off, unless the employer voluntarily chooses to include nonworking time in the accrual.

Q: Can employees carry over unused paid sick days?

A: Employees can carry over up to 40 hours of unused accrued paid medical leave from one benefit year to another benefit year, but employees may not use more than 40 hours in a single benefit year.

Q: Can employers provide the total amount of paid sick days all at once?

A: Yes. An employer may provide at least 40 hours of paid medical leave at the beginning of the benefit year or on the date the individual becomes eligible during the benefit year on a prorated basis. If an employer adopts this approach, it does not have to permit employees to carry over unused leave to the next benefit year.

Q: How much are employees paid for their accrued paid medical leave?

A: Accrued leave is paid at the employee's normal hourly rate of pay or base wage. Calculation of the normal hourly rate of pay does not include overtime pay, holiday pay, bonuses, commissions, supplemental pay, piece-rate pay, or gratuities.

Q: Must an employer provide additional paid medical leave if it already provides paid leave to employees?

A: There is a rebuttable presumption that an employer is in compliance with the Paid Medical Leave Act if the employer provides at least 40 hours of paid leave to an eligible employee each benefit year, including paid vacation days, paid personal days, and other paid time off. What type of information would rebut this presumption is yet to be determined.

Q: For what purposes may an employee use paid medical leave?

A: Employees may take paid medical leave for the physical or mental illness, injury, or health condition of the employee or his or her family member; medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of the employee or employee's family member; or preventative care of the employee or his or her family member. Employees may also take paid leave if the employee or his or her family member is the victim of domestic violence or sexual assault; for the closure of the employee's place of business by order of a public official; to care for a child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a public official; or because of the employee or his or her family member's exposure to a communicable disease that would jeopardize the health of others.

Q: Under what circumstances may an employee take paid leave in connection with domestic violence or sexual assault?

A: An employee can take leave for medical care or psychological or other counseling, to receive services from a victim services organization, to relocate, to obtain legal services, or to participate in any civil or criminal proceedings related to or resulting from the domestic violence or sexual assault.

Q: Who is part of the employee's ""family""?

A: ""Family member,"" as defined under the act, includes ""a biological, adopted or foster child, stepchild or legal ward, or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis""; a biological parent, foster parent, stepparent, adoptive parent, or legal guardian of an employee; a spouse; or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child. Family members also include grandparents; grandchildren; biological, foster, and adopted siblings; and any person to whom the employee is legally married under the laws of any state.

Q: Do employees have a right to be paid out for unused, accrued paid medical leave upon their termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation of employment?

A: No. Employees need not be paid out at separation.

Q: What is the smallest increment of time in which an employee must use accrued paid medical leave?

A: Paid medical leave must be used in one-hour increments, unless the employer has a different increment policy and the policy is in writing in an employee handbook or other employee benefit document. For example, if an employer allows employees to take leave in 10-minute increments under its existing written policy, then paid leave under the act can also be taken in 10-minute increments.

Q: What notice must an employee provide when requesting use of paid medical leave?

A: Employees must follow the employer's usual and customary notice, procedural, and documentation requirements for requesting leave, but the employee must be afforded at least three days to provide documentation.

Q: What recourse do employers have if an employee does not provide sufficient notice?

A: Employees may be denied leave and may be subject to discipline and discharge for failing to follow notice, procedural, and documentation requirements. However, employees may have protections under other laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act that employers cannot ignore.

Q: Who may sign medical documentation on behalf of an employee or an employee's family member?

A: ""[A] doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) . . . or any other person determined by the Secretary [of Labor] to be capable of providing healthcare services"" (as defined under the FMLA), including podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, optometrists, chiropractors, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, clinical social workers, and physicians assistants -- may provide medical documentation.

Q: What forms of documentation may an employee provide where paid medical leave is taken because of domestic violence or sexual assault?

A: A police report, a signed statement from a victim or witness advocate, or court documentation indicating involvement in domestic violence or sexual assault is satisfactory documentation.

Q: Are there any limits on the type of information an employer may require from the employee?

A: Employers may not require the documentation to disclose the details of the medical condition, domestic violence, or sexual assault as a condition of providing paid medical leave.

Q: Do employers have any duty to maintain the confidentiality of the information provided by the employee?

A: Yes. Employers must keep health information, as well as information about domestic violence and sexual assault (about an employee or his or her family member), confidential and cannot disclose the information to others without the employee's permission.

Q: What, if any, recordkeeping obligations do employers have under the act?

A: Employers shall retain, for not less than one year, records documenting the hours worked and paid medical leave taken by employees.

Q: What, if any, posting obligations do employers have under the act?

A: Employers must display conspicuously at their places of business a poster that contains the amount of paid medical leave required to be provided, the terms under which paid medical leave may be used, the employees' right to file a complaint with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) for any violation of the act.

Q: What recourse does an employee have if his or her employer violates the act?

A: Employees may file a claim with LARA within six months of the alleged violation.

Q: What can LARA do if it discovers violations of the act?

A: LARA may recover payment of the improperly withheld paid medical leave and may impose civil fines of not more than $1,000. LARA may also impose civil fines of not more than $100 for each willful violation of an employer's posting obligations.

Q: Is there any possibility that the obligations under the Paid Medical Leave Act may change in the future?

A: Outside interest groups are likely to continue to support future ballot initiatives related to paid medical leave, perhaps in 2020. Also, the Michigan legislature could seek to amend the act in the future. There could even be a constitutional challenge in court.

Q: What should employers be doing now to prepare for compliance with the Paid Medical Leave Act?

A: Once employers have determined that they are a covered employer and that they do or will employ individuals eligible for paid sick leave, they will want to adopt or revise their existing paid time off policies. Employers that operate in other states and municipalities with paid leave laws or ordinances may have a number of different obligations.

"157","1028057645","2018-12-28","https://www.gqindia.com/content/future-crime-fighting-family-tree-forensics/","The future of crime-fighting is family tree forensics","GQ India",FALSE,"In April, a citizen scientist named Barbara Rae-Venter used a little-known genealogy website called GEDMatch to help investigators find a man they'd been looking for for nearly 40 years: The Golden State Killer. In the months since, law enforcement agencies across the country have flocked to the technique, arresting a flurry of more than 20 people tied to some of the most notorious cold cases of the last five decades. Far from being a forensic anomaly, genetic genealogy is quickly on its way to becoming a routine police procedure. At least one company has begun offering a full-service genetic genealogy shop to law enforcement clients. And Rae-Venter's skills are in such high demand that she's started teaching her secrets to some of the biggest police forces in the US, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Identifying individuals from their distant genetic relatives, a technique called long-range familial searching, is a potent alternative to the types of DNA searches commonly available to cops. Those are typically limited to forensic databases, which can only identify close kin -- a sibling, parent, or child -- and are highly regulated. No court order is required to mine GEDMatch's open source trove of potential leads, which, unlike forensic databases, contains genetic bits of code that can be tied to health data and other personally identifiable information.

Currently, there aren't any laws that regulate how law enforcement employs long-range familial searching, which hobbyists and do-gooders have turned to for years to find the biological families of adoptees. But some legal experts argue its use in criminal cases raises grave privacy concerns. They expect to see a legal challenge at some point, though probably not in the next year. In the meantime, GEDMatch is becoming even more powerful, as it grows by nearly a thousand new uploads every day. And with hundreds more cases currently in the hands of full-time family-tree builders, one thing's for sure: In 2019, genealogy is going to send a lot more people to jail.

It was the last Saturday of June and CeCe Moore had been working on her couch, hunched over her laptop for 16 hours straight. The month before, the genetic genealogist had been hired by a forensic DNA company in Virginia called Parabon, to lead its new division devoted to long-range familial searching. She was immersed in a case out of Fort Wayne, Indiana; In the spring of 1998, eight-year-old April Tinsley went missing from her home. Three days later, a jogger discovered her body in a ditch on DeKalb County Road 68, about 20 miles outside of town. She had been raped and strangled to death.

For years, Tinsley's killer haunted that northeastern corner of Indiana, leaving messages scrawled on a barn bragging of his crime. In 2004, four threatening notes appeared on bicycles owned by young girls that had been left in their yards. The notes, which were claimed to be written by the same person that killed Tinsley, were placed inside baggies alongside used condoms. The semen matched DNA found in Tinsley's underwear.

This summer, Indiana investigators extracted DNA from the original crime scene and sent it to Parabon. There, the company reverse-engineered the information into a DNA data profile similar to what you would get back from consumer genetics companies like 23andMe or Ancestry. Then they uploaded it to GEDMatch and waited for a match. They got 12. Twelve relatives, ranging from fifth to third cousins.

So that's where Moore started, that weekend in June. The cousins represented four different family trees containing thousands of people, all of which somehow had to tie into the Fort Wayne killer. The first thing she did was work backward in time to locate ancestors from whom the suspect and the 12 matches were both descended. Eventually she found four couples, born between 1809 and 1849. Once she had them, she could move forward in history, building out family trees of every generation until the present. She did this by tracking names and faces through census records, newspaper archives, school yearbooks, and social media.

By the time night fell over her home in San Diego, she had begun to close in on a single branch, into which the four genetic tributaries all ran. From there things moved quickly. As the clock ticked past midnight, she found the relatives that had struck out for Indiana. It didn't take much longer to circle in on two brothers who lived in the area where Tinsley was murdered. Full siblings are as close as genetic genealogy can get. But Moore had a hunch. One brother struck her as a recluse; he had no wife or kids, he lived in a trailer, there were no pictures of him anywhere, and his family never mentioned him on Facebook.

Moore laid this all out for the Indiana investigators. A few days later they came back to her with a photo of one of the two brothers, with a hand-written note underneath. She gasped. ""I thought it was him, but I wasn't sure until I saw his writing,"" Moore says. ""It was the same as those notes and that barn.""

Indiana authorities staked out the trailer the first week of July and collected a piece of trash with the suspect's DNA on it. Lab tests confirmed that the DNA recovered from the condoms in 2004, and the crime scene in 1988, belonged to the same man: 59-year-old John Dale Miller. Police arrested him July 15th. According to local reports, when the police asked him why they were at his home, Miller replied, ""April Tinsley."" On Friday, December 7, Miller pled guilty in the Allen County Courthouse to murder and child molestation, as part of a plea agreement. On December 21, a judge sentenced him to 80 years in prison.

Miller is the first person genetic genealogy has put away for good. There could soon be others. Parabon has made public its involvement in 20 ""solved"" cases so far, with eight more undisclosed. Of those, at least four of the suspects were already deceased. The company was able to get up and running quickly after the Golden State Killer news broke the ice, because it had already created 100 or so genetic profiles through its phenotyping service, which creates a composite image from DNA for police to circulate in hopes of getting a lead. After hiring Moore, they quickly brought on three more genetic genealogists over the summer, and are in the process of hiring one more. The company says it's now uploaded 200 profiles to GEDMatch, which represent cold cases from nearly as many law enforcement agencies scattered around the US. Parabon is actively working on 40 such cases.

Some of those include active cases, not just crimes committed decades ago. For example, in April, exactly a week before the Golden State Killer announcement, a man broke into a residence in the red-rocked southern Utah town of St. George, and sexually assaulted the 79-year-old woman who lived there. Three months later, authorities arrested a suspect, Spencer Glen Monnett, based on Moore's genetic detective work. She says everyone clears their schedules to prioritize any active cases. At the moment, Parabon is working on at least one other active case involving a serial offender, but the company expects it to become a bigger part of what they do in 2019.

""In these active cases that come back with no match in CODIS [the federal offender database], law enforcement are realizing they don't have to wait until every last avenue has been exhausted before coming to us,"" says Ellen Greytak, who runs the company's advanced DNA services division. ""Genetic genealogy can be a tool to use right away.""

Rae-Venter, the genetic genealogist who cracked the Golden State Killer case, has also begun taking on active cases, with a small team of volunteers who mostly work pro bono. Right now she's spending 12 to 15 hours a day, six days a week trying to track down a serial rapist who is still out there committing crimes. In addition to that one, her consultancy group is working through a backlog of 25 to 30 more cold cases. And she's still collaborating closely with the Sacramento County detectives she joined forces with on the GSK case. Rae-Venter says a large part of their queue are referrals from the FBI.

Indeed, the feds can't seem to get enough of her. Earlier this year, The FBI flew Rae-Venter to Houston, Texas to give a seven hour presentation on genetic genealogy to a room of 100 people -- mostly federal agents, some local police officers, and even one Texas Ranger in a signature white rancher-style cowboy hat. ""It's really catching people's attention,"" she says. While family historians such as herself may be leading the way in this emerging field, she thinks it makes more sense to train, and perhaps even certify, law enforcement, rather than try to pull from the hobbyist community. Ultimately, she believes every major law enforcement agency will have its own specialists on staff. ""I think this belongs to detectives, not genealogists,"" says Rae-Venter.

As an example, she points to the arrest in September of the man believed to be the NorCal Rapist, another serial offender who terrorized victims in six California counties over a 15-year period beginning in 1991. Detectives from the Sacramento District Attorney's office, who Rae-Venter had trained, uploaded a genetic profile of the suspect and built out family trees on their own. According to the DA's office, they singled out the man arrested, Roy Charles Waller, in just 10 days.

Genetic geneology alone isn't enough to make an arrest. Investigators have to do confirmatory DNA testing, by retrieving bits of genetic material from the suspect, usually pulled from his or her trash, and comparing them to DNA found at the crime scene. But legal scholars worry that the widespread adoption of long-range familial searches will expose vast numbers of innocent people to genetic surveillance.

GEDMatch, which currently houses 1.2 million profiles from folks who've had their DNA analyzed at places like 23andMe and Ancestry, can now be used to identify at least 60 percent of all Americans with European Ancestry, regardless of whether they themselves have ever been tested. That's according to two recent analyses by genetics researchers, who expect databases like GEDMatch to grow so big in the next few years that it will be possible to find anyone from just their DNA, even if they haven't voluntarily put it in the public domain.

""You can't claw back the profile of your third cousin once removed who you don't even know exists,"" says Erin Murphy, a law professor at New York University Law School and an expert on familial DNA searches. If someone gets ensnared in a long-range familial search, she says, they're going to have very little legal recourse. ""These searches throw into sharp relief how current privacy protections under the 4th Amendment are insufficient to contend with what technologies are available to police in 2018.""

There's not a lot of data yet on whether the general public believes police should have access to non-criminal genetic databases. But initial surveys suggest that the majority of Americans are most supportive of such searches when they're used to go after violent offenders. Approval drops from 80 percent to less than 40 percent for pursuing people who've committed nonviolent crimes.

As long as genetic genealogy remains resource-intensive, it's unlikely to be used to catch thieves or drug-dealers. But even that appears to be changing. As more people send in their spit to DNA testing companies and upload their results to GEDMatch, matches will become more frequent. Curtis Rogers, the website's 80-year-old co-creator, says the site has grown by about 200,000 profiles since it changed its terms in May. And its search capabilities just got more powerful. Last week, Rogers' team of retired computer engineers rolled out an update that will let people see more matches with even more distant relatives. They also added a tool he calls ""revolutionary"" that will help sleuths decide if a small piece of DNA is a real match or just noise. Since the website's skeletal staff are mostly volunteers, the effort has taken about two years. But now that it's done, Rogers says they can start thinking about how to transform their hobby site, which resembles a Web 1.0 Wiki, into something more professional -- including adding backups and beefing up security. ""We want to make sure it's something that is around for the long term,"" he says."

The first information report, filed on court orders, also names her mother and an uncle. The case was registered against the three on a complaint by the father of another rape accused, who is in jail, said senior police officer Harish Kumar on Thursday.

He said complainant had alleged that the survivor, her uncle and mother had procured a forged age certificate to implicate his son Shubham in the rape case, said Kumar.

The police said the case was registered against the family members under sections related to cheating and forgery.

The complainant had moved the court saying the school transfer certificate, purportedly made by Raebareli school and produced as the age certificate, was forged to frame his son, police said.

The survivor's uncle is presently in jail in connection with another case. The complainant's wife and son are accused in the rape case and have been in jail since April along with the main accused, BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

Sengar, a four-time lawmaker from Unnao, was charged by the CBI with raping the girl at his residence in Makhi village on June 4 last year.

The girl was again abducted and raped by a separate group of accused, allegedly including complainant's son Shubhan Singh, his driver Naresh Tiwari and one Brijesh Yadav between June 11 and June 20, 2017.

The complainant, Harpal Singh alleged that the rape survivor had an affair with a man named Awadesh Tewari, with whom she had eloped in September 2017, and returned sometime later.

After she returned, her family had begun persuading his son Shubham to marry her, the complaint said.

When Shubham refused to marry her, the family filed a case against him and his mother on charges of kidnapping as well as various offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, alleged Haripal Singh.

He also alleged that the rape survivor's family had forged her age certificate with a fake date of birth, purportedly issued from a school in Raebareli as proof.

Both the education department official and the school principal have denied signing the certificate, Haripal Singh claimed.

The Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government's ""inaction"" against the party lawmaker in the case had drawn scathing criticism from the Allahabad High Court.

The state government had subsequently transferred the case to the CBI nearly 10 months after the alleged crime took place."

In Kerala, the Supreme Court judgement in the Sabarimala temple case on 28 September may have kindled a similar sense of deja vu among some. Three months on, the furore over granting women access to the centuries-old hilltop shrine refuses to die down.

Women of menstrual age had always been banned, at least in theory, from entering the Sabarimala shrine, perched on top of a hill surrounded by a lush green forest in South Kerala's Pathanamthitta district.

The ban was apparently in keeping with the wishes of the celibate deity of the temple. The Supreme Court, however, ruled that the ban was unconstitutional, violative of gender rights and equality, and ordered that women of all ages be allowed access.

The judgement almost immediately sparked protests -- so much so that the brotherhood and political coexistence that Kerala witnessed during the century's worst floods in August seems like an illusion now.

The pilgrim's burden

Sindujan, from Kerala's Palakkad district, went to Sabarimala at a particularly fraught time this year.

It was in October and, on the same day, Rehana Fathima, an activist claiming to be a devotee, was trying to visit the shrine. She was wearing riot gear and had police escort. This angered Sindujan. He joined a mob of protestors who physically blocked Fathima on her way up the hill, forcing her to abandon the trip and return home.

The day became a flashpoint in the post-judgement life of Sabarimala pilgrims, who subsequently blocked about two dozen women who have tried to enter the shrine.

""My eyes welled up, I have seen this woman as part of a 'Kiss of love' protest (a popular protest against moral policing held in Kerala in 2014),"" Sindujan said. ""Are these the kind of women who should visit Sabarimala? They are playing with the light of our life.""

Sindujan was, in fact, articulating a burden that has fallen upon every Sabarimala pilgrim. The annual pilgrimage to Sabarimala is already an arduous affair. Pilgrims renounce material comfort, abstain from sex and alcohol and trek miles through the forest carrying a bulky bag of offerings to the deity.

Given the political polarization, one more factor was now added to the mix: a visit to this pilgrim site now has also become a political statement of sorts for many. Sabarimala pilgrims are now part of a loyal group that loathe those that support women's access to the shrine. Sindujan, 30, sees them as sinners, and is worried about the sanctity of his beloved temple if women are allowed to enter.

He has been dogged in his persistence, having visited the shrine for the 23rd time this year, in the face of hardship. Sindujan lost his right hand in an industrial accident and ekes out a living by selling lottery tickets. Many relish the challenges of these penances, some see it as necessary to attain salvation, and others see it as an opportunity to be seen as a good person.

The pilgrim's guide

In Bunyan's book, the pilgrim is assisted by several colourful characters -- Evangelist, Faithful, Goodwill, Gatekeeper, Interpreter and so on -- who provide the moral boost and support for him to finish the spiritual journey and achieve salvation.

The Sabarimala pilgrim is also not alone in his fight.

Midway through the trek to the hilltop in October, two activists of Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party, stand as guides for pilgrims. They were ferried by the party, like thousands of others, to block women, they say. As soon as Fathima tried to enter, they said, they inspired the mob to chant ""Swamiye Saranam Ayyappa"", a devotional chant that now acts as a dog whistle for protesters, and brings on the righteous anger that animates them to break the law.

The first of the two, who requested not to be named, says his wife just gave birth to a baby boy, and is still in hospital. But he does not want to go home anytime soon. He is enamoured by the sort of hero's welcome his Facebook selfies from the hill are generating.

""My village folks have asked me to tell them in advance when I'm returning so that they can give me a proper reception,"" he said. ""If only we can drag this until the election.""

His zeal, mirroring that of an evangelist, highlights how the Bharatiya Janata Party has made Sabarimala the chosen battleground in the only state, apart from smaller north-eastern ones, in which it does not have an elected member of Parliament.

Beyond the hill, several others are also jostling to be seen as supporting the pilgrims; the most faithful would be the leaders of the Congress, Kerala's main opposition party, who have sworn to be faithful to the pilgrims, despite the party president Rahul Gandhi explicitly telling reporters he favours the entry of women.

The pilgrim's crusade is also supported by the Nair Service Society, the organization of upper caste Nairs in Kerala. But the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam, the other major caste organization, belonging to the lower caste Ezhava community, has a blow-hot-blow-cold approach to the protests.

Incidentally, both organizations have their roots in ending caste-based oppression by higher castes in the name of religion.

Then there are the gatekeepers, the head priest Kandararu Mohanaru and the members of the Pandalam royal family who are associated with the temple's rituals and command respect from devotees, who have threatened to shut down the temple if women were allowed entry.

The interpreters, such as right-wing activist and motivational speaker Rahul Easwar and his wife Deepa Rahul Easwar (Easwar is also related to the head priest), are perhaps the most visible faces of the crusade

In debate after debate, from local TV channels to national news studios, they help explain how allowing women is against Lord Ayyappa's will. But their detractors charge them with sophistry and speaking without a deep understanding of the land or the religion. Appearing in a quiz show on Sunday, Deepa, for instance, was asked which taluka Sabarimala falls in. She didn't know.

Met by atheist

A leader from Idukki district of Kerala's ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) is busy making arrangements to ferry hundreds of women to a neighbouring district on 1 January.

They will be joining about one million other women to build a human wall in a show of strength ""against the ongoing attempts to reverse Kerala to the dark ages"", as chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan puts it.

As the Sabarimala pilgrim walked through the forest valley after the apex court judgement, he encountered his biggest nemesis in Vijayan.

The Communist -- who was, ironically, until recently criticized within the Left for alleged right-leaning tendencies -- has been trying to convince pilgrims to give up the crusade and return the hill to peace. The pilgrims, of course, refused. The pilgrim finds strength in quoting the scripture, even as Vijayan holds rallies across the state peppering his speeches with the history of Kerala's progressive religious and caste movements, which he terms ""renaissance history"".

He also persecuted the faces of the crusade, local BJP leaders, and arrested them one by one.

The pilgrims are also ridiculed in the town by Left historians, speakers, writers and even seers. For instance, Swami Sandeepananda Giri, a Left activist-turned-popular spiritual guru, questions some of the basic concepts on which the debate is founded, such as that the deity ""Ayyappa"" is a bachelor. In his speeches and television appearances, he cites Hindu scriptures to state that the bachelor deity Ayyappa is a later creation, who is believed to have merged with the ""Dharma Sastha"" deity form who is said to have two wives.

According to P.K. Sajeev, founder of the Aikya Mala Araya Maha Sabha, Ayyappan is a tribal god who had nothing against women visiting, but was a hapless victim of Brahminisation of the temple and its rituals, which subsequently ousted not only menstrual age women but also the tribal community from the shrine.

Despite this, the Sabarimala pilgrims continue their fight in the apex court, expecting the court to admit a plea for review of the judgement on 14 January.

The Sabarimala story is also a tale of the gradual unravelling of the Indian secular state, experts say.

The turbulent situation in Sabarimala can be viewed as an example of a conflict between religious freedom and the regulatory powers of the state, according to Sumantra Bose, a professor of international and comparative politics at the London School of Economics (LSE).

""India is a secular state with no state religion. Of course, the actual reality, the political reality has shifted over time... (but this secular state concept) is not based on a measured and deliberate separation between the church and state, sort of a bedrock of the Western version of the secularism,"" Bose said while giving a talk on his new book, Secular States, Religious Politics: India, Turkey, and the Future of Secularism at LSE on 23 October.

The Indian state, he said, is self-invested with vast powers over religion and religious matters. ""So the Indian Constitution assures religious liberty for all, freedom of faith profession, practise, propagation, but always subject to public order, morality and health. And of course the ultimate interpreter of what constitutes or does not constitute public order, morality and health is the state and those at the helm at the state.""

What follows from this is the state constantly and inevitably intervening in the religious domain, giving rise to allegations of interference.

In the process, the state should also not give preferential treatment or discriminate against various religious sects, which is much easier said than done, said Bose.

In 2019, such debates are bound to grow louder, as governments try to piggyback to power on the rise of majoritarian forces. With general elections due by May 2019, the central government is already facing pressure from within to commit to building a Ram temple in Ayodhya in place of the Babri mosque, despite the matter being before the apex court.

Both religion and constitution are made out of rules and customs, and come to life upon their faithful observance. Both are built on a ground of social mores. How does one resolve a conflict where the two battle for an upper hand over what constitutes right and wrong?"

The government has said that school principals will be held responsible in case of a mishap while ferrying children in such vans.

In a circular issued by the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) on Wednesday, the principals or heads of schools (HOSs) were asked to ""strictly"" comply with the norms. ""This is to bring to the notice of principals/HoSs of all the private recognised unaided schools functioning within the territory of Delhi that a large number of school vans are operating illegally for ferrying students between their homes and schools without taking adequate safeguards towards safety of school children. It is also known that these vans are primarily hired by the parents. The Delhi traffic police and transport department have tried to impress upon the concerned school principals to brief parents not to use these school vehicles, which are not following norms,"" said DoE director Sanjay Goel in the circular.

It, however, added that the school principals were responsible for the safety of children. ""The concerned school administration shall be held responsible for non-compliance of directions by the school vans/cabs being used to ferry students of their schools, especially in cases where such vehicles (owned by schools or hired by parents) meet with accidents resulting in injury or death of the school children. The necessary action shall also be taken against the defaulting schools in case such an unfortunate accident happens,"" Goel said in the circular.

The move comes a month after an eight-year-old student of a private school was killed and nine other children were injured when a speeding goods carrier hit an overloaded private school van in north Delhi's Dheerpur. The incident had prompted the Delhi government to ask the transport department to formulate a fresh school cab policy by January 2019.

As per the Supreme Court guidelines, school vehicles should follow several norms -- such as having 'on school duty' written prominently on the back and the front, horizontal grilles on windows, first-aid boxes, fire extinguishers, reliable locks, experienced drivers and at least one conductor. The speed of the vehicle should not exceed 50km/h.

Meanwhile, the committee of private recognised and unaided schools in Delhi termed the government's order as 'impractical'.

""How is it even possible for the schools to monitor thousands of private vehicles ferrying students across the city. We take complete responsibility of children at the school campuses. But how can we keep a tab on all the modes of transport parents are choosing over school vans.

The sequence of events had started Thakur's family had approached the Supreme Court stating that he was being tortured in Patiala jail. Thakur was shifted to Patiala jail on the directions of the apex court, which asked the Punjab government to look into allegations of the sex scandal accused.

After that the ADGP had visited the Patiala prison on December 6 and submitted a report with the state jail minister, stating that Kapoor was running an extortion racket from inside the jail. Chaudhary had put on record that gangster Gaurav Sharma, alias Goru Bachcha, in connivance with then jail superintendent Kapoor tortured Thakur.

The report stated Thakur was shifted to the barrack where gangsters Goru Bacha, Amit Bhura, Bholu Havelian and Kali were lodged at around 4am on November 11. They allegedly tortured him for the next three days and during this time, the CCTV cameras inside the jail were shut down. The gangsters managed to extort ₹15 lakh as ransom from his family member. The exchange of money took place in Delhi where gangsters' aide Raman collected the money from Thakur's daughter Nikita.

OCCU was ordered to start a detailed probe into the matter and on December 17, DSP Bikramjit Brar visited the jail to collect the first line of evidence. On December 22, contestable Kuldeep Singh entered the barrack of Thakur and threatened him against cooperating with the investigators.

Three days later, Thakur filed a written complaint with the jail superintendent who ordered a separate probe into the incident, which was conducted by deputy superintendent of the jail. In his report, the deputy jail superintendent confirmed that warder Kuldeep had issued threats to Thakur.

Jail superintendent Jaspal Singh confirmed that Kuldeep had been suspended after an internal probe.

Meanwhile, the report submitted by ADGP had put on record that of the ₹15 lakh extorted from Thakur, Kapur took ₹6 lakh. Besides, Thakur had also promised the gangsters to give them a flat and 15-20 acres of land in Muzaffarpur.

However, Kapoor, who had been transferred to Patiala jail school following the ADGP report, has already denied all these allegations."

Armed with banners decrying the facility, the protesters -- including women and children -- sought the relocation of the station during a peaceful, hourlong demonstration at Phadke Houd Chowk.

The protesters said that there was no need for a Metro station in the densely populated area and urged the authorities not to acquire properties to facilitate the station's construction.

According to the residents, about 250 families and 30 shops will have to relocate to make way for the project. ""The authorities must consider the sentiments of the local citizens,"" the agitators said.

Mohan More, a local resident, who coordinated Thursday's agitation, said the local residents were not opposed to the Metro project. He said they only do not want the station at Kasba Peth, as it would cause displacement of families. About 250 families and 30 shops could be affected, he said.

The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation (MahaMetro), which is executing the project, pegged that number at 197 families and 28 commercial establishments.

""The Metro rail will run from Civil Court towards Kasba Peth. The proposed Civil Court station is nearby. People can easily walk there or even to the next station, which is coming up in the Mandai area. There is no need to build a station at Kasba Peth, which is a completely residential area without much commercial activity. In addition, there are old religious structures in the area,"" More said.

The Kasba Peth Metro station is part of the Shivajinagar-Swargate underground Metro line. MahaMetro has yet to begin the physical work on the underground stretch.

Suresh Jain, another resident who also owns a shop in the area, said the station was earlier proposed in Budhwar Peth area, but has since been moved to Kasba Peth. ""Citizens are not in favour of the relocation,"" Jain said.

Local Shiv Sena corporator Vishal Dhanawade extended his support to the protest.

Arvind Zambre, another resident, said that historical establishments in Kasba Peth are likely to be affected.

'Rehab plan in place'

MahaMetro said that it has chalked out a plan for the rehabilitation of the families and establishments that stand to be affected by the project. The officials have already submitted a proposal to PMC, seeking plots on which Dadoji Konddev school and Bhau Kotwal Mandai stand -- in the same neighbourhood -- for the rehabilitation project. MahaMetro further said they were holding individual discussions with the affected families, wherein they address their doubts and explain the project.

YALAMBOJOCH, Guatemala (Reuters) - Between heavy sobs, Catarina Alonzo explained that when her husband left Guatemala to try to reach the United States, they hoped taking their 8-year-old son would make it easier for the pair to get in. Instead, the boy fell ill and died.

Detained on the U.S. border, Felipe Gomez Alonzo died late on Christmas Eve in a New Mexico hospital a few weeks after setting off with his father, becoming the second Guatemalan child to die this month while in U.S. custody.

The two deaths have led to increased criticism of the Trump administration's hardline stance on illegal immigration, as well as fresh scrutiny of why some migrants from Central America travel with children on the long, dangerous road north.

Speaking at her home in a mountainous region of western Guatemala, Catarina Alonzo said neighbours had told the family that taking a child would provide her husband with a way in.

""Lots of them have gone with children and managed to cross, even if they're held for a month or two. But they always manage to get across easily,"" she told Reuters in an interview.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has yet to give an official cause of death for the boy, prompting Democratic lawmakers to intensify calls for an investigation.

The Department of Homeland Security, which says that Felipe Gomez Alonzo and 7-year-old Jakelin Caal, who died on Dec. 8, were the first children to die in CBP custody in a decade, this week said it would step up medical checks of migrant children to try to prevent any more deaths.

Alonzo, an indigenous Maya and native speaker of Chuj, has little Spanish and communicated through a translator. Wearing a sweatshirt and a purple dress, she spoke outside her hut in Yalambojoch, a village of about 1,000 people near the Mexican border.

She related how her son and his father, Agustin, an agricultural worker, had left in early December to find work in the United States to pay off debts. The two also hoped the boy would get a better education in the United States, she said.

Still, Alonzo said her husband had doubts and at one point decided he did not want to take the boy. But that upset the boy, so they resolved he should go.

Alonzo's sobs could be heard for minutes outside the house before she came out to be interviewed. Afterwards she went back inside to a tiny altar she had adorned with three photos of the boy that a local school teacher had printed out for her.

The altar stood to one side of a room with cement walls that serves as a bedroom and living area for Alonzo and her three surviving children. Adjoining it was a kitchen with a dirt floor and wooden walls.

Her husband remains in U.S. custody.

""NOW OR NEVER""

Marta Larra, a spokeswoman for Guatemala's Foreign Ministry, said smugglers known as ""coyotes"" often encourage migrants to take children as a form of ""visa."" Many coyotes, she noted, are trusted by migrant families, so their word carries weight.

But Lucas Perez, the mayor of Yalambojoch, said some coyotes are only interested in ripping off people. Still, for many migrants trying to cross the U.S. border, taking a child along was the ""only option,"" he told Reuters.

Describing migration from the area as ""constant,"" Perez estimated about 200 people from the tiny village live in the United States.

Agustin Gomez, the boy's father, has two brothers in the United States he hoped to meet, his wife said.

Next to her hut, labourers worked on a two-story concrete house with a twin-gabled, tiled roof - evidence of the money coming back from the United States, the mayor said.

Under U.S. law, families from countries that do not border the United States cannot be immediately deported, and because of a longstanding legal settlement, there are restrictions on how long U.S. authorities can detain migrant children.

As a result, families with children are often released to await an immigration court hearing, which can be scheduled well into the future due to ballooning backlogs.

U.S. President Donald Trump has tried to reverse the policy, which he calls ""catch and release,"" but has been blocked by lawsuits in federal court.

His Democratic opponents have seized on the deaths of the two Guatemalan children to attack his policies. On Thursday, Senator Dianne Feinstein urged the Senate to hold a hearing in the new year on how children are treated in U.S. custody.

In the meantime, Trump's insistence on building a southern border wall has given coyotes a fresh argument to promote migration, Larra said.

""According to interviews (with migrants), the coyotes are saying 'it's now or never' because the wall is going to be built, and it won't be possible to cross,"" she said.

With Simmba, he also has the challenge to make Ranveer Singh, the darling of the classes, into a mass hero. He also has to establish Sara Ali Khan as the nest IT girl in the industry, while showing the world that he can make a blockbuster without the Khans and Devgns. So does Simmba lives up to that task? Somewhat, yes. Is it as entertaining as the movie it tries to replicate, Singham? Not exactly! Ranveer Singh Speaking About Deepika Padukone Watching Simmba is The Cheesiest Thing Ever! (Watch Video)

Sangram Bhalerao aka Simmba (Ranveer Singh) has grown up in the same town as Bajirao Singham (Ajay Devgn), which is Shivgad. While he shares the same professional aspirations of being a cop as Singham, the orphaned Simmba looks at it as the means to earn power and money. When he is transferred as the inspector to Miramar police station in Goa, he thinks of the opportunity to make more money, by being in the employ of the local don, Dhuruva Ranade (Sonu Sood). There, he also falls for a pretty Shagun (Sara Ali Khan), a girl who runs tiffin service next to the police station.

Simmba's malpractices don't go down well with his honest subordinate (Ashutosh Rana), but for Simmba, the only crime that he can't stand is those against the women. And when Ranade's brothers cross that line, the Singham in Simmba wakes up.

How do you review a movie that plays exactly as you imagine it to be? Simmba is a film that stays within your expectations and challenges you to write what you want about it. For, unlike that last week's so-called dud, this one doesn't care for reviews; it cares for the number of cheers and whistles that the front-benchers contribute to its mass moments.

At the beginning of a song sequence, Karan Johar pops up out of nowhere and sighs about getting another remix. And immediately, the ""Aankh Marey"" song begins and we feel like the makers are poking fun at the audience being fed the same stuff again and again. Simmba is exactly that!

Apart from a big star cameo in the end (not the one, you think), Simmba goes through exactly the same motions as the trailer. Everything is predictable, be it the placement of the songs or the fight scenes or character transformations. Where Simmba falters big time is that it struggles to step out of Singham's shadow. Sure, What's interesting is that Simmba borrows all the flaws from the first Singham, but very few of the redeeming factors.

Like that other film, the first half of Simmba is filled with unwanted comic sequences, that barely register a chuckle, and a romantic track so needless that it is contained within the first act itself. The female lead, more or less, serves only to fulfil the hero's romantic aspirations, while offering one or two motivational lines.

What makes Simmba distinct is that the hero is shown as a morally ambiguous cop, though Salman Khan has done something similar with better conviction in the Dabbang series. But at least, it made Ranveer's character different from that of Devgn's. There is even an observation that Simmba is like that because he had no parents to guide him (unlike Singham who belonged to a privileged family). For a movie that lacks nuances, this was a nice touch.

Things fare slightly better, post-interval when the conflict of the film is brought in after a character is raped and killed. The incident pricks the conscience of our protagonist enough to rebel against his unlawful master, never mind that a couple of sequences back, he allowed the same goon to kidnap a school girl to blackmail her grandfather. And once the transformation of Simmba as the upright cop is complete, then there is no shunning away from being a Singham replica.

I appreciate Shetty wanting to pay tribute to his own movie, just like Nana Patekar worshipping himself in Bluffmaster. We all live in a self-centred world, so why not celebrate some narcissism? Even Rajkumar Hirani does the same with Sanju. But what about some uniqueness?

Towards the end, even Simmba drops the pretence of being a wannabe. Ranveer Singh wages a losing battle to make the proceedings lively, so Shetty brings in the man himself to save the film. Ajay Devgn as Singham makes a seetimaar entry (a scene that was spoilt by the trailer), even if everything about that sequence feels random. After the dust settles down, and Simmba thanks Singham for handling everything properly, I was curious to know this was Shetty's way of hinting that Simmba was the Singham sequel he couldn't make. BTW, there is one more star cameo towards the end of Simmba that is a tease of a film that Shetty is making next year. Also, not to mention the hint of Golmaal 5! Simmba: Whoa! Not Just Ajay Devgn, Even Akshay Kumar Has a Cameo in Ranveer Singh-Sara Ali Khan's Film.

And then, there is the whole sexual assault aspect and how the movie simply trivialises this crime to glorify the hero. It's incredulous that Rohit Shetty and team uses the horrifying Nirbhaya incident just to add drama to the proceedings, with even a needless placard protest also brought in. It would have been forgivable if Simmba does justice to the issue and works towards a solution. But this is a mainstream movie that wants to appease to the generalist sentiments. Therefore, we have ludicrous court proceedings and red-tapism that inspire the protagonist, a cop himself, (and the movie) to determine that it is better to take the law in your own hands. And to think, we had a PINK coming out a couple of years back that handled this dilemma so brilliantly.

Moreover, in a movie about empowering women to be safe in our country, there isn't one strong female character, while the ones we have look upto Simmba to be their protector.

So where exactly did Rohit Shetty make Simmba work? The director still has the knack of creating powerful sequences and interesting supporting characters. The scene where Simmba dons the police uniform for the first time will make you clap, despite yourself (though the movie takes away Simmba's individuality by putting in the Singham theme).

Some of the scenes between Ranveer Singh and Ashutosh Rana are good, especially their camaraderie. I really wish there was more to do with Rana's character. He was the most upright cop in the whole film, and yet his honesty is looked down by his own family and is often made jokes of. And after Simmba's transformation, he has barely anything to do in the rest of the movie, save for being a catalyst in a crucial scene. The dialogues sometimes sparkle, sometimes doesn't. The overuse of Marathi dialogues may find it hard to appeal to the audiences outside Maharashtra.

The songs are pretty okay, though the picturisation is eye-pleasing. The background score is annoyingly blaring.

The Performances

If you have some liking towards Simmba, it is all because of Ranveer Singh's very trying performance. Though his Marathi accent is all over the place, Ranveer Singh infuses life in what is one of his weakest roles. You can't help but admire that enthusiastic energy in that man, when he suddenly sings 'Sandese aate hai' to mock his subordinate or screams his lungs out to make a point (the veins in his throat have got a lot of workout in the movie). Ranveer Singh has in him to be a massy hero, though I am not sure if Shetty and Johar trusted him enough to carry this film on his own.

Thank God for Kedarnath, for Sara Ali Khan is completely wasted that doesn't require her to do much except look pretty. Sonu Sood is his usual self as the villain of the piece, flexing biceps to show his meanness. Ashutosh Rana is too good, while Siddharth Jadhav delivers in an emotional sequence.

Watch Simmba for Ranveer Singh, if you are in love with his enthusiastic charm and unbridled energy. Apart from that, this clone of Singham offers very little to offer, other than being a nearly three-hour-long tease for three upcoming movies! I admire Rohit Shetty and Karan Johar (co-producer)for thinking out of the box and creating Singham-verse. Having said that, they would have done much favour to Ranveer if they didn't make Simmba, the Iron Man 2 of this universe!"

Raghu had earlier been arrested in connection with a robbery in Delhi's Lajpat Nagar police station area in an FIR registered on July 8, 2012, and was jailed for several years.

After being released on July 7 this year, he set up his own gang and started committing crime, the police said. The gang was mostly active in the police station areas of Sector 31, Surajkund, Sarai Khawaja, Sector 17 and Old Faridabad over the past five months.

All three are drug addicts and took to snatching to arrange money for drugs, they said. The accused would mostly chase and target women going to drop their children at the school bus stop or walking to the market or on the road in the evening.

The three would take turns to drive the motorcycle without a registration number to avoid the arrest.

The year began on a positive note with the government promising to draft non-governmental organisations and corporate houses into helping upgrade facilities in its schools. It maintained the momentum with a promise to enable 381 schools with wi-fi in March.

The introduction of QR codes in textbooks under the new syllabus was a hit with students who enjoyed the freedom of learning at their own pace.

The low point was when School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan announced at a meeting in December that the government was considering curtailing the syllabus as teachers were finding it difficult to complete. Incidentally, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has also suggested a reduction in the NCERT syllabus for Central Board of Secondary Education schools.

Though no final decision has been made yet, educationists wonder if all the good work done over the last two years will come undone if the State and Centre decide against the continuation of the present syllabus. It was not a great year though for higher education. Vice-chancellor appointments in State universities generated a lot of controversy with political parties venting their displeasure.

Corruption, allegations of favours to students in exchange for being pliant, searches by the Directorate of Anti-Vigilance and Corruption officials in houses and offices of V-Cs made headlines.

In February, the DVAC trapped Bharathiar University V-C A. Ganapathy, rendering the institute headless. In March, Anna University's former V-C M. Rajaram faced charges of corruption in the recruitment of teachers. The University was in the eye of the storm with several officials being accused of taking money and helping students pass exams.

In April, a scandal rocked the State with the leak of audio tapes of a college teacher urging students to do as expected by ""higher officials of the Madurai Kamaraj University"" in return for higher marks in their semester examinations, money and admission to higher-level courses in the university.

Political parties continued to target Governor-Chancellor Banwarilal Purohit and alleged that he had received favours in return for appointments. They objected to the appointment of candidates from other States as Vice-Chancellors to Dr. Ambedkar Law University and Anna University.

The situation became tense with MKU V-C P.P. Chellathurai seeking legal intervention. In June, the court threw out his appointment, leaving the University without a V-C, in less than a year since his appointment.

The situation has improved with the V-C search committee finalising a list of 10 persons for the post. In a couple of days the Governor is expected to announce a new V-C for MKU."

The plea alleged the name change was done without following due process and that it jeopardised the future of students by running the risk of de-recognition by CBSE.

The parents have petitioned against the management societies of all three schools -- in Ashok Vihar, Dwarka Sector 16 and Dwarka Sector 22 -- stating that the name change had been affected in the middle of the academic year without prior notification or consultation with them.

In November, Education Minister Manish Sisodia had told The Indian Express that while a school cannot be compelled to remain part of a franchise, it requires government approval to do so and that no prior application had been received from the three schools.

The Prudence schools are now operating with a new logo, signboards, ID cards and uniforms. According to Matharoo, the change was instituted keeping the best interests of students in mind. He said the schools would file their response in court: ""Only the name has been changed, which was done through unanimous resolutions of all three managing societies due to financial malpractices by Presidium. Everything else remains the same... We submitted our proposal for name change to the Directorate of Education soon after the circular was sent to parents, and the proposal is currently being processed.""

The court re-notified the matter for February 2019, and gave the respondents four weeks to file a counter affidavit.

""We are examining the legal aspects of both the proposal and parents' complaints... and the validity and precedent for post-facto approval in such cases,"" said Director of Education Sanjay Goel."

To begin with, Duntsch v. State, 2018 Tex. App. LEXIS 10131, 2018 WL 6445369 (Texas Ct. App. 5th Dist. Dec. 10, 2018), is an appeal from a criminal conviction. Since we have droned on incessantly about how our happiest days as a lawyer were spent prosecuting crooks, everyone on the blog knows that we have first dibs on criminal cases. In Duntsch, the issue was whether a criminal assault statute could apply to a case of medical malpractice. The Texas court ended up affirming a neurosurgeon's conviction for ""intentionally or knowingly causing serious bodily injury to an elderly individual while using or exhibiting a deadly weapon"" - the ""deadly weapon"" being his hands, surgical tools, and a medical implant. As described by the court, the defendant neurosurgeon comes across as not only incompetent, but also arrogant. Indeed, read a certain way, the court's recital of the facts of the case portrays a sociopath. Nevertheless, a criminal conviction for assault with a deadly weapon against an actual surgeon, no matter how bad the surgeon's conduct (and the court makes it sound bad bad bad bad), seems unprecedented.

We will confine ourselves to the facts in the Texas appellate decision, though this case has received extensive coverage. There is an article in D Magazine calling the defendant ""Dr. Death."" There are several accounts on the web. There is a multi-part podcast devoted to this extraordinary story. One of the themes running through these accounts is the alleged failure of the medical system, in terms of credentialing, reporting, and med-mal limitations. The moral of the tale, so we are told, is that the criminal justice system was the last, best, necessary resort after other systems failed to protect patients. You can decide for yourself whether that moral is fitting here.

The particular offense involved back surgery on an elderly woman. It is an understatement to say that the result was not the desired reduction of pain. Rather, the patient's pain dramatically increased. Even worse, the woman suffered from ""drop foot"" and incontinence. It appears that the defendant put the pedicle screw in exactly the wrong place. The surgery was a sequence of terrible errors. ""There were holes where they shouldn't be in the bone."" Further, there was testimony that the defendant was distracted during the surgery by the deteriorating condition of another back surgery patient, who subsequently died. The defendant got into an argument as to whether the other patient required a craniotomy. Meanwhile, the defendant's surgical technique for the patient in front of him on the operating table was, according to doctors and nurses present during the surgery, abominable. One doctor characterized the procedure as a ""catastrophic surgical misadventure.""

One of the eyewitnesses to the disastrous surgery was the device representative. We have written in the past ( here, for example) on whether the presence of a device representative during a surgery can present problems for the manufacturer in a product liability case. But here, the device representative's testimony was damning for the defendant doctor. The rep said that surgery was ""chaos from the beginning,"" that the pedicle screw erroneously was placed into soft tissue rather than bone, and that there was more bleeding during the operation than there should have been.

The jury heard not just about the subject surgery, and not just about the other back surgery that went fatally wrong and that distracted the defendant, but also about several other surgeries where the defendant committed awful malpractice. In one especially sad case, the defendant operated on old friend and managed to turn him into a quadriplegic. In another, a fellow surgeon described the defendant as operating at the level of first or second year neurosurgery resident. Multiple patients died from the defendant's treatment. Think of how this evidence of other catastrophic results played out at trial. Every day in the courtroom the jurors must have seen injured people using crutches, walkers, wheelchairs and worse. They must have also seen loved ones overcome with grief and anger. Evidence of other acts is powerful stuff. Sometimes it can be too powerful.

The evidence of other acts did not come only from victims. An office manager who worked for the defendant acknowledged that the defendant ""had an unusual number of bad outcomes"" compared to other doctors for whom she had worked. She also described an instance where the defendant had asked her to alter some medical records after the fact. Perhaps even worse, a nurse practitioner who was also an ex-girlfriend of the defendant was quizzed about some incendiary emails the defendant had sent her, including one where the defendant described himself as a ""stone-cold killer."" She did not interpret the email to reveal a criminal mind, but the jury was free to do so.

An expert doctor testified for the defense that the defendant's errors were ""known complications"" that a ""poorly-trained surgeon could do,"" and that have, in fact, occurred in the past. In other words, the defense added up to arguing that the defendant was an idiot but not quite a criminal.

After all the evidence rolled in, the jury convicted the defendant. The sentence was life imprisonment. Let that sink in for a moment.

The two key issues on appeal were whether the other terrible surgery results should have been admitted into evidence and, most fundamentally, whether the evidence was enough to support a finding of criminal intent on the part of the defendant. The two issues have a lot to do with one another, of course. As we said up top, the criminal statute applies to someone who ""intentionally or knowingly causes serious bodily injury"" to an elderly person. The state did not claim that the defendant actually intended to inflict harm on the patient. Consequently, the issue was one of knowledge. A person acts ""knowingly"" with respect to a result of his conduct if ""he is aware that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result."" The court concluded that a jury could reasonably find that the defendant was reasonably certain that his conduct would seriously injure his patient inasmuch as the defendant was aware of his recent track record of inflicting extremely rare and serious complications on his surgery patients, and was also told during the surgery in question that he was botching the operation.

The prior surgeries came into evidence not merely to show that the defendant was a rotten surgeon, but to show that the defendant had the knowledge of those results in his head, and that such knowledge added up to the requisite culpable state of mind (in law school we learned to call it mens rea). As the prosecution contended, the other acts here were contextual, not extraneous. The court agreed, and held that the other surgeries were properly admitted per Fed. R. Evidence 404(b). They were similar to the surgery at issue, and they shed light on the defendant's state of mind.

The defendant offered a pretty good argument that there is something wrong with the fact that the evidence of the surgery in question took up less than a day of trial, while the evidence of the prior surgeries took up another twelve days. But the court reasoned that the prior surgeries were probative on a highly disputed point (the defendant's mental state). Moreover, the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury that the prior surgeries were to be considered ""only ... in determining intent, knowledge, motive, absence of mistake or lack of action of the defendant, if any, alleged in the indictment in this case and for no other purpose.""

The appellate court also rejected the defendant's argument that the ""stone-cold killer"" email was substantially more prejudicial than probative. The prosecutor certainly emphasized that email during closing argument. We can understand why the prosecutor would do that, but use of evidence in closing argument makes it that much harder to argue harmless error. The prosecutor's bet paid off, given that the appellate court did not find error. We probably would have gone the more prudent route and kept mum about it in argument, trusting the jurors to seize upon it during deliberations. Maybe that's why we are now a hypercautious civil defense hack.

One of the three appellate judges in Duntsch dissented, arguing that the evidence at trial did not prove the defendant's ""knowledge."" The dissenter believed that evidence of the prior bad surgeries at most showed what the defendant should have known, not what he actually knew, about his poor surgical skills. One passage in the dissent is particularly persuasive: ""Appellant was not on trial for being a doctor generally or, more to the point, for being a doctor who lacked adequate training or technique - neither of those things is a crime. And, criminal trials are not reverse class actions."" The dissent makes other useful points, and suggests that the evidence could have supported a finding of recklessness, which would have been a lesser offense. But the dissent was only a dissent, so the majority's affirmance of the conviction on the most serious offence charged held sway. Interestingly, the dissent agreed with the majority that there is no broad policy reason to exempt physicians from the reach of the criminal code when medical malpractice sinks to the defined level of culpability.

Duntsch is an extreme case. It is a memento mori painted on the edge of tort law, reminding us of what can happen when things go horrifically wrong."

Events over the past few years have prompted many to revisit the idea of individual freedom. Indeed, not just in India, but elsewhere too, the idea of individual freedom is under intense scrutiny. Are governments across the world increasingly posing a threat to liberty? By corollary, are fascist policies and rhetoric on the rise?

Persons with a liberal bent of mind, who prize individual freedoms like free speech, gender and racial equality, are especially troubled, for our country appears to be at a juncture where fundamental notions of modern India are under existential threat.

One particular freedom that has come under fire is the freedom of practising one's own religion. Personal freedom is very often associated with secularism, which, as received from the Western canon, is the separation of church from state. Sometimes secularism is also seen as a negation of religion completely. Indeed, many religious leaders taught that secular people do not believe in gods. But in my view, even if you are a temple-going Hindu or a devout Muslim, you can still be secular.

Unfortunately, those of us who value religious freedom have been disillusioned by multiple governments once too often. The current BJP-led government has no pretensions about its dislike for the secular idea. Even those governments that proudly flaunt the label of ""secularism"" have subjected us to their non-secular realpolitik. Take the politics of Rajiv Gandhi, for instance, often touted as a ""secular"" Prime Minister: his government not only overturned the Shah Bano judgment, but also banned Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses and had the locks of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya opened to Hindus. Every political party, including the Congress and the BJP, has played communal politics with everyone in India -- Hindu, Muslim, minorities -- in the search for pliable vote banks.

In contrast, an exhibition of true ""secularism"" would be open-ended, either agnostic or, at the other extreme, in a country like India where faith is so central, multi-religious. Most importantly, at its heart, true secularism would be driven by universal values of truth, compassion and equality, which are fundamental values that straddle all religions.

In 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Yuval Noah Harari captures the essence of these values beautifully. Truth, not to be confused with belief, has no sole custodian. Truth is based on observation, evidence, and inference, and is accessible to all. Compassion comes from an understanding of suffering: a compassionate person does not kill not because their faith tells them not to, but because they know that killing causes immense suffering. And the universal value of equality comes from a recognition of both truth and compassion, empowering people to never substitute ""uniqueness"" with ""superiority"". Everyone may be unique in their own way, but they are all still equally unique -- no one being more specially so than the other. Ultimately, we cannot find truth, or learn compassion, or appreciate equality if we have no freedom to think, to question, to seek, to find these for ourselves. These freedoms are, ultimately, the most valuable. Recognising these freedoms was central to the politics of Mahatma Gandhi. Sadly, our leaders since have either forgotten or chosen to turn a blind eye to these ideas completely.

What can we do to change this? We need not look to foreign shores or to long-forgotten pasts. We only need to open India's nearly 70-year-old liberal manifesto. The Constitution contains all the declarations essential to a nation that preserves individual liberties. It is for us to protect it from neglect and disrepair.

It was B.R. Ambedkar, the key driver of the Constituent Assembly, who said: ""The assertion by the individual of his own opinions and beliefs, his own independence and interest as over and against group standards... is the beginning of all reform."" These ideas also find their way into the Constitution.

Even as the Constitution was being written, even as the leaders of the independence movement were negotiating for our freedom, Hindutva forces present at the time -- the days of the advent of the Hindu Mahasabha, of Veer Savarkar and B.S. Moonje -- were suspicious of secular ideas. They were, instead, great admirers of Hitler and Mussolini, with Moonje even going to Italy to meet the latter, and Savarkar justifying Hitler's treatment of Jews.

This suspicion continues amongst the legatees of the Hindu Mahasabha, in their mistrust of the Indian Constitution, for it is this document borrowed from Western ideals, they believe, that obstructs the idea of the Hindu Rashtra. In today's India, as a result, the most liberal document that we have, the Constitution, is at risk.

In his new book, How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them, Yale University philosophy professor Jason Stanley identifies 10 characteristics that define fascist political movements. For example: ""Fascism always promises to return us to a mythic past."" Similarly, fascist politicians use propaganda, for example, about anti-corruption campaigns, even when they are transparently corrupt. Another aspect is anti-intellectualism, for the ""enemy of fascism is equality,"" and the target of such anti-intellectual campaigns are places of learning, like universities. How can the educated elite know anything about anything, the fascist believes. Only the mythical ""common man"" can know what is right; note the emphasis on ""man"", which includes no women, or racial and sexual minorities. The similarities do not end there. Unlike liberal democracies, based on freedom and equality, fascist regimes posit the dominant group's interests as the ultimate, unquestionable truth. The dominant group is also always the victim of the situation. They rely on conspiracy theories to justify calls to power. And most tellingly, fascist politicians promise a law and order regime designed not to seek out offenders, but to criminalise outliers, who are usually ethnic, religious or sexual minorities. Professor Stanley has the U.S. in mind, but surely there is some resonance closer home.

Today, we live in an India where we are told what we can and cannot eat, what we can and cannot watch, what we can and cannot speak about, and who we can or cannot marry. Dissent, particularly in universities and public spaces, is being curbed. Sloganeering and flag raising have become tests for nationalism. Journalists are shot dead at point blank range for the views they hold and propagate. Not long ago, the police arrested five political activists essentially for thought crimes and taking up the cause of the tribals. More recently, when actor Naseeruddin Shah expressed legitimate concerns about growing vigilantism, his views were blown out of proportion, and misunderstood as an expression of disloyalty to the country. Even public institutions like the central bank have not been spared. A school of thought appears to have gained prominence in India which believes that everything can be solved by violence, and that it is always better to have power concentrated in a few men.

As a judge, naturally, I wonder if the courts will save the Constitution. I am honestly sceptical about this. Although the Supreme Court has delivered some wonderful judgments recently, can the court fully play out its role as the ultimate defender of the Constitution? The past record of the judiciary in testing times is not very encouraging, if we think of the Emergency. New allegations that the former Chief Justice of India (CJI) was perhaps being ""remote controlled"" do not invite much confidence either.

A few other things trouble me too: our present CJI, before taking office, publicly lectured about independent judges and noisy journalists. Just recently, the judicial system allowed a journalist in Odisha to remain in jail for over a month for making certain remarks about the Sun Temple in Konark. Our Supreme Court even refused to grant him bail, reportedly remarking that if one's life were in danger, what better place was there than to stay in jail. When the court is angered about the publication of information pertaining to the working of critical public institutions like the Central Bureau of Investigation on grounds of confidentiality, one cannot help but worry.

All this has made me less optimistic about the judiciary doing its bit. Ultimately, it is the people who will protect the Constitution, and all of the wisdom it contains about personal liberties and individual freedoms. Prof Stanley phrases this appropriately when he says, ""The ordinary citizen [must] stand up and loudly confront people who engage in... fascist rhetoric and not be afraid. Those millions of acts of individual bravery, if we can stitch together, will save us."" This is a time for individual acts of bravery. These are what will save us from a dangerous future."

In a fresh twist to a rape case allegedly involving BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an FIR has been lodged on court orders against the victim, her mother and an uncle for producing a forged age certificate to prove she was a minor.

The court ordered registration of a case against the three on a complaint by the father of another rape accused Shubham, who is in jail, said SP Harish Kumar on Thursday.

He said complainant Harpal Singh had alleged that the victim, her uncle and mother had procured a forged age certificate to implicate his son Shubham in the rape case, said Mr. Kumar.

The police said the case was registered at the Makhi police station on court's December 17 order against the family members for various alleged offences of cheating and forgery.

Complainant Harpal Singh had moved the court saying the school transfer certificate, purportedly made by a Raebareli school and produced as the age certificate, was forged to frame his son, police said.

The victim's uncle is presently in jail in connection with another case.

Harpal Singh's wife Shashi and son Shubham are accused in the rape case and have been in jail since April along with the main accused, BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

Sengar, a four-time MLA, was charged by the CBI with raping the girl at his residence in Makhi village on June 4 last year.

The girl was again abducted and raped by a separate group of accused, allegedly including Harpal Singh's son Shubhan Singh, his driver Naresh Tiwari and one Brijesh Yadav between June 11 and June 20, 2017.

But in his complaint, Harpal Singh alleged that the victim had an affair with a man named Awadesh Tewari, with whom she had eloped in September 2017, only to return sometime later.

After her return, her family had begun persuading his son Shubham to marry her, alleged Harpal Singh in his complaint.

When Shubham refused to marry her, the family filed a case against him and his mother on charges of kidnapping as well as various offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, alleged Haripal Singh.

He also alleged that the victim's kin had forged her age certificate with a fake date of birth, purportedly issued from a school in Raebareli as proof.

The certificate purportedly had the signatures of the Basic Shiksha Adhikari of the district and the school principal.

Harpal Singh claimed both the education department official and the school principal have denied signing the certificate."

The Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party had pressed for a judicial inquiry into the encounter, the issue echoed in the Parliament as well. Professors and students at the Jamia Milia University found support in the left-of-centre intelligentsia and staged protests on a national scale until the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) eventually cleared the police of any violations of rights. The broader impact of an incident like this goes beyond the profile of the accused and the procedures of investigation. It impacts the social identity of a community who is then suspected even more of having pan-Islamic leanings that can threaten constitutional equilibriums. The question is, what does the local administration do to repair the reading of such an incident and the way it dents the morale of the neighbourhood where it takes place. The first and lasting interpretation of such an investigation and arrest in the immediate neighbourhood is that the accused have been framed, and through them, the entire social milieu they belonged to is being condemned.

Jafrabad, from where the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested four young men on Wednesday suspecting they were part of a module of the Islamic State, was no different. The area falls in North East Delhi's Seelampur constituency. Here, the percentage of Muslims is 44.19 percent compared to 12.66 percent in all of Delhi and the literacy rate is 74.20 percent compared to 81.57 per cent for Delhi.

Fleece and goose leather jackets in greys and blues and browns hang off hooks in slim lanes of Jafrabad, known for its jacket market, with broken drains at random intervals. Hafeez Ahmad Suhail, whose son Mufti Mohammad Suhail was arrested from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh in the wee hours of Wednesday, sat on the edge of a bed, weeping into a floral fleece blanket. He said that he fully cooperated with the police and the investigating authorities who combed through his tiny first-floor house where women and children also live.

He said he is weak and paralysed and wants the police to record and report the truth, even if it goes against his son. But, he said that the investigation authorities should have told them where they came from before raiding their home ruthlessly, not leaving a single piece of cloth untouched. He said his two sons repair inverter batteries and one son supplies emergency lights. Sohail was arrested from Amroha in North West Uttar Pradesh. He had moved to Amroha just two months ago.

Junaid, brother of suspected terror mastermind Sohail, said that the geometric pattern in Sohail's diary was to study turning coils in inverter batteries and not make bombs.

Sohail's older brother Junaid, seated next to his father, pulled out a diary and pointed to a hand-drawn geometric pattern used to depict functioning of inverter batteries. He said the family doesn't manufacture batteries and any technician can say this is a pattern for turning the coils that are used by repair mechanics. Junaid said that the investigating teams took away the circuits used in chargers.

He described Sohail as a God-fearing boy who had been put through madrasa education and someone who didn't have many friends and mostly spent time at home. An NIA official, who had been directing the activities of the investigating team at every step, has stated that most of those who have been arrested were known to Sohail since before. He is also the alleged voice in the video where intricacies of an IED are being explained. The agency has confirmed that it has recovered a huge cache of explosives, arms and ammunition from the accused.

The mood below Sohail's house seemed tense. Anxious young men had formed huddles. Ishfaq and Naseem, both of whom work in the jacket market, said that such an incident throws a blanket of doubt over the entire community's character and intentions.

He said there are people who work hard to earn a living in Faizabad and that they will be unhappy if Jafrabad is treated the same way as Batla House was in the broader discourse on minority rights because that can damage the peace in their locality.

Mohammad Ishaq, an elderly person known to Sohail, referred to him as a 'kaabil bacha (competent child)', one who never fought with anybody. He admitted that the terror speculations are most damaging to the locals, who, as it is, find it hard to find acceptance outside because of their last names and their social class.

A short bike ride away is the home of Rashid Zafar Raq, located right above a garment shop that he owns and runs. Rashid is one of the 11 terror suspects who the NIA arrested in raids in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, on Wednesday.

His sister-in-law told Firstpost that the investigating authorities raided their home for 12 hours, but didn't find anything from within its chipped pink and green walls. She asked why they dragged her brother-in-law away if nothing was found in the house and also objected to the lack of a search or arrest warrant.

Mahmood, Rashid's cousin, said that if someone's home is raided without warrants and the investigating authorities don't feel the need to explain what's going on, then the people are justified in feeling defenceless against a system. He said they covered Zafar's face and dragged him out and didn't let any of the family members leave the premises, even to get food to feed the children in the house.

Vivek Tyagi, SHO from Jafrabad, told Firstpost that he was part of the raids and that the locals are, in fact, unaware of the laws. ""The crime rate in Jafrabad, fuelled by gang wars, has come down. It is largely a peaceful area and no unconstitutional measures were taken to conduct the investigation or the raids,"" said Tyagi, adding that the families can appeal in court against the action taken by the NIA.

Chapter five of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, deals with the arrest of persons. Section 41 is the main section providing for situations when the police may arrest a person without a warrant. Under this, any police officer may without an order from a magistrate and without a warrant, arrest any person who has been concerned in any cognisable offence, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists, of his having been so concerned; or who has in his possession without lawful excuse, the burden of proving which excuse shall lie on such person, any implement of house-breaking; who has been proclaimed as an offender either under this code or by order of the state government.

Unfortunately, after the police leaves the scene, speculations and fear enter the scene and representatives from the local administration are missing to address and explain the goings-on. There's a void nobody fills and it widens to become a national issue that is debated by big political parties. In all this, where is the local administration?

Dilip Pandey, a Lok Sabha prabhari from the area, who had come to inaugurate a function at the Zakir Hussain Memorial School in Jafrabad on Thursday morning, told Firstpost that he wasn't aware that such an incident had taken place and that he can't go beyond the party line to give his personal opinion because it 'does not matter'.

Abdul Rehman, AAP Counselor from Chauhan Bangar in East Delhi had reached the homes of the accused, to gauge the situation. Alleging that minorities are being targeted, he asked why incidents in Muslim colonies like Batla House, Chauhan Banger, and Jafrabad take place before elections. ""Yesterday, Mohammad Azam's home was raided. The police didn't find anything but seized the passports of the family members. Why?"" he asked. AAP MLA Haji Ishraque refused to comment on the issue. If local leaders fail to reach out to residents, alienation is bound to seep deeper into the psyche.

Minorities seek comfort in territorial bastions and this spatial segregation has elements of both voluntary self-segregation and forced exclusion wherever governments have failed to address unequal access to residential areas.

Jafrabad and Seelampur are also severely drug-torn regions.

In 2016 October, Firstpost had reported on the drug crisis in New Seelampur and the way cannabis and medical drugs were being sold and consumed in the open. Asif Chaudhry, a social worker from the area, had then told Firstpost that entire families are addicted to smack, cannabis and medical drugs, apart from alcohol and tobacco.

Two years on, Chaudhry is sorry to state that the drug crisis has increased. He said that instead of focusing on cutting the supply chain of drugs and using its energy to attack the mafia network, Seelampur's drug crisis is viewed as the Muslim area's 'internal crisis' by the local and state administration.

""Communal politics and minority appeasement are the reason why even basic law and order issues acquire a religious lining. This is the reason why Muslims are either all victims or all criminals, there is no middle ground,"" he said.

There are many Jafrabad-like neighbourhoods in urban India, and callous handling of incidents like these could push them further away from the mainstream.

The recent judgment by a Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and D.Y. Chandrachud is based on a plea filed by the father of a school teacher whose husband, also a teacher in the same zila parishad school in Maharashtra, committed suicide.

The prosecution version is that the man took his own life unable to bear the harassment meted out to his wife by their colleague. A few days before his death in 2015, the husband had had a verbal altercation with the alleged harasser, but to no avail. The man, according to the police, kept on calling the deceased's wife. Finally, unable to take the pressure on his marital life, he took the fatal step leaving a suicide note naming the harasser.

The police registered a case of abetment to suicide against the accused teacher. He however successfully moved the Bombay High Court to quash the FIR against him. The High Court, in its order in March 2016, recorded that there was no prima facie material to establish that the accused male teacher ""had either an intention to aid or instigate or abet"" the suicide. Quashing the FIR, the High Court said even the suicide note did not indicate any instigation or abetment on the part of the accused to drive the husband to suicide.

Disagreeing with the High Court, Justice Lalit, speaking for the Bench, ordered the police to complete the investigation. The Bench said the High Court should not have gone into whether there was requisite intention on part of the respondent (accused teacher) when the investigation was yet to be completed and chargesheet, if any, was yet to be filed.

""There are definite allegations that the respondent would keep on calling the wife of the victim on her mobile and keep harassing her which allegations are supported by the statements of the mother and the wife of the victim recorded during investigation,"" the apex court observed, adding that the suicide note had made a ""definite allegation"" against the accused."

The Spanish world number two had to pull the plug early on his 2018 season and has not played since a knee problem forced him to retire during his US Open semi-final against Juan Martin del Potro in September.

He underwent surgery on his ankle to remove an intra-articular loose body in November and only resumed training two weeks ago.

Nadal will dip his toes back into competition at the Mubadala World Tennis Championship exhibition in Abu Dhabi, where he faces either Kevin Anderson or Chung Hyeon in his opener on Friday.

""I started two weeks ago and of course doing the things step by step and I think I have time to be ready for Melbourne at my 100 percent,"" Nadal told reporters in the UAE capital on Thursday.

""It's going to be good to have some matches before but I'm confident that I'm going to arrive to Melbourne with the right situation.""

The 32-year-old retired during matches at two of the four Grand Slams in 2018, but still added a record-extending 11th French Open crown to his collection.

He says he remains motivated to launch yet another comeback from injury, despite a career plagued by physical problems.

""After the second part of the year, have been tough last year in terms of injuries but that happens and that's part of my tennis career too,"" he added.

""Just try to stay calm, try to work the right way and when I'm back I know things are not easy, I know at the beginning you always have tough feelings and pains in the body that normally you don't have.

""But I have experience in all of this and try to be ready for the everyday practices and when (I) arrive (at) the matches I don't have to ask myself big things at the beginning, just trying to be positive with every improvement and that way normally you get the right point.""

- Djokovic enjoying tennis again -

Joining Nadal in Abu Dhabi is the man who replaced him at the top of the rankings, Novak Djokovic. The Serb is the reigning Wimbledon and US Open champion and will be looking to win a third major in a row at the Australian Open next month.

Djokovic ended a two-year Grand Slam title drought at Wimbledon in July and has lost just three matches since.

He admits that he lost his motivation during the difficult period that followed the 2016 French Open, where he completed the career Grand Slam, but has now found different ways to attain gratification from the sport.

""I feel I'm not prioritising success on the tennis court for the sake of the success only as I used to do that probably up to five years ago,"" Djokovic said.

""For me, tennis is more of a platform now for other things and for the values I want to share, and the messages I want to share with the young generation.

""Ultimately a tennis court for me is a place where I get challenged in every possible way emotionally and my character is kind of on the line. I treat that as my own personal school of life.

""Not many places can trigger me in a positive or negative way as a tennis court does."""

The Uttar Pradesh Police have booked a teenager for fraud and forgery months after she had accused a Bharatiya Janata Party MLA in Unnao of raping her, the Hindustan Times reported on Thursday. She, her mother and uncle have been accused of tampering with documents to prove she was a minor.

The case was filed on Sunday based on directions from a local court after a plea from Haripal Singh, the father of one of the 11 people in jail since April in connection with the rape case. Haripal Singh's wife is a co-accused and was arrested too. BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar is the main accused.

According to Singh's account, the rape complainant had eloped with a man last year, after which her family began to ask Singh's wife to get their son married to her when she returned. When Singh's family refused, his wife and son were falsely named in the rape case, he alleged. Singh also claimed that the teenager's family had forged a school certificate to wrongly show that she was a minor at the time of the alleged rape. An education officer and a school officer who had purportedly signed the certificate had denied having done so, Singh claimed.

An investigation is under way to verify the documents, said Dinesh Chandra Mishra, an official at Makhi police station, where the case was filed.

""The FIR was lodged on charges including cheating by impersonation, cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, forgery for purpose of cheating and using as genuine a forged document,"" Mishra told The Indian Express.

The complainant had accused Sengar, who represents Bangermau in the state Assembly, of raping her at his home in June 2017 when she had gone to meet him about a job. In April, she attempted suicide outside Chief Minister Adityanath's house, alleging that the police did not act on her complaint though she had approached them several months earlier. The CBI arrested Sengar on April 13.

The complainant's father had died after he got into a fight with Sengar's brother while in judicial custody. The police had arrested the brother for the alleged assault."

In a two-storey building under a flyover in Bareilly, above namkeen shops, past a policeman posted in the stairwell, lives a 24-year-old woman with her parents, brother, two parrots and five Persian cats.

The oldest of the cats, Simba, with her furry golden coat, sauntered around the living room, while black-haired Mikey scampered. Mother and child, I asked. ""No, no, partners, just like Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas,"" the young woman giggled, her eyes sparkling, her long straight hair bouncing in a ponytail.

She might not have the international fame of film actor Chopra, who also grew up in Bareilly, but in this part of western Uttar Pradesh, everyone seems to know Nida Khan.

The young woman was catapulted to fame in 2016 when she filed a case against her husband, Sheeran Raza Khan, accusing him of beating her after she failed to meet his family's demands for dowry.

Sheeran Khan is no ordinary man: he is the scion of a powerful family of Islamic scholars who trace their lineage to Ahmed Raza Khan, the founder of the influential Barelvi school of Islam, which is followed by most Indian Muslims. They are the custodians of the Dargah-e-Ala Hazrat, the tomb of Ahmed Raza Khan. Sheeran Khan's uncle Tauqeer Raza Khan, a prominent cleric, also leads a political party called the Ittehad-e-Millat Council, and was a minister in the Samajwadi Party government.

When a rishta (marriage offer) came from the illustrious dargah family, Nida's mother was tempted. But her father, an officer in a public sector company, was clear: Nida had just passed out of St Francis High School, he wanted her to complete her graduation. Sheeran Khan's family had to wait.

The engagement took place in the summer of 2014, two months after Nida Khan finished a degree in commerce.

India had just witnessed a tumultuous election. Narendra Modi, the controversial chief minister of Gujarat led the Bharatiya Janata Party to a thumping victory. Under his watch, more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslim, had been killed in the 2002 Gujarat riots. This triggered deep anxieties among Muslims, who found their representation in the Lok Sabha plummet to an all time low.

As a woman on the path to marriage, Nida Khan was caught in her own maelstrom - she had just started to wear a burqa. All she remembers of the election is that she cast her vote for the first time. She voted in favour of the Congress candidate, not as a rejection of Modi, but because she was impressed with the strength of Indira Gandhi, India's only woman prime minister.

""I too was a leader in school,"" Khan said. ""First, as class monitor, then as school prefect.""

But when it came to marriage, Nida Khan followed tradition. In February 2015, when her nikah was solemnised to Sheeran Khan, she had not even seen his photograph.

Months later, in July, she was back at her parents home - with injuries serious enough to have caused a miscarriage.

""Our mentality did not match,"" she explained. ""Everyone assumed he is from the dargah family, he must be a hafiz, aalim [erudite person], but it turned out he was a Class 5 passout."" She got a taste of his anger in March, when he stormed into an examination hall where she was writing her first-year masters of commerce exams. Holding her by the arm, he pulled her out - a story dramatic enough for the local newspapers to publish, but after carefully excising all the names.

Such was the power of the dargah family that when Nida Khan decided to file a police complaint in 2016, she was initially turned away. She had to seek the intervention of the courts.

Even then the police hastily filed a final report exonerating Sheeran Khan, citing lack of evidence. On his part, he claimed the marriage itself was infructuous - he had dissolved it by saying ""talaq"" three times.

At this crucial juncture, Nida Khan's crusade caught the attention of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which, by then, had decided to raise the pitch against triple talaq. Launching the party's campaign for the 2017 assembly elections, Modi spoke of saving ""Muslim sisters"" from injustice. But many in the Muslim community saw this as an encroachment in their personal laws and another act of majoritarian assertion.

Already, western Uttar Pradesh had witnessed attacks on Muslims. In September 2015, a middle-aged man, Mohammed Akhlaq, was dragged out of his house and killed by a mob which claimed that he had slaughtered a calf for meat. The murder took place just 50 km away from Ghaziabad where Modi, during the 2014 election campaign, had thundered against India's rising beef exports, deriding them as ""gulabi kranti"" or a pink revolution.

Consolidating its 2014 victory, BJP swept the Uttar Pradesh elections in March 2017. For Muslims, the political marginalisation was now complete - not a single Muslim MLA in the ruling party and a rabble-rousing Hindu monk, Adityanath, in the chief minister's seat. One of his first orders was to clamp down on unauthorised slaughterhouses and meat shops, which mostly employ Muslims. While the shops reopened after complying with the new rules, meat became a bad word, leaving people in the business vulnerable.

Mohammad Salim Qureshi ran a meat shop in the narrow lanes of the old city of Bareilly. In June 2018, he was beaten to death in his own neighbourhood, allegedly by the henchmen of the police, after he failed to pay them bribes. ""They threatened to fix my brother in a cow slaughter case,"" said his brother Nayeem Qureshi.

Scroll.in spoke to a dozen Muslims living in and around Bareilly. Surrounded by other Muslims, they said they felt secure in their neighbourhoods, but travelling outside was a source of anxiety. A young rice miller said he had stopped taking trains to Delhi and now only journeyed by car: ""Because my wife wears a hijab,"" he explained. Others spoke of avoiding meat - in school tiffins, on journeys. ""No kebabs on the train,"" said a crafts merchant.

In this worsening social climate, the BJP has found one trump card: the triple talaq crusaders among Muslim women. Ishrat Jahan, a petitioner in the Supreme Court case that led to a ban on the practice, joined the party this year in West Bengal. So did Sofia Ahmed from Kanpur, who was rewarded with a post in the Uttar Pradesh minorities commission.

But Nida Khan is yet to join.

Her story offers glimpses of the complex fabric of life in western Uttar Pradesh, which is now under strain.

Bareilly district lies in northwestern Uttar Pradesh in a region called Rohilkhand, named after the Afghan Rohillas who ruled in the 17th century. The large Muslim population here - 34.54% in Bareilly and 50.57% in neighbouring Rampur - is often the subject of the feverish imaginations of Hindutva supporters.

For all the menace attributed to them, most Muslims here barely scrape through a living. The traditional occupations they follow are in a state of decline.

""Bareilly is famous for four things,"" a young man explained, ""baans, surma, manjha, zari"" - bamboo furniture, eye kohl, kite string and embroidery work.

All of them are losing out to cheaper, factory-made versions.

In 2014, while campaigning in Bareilly, Modi invoked the special connection he shared with the city as a Gujarati who loved flying kites. ""If your kite flies high, then the manjha must be from Bareilly,"" he said, sending the audience in raptures.

Referring to the downturn caused in the industry by cheaper nylon substitutes called Chinese manjha, he promised to turn around its fortunes, in the same way that he claimed his government had done with the kite industry in Gujarat. ""Brothers and sisters, in Gujarat, the kite industry is in the hands of the poor, 90% of whom are Muslims,"" he said. ""We did research and started schemes. The industry barely touched Rs 35 crore, we took it to Rs 500 crore.""

Among the audience was Arshad Hussain, the president of the Manjha Mazdoor Kalyan Samiti, which represents 30,000 workers in Bareilly district. Impressed with Modi's speech, he voted for the BJP in 2014, he recalled with nervous laughter one morning in December, sitting in a field in impoverished Bakarganj, where hundreds of men ran around poles in luminous winter light.

To make the kite-slaying manjha, the workers must injure their hands, coating the cotton thread strung on poles with a rice paste mixed with glass. The daily wages are a pittance - just Rs 150-Rs 200.

Far from seeing a revival under Modi government, this marginal industry has been pushed further against the wall. First, demonetisation in November 2016 caused an upheaval, then seven months later, the introduction of Goods and Services Tax came as a blow.

GST, which replaced a welter of other taxes, was supposed to make things easier. But not only are the costs of filing GST returns prohibitive, navigating paper work is a steep challenge for those who lack a formal education, said Hussain. ""About 200 people run majha-making units here,"" he said. ""Only 50 have a GST registration."" Others either sell their products by borrowing GST numbers [from other units], for which they pay a commission, or they sell them cheap to whoever is willing to buy.

A sales representative of a leading yarn-making company who was visiting Hussain in Bakarganj said he saw a downturn in every industry he did business with: shoe-making, textiles, mattresses. ""Cash flow has stopped in the economy,"" he said. As firms waited for refunds, GST had locked up private funds with the government, and banks were not lending. The result was a liquidity squeeze. ""The big players are benefitting, the smaller businesses are getting wiped out,"" he said.

In Shahmat Ganj in the old city, Asad Khan, 42, who makes and sells hand-embroidered salwar kameez fabrics pointed to a pile of products lying around. ""These have come back from Punjab,"" he said. He had sold them on credit - the buyer made no upfront payment - but when they remained unsold, the buyer sent them back. ""Now the trouble is I have already paid GST on them, which I won't get back,"" Khan said. The new tax system does not account for a traditional economy based on credit and trust.

It is easy to discuss the economic crisis in these neighbourhoods. But broaching the subject of the worsening social climate and the anxiety of being Muslim is not.

""I have stopped watching TV,"" is all that Asad Khan was willing to say.

Hammad Nabi, a youth leader of the Samajwadi Party, said it was counterproductive to dwell on the fears of Muslims: it pushes them to hardline leaders like the Owaisis, he claimed. ""This government is bad not just for Muslims, we say it is bad for everyone,"" he said.

But in the villages of Bareilly, there is disquiet. Zarar Ahmed, 60, the pradhan of Jojkharpur village in Bahedi block, and the head of the association of village chiefs, alleged that Muslim-majority villages were being denied development funds under the BJP. ""They have not sanctioned a single awaas [house] in my village,"" he said, referring to the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana, which subsidises the construction of low cost houses.

In another Muslim-majority village, Rurki, in the same block, a younger pradhan, Akram Khan, 43, disagreed. ""There might be verbal discrimination,"" he said, hinting at the sparring between BJP MLAs and pradhans owing allegiance to the Samajwadi Party, ""but there is no discrimination in funds.""

In his own village, however, stands a monument to the government's malice towards Muslims.

It is a two-storey building which lies incomplete. Funded through the previous government's multisectoral development programme, the building was meant to house an industrial training institute. The programme, which was launched in 2008, aimed at building infrastructure to ""address the development deficits of minority concentration areas"". The Centre contributed 75% of the funds, while 25% came from the state.

But, since the Modi government came to power, Uttar Pradesh officials say not only has the sanction of new projects stopped, even ongoing projects have come to a standstill because central funds have dried up. All that the Modi government has done is rename the programme as the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram.

For instance, of the Rs 3.65 crore allotted to the industrial training institute in Bahedi, Rs 2.65 was released by the previous government, all of which was spent. About 75% of the construction is complete. But the second instalment never came. Now, weeds have taken over the unfinished building.

In Bareilly district alone, as many as 24 projects are lying incomplete. The original sanction for them was Rs 52.73 crore but the delay has pushed up costs to Rs 77.56. To complete them, Uttar Pradesh would have to dip into its own funds, which, officials say, is unlikely to happen.

""Don't do anything for minorities, no issue,"" said a senior official. ""But this government wants to show it is not doing anything for them.""

Another example of Modi government's ill-will towards Muslims, said state officials, was the unprecedented delay in the salaries of teachers appointed under the madrassa modernisation scheme. Launched by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government in 2003, the scheme aimed to supplement privately funded deeni talim (religious education) with government-funded duniyawi taleem (secular education) through the appointment of maths, science and other subject teachers.

While delays occurred even under the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, never before had the Centre completely stopped releasing salaries. ""It's been 33 months since we were paid,"" said Mohammad Shakeel, who has been in service since 2003. ""We have agitated in Jantar Mantar [in Delhi], to no avail.""

""Modi ji says he wants Muslims to have ek haath mein computer, ek haath mein Koran [a computer in one hand, Koran in the other],"" he continued. ""Computer to mila nahi, ab Koran bhi chooth jayegi."" We did not get a computer, and now we stand to lose the Koran.

Funds are not the ony instrument by which governments signal their priorities.

Months after it came to power, in August 2017, the Adityanath government ordered all districts to enforce the singing of the national anthem in madrassas on Independence Day. The proceedings were to be recorded and the footage sent to Lucknow.

The decision created palpable tension in parts of Bareilly, said an official, leading to orders being imposed under Section 144 to prohibit more than four people from assembling at a spot.

Assigned the task of enforcing the order in one madrassa, he recalled how he got around it. ""I told them I will sing, you please join only if you want to,"" he said. ""Literally, no one sang. But I had positioned the camera in a way where only I was visible. So the work was done.""

In August, Nida Khan received a call from Rekha Arya, the women and child development minister of neighbouring Uttarakhand. Arya said she wanted to discuss women's issues but Khan was smart enough to know this was a cover. In July, a cleric in Bareilly had passed a fatwa against her, which had prompted the police to assign her a full-time security detail, but it had also raised her public profile. Aware that other triple talaq crusaders had joined the BJP, she anticipated an offer from the party.

When she consulted her parents, her father said ""no netagiri"", but her mother asked her to make up her own mind. Khan reminded herself that it was only after the BJP had come to power in Uttar Pradesh that the investigation in her case had been reopened. The police had taken one year to file the chargesheet. ""There was delay, but no injustice,"" she reasoned. ""I am safe as long as the BJP is in power. If the SP comes back, I am finished.""

But driving from Bareilly to Dehradun, via Haridwar, was a challenge.

It was the season for the Kanwar Yatra, in which young male devotees of Shiva walk long distances to fetch the water of Ganga from Haridwar. The road was jammed. ""My brother told the driver, be extra careful, if you even touch the bhole people, you will get killed,"" Khan recalled. A video had surfaced, showing Kanwariyas vandalising a car in the full public view, with the police watching helplessly.

In 2012, communal clashes had erupted in Bareilly district after Kanwariyas were stopped by Muslims from playing loud music in the town of Aonla. This year, in many villages of Bareilly, Muslims complained that Kanwariyas deliberately strayed from the official routes, marched in front of mosques, resorted to provocative slogans. ""Musalman khamosh raha (Muslims stayed silent),"" said Abdul Waheed, a leader allied to the Samajwadi Party. ""We counselled them to stay silent. If you speak up, you only will get beaten up. The government is theirs.""

But Nida Khan scoffed at the simplistic binaries. ""Our people too take out jaloos [processions] which are nothing but shakti pradarshan [displays of strength],"" she noted. The competitive displays clashed in 2010, when a procession to mark the Prophet's birthday ran into a Holi celebration in Bareilly. This triggered riots that led to a month-long curfew in the city.

Voicing a commonly held belief, Nida Khan claimed the riots were not spontaneous: the clash was orchestrated. Less than a year ago, in 2009, Santosh Gangwar of the BJP, after six successive wins, was defeated by the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections. The Bahujan Samaj Party was in power in the state. Both the Samajwadi Party and the BJP were political marginalised. Nida Khan claims they got together to engineer the riots and polarise the electorate. ""Tauqeer Mian [of the dargah family] and Santosh Gangwar are after all good friends,"" she said.

This year, in the thick of speculation over whether Khan would join the BJP, local newspapers reported that Gangwar had scuttled her chances - at the behest of the dargah family. While Arya had made an offer on behalf of BJP's Uttarakhand unit, Nida Khan had turned it down, saying she would also consider an offer from the central leadership.

Nida Khan remains ambivalent about joining the BJP.

In September, she had travelled to Lucknow to collect an award. Adityanath was the chief guest at the event. On stage, the moderator asked him about the mob lynchings in the state - as recently as June, a Muslim man had been killed over cow slaughter rumours in Hapur.

Khan recalled his answer: ""Mob lynching? No, that's not taking place in UP"".

""I was like how much is he lying,"" she said. ""But the anchor did not even cross-question him.""

In the Bareilly college, where Nida Khan studied, colonial-era red brick buildings are set against green expansive lawns. Like many campuses, in recent years, it has seen a rise of the Hindutva student organisation, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. In October, a bus carrying Urdu books sponsored by the National Council For Promotion of Urdu Language, an autonomous body under the Ministry of Human Resource Development, had to be sent back after ABVP objected, shouting slogans against it.

Even without paying much attention to politics, two young women in the second-year BSc course had concluded that Modi government was anti-Muslim.

The Centre has given an extension of six months to complete the ongoing exercise for updating the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam by June 30.

In a notification, the Registrar General of India said the decision has been taken as the exercise to enumerate citizens in the NRC, a list of Assam's residents, could not be completed within the specified date of December 31, 2018.

""The central government has considered it necessary and expedient in the public interest to complete the said enumeration in connection with the updation of the National Register of Citizens, 1951, by the 30th day of June, 2019,"" the notification, issued by Registrar General of India, Sailesh, said.

On December 6, 2013, the government had issued the first notification setting a deadline of three years for completion of the entire NRC process. However, since then, five extensions were given by the government in regular intervals as the exercise has not yet been completed.

""Now, therefore, pursuant to the provisions of sub-rule (3) of rule 4A of the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003 and in supersession of the notification number S.O.3715(E), dated the 30th July, 2018, except as respects things done or omitted to be done before such supersession, the Registrar General of Citizen Registration, hereby, notifies that the enumeration in connection with the updation of the National Register of Citizens, 1951, in respect of the State of Assam shall be completed within the period ending on the 30th day of June, 2019,"" the notification said.

The draft NRC was published on July 30 and included the names of 29 million people out of the total 32.9 million applications. There has been a huge controversy over the exclusion of 4 million people from the draft NRC.

The current process of claims and objections to the draft NRC will come to an end on December 31 and after that the final list is expected to be published.

For the claims and objections process, forms are available in 2,500 Seva Kendras in Assam, where people can file their appeal in their respective areas. People can file corrections to their names that are in the draft and also raise objections against suspected foreigners.

The Supreme Court-monitored NRC exercise, aimed at identifying illegal immigrants in the state that borders Bangladesh, was carried out only in Assam, which faced influx of people from Bangladesh since the early 20th century.

But the fact is that our officers routinely organize raids on them but they always come back.""

""The day we remove their encroachments, the next day everything is back. We believe it also happens in collusion with corrupt officers. The best way out of this is to take money from such restaurant owners.

Last year, during a safai karamcharis' strike in October, the Delhi Government had to bail out the municipality with advance payment of tax shares to the tune of '108 crore.

Sachin Sharma said, ""We know that we have thousands of licence-holding restaurants that have spilled out of their sanctioned premises deliberately. They create traffic problems, besides generating more solid waste because of more consumers. We must take extra money from them at least to handle the mess that they create.""

At least 50,000 more restaurants and eateries operate without any licence, and the EDMC is unable to shut them due to lack of supervisory officers and health and sanitation inspectors.The health committee of EDMC is only an advisory body. Its proposal will go to the standing committee for approval, only after which will it get a final sanction.

A few officers of EDMC, however, said that this proposal could be untenable. ""How can you legalise them with money when, for the same reason (encroachment), entire markets have been shut down by the monitoring committee of the Supreme Court under the sealing drive in Delhi?"" asked an officer.

In a fresh twist to a rape case allegedly involving BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an FIR has been lodged on court orders against the victim, her mother and an uncle for producing a forged age certificate to prove she was a minor.

The court ordered registration of a case against the three on a complaint by the father of another rape accused Shubham, who is in jail, said SP Harish Kumar Thursday.

He said complainant Harpal Singh had alleged that the victim, her uncle and mother had procured a forged age certificate to implicate his son Shubham in the rape case, said Kumar.

The police said the case was registered at the Makhi police station on court's December 17 order against the family members for various alleged offences of cheatring and forgery.

Complainant Singh had moved the court saying the school transfer certificate, purportedly made by Raebareli school and produced as the age certificate, was forged to frame his son, police said.

The victim's uncle is presently in jail in connection with another case.

Harpal Singh's wife Shashi and son Shubham are accused in the rape case and have been in jail since April along with the main accused, BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

Sengar, a four-time MLA, was charged by the CBI with raping the girl at his residence in Makhi village on June 4 last year.

The girl was again abducted and raped by a separate group of accused, allegedly including Harpal Singh's son Shubhan Singh, his driver Naresh Tiwari and one Brijesh Yadav between June 11 and June 20, 2017.

But in his complaint, Harpal Singh alleged that the victim had an affair with a man named Awadesh Tewari, with whom she had eloped in September 2017, only to return sometime later.

After her return, her family had begun persuading his son Shubham to marry her, alleged Harpal Singh in his complaint.

When Shubham refused to marry her, the family filed a case against him and his mother on charges of kidnapping as well as various offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, alleged Haripal Singh.

He also alleged that the victim's kin had forged her age certificate with a fake date of birth, purportedly issued from a school in Raebareli as proof.

The certificate purportedly had the signatures of the Basic Shiksha Adhikari of the district and the school principal.

Singh claimed both the education department official and the school principal have denied signing the certificate.

The victim had alleged that she was raped by BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar at his residence on June 4, 2017, when she had gone there to meet him along with Shashi Singh, Shubham's mother, to seek a job.

In February, the girl's family had moved the court for inclusion of the MLA's name in the case.

The state police registered a case on April 12, 2018, on the day of handing over the probe to the CBI.

Meanwhile, the victim's father was booked by the police under the Arms Act on April 3 and put in jail on April 5 where he died on April 9, 2018.

A video, purportedly showing the victim's father before his death accusing the MLA's brother of assaulting him had then gone viral.

Sengar's brother Atul Singh, was arrested along with four others, by the UP Crime Branch, for allegedly thrashing the victim's father.

Frustrated with the alleged police inaction and coercion from influential people, the minor victim had attempted self-immolation in front of Chief Minister yogi Adityanath's residence on April 8, 2018.

The Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government's ""inaction"" against the party MLA had drawn scathing criticism from the Allahabad High Court.

The state government had subsequently transferred the case to the CBI nearly 10 months after the commission of the alleged crime. Sengar was arrested by the CBI on April 13 and has been in judicial custody since then.

A second arrest in the case was made on April 14 when Shashi Singh, who had taken the victim to Sengar's house, was held.

The man is never still. He is constantly stretching one body part or the other, which possibly explains those rubber-like appendages that can reach out at impossible angles and retrieve the toughest of passing shots.

Novak Djokovic reached the final seven times in his last eight events in the season and won four, including the Wimbledon and the US Open. AFP

You cannot argue with any part of a career that has won 14 Grand Slam titles. But even then, 2018 will probably go down as his finest year. Just when it looked as if the 31-year-old Serb's star was waning following an elbow injury towards the end of 2017, he scripted one of the most remarkable comebacks in the game following his surgery and injury lay-off.

After surprisingly losing in the quarter-finals of the French Open to Italian Marco Cecchinato in May, Djokovic went on a tear. He reached the final seven times in his last eight events in the season and won four, including the Wimbledon and the US Open. Despite losing in the finals of his last two starts, he finished the year as the World No 1.

Djokovic is back in Abu Dhabi for the Mubadala World Tennis Championship, an exhibition event featuring six leading players from the ATP Tour. He had withdrawn from the tournament last year because of the elbow injury.

""It's been a very exciting 12 months. Last year here, I was still carrying the injury of the elbow that resulted in the surgery a couple of months later. Post surgery, I was ranked 22 in the world and in 4-5 months, I was the No 1. It was quite a roller-coaster ride to be honest,"" the Serb said.

""I am grateful that this season has taught me a lot about myself as a tennis player and as a person. I really had to dig deep to sort of turn the table in my favour. I had to understand my game in every aspect in order to get back to where I am. Hopefully, I can take the confidence that I had in the second half of the season into the first half of 2019.""

As Djokovic embarked on a new season, I asked him what continued to motivate him at this stage of his career. I half expected him to say more grand slams, or chasing Roger Federer's record, but he thought about it for a few seconds, and came with a surprisingly deep reply.

""I feel I am not prioritising success on the tennis court to evaluate success as I used to do probably until about five years ago,"" said Djokovic, who is very involved with his own Noval Djokovic Foundation and is also a UNICEF ambassador.

""For me, tennis is more of a platform now for other things - for the values that I want to share and the messages that I want to give out to the young generation.

""At the end of the day, the tennis court for me is a place where I get challenged in every possible way - emotionally and physically. My character is kind of on the line, so I treat it as my own personal school of life.

""Not many places can trigger me, positively or negatively, like a tennis court does. I see it as a place where I can grow, regardless of where I am in the world. It demands a lot a lot of extreme focus and dedication from me and there are outbursts of emotions that I did not think I had. That's the reason why I am grateful I still play this sport.""

Abu Dhabi might be a relaxed start to his year, but there is no doubt that Djokovic is focused on the upcoming Australian Open, the first Grand Slam of the year.

""It is just the start of the season and in a few weeks, we have the first Grand Slam of the year. So, there is not much time to ease your way into the season. We have to be at our best in a few weeks and that's why this Abu Dhabi tournament is important for me,"" explained the six-time Australian Open champion.

""Australian Open is a tournament where you want to shine and give your best. I'm really looking forward to it because that is where I have had my most success in Grand Slams.

""I know I have not had a good time in the last couple of years, but I was injured and going through physical difficulties. I'm fit this time and back to No 1 in the world and playing good tennis in the last six months. Hopefully, I will be able to transfer that in to success in Melbourne.""

The UN recognised the Prime Minister in the Policy Leadership category for his bold environmental leadership on the global stage. His pioneering work in championing the International Solar Alliance where the country heralded a global coalition of nations to tackle climate change by leveraging the power of solar energy which has been lauded globally. Some of the major highlights of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in the year 2018 are outlined below:-

World Environment Day:

Considering India's global leadership in environmental protection and climate change sectors, the UNEP had chosen India to be the global host for World Environment Day (WED) on 5 June, 2018.

The main event was organized in Delhi and included a series of conferences in Vigyan Bhawan, a mega exhibition in Rajpath Lawns behind Vigyan Bhawan and the concluding event was graced by the Hon'ble Prime Minister and dignitaries from UN also attended the event. This WED, 2018 focused on ""Plastic Pollution"" which is one of the most challenging environmental concerns today.

Green Good Deeds Campaign:

Green Good Deeds, the societal movement launched by the Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr Harsh Vardhan to protect environment and promote good living in the country, has earned worldwide accolades.

""Green Good Deeds"" is an idea to take environmental awareness to the people and get them involved. Formally launched in January 2018, the campaign lauds small positive actions performed by individuals or organisations to strengthen the cause of environmental protection. The Ministry has drawn up a list of over 600 Green Good Deeds and asked people to alter their behaviour to Green Good Behaviour to fulfill their Green Social Responsibility. These small, positive actions, to be performed by individuals or organisation to strengthen the cause of environmental protection have been enlisted on a mobile App called Dr Harsh Vardhan App.

Students under Eco-clubs are implementing the Green Good Deeds (GGDs) initiative which seeks to transform the people's behaviour into Green Good Behaviour and fulfil Green Social Responsibility. A ten point agenda has been developed to implement the GGDs through Nodal agencies in State/UTs implementing the Ecoclub programme. Various activities covered under GGDs like cleanliness drives within the school campus, carry out waste segregation into biodegradable and non-biodegradable, paper re-cycling and conducting tree plantation drives etc are being implemented across the country by the students. The green attitude is visible in their actions. Further GREEN GOOD DEEDS event was successfully organised on 6.10.2018 at India International Science Festival (IISF) 2018 held at Indira Gandhi Prathishthan, Lucknow. Event was inaugurated by Dr. A.K. Mehta Additional Secretary, MoEFCC. Exhibition showcasing the success stories under Ecoclub programme. Around 200 Ecoclub students from Uttar Pradesh participated in the Drawing and Essay competitions.

In order to skill youth in environment, forest and wildlife sectors and enable them to be gainfully employed/ self-employed, MoEF&CC launched a Green Skill Development Programme (GSDP) in June, 2017 on a pilot basis. The programme is now being scaled to an all India level. More than 30 skilling programmes are being conducted during 2018-19, covering diverse fields-pollution monitoring (air/ water/ soil), STP/ETP/CETP operation, waste management, forest management, water budgeting & auditing, conservation of river dolphins, wildlife management, para taxonomy, including PBRs, mangroves conservation, bamboo management and livelihood generation.

During 2018-19 from August till date, 944 candidates have successfully completed the different skilling courses. Currently, 568 candidates are enrolled in various ongoing courses. The objective of creating a pool of Master Trainers during 2018-19 is also being met as 283 of the successful trainees have offered to be Master Trainers, who would skill more youth across the country in various skill sets, related to environment, forest and wildlife. A mobile app giving information about the training programme being conducted under GSDP, list of the Institutes offering these programme and other details has been also launched.

Reclassification of Bamboo & Removal from Category of Tree:

The Government of India has made concerted efforts to promote bamboo cultivation right from enabling regulatory provision, to supporting the bamboo plantation on a large scale by launching newly restructured National Bamboo Mission with a budget outlay of Rs 1290 crore.

The amendment in Indian Forest Act, 1927, will facilitate the inter-state movement of bamboo, as there will be no requirement of permit during transit from one State to another. It will ultimately result in reducing the gap of availability of resources from bamboo-surplus states to bamboo-deficit states. As a result, both producers and consumers will be benefitted.

The Climate Change Division of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) looks after the issues related to climate change including the international negotiations and domestic policies and actions. India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Paris Agreement and Kyoto Protocol. The Division is also responsible for submission of National Communications (NATCOMs) and the Biennial Update Reports (BURs) to UNFCCC. Several domestic programmes/ schemes have been initiated in the recent years for addressing climate change. Some key initiatives include the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC), Climate Change Action Programme (CCAP) and State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) among others. In order to create and strengthen the scientific and analytical capacity for assessment of climate change in the country, different studies have also been initiated under CCAP.

During the year 2018, many important bilateral and multilateral meetings and negotiations on climate change were held in the run up to the 24 Conference of the Parties to UNFCCC (COP-24), in which Hon'ble Minister, EF&CC and senior officials of the Ministry participated. The Ministry hosted international meetings of the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) on 1 and 2 November 2018 and BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) countries on 19 -20 November 2018. The meeting has helped in strengthening and securing common interest and positions of the developing countries in the run up to COP-24 to the UNFCCC.

Twenty Fourth Conference of Parties (COP-24) in Katowice, Poland was successful in adopting Paris Agreement Work Programme. The conference was significant one which focused on other key issues including the conclusion of 2018 Facilitative Talanoa Dialogue and the stocktake of Pre-2020 actions implementation and ambition. India engaged positively and constructively in all the negotiations while protecting India's key interests including recognition of different starting points of developed and developing countries; flexibilities for developing countries and consideration of principles including equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC). India re-affirmed its commitment to multilateralism and international cooperation and its image has undergone a positive change

An India Pavilion was also setup during Twenty Fourth Conference of Parties (COP 24) of UNFCCC held in Katowice, Poland from December 3 to 14, 2018. The theme of pavilion this year was 'One World One Sun One Grid' based on an ambitious target set by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during the first assembly of the International Solar Alliance on October 2018 that 40 percent of its installed power capacity will be from non-fossil fuels by 2030. Eminent dignitaries from the other participating countries of Japan, Qatar, Austria, Maldives, UK and the host country Poland visited the India Pavilion and gave remarkable feedback. The India Pavilion also became a platform to bring together 43 different stakeholder institutions including Central Ministries, State Governments/ Departments, Think Tanks, Civil Society Organisations, etc. to showcase their climate change action taken in various sectors through 20 side events. A footfall of about 14-15,000 people at India pavilion during the course of COP-24.

Reuniting a child with her foster mother

For seven years, Jayashree Guttedar had brought up an abandoned girl as her own, only to be told that she was raising the girl ""illegally"". The wailing baby that Jayashree had rescued from a bush near a private maternity hospital in Gubbi Colony in Kalaburagi years ago, was taken away by Women and Child Development department officials to an orphanage. Jayashree -- a mother of three who had accepted the girl as her own -- had to run from pillar to post, fighting to claim the child with proper documentation. Jayashree then reached out to district in-charge minister Priyank Kharge. On October 3, 2018, TNIE carried the story, highlighting the torment of the mother. Minister Kharge intervened, and the child was returned to Jayashree with coordination from the district commissioner."

Her performance caught the attention of Nipon Das and Nabajit Malakar, athletics coaches in the Directorate of Sports and Youth Affairs, Assam, who asked her to shift to Guwahati for better training facilities. After joining the academy, she began to show steady progress, and reached the finals of 100m in Junior National finals, in 2016. Her win in the IAAFWorld U20 Championship is the cherry on her cake.

Special educator: Zhao Yu

A dancing team led by Zhao Yu, in China, has won multiple honours in art events nationwide, this year. But what makes this team or their teacher special? Well, all the students either suffer from visual, hearing impairment, or autism. Zhao Yu is a special educator, and as a a dance teacher at the Shijiazhuang Municipal Special Education School, she has to break down communication barriers with her students. Though her dancing team has won multiple honours in art events across the nation, it took a lot of effort and time to achieve cooperation. ""A five-minute dance might cost us more than 700 days of rehearsal, during which tens of thousands of repetitive trainings are done,"" said Zhao, in an interview.

Women in Iran are banned from motorbike riding because of their modesty laws. In a bid to change this attitude, Maral got onto her bike. She travelled solo across the world, and rode into her country triumphantly. She was not arrested. Now, she has the dubious honour of being the first Iranian woman to ride a bike.

In 2017, she set out from India, crossed seven continents and 64 countries in 17 months, concluding her trip in November, this year. In a BBC video, she said, ""The only message I want to send out is that if an Iranian woman, or any woman, thinks that she can't do something, she just needs to close her eyes and say 'I can, if I really want to'. And she definitely can.""

She is currently campaigning for Iranian women to get driving licenses and permission to ride motorbikes. She is also an advocate for creating awareness about rape and domestic violence on women."

In March 2016, Imtiyaz Khan, 13 and 32-year-old Mazloom Ansari were on their way taking eight oxen on foot to a cattle fair when they were beaten up and then hanged from a tree by a mob of Gau Rakshas in Khaprelwar village of Latehar district.

On 19 December, last week, Jharkhand court convicted eight people and awarded life imprisonment for lynching the two innocents.

According to media reports, the family members of both the victims are not satisfied with the quantum of sentence. ""We seek the death penalty for the killers and compensation for the family members to eke out a living,"" said Sayra Bibi wife of Imtiyaz.

Majlum Ansari was the lone caretaker of the family of 6 members that included his wife, four daughters and a son. Sayra Bibi claimed to had been receiving threats despite court awarded life imprisonment to all the accused.

The year 2018 kept India's Supreme Court in the headlines like never before. While sensational cases like Sabarimala, Rafale, Ayodhya were closely followed, not much attention was given to how the Supreme Court handled routine cases in its docket.

The Supreme Court pronounced close to 1,000 judgments in cases of varied subject matters between January and November 2018. It is interesting to note the years in which these cases were filed:

Table 1. Year of filing

In Table 1, 60 per cent of the judgments rendered were in cases filed over the past four years. However, some cases have taken well over 10 years to be disposed off. While chief justices have deliberated the problem of subordinate courts having cases pending for over 10 years, it is perhaps time for the Supreme Court to lead by example and take an active effort to decide cases that have been pending for a long time. As per information provided to the ministry of law and justice, around one-third of the cases pending at the Supreme Court have been pending for over five years.

A look at the subject matter of the judgments pronounced and the time they took to dispose will help us understand what kind of cases the court dealt with:

Table 2. Subject matter of cases decided

In Table 2, the largest number of judgments pertains to criminal matters and ordinary civil matters, with such cases taking 1,697 days and 2,041 days respectively on average to be disposed off. The category of cases, which took the most amount of time to be disposed off in the Supreme Court were direct tax matters, with these cases taking 2,377 days (6.5 years) on average to be disposed off. However, a lack of publicly available aggregated data on the cases pending before the Supreme Court hinders a more meaningful understanding of the workload and time spent by the court on adjudication of matters before it.

Now, let's look at the nature of disposal in the judgments pronounced to understand what the Supreme Court has spent its time on:

Table 3. Nature of disposal

In Table 3, a substantial number of decisions (231 judgments) were in cases that were dismissed, with those cases taking 2,299 days on average to be disposed off. In order to understand what type of cases take a long time to be dismissed, we must look at the subject matter of these cases:

Table 4. Subject matter of dismissed cases

Table 4 shows that the highest number of dismissed cases pertains to criminal matters. Criminal matters are a category that has far higher costs to those involved when compared to any other class of cases. The category of dismissed cases that took the longest amount of time to be disposed off are cases pertaining to 'family and personal law matters' and 'land acquisition, requisition, land law, and agricultural tenancy matters', with these cases taking over 10 years to be dismissed.

The problems plaguing the judicial system are often seen from the perspective of the subordinate courts, as they are the courts of first instance and the vast bulk of litigation lies before them. However, the problems that stem from judicial delay are several folds worse by the time a matter goes through the judicial system and reaches the Supreme Court - this makes the need to ensure timely adjudication at the apex court equally important. The Supreme Court must make the best use of its resources to analyse its functioning, adopt better listing practices, make a targeted attempt to adjudicate matters that have been pending for a long time, encourage dialogue by making data publicly available, and serve as an example to restore the faith of the general populace in the only adjudicatory system that upholds the rule of law.

President JKJCCPS Showkat M Chowdhary said the Fee Fixation Committee, as per the High Court Directions, approves the fee for a full calendar year and not on monthly basis.

He said the schools submit all the documents, income and expenses attested by Chartered Accountant, undertakings and declarations to the Fee Fixation Committee on the basis of which the fee is fixed.

""The private schools hire staff on yearly basis who are provided salary and provident funds for full year. No school hires staff as daily wagers. Accordingly, the schools charge tuition for full calendar year. The schools also make it sure that the teachers and other staff are paid properly. They also upgrade its infrastructure and other facilities on regular basis in an effort to impart quality education to the students so that they can compete not only at state or national level but at international level.""

About the transportation charges, JKJCCPS said the private schools charge for only 10 months even though they provide salary to the drivers and conductors for full year.

""Besides other charges including road tax, insurances are also borne by the schools for 12 months and there is no exemption from any authority or company to schools for the school buses during winter months. The schools only save fuel during the winter months on the basis of which only 10 months transportation fee is charged from the parents.""

JKJCCPS said transport facilities are provided to the students on no profit no loss basis.

""This facility is for the smooth transportation of the students so that they reach the schools and return back home on fixed times. It is neither prudent to say that schools will ply buses on losses.""

JKJCCPS said it is not mandatory for the parents to avail transport facility. ""If parents feel the transport is not viable, they can opt out of this facility and drop the students at schools on their own.""

It said the Coordination Committee has already given clear-cut instructions to the schools not to charge arbitrarily or make unnecessarily charges.

""We have also urged parents to register their complaints with the Coordination Committee for its prompt redressal.""

JKJCCPS urged parents no to resort to media trails instead seek better education for the wards.

""In today's modern world when competition is very high for the students, parents should exhort upon the school management to further upgrade infrastructure in terms of latest teaching aids and other facilities which should be integral part of class room.""

JKJCCPS further urged parents' association to sit with coordination committee over the issue and clear doubts, if any, regarding the fee charged from the students.

""We believe that media trials will serve no purpose but only hamper the school functioning and derail our effort to impart quality education. We will also like to invite media for open discussion and clear any doubts on the matter so that we focus on providing quality education to the students and help parents lay a strong foundation of their children."""

After the gang was busted in December last year, the police said it had cheating more than 20,000 students across India and jeopardised the careers of many unsuspecting candidates who bagged government jobs using fake certificates issued by them.

On Wednesday, Rajesh Deo, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch), said at least one such candidate -- who had bagged a UP Police job using a fake degree -- had been dismissed from his job after his documents were found to be fake.

The gang ran a fake education board in the name of 'Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi' and operated from west Delhi's Vikaspuri, said the DCP..

Police said the gang was busted for a second time on December 12 after the crime branch received a tip-off about the 'Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi' , said Rajeev Ranjan, additional commissioner of police (crime branch). ""We were already working on a similar recent complaint from the Directorate of Education,"" Ranjan said.

The first person to be arrested was 23-year-old Altaf Raza, who was one of the six persons nabbed last year as well. The police said he was ""one of the masterminds"" of the racket. ""We arrested him on a day he was to appear at a court hearing in the previous case,"" said DCP Deo.

Raza had allegedly learnt the trade from one Shiv Prasad Pandey a few years ago. Pandey was arrested with Raza last year. After coming out on bail, he has gone underground, said the DCP.

The other two men arrested in the latest case are Shambhu Nath Mishra and Manoj Kumar, who run a school in Uttar Pradesh's Deoria and were allegedly involved in scouting for potential candidates as well as schools in desperate need for recognition certificates.

""The gang promised to provide marksheets and degrees of Class 10 and 12 in two-three months without any tests or requirements. The documents provided were fake,"" said DCP Deo.

Each time their website was busted, the gang would allegedly come up with a new portal with a different name.

The police claimed to have recovered a large number of fake marksheets, provisional certificates and migration certificates. ""In their last few months of operation, the gang had cheated more than 10,000 students from Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar,"" said the DCP.

The gang allegedly charged anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000 for fake certificates and marksheets. That, investigators said, allowed them to operate easily as their victims rarely approached the police because of the relatively small sum of money involved."

The Appellate Division, in Oasis Therapeutic Life Centers, Inc. v. Wade et al., (December 10, 2018), reversed the trial court, holding that the plaintiff had standing to sue since it served the protected class and that a neighbor's interference with a protected class' transaction with discriminatory intent violated LAD.

Plaintiff Oasis (an acronym for Ongoing Autistic Success in Society) is a nonprofit charitable organization established to create transitional residential adult independent learning centers (TRAILs) for challenged individuals diagnosed with autism.

In early 2015, Oasis offered to purchase a large residential property on the Navesink River in Middletown Township for the purposes of establishing a farm. Oasis' purchase offer of $2.2 million was contingent upon receipt of a grant of $600,000 from the Monmouth County Conservation Foundation (MCF).

MCF's approval was delayed when a member of the MCF board, who apparently lived near the property, indicated a concern there may be a link between autism and the 2012 shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Following this expression of concern, certain defendants and others allegedly undertook a series of actions against the Oasis project, including a door-to-door campaign, a petition submitted to the MCF board objecting to the grant and a sham offer to induce the property owner to back out of his commitment to sell to Oasis. Ultimately, the seller terminated its contract with Oasis and pursued the sham offer (which the sham buyer walked away from on the eve of closing), following which the sale to Oasis was resurrected. Again, unidentified sham buyers attempted to purchase the property, or alternatively, pay the owner $250,000 not to sell to Oasis. Ultimately, Oasis purchased the property in mid-2015.

After the closing, Oasis experienced additional harassment, including graffiti on its property, as well as the dumping of significant quantities of manure there. A fence was also constructed over an easement in favor of Oasis, and a resident attempted to have Oasis' property tax exemption impaired.

In 2016, Oasis' neighbors sued, and Oasis filed a third-party complaint against defendant-neighbors and others. Oasis alleged, inter alia, interference with its easement rights and violations of the LAD. The defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which was granted by the trial court, holding, among other things, that Oasis lacked standing under the LAD and Oasis failed to plead a cognizable LAD claim. On appeal, Oasis contended the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint on these bases.

In reversing the trial court on the LAD claim, the Appellate Division held there was ""no doubt"" that Oasis had standing to assert the LAD claims on behalf of those who benefit from its charitable works. The court noted the ""claim of economic damage allegedly resulting from defendants' alleged discriminatory conduct sufficiently meets the standing required by the LAD."" The Appellate Division went further, viewing Oasis' claims broadly -- that Oasis may also incur ""stigmatic and associational damage"" -- because ""defendants' conduct may be viewed as interfering with Oasis's relationship to those who benefit from its existence and good works."" Likewise, the Appellate Division found that Oasis presented a viable LAD claim, noting the ""LAD's 'overarching goal ... is nothing less than the eradication of the cancer of discrimination.'"" Though a typical LAD claim involves a seller or landlord with a discriminatory intent, the Appellate Division noted the statute is not limited to that scenario and can include a third party's discriminatory conduct in interfering with a transaction. The Appellate Division reasoned the defendants' purported actions ""were alleged to have induced or attempted to induce a discriminatory result by interfering with the prior owner's dealings with Oasis,"" which is prohibited by the LAD.

The Oasis decision, which is precedential, adds another arrow in the quiver of those up against a NIMBY objector. Purchasers or aspiring applicants constituting a protected class now potentially have the LAD on their side when faced with discriminatory interference or sham claims that are mere subterfuge for discrimination.

But some people turn up dead nonetheless

I did not know Bryan Njoroge. I had never met him, talked to him, or encountered him online. In ordinary circumstances, I would have never heard of his death, more than 6,500 kilometres away. Yet in late June 2018, a message arrived in my inbox. Its subject read: ""Suicide (or Murder)?"" The email contained a link to a webpage showing unequivocally that someone wanted Bryan dead.

On May 29, a person calling themselves Toonbib had exchanged messages with someone they thought was a Mafia capo renting hitmen on the dark web. Toonbib had sent a picture of Njoroge in a suit, lifted from a school yearbook, and an address in Indiana where Njoroge - a soldier, who usually resided at a military base in Kentucky - would stay for a few days. ""He will only be in location from june 01 2018- june 11,"" Toonbib wrote. They paid about $5,500 in bitcoin for the hit.

The day after, Toonbib started chasing the presumed capo for an answer, which took some more time to arrive. ""I will assign an operative to your job and it will be done in about a week, is this ok? I will get back to you shortly with an estimated date,"" the capo wrote on June 1. Toonbib never answered. On June 9, Bryan Njoroge was found with a fatal gunshot wound to the head, near a baseball field in Clarksville, Indiana. His death was recorded as a suicide.

There are no hitmen in this story. There are no sharply dressed assassins screwing silencers on to their Glocks, no operatives assigned, nor capos directing them.

There is a website, though - a succession of websites, to be precise - where all those things are made out to be true. Some people fall for it. Looking for a hitman, they download Tor, a browser that uses encryption and a complex relaying system to ensure anonymity, and allows them to access the dark web, where the website exists. Under false names, the website's users complete a form to request a murder. They throw hundreds of bitcoins into the website's digital purse.

The website's admin is scamming them: no assassination is ever executed. The admin would dole out a hail of lies for why hits had been delayed, and keep the bitcoins.

But, elsewhere, someone called Chris Monteiro has been disrupting the website's operations for years, triggering its admin's wrath.

The website's admin is scamming them: no assassination is ever executed. The admin would dole out a hail of lies for why hits had been delayed, and keep the bitcoins.

But, elsewhere, someone called Chris Monteiro has been disrupting the website's operations for years, triggering its admin's wrath.

In 2016, two years before sending me the email about Njoroge, Monteiro was just a guy writing wikis. A tall man in his thirties with thick sable hair, a short beard and deep-set, dark eyes, Monteiro is a man of weird pastimes. By day, he worked as a computer system administrator for a London-based firm; by night, he turned on a six-screen desktop computer in his South London flat and spent hours plumbing the depth of the internet. He called himself a ""cybercrime and niche topic internet researcher"". He was into transhumanism, the internet-based movement advocating for human enhancement and immortality. He gave talks about the politics of sci-fi, using a slightly slurred patter. He knew a great deal about credit card fraud. But his passion was the dark web.

This was the perfect environment for scammers - impenetrable to search engines and rife with illegality. Online forums crawled with references to sentient AIs lurking in the dark web, live-streaming websites showing people being slaughtered in ""red rooms"", or dark web pages revealing the secret of the Illuminati. ""This weird fringe of the internet, it's one of the toughest areas to seek truth,"" Monteiro says.

In 2015, Monteiro started running the r/deepweb subreddit, a front row on the day-to-day happenings of the online netherworld. He documented his findings on his blog - pirate.london - and on online encyclopedias, such as Wikipedia and anti-pseudoscience website RationalWiki. He made it his mission to kill urban legends - he contributed to Wikipedia's articles on the dark web and darknet market, and created RationalWiki's pages about red rooms and runaway AIs.

He also wrote RationalWiki's article about internet assassination. The rumour that you could hire a contract killer on the dark web in exchange for bitcoin had been around since the early 2010s. That was because, unlike snuff movies and evil AIs, hitman-for-hire services were ubiquitous on the dark web. Some were structured as ""prediction markets"", with users crowdfunding the assassination of VIPs and politicians; or they could be catering to the private grudge-bearer wanting to book a hit via private chat.

Monteiro's research suggested all such websites to be either harmless trolling or scams designed to rob people of their bitcoins. He could find no evidence of anybody ever being killed by a hitman hired online, nor of any hitman working online. He wrote this all on RationalWiki. With footnotes.

Then, on February 20, 2016, an anonymous user made an edit to the internet assassination article. The edit, Monteiro says, added something to the effect of ""all assassination sites are scams, except for Besa Mafia, which is real"", appending a link to a dark web site. (The edit was permanently deleted by RationalWiki's admins at Monteiro's urging; but a subsequent modification by the same user remains in the edit history. ""An other site is Besa Mafia, a marketplace where hitmen can sign up to provide their services and where customer can order, [sic]"" the edit read. ""The site protects the customers with an escrow service that stores the bitcoin until the job is completed. They also accept external escrows."")

Monteiro understood this to be shameless self-promotion. The people running Besa Mafia, whatever that was, had seemingly vandalised his finely crafted piece of wiki-scholarship in order to shill for their assassination website. ""I went, 'What the fuck is this shit?,'"" he says. ""This is not only nonsense, it's someone promoting a scam on my article.""

He fired up Tor and went to the Besa Mafia website. Ostensibly run by Albanian gangsters (""besa"" is Albanian for ""honour""), it was littered with poor English, stock pictures of armed beefcakes, and a payment system that - far from protecting customers' bitcoin - allowed whoever ran the website to easily snatch the funds. He wrote a scathing review of Besa Mafia on his blog, calling it a scam.

A few days later, someone from Besa Mafia got in touch. ""Helo, I am one of the admins of the Besa Mafia website on deep web [sic],"" the email read. ""Would it be possible for us to pay for a true and honest positive review? Let me know if we can prove to you that we are legit."" It was signed ""Yura"".

A back-and-forth exchange ensued. Monteiro gleefully bombarded Yura with questions, punching holes in the site's business model, security and technical makeup. For Monteiro, it was obviously a scam. But, while Yura acknowledged the website's shortcomings, he maintained it was legitimate. He asked Monteiro to give Besa Mafia the benefit of the doubt. ""We are open to suggestions, we will do our best to make it the best marketplace focusing on body harm revenge and property destruction,"" Yura wrote.

As evidence, Yura offered to have someone of Monteiro's choice beaten up. He then proposed to pay a $50 monthly retainer to feature Besa Mafia banners on Monteiro's blog. When Monteiro declined both offers, Yura's tone became menacing. ""Be neutral to our website,"" he wrote. ""Unless you do that, we will pay some cheap freelancers to fill articles and submit posts and comments claiming you are undercover cop.""

Monteiro published the exchange in full on his blog, mocking Yura and Besa Mafia. Weeks later, someone left a comment: a link to a video. It started by showing an A4 sheet. """"[G]ang members for besa mafia on deep web,"" the sheet read. ""[D]edication to pirate london, 10 April 2016."" There followed some 30 seconds of darkness, rustling and metallic sounds. Finally, the camera turned towards a white car, engulfed in orange flames. The sheet was shown again, metres away from the blazing car. The video appeared to be a threat to whoever was running pirate.london.

Monteiro was horrified: he thought this was not the behaviour of a scammer. Online con artists ignore people who call them out, he thought; they don't set cars on fire to defend their reputation. ""I started questioning myself: had I pissed off a criminal organisation?"" he says. ""What the fuck had I got myself into?""

The video prompted Monteiro to contact law enforcement. At London's Charing Cross Police Station, he told the officer behind the desk that he was a cybercrime researcher - specialising in drugs, fraud and murder - and he wanted to report a darknet assassin threatening him with videos of flaming cars. ""I just wanted to get this on the record,"" Monteiro recalls.

The officer was perplexed. Weeks later, the case was passed on to the Metropolitan Police's cybersecurity unit, Falcon Team. Monteiro maintains that nothing came out of it: he says that the officer said that the car did not seem to have been destroyed in the UK and was therefore out of the Met's jurisdiction.

Monteiro also attempted to contact the UK National Crime Agency (NCA) - but, he would later realise, he mistyped the email address and the message was not delivered. (The NCA doesn't send bounce-back notifications.)

Monteiro resolved to explore the Besa Mafia website himself. He created a customer account, calling himself Boaty McBoatFace and requested a hit on a fictional person he called Bob the Builder. In doing so, he spotted a way to gather intelligence on the website: each message sent on the platform was assigned a unique numeric ID. By combining message IDs with the website's url, Monteiro discovered that he could read every other user's messages. Exploiting this vulnerability, he downloaded Besa Mafia's entire message database and examined its archive.

Sure enough, Besa Mafia was a scam. Every conversation followed an identical template. Customers submitted the details of the person they wanted killed and the method they preferred - for instance, a hit that looked like an accident would be more expensive. To prove they had the wherewithal to pay, they were required to make an advance bitcoin transfer to a digital wallet - from which, the website assured, its clients would be able to withdraw their funds any time.

Yura would claim to take swift action, before a period of prevarication: the hitman had been stopped for a traffic violation, or for illegal possession of a gun. A more professional assassin could be hired, but that would cost more bitcoin. Some customers kept paying, as Yura led them on for months. Others requested a refund, which never came. Yura kept all the bitcoin.

But Besa Mafia was more than just any run-of-the-mill scam: Monteiro realised that it was a fully fledged fake news operation.

Yura devoted a lot of energy to defending the website's credibility. A California-based person going by name Thcjohn2 had written to the website offering his services as an assassin. ""[I] am broke (of course), and am looking for quick cash,"" Thcjohn2 wrote. ""I have military training (US Navy)."" Instead of taking him up on his offer, Yura had asked Thcjohn2 to make videos of burning cars to intimidate Monteiro and other critics. He then asked him to enact and video a fake murder, with the help of a friend and a replica gun. In the following months, several videos of balaclava-clad thugs firing guns and talking up Yura's assassination websites would pop up online.

Yura had also set up a galaxy of micro-websites on the regular web, which spread the word about Besa Mafia under the pretence of denunciating it. Yura had hired freelance SEO experts, who had optimised the sites to ensure that they appeared first in search results for ""hitman for hire"" and similar word combinations. One such freelancer, a Kolkata-based consultant called Santosh Sharma, told me in July 2018 that Yura - who had used the name of Andreeab when dealing with him - had paid him in bitcoin. ""He was based in Romania,"" he said. Sharma says that he is no longer working for Yura.

The marketing strategy seemed to have paid off. After working his way through Besa Mafia's messages, Monteiro had proof he was right about the site being a scam - but that was little consolation. ""It was a fully functioning operation,"" he says. ""People had been buying it.""

And there was a flipside to the scam: the message archive was essentially a kill list - of targets, of conflicts, and instigators. Of people who other people wanted to kill. Yura had no hitmen to deploy, Monteiro thought, but what if some of the website's customers decided to take matters into their own hands, and kill their target themselves? Could this archive be evidence - or even be used to pre-empt murders?

""Most scams aren't dangerous or don't feature dangerous people,"" Monteiro says. ""If you get ripped off by a 'Nigerian prince', you're not dangerous - just stupid. This scam was different, fundamentally different, from any scam I had seen before. The people who are using it are the dangerous people, more than the scammer himself. The clients are the bad guys.""

The website attracted customers from every corner of the world. There were some trolls who put in joke requests, but most users were serious. Someone wanted his wife's lover killed, his organs sold to get a discount on the hit, and the woman herself smuggled into Saudi Arabia; a Dutch user paid 20 bitcoin to have someone flattened in a fake cycling accident; a person in Minnesota had spent four months chatting with Yura about how to get a mother-of-one murdered.

Monteiro turned for help to a friend of his - a scammer-baiter who adopted the nom de guerre Judge Judy - and together they created a program to systematically scrape messages from Besa Mafia. Judge Judy was solely interested in disrupting Yura's business. Monteiro, instead, started compiling a list of the most dangerous users, ranked by how much they paid and how determined to see the murder through they appeared. Sometimes, he used information in the correspondence to find out the website users' identities; but he decided against getting in touch with the targets mentioned in the messages, or leaking the archive online. ""I was hoping to work with the police, and what I didn't want to be was a hacker who destroys evidence,"" he says. ""What if [the users] realised they were exposed, and had hidden?""

He says he tried to get the police involved - again, with little success. He claims that the Met referred him to the NCA, which didn't answer his calls or messages; the National Counter Terrorism Security Office said that the matter was out of its jurisdiction; the FBI suggested that he talk with the NCA.

On July 3, 2016, Monteiro and Judge Judy launched ""Operation Vegetable"". It was the third hack Besa Mafia had suffered in four months. It would also be the final - and decisive - one.

In late April 2016, a hacker known as bRspd had infected the website by uploading a malicious file instead of the picture of a target. In that way, the hacker seized the website's message archive, its user IDs, passwords, server passwords and admin emails; then dumped the whole lot on the internet. The hack - together with a second, nearly identical attack bRspd carried out in June - set several events in motion.

Yura reassured his customers that the leak was not a big deal. ""We are not a scam. There are no bitcoin lost. Our website got hacked, but hackers only got information about some users,"" Yura wrote in a message to a customer. ""[T]hey did not stoled any bitcoin."" Meanwhile, he set about launching a new, rebranded website.

Some media outlets covered the leak and Monteiro gave interviews on the matter - something that, in hindsight, put his name on Yura's radar.

Together with Judge Judy, Monteiro planned to build on bRspd's work to bring Yura down for good. Using information from bRspd's dump, the two managed to hack into the website; Monteiro even obtained access to Yura's Gmail. There, he snooped through the admin's correspondence. He found emails in which Yura talked about buying a much-needed English course, messages to freelancers about advertising and shill sites, and data on bitcoin payments. Combining this information with the content of the two bRspd leaks, the duo obtained the cryptographic keys controlling access to Besa Mafia's website domain. ""Me and my mate said, 'Well, we appear to have access,'"" Monteiro explains. ""Let's take the website down.""

There was no long-term plan or complex rationale behind the decision. ""I just wanted to disrupt the operation,"" Monteiro says. ""It was also a personal revenge. I can talk about the greater good... but it's personal. It's many things - my individual focus shifts day to day.""

Monteiro describes ""Operation Vegetable"", as a carefully planned ""Ocean's Eleven-style"" mission. They copied all of Besa Mafia's content - and saved it, Monteiro says, with a view to giving it to the police - and shut the website down, redirecting users to a site they had built. The new page showed the picture of a closed, rusty door. Under the Besa Mafia logo, they left a message:

""Besa Mafia has closed for business

After 6 months of scamming criminals for their bitcoins and stealing over 100 BTC ($65.000) the site has closed

No one was ever beaten up or killed ""

In the background, the website played that tune from The Sound of Music, ""So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye.""

At Monteiro's place, he and Judge Judy uncorked a bottle of champagne.

Evidence of the first murder linked to Besa Mafia emerged shortly after Monteiro met up with two police officers and seven months after Besa Mafia's takedown.

In January 2017, Monteiro managed to establish contact with the NCA through a friend who knew someone in the organisation's intelligence unit. After some email exchanges with an operative - who did not use his real name - Monteiro was invited for a confidential meeting in central London.

For more than an hour, Monteiro told the officers about the material he had come across after penetrating the website's messaging system - wannabe organ harvesters, mutilation requests, people aspiring to commit matricide. He suggested that the targets should be told what was going on and flagged up that Yura, undeterred by the Besa fiasco, was now operating a new assassination market, called Crime Bay. It used the same source code as Besa Mafia, which conveniently allowed Monteiro to continue to read the site's correspondence.

Monteiro claims that the officers said they would be in touch again for an information handover, but did not ask him to show them the data he had brought to the meeting, which was on his laptop. The only document they consulted was an A3 printout on which Monteiro had summarised the intricacies of Besa Mafia's operation.

Part timeline, part list, part flow chart, the document included a breakdown of the various hacks and dumps the website had suffered, and even a top 10 of the website's most dangerous users - in a fully wikified format. Always the wikipedian, Monteiro had begun to structure his trove of Besa Mafia-related information in a password-protected BesaWiki. One of the ""most wanted"" users on Monteiro's A3 was someone who went by the name of Dogdaygod.

Dogdaygod first messaged Yura in February 2016. He was eager to kill a woman living in Cottage Grove, Minnesota. He was open-minded about the method - initially pushing for a hit-and-run, or a deliberate traffic collision, but later suggesting rasher systems, such as shooting the target and burning her house down.

Dogdaygod displayed a virulent animosity towards his target. ""I need this bitch dead, so please help me,"" he wrote. Yura had egged him on: ""Yes she is really a bitch and she deserve to die."" The conversation went on for months, coming to an abrupt conclusion when Dogdaygod - tired of Yura's increasingly implausible pretexts for why the hit had not been carried out - requested a refund.

""Unfortunately, this site has been hacked,"" the admin had responded. He pretended to be the hacker, hoping to stop Dogdaygod from badgering him, and make some money on the side. ""We got all customer and target information and we will send it to law enforcement unless you send 10 bitcoin,"" he wrote. That happened on May 20, 2016.

On May 31, 2016, about a month after the bRspd leak, the FBI contacted Amy Allwine, a woman living at the Minnesota address Dogdaygod had submitted to Besa Mafia. Amy and her husband Stephen Allwine - an IT specialist and a deacon at a local church - met with officers who informed them that someone had paid at least $6,000 on the dark web to murder Amy. The Allwines said they had no idea of who could be hiding behind the Dogdaygod persona.

Six months later, Amy Allwine was dead. On November 13, her husband called 911 and said he had found her body in her bedroom. ""I think my wife shot herself,"" he told the operator.

However, the police found evidence that linked Stephen Allwine to the murder: traces of bitcoin transactions on his devices, cookies for dark web-related websites, the fact that Dogdaygod had tried to buy the anaesthetic scopolamine on the darknet - and that high doses of the substance had been found in Amy's system.

In January 2017 Allwine - aka Dogdaygod - was charged with his wife's murder. In court, prosecutors pointed to a series of affairs - and the fact that Stephen was the only beneficiary of Amy's $700,000 life insurance policy - as probable motives. Allwine was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison in February 2018.

Monteiro says that he was devastated when Allwine was arrested. Up to that point, the idea that he could have saved lives - that the kill list he had been frantically trying to hand to law enforcement had a portentous power - had essentially been a thought experiment.

""I had been thinking: 'Well, these are horrible, terrible people, who, if you don't arrest them, maybe will take the matters into their own hands,'"" he says. ""I thought that was hypothetical. But then it really happened."" He texted his NCA contact about the development; the officer reassured him that they would look into the matter urgently.

Weeks went by. One Friday night in early February, Monteiro was at home sipping pumpkin soup in front of his computer's six glowing screens. His desk was strewn with tokens of geekery: a self-destruction-style red button; a stuffed Bulbasaur; a parody ""Maybot user's guide"". Monteiro walked across his beige-carpeted living room, towards the front door: he had heard a strange noise. Seconds later, a red battering ram smashed through the white door and armed police officers rushed in. They pushed Monteiro against the wall and handcuffed him. Seizing his computer, they took pictures of the room and asked him for his devices' passwords. After about 15 minutes, they put Monteiro into the back of a van and drove him to the nearest police station.

At the station, an NCA officer told him he had been arrested for incitement to murder, in connection with Besa Mafia.

It appeared that Monteiro had been arrested on the basis of a misinformation campaign.

There had been warning signs for a while, at least since the point at which Yura had threatened to expose him as a cop. In June 2016, when Monteiro hacked into Yura's Gmail account, he had noticed that the scammer had created email addresses under the name of Chris Monteiro and Eileen Ormsby, an Australian journalist who had also written about Besa Mafia.

Over the following months, Yura had instructed his detail of freelancers to create websites peddling fake news about Ormsby's and Monteiro's involvement in the assassination marketplace. They were WordPress blogs, not excessively sophisticated, but strong on SEO. Some had seemingly caught the NCA's eye: the application for the warrant to search Monteiro's flat referenced one of these blogs as evidence.

""Open source reporting shows that Chris MONTEIRO and two other subjects created the Hit Man for Hire website 'Besa Mafia' on the Dark Web https://hackeddatabaseofbesamafia.wordpress.com/,"" the document read.

It was imperative to search Monteiro's place, the application for the warrant continued, because, as the presumed site's admin, he might be in possession of more victim data and criminal evidence.

Monteiro spent almost two days in a custody suite, working himself up, pacing the cell and paging through the only book he could get his hands on - a golfer's autobiography.

Over the course of several interviews with the officers who had arrested him, Monteiro understood that the NCA agents he had spoken with some weeks earlier had not told their colleagues that he was collaborating with them - and that, far from being Yura's accomplice, he claimed to be his self-appointed nemesis. Monteiro says that, as he didn't know his NCA contact's full name and he didn't have access to his devices while in custody, he could not immediately prove his dealings with the agency.

For Monteiro, the interrogations were a mix of blundering and black comedy. He had to explain the story of Boaty McBoatFace's taking a hit on Bob the Builder. At some point, the person questioning him asked Monteiro about a copy of stealth videogame Hitman found in his flat, implying that it could have been an inspiration for Besa Mafia.

Eventually, Monteiro succeeded in explaining to the agents that they should look at the BesaWiki on his computer. There, they would find everything they needed: target names, messages, data on bitcoin payments, server IPs and information on how to backdoor the Crime Bay website. At midnight, on Sunday February 5, Monteiro was released on bail.

He went back to his flat and guessed he'd have to change the door's frame. Monteiro stayed at Judge Judy's place that night. They played N.W.A's song ""Fuck tha Police"".

In June 2017, the police informed Monteiro's lawyer that no further action would be taken.

Shortly after, the NCA launched an international operation. They tracked down several Besa Mafia users and charged them with conspiracy to commit a crime.

In March 2017, they arrested David Crichton, a British doctor who had ordered a hit on his former financial advisor. Crichton did not pay the website, though, and later said he had put in the order just out of frustration; Crichton was cleared of any wrongdoing in July 2018. Another Crime Bay user in Denmark, an Italian-born woman called Emanuela Consortini, was arrested thanks to an NCA tip-off and then sentenced to six years in jail for commissioning the murder of an ex-boyfriend. The Crime Bay website was eventually shut down by the NCA and the Bulgarian police in May 2017 and Monteiro assumed that Yura had been found and jailed. Monteiro stopped researching the matter.

Then, in December 2017, he received an email from Yura. The scammer accused Monteiro of being immoral: his exposing of Besa Mafia as a scam could have caused users to stop wasting time and resources on the website and kill their targets themselves. He called Monteiro Amy Allwine's real killer. ""How is Yura sending me emails?,"" Monteiro thought. ""How is he not in jail?""

The full extent of the situation emerged in early 2018 when CBS's 48 Hours approached Monteiro regarding the Allwine case. They wanted to interview him about his run-in with Yura.

While preparing for the interview, Monteiro discovered that Yura had launched a new website, Cosa Nostra, and adopted a new persona - Italian capo ""Barbosa"". Monteiro's exploit still worked and he could read all the messages between Yura/Barbosa and his customers, just as he did back in 2016.

For some time, Monteiro entertained the hypothesis that the new website may be a police decoy. But it seemed unlikely: when Monteiro started providing CBS with details about conversations from Cosa Nostra, it would always be CBS's subsequent tip to the local police force that triggered investigations and arrests. ""I started realising that people were getting arrested directly as a result of the information I supplied,"" he says. CBS's tips led to arrests in Singapore, Illinois and Texas. When Monteiro passed me some documents about customers in the UK, I forwarded the details to police stations in Edinburgh and Oxfordshire.

Monteiro tried again to pass the matter to the police. He had his lawyer email the NCA, telling them about murderous plots hatched on Yura's website, which was continuously rebranded - Cosa Nostra, Sicilian Hitmen, Camorra Hitmen, Ndrangheta Hitmen, Yakuza Mafia, Bratva Mafia. Through his lawyer, the NCA advised Monteiro to call their hotline to report possible offences; they warned him about using illicit means to access the assassination markets' correspondence.

""The threat posed by so-called assassination markets is going to be pretty small in comparison to other things we deal with,"" an NCA spokesperson told me. ""We aren't monitoring the website [and] there have been no arrests. However, we work closely with our international law enforcement partners to share information and intelligence,"" a second spokesperson later added.

That leaves Monteiro stuck with the list and an apparent strong urge to act, by sending the most plausible cases to the media. ""I want to create a bit of a splash about this thing,"" Monteiro says. ""Selfishly, I want to give talks [about assassination markets], and use it as a platform to put further pressure on the police."" But he also feels that he has a duty to try and act on the information he retrieves. ""I can't stop because there are people's lives at risk. Imagine you'd looked into a box and the act of looking into that box changed you. You can choose not to look into that box. But you knew that something would still be going on: the box is full of horrors. Should you look? Should you not look?""

Monteiro keeps looking. He set up Google alerts for every target's name - in case something happens to them, even if the authorities have been alerted. That's how he spotted the news about Bryan Njoroge in a local Indiana outlet, the News and Tribune.

According to Clarksville PD's case reports, on June 8, Njoroge, a 21-year-old Texan on leave from the Fort Knox base, stole a gun from a shooting range, American Shooters, in the town's north-west. Njoroge was found dead in the early hours of June 9, face down under the stairs of an announcer's box on a baseball field. The coroner quickly established that he had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The case was closed within days.

Whoever ordered the hit on Yura's scam website knew that Bryan would be in Indiana on those days; more specifically, they knew he would stay at a specific Airbnb, the address of which was included in the order instructions. Njoroge's father, Samwel, confirmed to me that his son had booked that Airbnb.

""We're done with the case,"" the officer in charge of the investigation at Clarksville PD, detective Ray Hall, told me in August. He said that he had already received a tip about the Toonbib conversation and that nevertheless had found ""no factual evidence"" of anything other than a suicide taking place.

Samwel Njoroge told me that the police had never mentioned the assassination market when talking with him about the case. He was not happy with how his son death's had been investigated, pointing to what he thought were inconsistencies between the case report detailing the discovery of the body and the autopsy, and underlining that the fatal bullet has never been found. (A forensic pathologist told me that bullets often go unretrieved in suicide cases.)

Samwel added that Bryan's computer, camera and two phones had vanished, which is strange, as Bryan - a small-time Instagram and YouTube celebrity - was inseparable from his devices. He also mentioned that his son had a $400,000 life insurance policy; Njoroge had changed the beneficiary - designating a female friend instead of his parents - just a month before dying.

Samwel said he did not know whether someone else could have been travelling with Bryan, or known about his trip to Indiana.

We know little about Yura: he (everyone I spoke to who had interacted with Yura believed him to be a man) boasts to have made a lot of money - which is possible, especially in light of last year's spike in bitcoin price; he claims to be Albanian, but Santosh Sharma's recollection and Monteiro's IP analysis of Yura's comments on wikis link him to Romania; Eileen Ormsby, who has had multiple email conversations with him, believes that Yura is likely to be in his twenties.

Maybe the most interesting question, though, is whether Yura, aka Barbosa, is a police informer. He certainly tries to style himself as one of the good guys. When we exchanged emails he implored me not to say that his website was a scam.

""If you intend to report hitmen scams, you are basically siding up with those would be murderers, helping them to avoid scams and traps and helping them to find other means to do their kill,"" Yura/Barbosa wrote. ""[It] is a moral right to scam criminals and would be murderers if this helps saving victims.""

He signed off his messages ""Barbosa, Lifesaver"".

His defence is that he is a hindrance to potential murderers' plans, robbing them of precious time and money. More significantly, he said that he was giving all target information to the police, and maintained that he has been working with the FBI.

""After Besa Mafia was hacked, FBI agent talked with me on chat on site. He told me they don't want to arrest me, they are not after me, they want to arrest the murderers,"" Yura/Barbosa, wrote. ""They don't care about a scammer. They care about murderers.""

Yura refused to provide evidence of his communications with the FBI, as that would prove that his website is a scam. Pleading with me not to report that, he offered to hand over the names of all the targets. He finally said he would deny ever speaking to me if I wrote that his business was a scam.

What Yura said was a blend of facts, factoids and lies. It is true that Yura has passed information to journalists who approach him in order to establish his credentials as a good-hearted scammer: he handed two cases to CBS, which then turned them over to the police, triggering investigations and arrests.

And some conversations in the bRspd dump do show that Yura had contacts with someone claiming to work for the FBI's Dallas office as early as 2016. The FBI declined to confirm or deny whether it had ever worked with Yura.

Other things Yura says are untrue. He maintains to have never condoned violence, but there is evidence of his trying to pressgang Thcjohn2, the wannabe hitman, into committing an assault - which apparently never materialised.

His overall narrative of being a killer-baiter in shining armour doesn't hold water. bRspd, the hacker who in 2016 twice broke into Besa Mafia's website, told me over private chat that he had approached Yura about turning Besa Mafia into an actual honeypot for criminals. ""I was trying to work with him by making the website better and more secured [sic] and instead of scamming we could really help people to identify these criminals and etc by collecting more data & NOT stealing people money,"" bRspd wrote in September.

According to bRspd, Yura refused. ""He was just thirsty for money,"" bRspd told me. ""He's a big liar, he doesn't care about anything but money. Almost all the conversations I had with him included the word 'money' or [bitcoin]."" According to Monteiro's analysis of Besa Mafia's bitcoin wallets, Yura might have amassed nearly £5m.

bRspd added that the notion that Yura was working with the police was - at least as of 2016 - ""totally false"".

In general, though, does Yura have a point? Without his scamming, some lives would have been at risk and some people plotting murders would still be around. Without Yura, neither Monteiro nor law enforcement nor journalists would have ever heard of Stephen ""Dogdaydog"" Allwine in Minnesota, the man in Singapore, or the woman in Denmark. Yura's greed, tenacity and SEO strategy had unwittingly created a tool to perceive the intentions of would-be criminals.

I posited the question to Monteiro over a beer in a London pub. Was Yura providing a service to the community?

The matter, Monteiro argued, boiled down to a philosophical debate between virtue and consequentialism. Yura could make the case that his website was being used to jail criminals. But he was doing that by inciting murder, by egging criminals on and by spreading lies - about hitmen, about other people and about the dark web.

The whole Besa Mafia sorry saga, Monteiro says, started because he wanted to cleanse the public sphere of lies. ""I set out to bump off fake news. I wanted to explain the dark web, establish facts and fiction, explain what's real and what's not,"" he says. ""That's my higher purpose - you know?""

Updated 05.12.2018, 10.13 GMT: This article has been amended to correct a date in the Toonbib correspondence: Barbosa replied on June 1, not June 6."

In a new twist to the Unnao rape case that grabbed national headlines, an FIR has been lodged against the victim, her mother and uncle for falsely claiming she was a minor.

Police said that the victim and her kin forged documents to portray her as a minor in police documents. A case has been filed against the family under Sections 419 (punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code.

The FIR was registered at Unnao's Makhi police station on December 23. The order came from a local court, based on a petition filed by Haripal Singh. Singh's wife Shashi and son Shubham are accused in the rape case and have been in jail since April along with the main accused Bharatiya Janata Party legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

Sengar, a four-time MLA who enjoys immense clout in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao, was charged by the CBI with raping a girl at his residence in Makhi village on June 4 last year. The girl was again abducted and raped by a separate group of accused between June 11 and June 20, 2017.

In the complaint, Singh has alleged that victim had an affair with a man named Awadesh Tewari and eloped with him in September 2017, following which her family started forcing Haripal's son Shubham to marry her when she returned. When Shubham refused to marry her, the family filed a case against him and his mother on charges of kidnapping as well as under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.

He also alleges that the victim's kin forged her date of birth, presenting a certificate from a school in Raebareli as proof. The certificate allegedly contains forged signatures of the Basic Shiksha Adhikari of the district as well as the school principal. Singh has claimed that both parties have denied signing the certificate.

Unnao rape case

The victim has alleged that on June 4, 2017, she was raped by BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar at his residence when she had gone to meet him, along with Shashi Singh, seeking a job.

In February, the girl's family had moved the court, seeking to include the MLA's name in the case. The state police registered a case on April 12, 2018, on the day of handing over the probe to the CBI.

Subsequently, the victim's father was booked by the police under the Arms Act on April 3 and put in jail on April 5 where he died on April 9, 2018.

A video, purportedly showing the victim's father before his death accusing the MLA's brother of assaulting him had gone viral. Sengar's brother Atul Singh, was arrested along with four others, by the UP Crime Branch, for allegedly thrashing the victim's father.

Frustrated with the alleged police inaction and coercion from influential people, the minor victim had attempted self-immolation in front of Chief Minister Adityanath's residence on April 8, 2018.

The inaction by the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government against its own MLA drew scathing criticism from the Allahabad High Court.

The state government transferred the case to the CBI nearly 10 months after the crime. Sengar was arrested by the CBI on April 13 and has been in judicial custody since then. A second arrest in the case was made on April 14 when Shashi Singh, who had taken the victim to Sengar's house, was held.

arises is as regards the power of the Disciplinary Authority in the instant case

being the Hon'ble the Chief Justice, the Hon'ble Judges of this Court to

institute the disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner. There can be no

dispute about the fact that the Maharashtra Civil Services Rules are applicable.

A useful reference could be made to Rule 8(1) and (2) of the said Rules which

are relevant for the purpose of the present Petition:

8. Procedure for imposing major penalties:(

1)

No order imposing any of the major penalties

shall be made except after an inquiry held, as far

as may be, in the manner provided in this rule

and Rule 9, or where such inquiry is held under

the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850 (37 of

1850) in the manner provided in that Act.

(2) Whenever the disciplinary authority is of the

opinion that there are grounds for inquiring into

the truth of any imputation of misconduct or

misbehaviour against a Government servant, it

may itself inquire into, or appoint under this rule

or under the provisions of the Public Servants

(Inquiries) Act, 1850, as the case may be, an

authority to inquire into the truth thereof.

Provided that, where there is a complaint of

sexual harassment within the meaning of Rule 22A

of Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules

1979, the Complaints Committee established in

each Department or Office for inquiring into such

complaints, shall be deemed to be the inquiring

authority appointed by the disciplinary authority

for the purpose of these rules and the Complaints

Committee shall hold, if separate procedure has

not been prescribed for the Complaints

Committee for holding the inquiry into the

complaints for sexual harassments, the inquiry as

for as practicable in accordance with the

procedure laid down in these rules.

ExplanationWhere

a disciplinary authority

itself holds an inquiry under this rule, any

reference to an inquiring authority in this rule

shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be

construed as reference to the disciplinary

authority.

A reading of the said Rule 8(2) therefore discloses that the

discretion is of the Disciplinary Authority if it is of the opinion that there are

grounds for inquiring into the truth of any imputation of misconduct or

misbehaviour against a Government servant. Hence the said Rule (2) can be

said to confer a wide discretion in the Disciplinary Authority in the matter of

inquiring into the truth of any misconduct or misbehaviour against the

Government servant.

12 Now coming to the guide lines which have been formulated by the

Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India which are comprised in the letter dated 3102014

they read thus:A.

The complaint making allegations against

members of the Subordinate Judiciary in the

States should not be entertained and no action

should be taken thereon, unless it is accompanies

by a duly sworn Affidavit and verifiable material

to substantiate the allegations made therein.

B. If action on such complaint meeting the

above requirement is deemed necessary,

authenticity of complaint should be duly

ascertained and further steps thereon should be

taken only after satisfaction of the competent

authority designated by the Chief Justice of the

High Court.

C. If the above requirements are not complied

with, the complaint should be filed/lodged

without taking any steps thereon.

The said guidelines were modified and communicated vide letter

dated 1632017

issued by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice Of India. The

modification carried out which is relevant for the purposes of the present

Petition is in clause (A). The modified clause (A) reads thus:

A. The complaint making allegations against

members of the Subordinate Judiciary in the

States should not be entertained and no action

should be taken thereon, unless it is accompanied

by a duly sworn Affidavit and/or verifiable

material to substantiate the allegations made

therein.

(emphasis supplied)

13 Hence by modification the requirement is that a complaint should

be accompanied by duly sworn affidavit and/or verifiable material to

substantiate the allegations made therein. Hence a complaint can be

entertained in two contingencies one is when a complaint is accompanied by a

duly sworn affidavit and second is when the complaint contains verifiable

material. It is in the light of the said modification that the instant case would

have to be considered. The said modification being in the matter of the

procedure which is required to be followed prior to holding a Departmental

Enquiry, the same would obviously relate back to the date of issuance of the

show cause notice, even if the notice is prior to the issuance of the

modification.

ORDINARY ORIGINAL CIVIL JURISDICTION

WRIT PETITION NO.643 OF 2017

Asif Badremunir Tahasildar Vs. State of Maharashtra

CORAM :R. M. SAVANT, &

SARANG V KOTWAL, JJ

PRONOUNCED ON : 4th MAY, 2018

Citation: 2018(6) MHLJ 850

JUDGMENT (PER R.M.SAVANT J.)

1 By the above Writ Petition No.643 of 2017 the Petitioner is

challenging the order dated 1572016,

(Exhibit N) by which order the

Learned Registrar General of this Court has informed the Petitioner that the

Disciplinary Authority in exercise of the powers conferred by Subrule

5(c) of

Rule 8 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules 1979,

has decided to hold a Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. By the

orders passed on the same date, the Enquiry Officer was also appointed to

enquire into the charges.

In so far as the Writ Petition No.692 of 2017 is concerned, the said

Writ Petition also challenges the order dated 1572016,

(Exhibit D) which

order is to the same effect as the order impugned in the above Writ Petition

No.643 of 2017. By a separate order passed on the said date an Enquiry

Officer has also been appointed to looked into the charges which are the

subject matter of the second Departmental Enquiry.

2 Since the Petitions involve a common question as to whether the

Departmental Enquiry could be commenced against the Petitioner in the

absence of a written complaint supported by an affidavit, both the Petitions are

heard together and are being disposed of together.

3 The facts giving rise to the above Petitions can in brief be stated

thus:

WRIT PETITION NO.643 OF 2017

The Petitioner was appointed as a Civil Judge Junior Division.

The Petitioner at the relevant time in the context of the Departmental Enquiry

was working as a Civil Judge Junior Division in Bhokardan District Jalna. A

complaint was received from one Mr. Teple against the Petitioner concerning

his tenure as Civil Judge Junior Division, Bhokardan District Jalna. By the said

complaint disciplinary action was sought against the Petitioner. The then

Learned Principal District Judge, Jalna forwarded the said complaint to the

Registrar General of this Court. The complaint was placed before the

Disciplinary Committee. The Disciplinary Committee comprising of the

Hon'ble Judges of this Court directed the Learned Principal District Judge

Jalna to conduct a fact finding enquiry. The report of the fact finding enquiry

was thereafter placed before the Disciplinary Committee who decided to

initiate a Disciplinary Enquiry against the Petitioner. The Petitioner was

accordingly issued a show cause notice along with the memo of charges and

statement of imputations. The Petitioner submitted his reply to the said show

cause notice. The matter was placed before the Disciplinary Committee who

considered the entire material including the reply submitted by the Petitioner,

as the said reply was found not satisfactory, the Disciplinary Committee

decided to hold a regular Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. It is by

the impugned communication dated 1572016

that the Petitioner was

communicated the said decision which as indicated above is the subject matter

of the above Writ Petition.

WRIT PETITION NO.692 OF 2017

4 Information was received by the Learned Principal District Judge,

Kolhapur as regards the incident which had taken place on 1672015

involving the Petitioner. In the said incident the Petitioner had allegedly

assaulted the bus driver of the school bus of his daughter and thereafter

threatened the driver and the owner of the bus that he would involve them in

a case under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and put them behind

bars for a period of 4 days. Pursuant to the said information which the

Learned Principal District Judge Kolhapur had received, he directed the

Learned District Judge3,

Kolhapur to conduct a discreet enquiry in respect of

the said incident. The Learned District Judge3

proceeded to Ajara, District

Kolhapur which was the place of posting of the Petitioner and conducted a

discreet enquiry in respect of the said incident which had allegedly taken place

on 1672015.

In the course of the said discreet enquiry, the Learned District

Judge3

recorded the statements of the driver, owner of the school bus and

some other persons and accordingly submitted his report to the Learned

Principal District Judge. The Learned Principal District Judge upon receipt of

the said report in turn submitted his report to the Learned Registrar General of

this Court. The matter was thereafter placed before the Disciplinary

Committee of this Court. Thereafter on 512016

the Disciplinary Committee

considered the said report and decided to initiate disciplinary action against

the Petitioner. The Petitioner was served with a show cause notice with the

articles of charges and statement of imputations. The Petitioner has filed his

reply to the said show cause notice on 1752016.

The matter was placed

before the Disciplinary Committee along with the Petitioner's reply and the

report of the Learned Principal District Judge. As the Petitioner's reply was not

found to be satisfactory, the Disciplinary Committee decided to initiate regular

Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner which decision was

communicated to the Petitioner by the impugned order dated 1572016.

As

indicated above by an order passed on the same day the Enquiry Officer was

also appointed to looked into the charges alleged against the Petitioner.

5 At this stage it would be relevant to refer to the charges which are

alleged against the Petitioner. The said charges are reproduced hereinunder:

WRIT PETITION NO.643 O F 2017

(First Departmental Enquiry)

Charge1

That during your tenure at Bhokardhan you were

staying in rented house owned by Shri Bismilla

Khan Mahetab Khan r/o Bhokardhan. In your

letter dated 08.04.2010 addressed to Executive

Engineer, P. W. D., Jalna you had informed the

Executive Engineer that as no Government

accommodation was available for you at

Bhokardhan, the Principal District Judge, Jalna

had granted permission to you to stay in private

accommodation on rental basis. Accordingly you

had acquired house of Shri Bismilla Khan

Mahetab Khan at Bhokardhan on rent of

Rs.6,000/and

requested him to issue Certificate

in that regard. The copy of said letter was also

addressed to the SubDivisional

Officer, P. W. D.,

Jalna. After the dispatch of the said letter

addressed to the Executive Engineer, P.W.D. Jalna,

you had carried out correction in your own

handwriting by rewriting

the figure Rs.5,000/as

Rs.6,000/and

in words Rupees Five thousand

as Rupees Six thousand. As per your oral

direction the SubDivisional

Officer, P. W. D., Jalna

also made correction in copy of your letter

addressed to him. However, in the office copy

maintained by the office, no such corrections

have been carried out and the amount of rent is

written as Rs.5000/per

month in figures as well

as in words. Thus by misusing your official

position you had made corrections in forwarding

letter later on for your personal benefit.

Charge2

That you had submitted medical bill of

Rs.20,513/regarding

treatment of your wife,

Smt. Najnin Tahasildar for reimbursement. In

order to get medical reimbursement bill you

produced false documents i.e. ""Mata Balak

Saurakshan Card (ANC Card) purporting to be

signed by the Medical Officer, Rural Health

Centre, Bhokhardhan, and that by producing such

false documents you obtained the amount of

Rs.20,513/on

22.11.2010, you thus not only

produced false document but used the said false

document (ANC Card) for encashing medical bill

knowing that it was a false document and thereby

caused wrongful gain to yourself and wrongful

loss to the state exchequer and thereby

committed gross misconduct.

Charge3

That from 08.02.02010 till 03042010

you

were stationed at Jalna for training, as per the

letter dated 17.10.2012 of the District Court,

Jalna (tk-dz-@vkLFkk 6266@2012) you had sought

permission to leave headquarters for going to

Bhokardhan only on 14.03.2010 and 24.03.2010.

That during the crossexamination

in the

departmental enquiry NO.03/2011 initiated

against Shri K. E. Teple, Junior Clerk, Civil Court,

Bhokardhan you deposed ""gs Eg.kus [kjs ukgh dh] eh

ekb&;k iRuhyk xzkeh.k #X.kky; Hkksdjnu ;sFks fn-09-02-2010 o

06-03-2010 jksth ?ksmu xsyks ukgh"" Thus you either made

false statement in the crossexamination

in the

abovesaid departmental enquiry or on

09.02.2010 and 06.03.2010 you went to P. H.C.,

Bhokardhan, without seeking permission from

the principal District Judge, Jalna to leave the

headquarter on the abovesaid dates. You, thereby

failed to maintain absolute integrity and devotion

to duty by indulging in most inappropriate

behaviour.

WRIT PETITION NO.692 OF 2017

(Second Departmental Enquiry)

Charge1

That on 16.07.2015 at 8.15 a.m. one Shri

Ashok Laxman Lohar, Driver of school van

reached your bungalow to pickup your daughter

Ms. Layba for school. After waiting there for five

minutes, the driver Shri Ashok started the van.

Thereafter you immediately came out of your

house and started abusing and beating the said

driver. When he tried to run away, your servant

caught him and presented him before you then

you again beat him by kick and fist blows. Your

abovesaid misbehaviour shows that you failed to

maintain judicial discipline or propriety and you

conducted yourself in a manner unbecoming of a

Judicial Officer and brought great disrepute to

the institution as a whole.

Charge2

After the said incident you called Shri Vijay

Jyotiba Kesarkar and Shri Stephen, owners of the

vehicle and Shri Ashok Lohar, Driver, during

office hours i.e. 11.00 a.m. in the court, talked

rudely with them and threatened them that you

will detain them for four days. When they

apologized, you threatened them that you would

file complaint against them by calling the officer

of Education Department. You further threatened

them that you will file complaint against them

under section 307 of I.P.C. to the effect that they

were in the van and they purposely tried to run

over him. Your abovesaid misbehaviour shows

that you failed to maintain judicial discipline or

propriety and you conducted yourself in a

manner unbecoming of a Judicial Officer and

brought great disrepute to the institution as a

whole.

Charge3

That you misused your position to make

Shri Vijay J. Kesarkar and Ashok Lohar to take

back the statements given by them during the

preliminary enquiry and accordingly both of them

filed application to withdraw their statements

recorded during the enquiry. You thus failed to

maintain absolute integrity by indulging in most

inappropriate behaviour.

Hence the allegations against the Petitioner in the Second

Departmental Enquiry are two fold, one is the alleged assault of the driver of

the school bus by the Petitioner and the second is the threat given by the

Petitioner.

6 In so far as the processing of complaint received against the

members of subordinate

judiciary is concerned, the Hon'ble The Chief Justice

of India had issued guide lines which are comprised in his letter dated 3102014

addressed to the Hon'ble Chief Justices of the High Courts. The said

guidelines were issued so that a uniform procedure is followed by all the High

Courts dealing with such complaints. The background to the issuance of the

said guidelines is contained in the said letter dated 3102014.

The said guide

lines came to be modified by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India, which

modification was communicated by letter dated 1632017.

The modification

carried out was in respect of clause (A) of the said guidelines. A reference

would be made to the text of the said guidelines a bit later in this judgment.

7 As indicated above, the order dated 1562017

passed by the

Learned Registrar of this Court informing the Petitioner of holding of the

disciplinary proceedings against him in respect of two sets of charges which

are subject matter of the two disciplinary proceedings, is the subject matter of

the above Petitions.

8 Heard, the Learned Counsel for the parties.

9 The principal contention of the Learned Counsel appearing for the

Petitioner Mr. Shaikh was that the commencement of the Departmental

Enquiry against the Petitioner was in breach of the guidelines issued by the

Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India as the Departmental Enquiry sought to be

commenced against the Petitioner without there being a written complaint and

an affidavit in support thereof as mandated by the said guidelines. The

Learned Counsel would contend that in cases of the absence of a written

complaint and an affidavit in support thereof the Departmental Enquiry

commenced against the judicial officers have been quashed and set aside. The

Learned Counsel sought to place reliance on the unreported judgment of the

Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court in the matter of Girishkumar

Rameshchandra Soni Vs. State of Gujarat & Ors. dated 1592017

and the

judgment of the Apex Court in the matter of R. C. Sood Vs. High Court of

Judicature at Rajasthan & Ors.1 The Learned Counsel would contend that

though in respect of the second Departmental Enquiry the Petitioner had

pursuant to the show cause notice issued to him represented against the said

show cause notice and pointed out as to how it was unnecessary to hold a

Departmental Enquiry against him. The reply of the Petitioner has not been

taken into consideration and neither has the Petitioner been afforded a

personal hearing though the Petitioner had requested for the same. It was

next contended by the Learned Counsel that in so far as the first Departmental

1 (1998)5 Supreme Court Cases 493

Enquiry is concerned i.e. the incidents which have taken place whilst the

Petitioner was posted at Bhokardan District Jalna. The complaint made by one

Mr. Teple was motivated in view of the fact that the Petitioner was an Enquiry

Officer in the preliminary inquiry which was held against the said Mr. Teple.

The Learned Counsel would next contend that in so far as the second

Departmental Enquiry is concerned, which is in respect of the alleged incident

which took place at Ajara, District Kolhapur, whilst the Petitioner was posted

there. There is a reference to Advocate Mr. Shailesh Deshpande in the report

of the Learned District Judge who carried out discreet enquiry, the said

Advocate was not recommended by the Petitioner for appointment to the post

of AGP. It was sought to be contended by the Learned Counsel that why the

reference to the Advocate Mr. Shailesh Deshpande appears in the report of the

Learned District Judge 3

who carried out the discreet enquiry, is unknown.

10 Per contra the Learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent

No.2, Mr. Nerlekar would submit that power to hold the Departmental Enquiry

against the judicial officer belonging to the subordinate

judiciary is conferred

by Rule 8(2) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules

1979. The said Rule confers a wide power on the Disciplinary Authority in so

far as holding of the Departmental Enquiry is concerned and the said Rule

leaves it to the subjective satisfaction of the Disciplinary Authority whether

such an enquiry is required to be held. The Learned Counsel would contend

that in so far as the guide lines are concerned, they have been modified by the

subsequent communication dated 1632017

and the words ""and/or verifiable

material"" has been included in the guide lines meaning thereby that a

Departmental Enquiry can be commenced either when there is a complaint

accompanied by an Affidavit and/or there is verifiable material. In the instant

case, the report of the discreet enquiry which report has been forwarded to

this Court by the Learned Principal District Judge, comprised the verifiable

material on the basis of which the Departmental Enquiry has been commenced

against the Petitioner. The Learned Counsel would next contend that in the

instant case the Learned Principal District Judge of Kolhapur has submitted a

report to this Court for taking appropriate action in the matter of holding of a

Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. The Learned Counsel would

contend that the contention of the Petitioner that at the stage of considering

his explanation to the show cause notice the Petitioner is required to be heard,

is misconceived . The Disciplinary Authority on the basis of the material which

has come on record till that stage which includes the reply, has to only come to

a prima facie conclusion that there is material to proceed against the

delinquent. The Learned Counsel would next contend that reliance placed on

the judgments of the Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court as well as the

judgment of the Apex Curt in R. S. Sood, is misplaced as the said judgments

were rendered in the fact situation as prevailing in the said cases. The

Learned Counsel would contend that the Petitioner would obviously have

adequate opportunity to controvert the charges which are levied against him in

the Departmental Enquiry that would be held against him. However, on one

ground or the other the said Departmental Enquiries have been unduly

delayed by the Petitioner. The Learned Counsel would lastly contend that

since the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked against the communication

informing the Petitioner of holding of a Departmental Enquiry against him, this

court would not exercise its extra ordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the

Constitution of India. In support of which contention reliance was placed on

the following judgments of the Apex Court.

1. Union of India & Anr. Vs. Kunisetty Satyanarayana (2006) 12 SCC 28

2. Special Director & Anr. Vs Mohd. Ghulam Ghouse & Anr (2004) 3 SCC 440

3. Executive Engineer, Bihar State Housing Board. Vs. Ramesh Kumar Singh &

Ors. (1996) 1 SCC 327

4. State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Brahm Datt Sharma & Anr (1987) 2 SCC 179.

11 Having heard the Learned Counsel for the parties we have

bestowed our anxious consideration to the rival contentions.

In the context of the challenge raised in the above Petitions, the issue that

arises is as regards the power of the Disciplinary Authority in the instant case

being the Hon'ble the Chief Justice, the Hon'ble Judges of this Court to

institute the disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner. There can be no

dispute about the fact that the Maharashtra Civil Services Rules are applicable.

A useful reference could be made to Rule 8(1) and (2) of the said Rules which

are relevant for the purpose of the present Petition:

8. Procedure for imposing major penalties:(

1)

No order imposing any of the major penalties

shall be made except after an inquiry held, as far

as may be, in the manner provided in this rule

and Rule 9, or where such inquiry is held under

the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850 (37 of

1850) in the manner provided in that Act.

(2) Whenever the disciplinary authority is of the

opinion that there are grounds for inquiring into

the truth of any imputation of misconduct or

misbehaviour against a Government servant, it

may itself inquire into, or appoint under this rule

or under the provisions of the Public Servants

(Inquiries) Act, 1850, as the case may be, an

authority to inquire into the truth thereof.

Provided that, where there is a complaint of

sexual harassment within the meaning of Rule 22A

of Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules

1979, the Complaints Committee established in

each Department or Office for inquiring into such

complaints, shall be deemed to be the inquiring

authority appointed by the disciplinary authority

for the purpose of these rules and the Complaints

Committee shall hold, if separate procedure has

not been prescribed for the Complaints

Committee for holding the inquiry into the

complaints for sexual harassments, the inquiry as

for as practicable in accordance with the

procedure laid down in these rules.

ExplanationWhere

a disciplinary authority

itself holds an inquiry under this rule, any

reference to an inquiring authority in this rule

shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be

construed as reference to the disciplinary

authority.

A reading of the said Rule 8(2) therefore discloses that the

discretion is of the Disciplinary Authority if it is of the opinion that there are

grounds for inquiring into the truth of any imputation of misconduct or

misbehaviour against a Government servant. Hence the said Rule (2) can be

said to confer a wide discretion in the Disciplinary Authority in the matter of

inquiring into the truth of any misconduct or misbehaviour against the

Government servant.

12 Now coming to the guide lines which have been formulated by the

Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India which are comprised in the letter dated 3102014

they read thus:A.

The complaint making allegations against

members of the Subordinate Judiciary in the

States should not be entertained and no action

should be taken thereon, unless it is accompanies

by a duly sworn Affidavit and verifiable material

to substantiate the allegations made therein.

B. If action on such complaint meeting the

above requirement is deemed necessary,

authenticity of complaint should be duly

ascertained and further steps thereon should be

taken only after satisfaction of the competent

authority designated by the Chief Justice of the

High Court.

C. If the above requirements are not complied

with, the complaint should be filed/lodged

without taking any steps thereon.

The said guidelines were modified and communicated vide letter

dated 1632017

issued by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice Of India. The

modification carried out which is relevant for the purposes of the present

Petition is in clause (A). The modified clause (A) reads thus:

A. The complaint making allegations against

members of the Subordinate Judiciary in the

States should not be entertained and no action

should be taken thereon, unless it is accompanied

by a duly sworn Affidavit and/or verifiable

material to substantiate the allegations made

therein.

(emphasis supplied)

13 Hence by modification the requirement is that a complaint should

be accompanied by duly sworn affidavit and/or verifiable material to

substantiate the allegations made therein. Hence a complaint can be

entertained in two contingencies one is when a complaint is accompanied by a

duly sworn affidavit and second is when the complaint contains verifiable

material. It is in the light of the said modification that the instant case would

have to be considered. The said modification being in the matter of the

procedure which is required to be followed prior to holding a Departmental

Enquiry, the same would obviously relate back to the date of issuance of the

show cause notice, even if the notice is prior to the issuance of the

modification.

14 Now coming to the facts of the instant case in so far as the first

enquiry is concerned, the same is on the basis of the complaint made by Shri

Teple, which was processed by the Learned Principal District Judge Jalna and

then a report was submitted to the Learned Registrar General of this Court

which was thereafter placed before the Disciplinary Committee which directed

the issuance of the show cause notice to the Petitioner pursuant to which the

Petitioner replied to the said show cause notice and the reply having been

found not to be satisfactory, the Disciplinary Committee of this Court decided

to hold the Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. In so far as the

second Departmental Enquiry is concerned, the Learned Principal District

Judge having received information of the incident which took place on 1672015

had directed the Learned District Judge3

to conduct a discreet enquiry

in respect of the said incident which the Learned Judge conducted and

reported to the Learned Principal District Judge. The Learned Principal

District Judge on receipt of the said report forwarded the same to the Learned

Registrar General of this Court with his recommendation. The Petitioner was

thereafter issued a show cause notice as to why a Departmental Enquiry

should not be held against him. The Petitioner submitted his reply. Having

found the reply of the Petitioner to be unsatisfatory, the Disciplinary Authority

decided to hold a Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. Hence in

respect of both the Departmental Enquiries there is a report of the Learned

Principal District Judge which was forwarded along with the verifiable

material which was in the form of the report of the discreet enquiry conducted

by the Learned Principal District Judge3.

In respect of the second

Departmental Enquiry and the complaint made by Mr. Teple who is an

employee of the Court, the same was also forwarded by the Learned Principal

District Judge along with his report. Hence in so far as the Departmental

Enquiries against the Petitioner are concerned, they would be covered by the

second part of clause (A) namely that they are based on verifiable material to

substantiate the allegations made. It is therefore not possible to accept the

contention of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner that in the absence of

there being written complaint accompanied by a duly sworn affidavit, no

Departmental Enquiry can be initiated against the Petitioner. It is also not

possible to accept the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner that

the complaint and the duly sworn affidavit have to be read together with the

verifiable material so as to mean that the material cannot be independently

brought forward but has to be by way of a complaint which is accompanied by

a sworn affidavit. It is probably on account of the difficulties faced in

proceeding and initiating the disciplinary proceedings wherein information is

received by the Learned Principal District Judge or any other authority of the

Court that the amendment in the guide lines was made vide letter dated 1632017

by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India. Construing the guidelines in

the manner sought by the the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner would fetter

the powers of the Disciplinary Authority in initiating departmental proceedings

against the erring judicial officers and thereby negating the power vested in

the Disciplinary Authority for enquiring into the truth of the allegations

against a judicial officer.

15 In so far as the submission of the Learned Counsel for the

Petitioner that the reply of the Petitioner has not been considered and that the

Petitioner has also not been given a hearing in so far as the second

Departmental Enquiry is concerned, in our view the said submission is

misconceived. The Disciplinary Authority is under no obligation at the stage of

the show cause notice to afford any opportunity of hearing to a delinquent.

The Disciplinary Authority has only to consider whether there are grounds for

proceeding with so as to enquire into the truth of any allegations against the

judicial officer. In our view therefore, the said submission cannot be accepted

and there is no violation of the principles of natural justice merely because no

hearing was afforded prior to the Disciplinary Authority coming to a conclusion

to proceed departmentally against the Petitioner.

16 Now coming to the judgments on which reliance was placed by the

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner is concerned, the cause for allowing the

Special Civil Application filed by the Petitioner therein are two fold namely that

since the allegation made against the Petitioner was as regards sexual

harassment in respect of which a complaint was required to be in writing in

terms of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention,

Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 and prior thereto under the Rules which

were framed pursuant to the judgment in Vishakha's case and since in the said

case there was no written complaint but action was sought to be taken on the

basis of the oral complaint made by three Advocates. The Division Bench was

of the view that the disciplinary proceedings could not be initiated on the said

basis. The second ground was that though the incident was of the year 2012

the decision to hold a Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner therein

culminated in the charge sheet dated 2112017

issued to the Petitioner and

therefore there being a time lag of 5 years between the date of the incident

and the date of the order, the Division Bench was of the view that a

Departmental Enquiry could not be initiated against the Petitioner. The

Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court has also referred to the circular

issued by that Court on 2542017

which can be said to be paramateria to the

first circular issued by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India. The Division Bench

thereafter referred to the Judgment of the Apex Court in R. C. Sood's case

(Supra), in which case the Apex Court had set aside the Disciplinary

proceedings which were initiated against the Petitioner R. C. Sood as the

complaint was not supported by an affidavit. The Division Bench therefore

opined that in the absence of any written complaint, initiating the

departmental proceedings pursuant to the oral representation, will run counter

to the ratio laid down in the judgment of the Apex Court in R. C. Sood

and Ishwarchand Jain Vs. State of Punjab.

17 Now coming to the judgment of the Apex Court in R. C. Sood, the

said judgment was rendered by the Apex Court when neither of the circulars

i.e. circular dated 3102014

and 1632017

were in the field. The said

judgment was also rendered in the peculiar facts of the said case. In the said

case the Petitioner R. C. Sood whilst acting as a Registrar of the Rajashtan High

Court was proceeded departmentally on account of the wrong mentioning of

the cut of date for determining the age in the advertisement issued for filling

up the vacancies in the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service by way of direct

recruitment. A committee of two Judges was appointed to go into the matter

as regards the mentioning of the cut of date in the advertisement issued calling

for applications. The committee of two Judges suggested that fresh

applications be called for and the matter should be placed before the Hon'ble

Chief Justice for taking suitable action against the officer who was responsible

for issuing the incorrect notification. The matter was placed before the Full

Court of the High Court. The Full Court constituted a committee of two other

Judges to look into the record leading to the issuance of the notification. The

said committee observed that it was their tentative view that the Petitioner was

responsible for the ""forgery committed in the record"" and it recommended a

regular enquiry to be made in accordance with rules. The report of the two

Judges committee was placed before the Full Court and the Full Court resolved

that the Departmental Enquiry be initiated against the Petitioner and he should

be placed under suspension. The Petitioner challenged the said action by way

of a Writ Petition in the Apex Court. By judgment dated 22111994

the Apex

Court quashed the proposed disciplinary proceedings as well as the order

placing the Petitioner under suspension. The Apex Court observed that it was

difficult to appreciate how the two Judges committee could come to the

conclusion that there was a forgery in the record and/or any person had

benefited from the said error or that the Petitioner was responsible for the

same.

18 The Hon'ble Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court had issued

a office note dated 1251994

providing that if a complainant does not file the

requisite affidavit, no action should be taken on that complaint. Though

initially the first disciplinary proceeding was quashed by the Apex Court, the

problem of the Petitioner R. C. Sood did not end there. As observed by the

Apex Court by letter dated 27101994

one of the Judges of the Rajasthan High

Court forwarded a PIL Petition received by him to the Hon'ble Chief Justice by

his letter addressed to the Hon'ble Chief Justice mentioning therein that as

allegations are serious they deserved to be investigated thoroughly. The said

letter was the same letter which had been dealt with by the earlier Hon'ble

Chief Justice vide letter dated 3111994

and the issue was closed. However,

the matter was placed before the Full Court and the Full Court resolved that

the order passed by the Hon'ble Chief Justice on the report of the preliminary

enquiry against R. C. Sood conducted by the Additional Registrar be hereby

revoked. The Full Court thereafter resolved to constitute a committee of three

Hon'ble Judges of the Rajasthan High Court to enquire into the various

complaints forwarded to them by the Hon'ble Judge against the Petitioner R.C.

Sood. The Apex Court in the facts of the said case observed that there was no

valid reason in law for the Full Court to revoke the decision of the then Chief

Justice which was taken on 3111994.

The Apex Court also adversely

commented upon the manner in which the enquiry was sought to be conducted

by the three Judges of the Rajashtan High Court. The Apex Court observed

that the witnesses were also of the choice of one of the members of the

committee and were persons who were inimical to the Petitioner R.C.Sood.

The Apex Court observed that the complainant Vijay Singh was a imposter and

who was that person who was examined by the committee, remained

unexplained. The Apex Court therefore in the facts of the said case held that

the complaint could not have been entertained without there being an

affidavit. Paragraphs 23 and 25 of the said judgment are eloquent and reflect

the reasons why the Apex Court interfered in the said matter. The same is

therefore reproduced hereinunder for the sake for convenience:

23. Apart from the nonjudicious

manner in

which the Three Judge Committee conducted the

enquiry the sequence of events, which bears

repetition, shows that being piqued with this

Court's judgment quashing the first departmental

enquiry the High Court, with a few functionaries

playing an active role, left no stone unturned

with a view to victimise the petitioner. On 21st

October, 1994 the High Court suspended the

petitioner and decided to hold the first

departmental enquiry. On 24th October, 1994 this

suspension was challenged by way of a writ

petition in this Court in which this Court on 7th

November, 1994 issued show cause notice to the

High Court. Suddenly we find on the High Court

record Justice Kokje's letter dated 27th October,

1994 forwarding to the then Chief Justice the old

complaint of Vijay Singh. The Chief Justice makes

an endorsement on this letter on the same date thereby

showing the sense of urgency. First office

note is written only on 9th November, 1994, after

issuance of notice by this Court in the writ

petition filed by the petitioner. The fact that it is

only on 30th November, 1994, after the decision

of this Court on 22nd November, 1994, that the

Full Court fixed up the matter lends credence to

the petitioner's submission that the dates which

appear on record may not be real. This is more so

when we find that none of the documents in the

form of complaints allegedly received by the

Judges bear any endorsement as to the date of

receipt of the same. To crown it all the second

round started on a complaint of Vijay Singh

stated to have been received by Justice Kokje on

or before 27th October, 1994. This complaint had

been circulated in September, 1993 amongst all

the then Judges of the High Court and in respect

of which order was passed by the then Chief

Justice and the matter was closed on 31st

January, 1994. Respondents' counsel could give

no explanation as to how Justice Kokje got this

complaint against the petitioner some time before

27th October 1994 when he was transferred to

the Rajasthan High Court only on 28th April,

1994. At that time the petitioner had ceased to be

the Registrar of the High Court with effect from

1st February, 1994. It is obvious that a copy of

this complaint was handed over to Justice Kokje

by some one who was interested in harming the

petitioner and thereupon the second round of

action against the petitioner commenced with

Justice Kokje being made one of the members of

the Three Judge Committee.

25. Normally enquiry committees are set up in

order to ascertain correct facts. Here, however,

we have a situation where a committee consisting

of a local judge and two transferred judges was

set up with the local judge sitting alone and

collecting a menagerie of witnesses who had a

grudge against the petitioner and were thus sure

to depose against him. Some of these witnesses

were those who had not sent any complaint

against the petitioner prior to 30th November,

1994 and it is only the local judge who, wanting

to gather statements against the petitioner, could

have known whom to approach and call for

evidence. Of the two transferred judges who were

members of the committee, one never took part

in any proceeding when evidence was recorded

between 20th February (Sic 20111994)

and 2nd

January, 1995. Yet he signs the report dated 4th

January, 1995. The other transferee judge is the

person who set the ball rolling with his conjuring

up Vijay Singh's complaint which had originally

been circulated long before the judge's transfer to

Rajasthan. The respondent's counsel was unable

to explain as to how this complaint was

conveniently placed in this judge's hand. It is

evident that there was a deliberate design to

bring to a premature end the judicial career of

the petitioner, whose name, at that time, was

being actively considered for elevation as High

Court Judge. This is apparent from the fact that

in the resolutions dated 30th November, 1994

and 5th January, 1995 it was resolved by the Full

Court that the President of India and the Chief

Justice of India should be informed about the

holding of the departmental enquiry against the

petitioner. Acting on the basis of the Committee's

biased report the Full Court, we are sad to note,

continued in similar vein and proceeded to nail

the petitioner by taking a decision which lacked

objectivity. Apparently stung by the judgment

dated 22nd November, 1994 of this Court it

retaliated by launching a fresh set of charges

against the petitioner clearly with a view to ruin

his judicial career. We have no doubt that the

action taken by the court was not bona fide and

amounts to victimisation. This is certainly not

expected from a judicial forum, least of all the

High Court, which is expected to discharge its

administrative duties as fairly and objectively as

it is required to discharge its judicial functions.

19 In our view, the judgments of the Gujarat High Court in

Girishkumar Soni's case and the Apex Court in R. C. Sood's case having been

rendered in the peculiar facts and circumstances as were prevailing in the said

cases would not aid the Petitioner in so far as the instant case is concerned. In

the instant case the factual basis has changed in as much as the original

circular issued by the Chief Justice of India has been amended by the

subsequent circular providing for a written complaint accompanied by an

affidavit and/or verifiable material. In our view, in respect of both the

Departmental Enquiries there being verifiable material on record, the same

would be covered by the amended circular dated 1632017.

20 The question that also arises is whether in the facts of the present

case we should exercise our writ jurisdiction. As indicated above the Petitioner

has invoked the Writ Jurisdiction of this court against the order dated 1572016

informing him that a Departmental Enquiry is to be commenced against

him. The Petitioner can obviously participate in the enquiry and refute or

dispel the charges which are leveled against him. In our view, the

commencement of the said two disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner

cannot be said to be without jurisdiction as is sought to be contended by the

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner as being in violation of the circulars issued

by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India. In our view the reliance placed by

the Learned Counsel for the Respondent No.2 on the judgments (Supra) of the

Apex Court, seems to be apposite. The Apex Court has in terms observed that

exercise of writ jurisdiction at the initial stage of commencement of the

disciplinary proceedings would only be in exceptional cases more especially in

cases where the disciplinary proceedings are commenced without jurisdiction.

Such is not the case in the instant matter. We therefore do not deem it

appropriate to exercise our Writ Jurisdiction.

21 We however, leave the contentions of the Petitioner in respect of

the charges levelled against him in the Departmental Enquiries open. Subject

to the aforesaid, the above Writ Petitions are dismissed. Rule to stand

discharged in both the Petitions with no order as to costs.

Over 1,600 migrant children shifted at midnight

On Nov. 6, 2017, at least 20 people trying to reach Europe from Libya drowned in the Mediterranean, foundering next to a sinking raft.

Not far from the raft was a ship belonging to Sea-Watch, a German humanitarian organization. That ship had enough space on it for everyone who had been aboard the raft. It could have brought them all to the safety of Europe, where they might have had a chance at being granted asylum.

Instead, 20 people drowned and 47 more were captured by the Libyan Coast Guard, which brought the migrants back to Libya, where they suffered abuse -- including rape and torture.

This confrontation at sea was not a simplistic case of Europe versus Africa, with human rights and rescue on one side and chaos and danger on the other. Rather it's a case of Europe versus Europe: of volunteers struggling to save lives being undercut by European Union policies that outsource border control responsibilities to the Libyan Coast Guard -- with the aim of stemming arrivals on European shores.

While funding, equipping and directing the Libyan Coast Guard, European governments have stymied the activities of nongovernmental organizations like Sea-Watch, criminalizing them or impounding their ships, or turning away from ports ships carrying survivors.

More than 14,000 people have died or gone missing while trying to cross the central Mediterranean since 2014. But unlike most of those deaths and drownings, the incident on Nov. 6, 2017, was extensively documented.

Sea-Watch's ship and rescue rafts were outfitted with nine cameras, documenting the entire scene in video and audio. The Libyans, too, filmed parts of the incident on their mobile phones.

The research groups Forensic Architecture and Forensic Oceanography of Goldsmiths, University of London, of which three of us -- Mr. Heller, Mr. Pezzani and Mr. Weizman -- are a part, combined these video sources with radio recordings, vessel tracking data, witness testimonies and newly obtained official sources to produce a minute-by-minute reconstruction of the facts. Opinion Video at The New York Times built on this work to create the above short documentary, gathering further testimonials by some of the survivors and rescuers who were there.

This investigation makes a few things clear: European governments are avoiding their legal and moral responsibilities to protect the human rights of people fleeing violence and economic desperation. More worrying, the Libyan Coast Guard partners that Europe is collaborating with are ready to blatantly violate those rights if it allows them to prevent migrants from crossing the sea.

Stopping Migrants, Whatever the Cost

To understand the cynicism of Europe's policies in the Mediterranean, one must understand the legal context. According to a 2012 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, migrants rescued by European civilian or military vessels must be taken to a safe port. Because of the chaotic political situation in Libya and well-documented human rights abuses in detention camps there, that means a European port, often in Italy or Malta.

But when the Libyan Coast Guard intercepts migrants, even outside Libyan territorial waters, as it did on Nov. 6, the Libyans take them back to detention camps in Libya, which is not subject to European Court of Human Rights jurisdiction.

For Italy -- and Europe -- this is an ideal situation. Europe is able to stop people from reaching its shores while washing its hands of any responsibility for their safety.

This policy can be traced back to February 2017, when Italy and the United Nations-supported Libyan Government of National Accord signed a ""memorandum of understanding"" that provided a framework for collaboration on development, to fight against ""illegal immigration,"" human trafficking and the smuggling of contraband. This agreement defines clearly the aim, ""to stem the illegal migrants' flows,"" and committed Italy to provide ""technical and technological support to the Libyan institutions in charge of the fight against illegal immigration.""

Libyan Coast Guard members have been trained by the European Union, and the Italian government donated or repaired several patrol boats and supported the establishment of a Libyan search-and-rescue zone. Libyan authorities have since attempted -- in defiance of maritime law -- to make that zone off-limits to nongovernmental organizations' rescue vessels. Italian Navy ships, based in Tripoli, have coordinated Libyan Coast Guard efforts.

Before these arrangements, Libyan actors were able to intercept and return very few migrants leaving from Libyan shores. Now the Libyan Coast Guard is an efficient partner, having intercepted some 20,000 people in 2017 alone.

The Libyan Coast Guard is efficient when it comes to stopping migrants from reaching Europe. It's not as good, however, at saving their lives, as the events of Nov. 6 show.

A Deadly Policy in Action

That morning the migrant raft had encountered worsening conditions after leaving Tripoli, Libya, over night. Someone onboard used a satellite phone to call the Italian Coast Guard for help.

Because the Italians were required by law to alert nearby vessels of the sinking raft, they alerted Sea-Watch to its approximate location. But they also requested the intervention of their Libyan counterparts.

The Libyan Coast Guard vessel that was sent to intervene on that morning, the Ras Jadir, was one of several that had been repaired by Italy and handed back to the Libyans in May of 2017. Eight of the 13 crew members onboard had received training from the European Union anti-smuggling naval program known as Operation Sophia.

Even so, the Libyans brought the Ras Jadir next to the migrants' raft, rather than deploying a smaller rescue vessel, as professional rescuers do. This offered no hope of rescuing those who had already fallen overboard and only caused more chaos, during which at least five people died.

These deaths were not merely a result of a lack of professionalism. Some of the migrants who had been brought aboard the Ras Jadir were so afraid of their fate at the hands of the Libyans that they jumped back into the water to try to reach the European rescuers. As can be seen in the footage, members of the Libyan Coast Guard beat the remaining migrants.

Sea-Watch's crew was also attacked by the Libyan Coast Guard, who threatened them and threw hard objects at them to keep them away. This eruption of violence was the result of a clash between the goals of rescue and interception, with the migrants caught in the middle desperately struggling for their lives.

Apart from those who died during this chaos, more than 15 people had already drowned in the time spent waiting for any rescue vessel to appear.

There was, however, no shortage of potential rescuers in the area: A Portuguese surveillance plane had located the migrants' raft after its distress call. An Italian Navy helicopter and a French frigate were nearby and eventually offered some support during the rescue.

It's possible that this French ship, deployed as part of Operation Sophia, could have reached the sinking vessel earlier, in time to save more lives -- despite our requests, this information has not been disclosed to us. But it remained at a distance throughout the incident and while offering some support, notably refrained from taking migrants onboard who would then have had to have been disembarked on European soil. It's an example of a hands-off approach that seeks to make Libyan intervention not only possible but also inevitable.

A Legal Challenge

On the basis of the forensic reconstruction, the Global Legal Action Network and the Association for Juridical Studies on Immigration, with the support of Yale Law School students, have filed a case against Italy at the European Court of Human Rights representing 17 survivors of this incident.

Those working on the suit, who include two of us -- Mr. Mann and Ms. Moreno-Lax -- argue that even though Italian or European personnel did not physically intercept the migrants and bring them back to Libya, Italy exercised effective control over the Libyan Coast Guard through mutual agreements, support and on-the-ground coordination. Italy has entrusted the Libyans with a task that Rome knows full well would be illegal if undertaken directly: preventing migrants from seeking protection in Europe by impeding their flight and sending them back to a country where extreme violence and exploitation await.

We hope this legal complaint will lead the European court to rule that countries cannot subcontract their legal and humanitarian obligations to dubious partners, and that if they do, they retain responsibility for the resulting violations. Such a precedent would force the entire European Union to make sure its cooperation with partners like Libya does not end up denying refugees the right to seek asylum.

This case is especially important right now. In Italy's elections in March, the far-right Lega party, which campaigned on radical anti-immigrant rhetoric, took nearly 20 percent of the vote. The party is now part of the governing coalition, of which its leader, Matteo Salvini, is the interior minister.

His government has doubled down on animosity toward migrants. In June, Italy took the drastic step of turning away a humanitarian vessel from the country's ports and has been systematically blocking rescued migrants from being disembarked since then, even when they had been assisted by the Italian Coast Guard.

The Italian crackdown helps explain why seafarers off the Libyan coast have refrained from assisting migrants in distress, leaving them to drift for days. Under the new Italian government, a new batch of patrol boats has been handed over to the Libyan Coast Guard, and the rate of migrants being intercepted and brought back to Libya has increased. All this has made the crossing even more dangerous than before.

Italy has been seeking to enact a practice that blatantly violates the spirit of the Geneva Convention on refugees, which enshrines the right to seek asylum and prohibits sending people back to countries in which their lives are at risk. A judgment by the European Court sanctioning Italy for this practice would help prevent the outsourcing of border control and human rights violations that may prevent the world's most disempowered populations from seeking protection and dignity.

The European Court of Human Rights cannot stand alone as a guardian of fundamental rights. Yet an insistence on its part to uphold the law would both reflect and bolster the movements seeking solidarity with migrants across Europe."

Along every step of the way, local tribals narrated their problems to me. Villagers of Chapara told me that the ruling party leaders backed adulterators of manure, fertilizers for fields and food substances. Their lives were torn between the devastation caused by the cyclone and adulterated food and fertilizers. They said that adulterated food was taking a toll on their lives. Yet, officials remained indifferent to their plight, they complained. They said that this adulteration activity which was taking place in the bordering areas of Odisha was rooted in the support of TDP leaders.

Hence, no official paid attention to it, they lamented. It is ridiculous on the part of Chandrababu Naidu to describe Andhra Pradesh as Ananda Andhra Pradesh when his leaders are hand in glove with adulterators playing with the lives of common citizens.

After listening to girl students describe the sorry state of affairs of the Zilla Parishad school in Chapara, I could once again see the extent to which Chandrababu Naidu had destroyed the education system in the state, putting the future of the students on the line. Board exams are two months away and these students have not as yet, received the social studies text books. Students of class VIII have not yet got their Science text books. ""How do we study and write the exams, Anna?"" those innocent girls asked me. What answer does the TDP government have to this query? Isn't the government squarely responsible for the performance of students or their failure? This was the genuine question posed by the girl students.

As my Padayatra moved through tribal areas, I could see that these villages had been completely neglected by the TDP government. Development was nowhere to be seen. Problems of all kinds plagued the region. Among the worst hit are the elderly -- as the experience of a 70 year-old widow, Janakamma of Chapara reveals. She would be content with either old age or widow pension, she said. Sadly, she was denied both, she lamented.

Yandamma of Patamarudukota went around government offices for widow pension several times without success. There was no official she did not plead with. Yalamanchili Ammulamma had an even more shocking tale to narrate. The pensions of 80 eligible innocent villagers were withdrawn out of sheer spite, she revealed. They had to seek legal help to get them restored which the government was forced to after being rapped on the knuckles by the Court. However, things were back to square one, three months after the pensions were restored. How unjust is it to compel poor villagers to go to court for what is rightfully theirs.

I have a question for the chief minister -- your white paper claims that welfare schemes have been rolled out to all eligible people, without discriminating against anyone. In Srikakulam district alone, where my Padayatra is in progress and in just Ponduru mandal the pensions of 900 people were withdrawn purely out of political vengeance and discrimination. Is this not a fact? Is it not true that only after the Court reprimanded your government were you forced to restore these pensions? Have you forgotten these facts? Does your so-called White Paper contain a grain of truth?"

"216","1027242776","2018-12-27","http://www.mondaq.com/x/767506/Copyright/Fiasco%2BIn%2BA%2BFlash","Malta: Fiasco In A Flash - Fenech & Fenech Advocates","mondaq.com",FALSE,"The latest article by Junior Associate Sarah Cannataci relates to a judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union (""CJEU"") in the Case C-161/17 (Land Nordrhein-Westfalen vs. Renckhoff) as well as the clarifications brought on by said judgment to some important aspects of EU Law regulating the copyright and communication of works to the public.

You're finishing off an important presentation or working on a school project - how many times have you Googled tirelessly and found the perfect image or photograph to bring your creation to life? Copy and pasting that photo or image onto your blog or website in one click or editing the material for your own specific purpose may be tempting, but it can easily land you in hot waters.

In a recent judgment, the Court of Justice of the European Union ('CJEU') has ruled that publishing freely available content on the Internet requires the authorisation of the author of such content.

Case C- 161/17, in the names of Land Nordrhein - Westfalen v. Dirk Renckhoff, nicknamed the 'Cόrdoba Copyright Case', centered around the fact that in early 2009, a student at the Waltrop Secondary School ('Gesamtschule Waltrop') in Germany downloaded a photo of the city of Cόrdoba he found online to include as part of a presentation that was then uploaded to the school website and thus made accessible to the public.

The Cόrdoba photo however, was the intellectual creation of Dirk Renckhoff, the photographer, who had granted an exclusive right of use to the operators of the online travel portal from which the student had downloaded the photo. He sued the city of Waltrop and North Rhine-Westphalia, claiming that such downloading and positing of the photograph on the school website constituted an infringement of his copyright, the right to make copies and his right to make the creation available to the public.

Replying to a request for a preliminary ruling from the German Federal Court of Justice ('Bundesgerichtshof'), the CJEU undertook an in-depth analysis of the concept of 'communication to the public' in accordance with the provisions of InfoSoc Directive (Directive 2001/29), highlighting firstly that, subject to any exceptions and limitations laid down by Member States, any use of an intellectual creation by a third party without the authors' authorisation constitutes an infringement of copyright.

As established in past cases, such as C - 610/15 Stichting Brein, this concept of 'communication to the public' finds its basis in the 'act of communication' of a work and the communication of that work to the 'public'. Moreover, the CJEU stipulated that the work must be ""communicated using specific technical means, different from those previously used, or failing that, to a 'new public', that is to say, to a public that was not already taken into account by the copyright holders when they authorised the initial communication to the public of their work"".

The Court here distinguished between the communication to the public via posting of a work on a website and the communication of a work through the use of hyperlinks that lead users through websites to the website where the work was originally communicated without restriction and with the copyright holder's consent. This distinction is especially clear in the fact that in the former, the exercise of the author's rights, such as to cease the communication or claim rewards, would be made impossible or at least much more difficult than in the latter example.

The CJEU's decision was that a 'communication to the public' includes the posting of a photograph on a website which had been previously published on another website with the consent of the copyright holder, even if without any restrictions preventing it from being downloaded. This gives authors, such as artists, publishers and broadcasters, amongst others, the opportunity to assert their rights in an unprecedented manner. This judgment will undoubtedly lead to an influx of litigation as authors of intellectual works seek to stop infringement of the copyright in their works as well as to claim revenue due for the unauthorised use of their works.

Maltese laws are in line with EU Directives on this subject. Thus, a photograph in Malta would be covered by copyright as an 'artistic work' under Chapter 415 of the Laws of Malta. Provided that the work in question satisfies the criteria of originality, qualification and fixation, Maltese law stipulates that copyright is granted automatically, without the specific need for registration of the same work. This latter point may prove to be slightly problematic in the proper implementation of the principles related to communication to the public arising from the Cordoba Copyright decision, in that, when faced with potential infringement by third parties who claim that the creation or similar work is theirs, and not the original author, date of creation of the artistic work might be unclear where the work in question have not been formalised to fix 'the date' when the artistic work was created.

Otherwise, in Malta too, the Cordoba decision stands, meaning that all uses of work found freely on the Internet must first be checked and the author's consent (if required) must be sought and obtained, so hold off pressing CTRL + V so quickly!"

Her mother and uncle have also been accused of tampering with documents to prove that she was a minor at the time the crime was allegedly committed.

The FIR against the survivor and her kin was registered at the district's Makhi police station on Sunday following a local court's directives. The complainant in the case is Haripal Singh, whose wife Shashi and son Shubham are also accused in the gang-rape case.

SHO Dinesh Mishra said that in her complaint, Haripal alleged that the rape survivor, her mother and uncle prepared a forged school transfer certificate using fake signatures and stamp of the principal of her school and the Basic Shiksha Adhikari (BSA) of Rae Bareli district.

""The FIR was lodged on charges including cheating by personation, cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, forgery for purpose of cheating and using as genuine a forged document. An investigation will be conducted to verify authenticity of the documents,"" he said.

In the affidavit to the court, Haripal also alleged that the woman reported to have been raped by Sengar had an affair with a person named Awadhesh Tewari and had eloped with him in September last year.

It was further alleged that the woman's family members pressured to get Shubham married to her when she returned after elopement. The complainant said the woman's family falsely framed his wife and son when they spurned marriage

The new twist to the case comes after it has already been marred by delays and allegations of the police protecting Sengar, who represents Bangermau in the state Assembly. The complainant had accused Sengar of raping her at his home in June 2017 when she had gone to meet him about a job.

The case came to light in April, when she attempted suicide outside Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's house, alleging that the police did not act on her complaint though she had approached them several months earlier. The case was transferred to the CBI after protests broke out and Sengar was later arrested.

On April 3, the victim's father was also beaten up allegedly by the MLA's brother Atul Singh and others in the village. He was sent to jail on various charges as well as under the Arms Act. On April 8, his condition deteriorated inside Unnao jail and he died in custody."

India's top intellectuals nominate the next generation. Here is their list of some of the brightest minds on the horizon.

Intellectuals are an essential component of an open society -- they bring their unique analytical insights to not only scrutinise the society in its immediate form but also help shape the ideas and ideologies of the future. They conduct research, deploy critical thinking, reason, teach, author books, challenge dogma and equip us with cognitive tools to engage with the world we inhabit -- just for the love of knowledge, or for the greater human good.

India has a rich and ancient tradition of producing such thinkers, teachers and philosophers who have contributed to the creation of new schools of thought that have travelled and established themselves far beyond Indian shores too. They have also passed on their learnings and discoveries to successive generations to preserve, innovate upon and further.

But who are the next generation of Indian intellectuals in the modern times we inhabit? The next Ramachandra Guha, the next Arvind Panagariya, the next Ashok Gulati, the next Raghuram Rajan, the next Makarand Paranjape, or the next Shashi Tharoor?

Over the last few months, ThePrint spoke to some of the biggest names in Indian intelligentsia and asked them who, in their opinion, are the brightest minds on the horizon -- in history, economics, sociology, political studies, law, strategic affairs, philosophy, public affairs, and inter-disciplinary studies, among others.

What follows is a long and impressive list of next-gen intellectuals who have begun to make a mark and given notice of their coming brilliance. Some of the nominees were directly mentored by the veterans who named them while the others are those whose work they track closely. This is by no means an exhaustive list and will be updated when more intellectuals respond to our requests.

Muralidharan, professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, is a doctorate from Harvard University. His research focuses on health and education in developing countries.

On Wednesday, a week after the incident, the girl was felicitated by her school amid cheers from her classmates and her father. ""I will go to court as many times as I'm summoned to depose against the molester. He should be given the harshest punishment so that he doesn't repeat the act,"" she told TOI.

The youngest of four sisters, the plucky teen is blind since birth. She was enrolled in school only after five years of age as her parents were not aware of a special school for the visually challenged. Currently in class VI, her father drops her and picks her up from school every day.

On December 17, she and her father boarded the 8.12pm local from Dadar station to head home. ""My father was ahead of me as we got into the compartment reserved for the disabled. I felt someone touch me inappropriately from behind. I caught hold of his hand and twisted it. The man probably did not expect this reaction, and stumbled and fell. I alerted my father,"" she said. An altercation broke out after her father slapped the man, later identified as Vishal Singh, a computer maintenance technician from Mulund.

""The man claimed that he had accidentally touched me. But other passengers came to our rescue and one of them called the Government Railway Police at Matunga station,"" said the teenager. ""The officers were good to me and my father. The senior inspector said I was like his younger sister. The police told me that Singh had molested a woman at Churchgate in the past. I was horrified""

Advising women not to stay silent and instead put up a fight if victimised, the teen said: ""Never let someone abuse you. Don't give up. Train yourself in self-defence. Always carry a safety pin when travelling in train to use it as a weapon. The police are always there to help you, but you must lodge a complaint.""

Commending her bravery, her school principal said she was an inspiration for all women. ""We start educating our students about 'good touch' and 'bad touch' at an early age. I'm happy she used her training in martial arts to nab the harasser,"" the principal said.

The girl's father said he was ""very proud"" of his daughter and is now not worried how she will look after herself in future."

Ramdhuni and poornahuti were organised in Ajmer on Tuesday. Both BJP MLAs from Ajmer were part of the event. The event is said to be a part of a nation wide series of similar events held across the country for atmosphere building. They have been scheduled at a later date in states that were scheduled to go to polls.

Postholders and functionaries of VHP and Bajrang Dal along with public representatives gathered at the function organised in the city. They chanted the Ramdhuni and prayed for the sadbuddhi (better sense prevailing) of the Union government. While similar prayer meets were organised in different states, the events have picked up now in five states including Rajasthan that were scheduled to have assembly elections.

The events assume more significance after the defeat of BJP in three Hindi heartland states.

Speaking to DNA, district functionary Lekhraj Singh said, ""Similar events are being held in all districts of Rajasthan and the country. We as a community have been patient for the last 130 years that the case has been in court.

What more patience can we exhibit that even today. We have a government of our party at the Centre and all we are doing is praying that they bring an Ordinance for construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya.""

Former school education minister and legislator from Ajmer, Vasudev Devnani said to DNA, ""We know it is a government of our party and these events are not for exerting pressure.

As party functionaries and public representatives, we are associating with these events to make the Central government aware of the public sentiment in favour of Ram temple construction.""

Rajasthan has had a long association with the Ram Temple agitation. Kar sevaks from the state had gone to Ayodhya in large numbers. Pillars were also carved out at Bayana in Bharatpur as part of preparations for temple construction."

A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar and some of his aides are facing charges of rape and criminal intimidation in the case. A separate case of murder had also been registered after the MLA's brother and some of his aides beat the victim's father to death.

The fresh FIR against the survivor and her family lists charges of fraud, forgery and tampering with documents to frame innocent people.

The FIR was registered at Unnao's Makhi police station on Sunday, following a local court's directives, reported The Hindustan Times. The complaint was filed by Haripal Singh, whose wife Shashi Singh and son Shubham Singh were accused in the FIR lodged in connection with the rape. Shashi allegedly took the victim to Sengar on the day of the crime.

The complainant alleged that the survivor and her family members forged the documents submitted to police to prove that the victim was a minor. Station House Officer (SHO) of Makhi police station Dinesh Mishra told The Indian Express, ""In his complaint, Haripal Singh has alleged that the rape victim, her mother and uncle prepared a forged school transfer certificate of the victim using fake signatures and stamp of the principal and Basic Shiksha Adhikari (BSA) of Rae Bareli district.

The mother and son, along with Sengar and eight others, were arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in April and have been in jail since.

The case came to light in April this year when the survivor tried to immolate herself outside Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's residence, alleging police inaction against the accused.

The survivor on 4 June, 2017 had alleged that she was raped by BJP MLA Sengar at his residence, when she had gone to meet him, along with a relative, seeking a job. In February, the girl's family had moved the court, seeking to include the MLA's name in the case. Subsequently, the victim's father was booked by the police under the Arms Act on 3 April and put in jail on 5 April.

Frustrated with the alleged police inaction and coercion from influential people, the victim attempted self-immolation in front of chief minister Adityanath's residence on 8 April. The next day, her father died in jail with the post-mortem examination report suggesting serious injuries on his body.

The election is just three days away and polls campaign ends at 8:00am tomorrow, but election violence and attacks on BNP and Oikyafront candidates are escalating even after military deployment.

In the latest such attack by alleged Awami League men, BNP candidate for Pabna-4 constituency Habibur Rahman Habib was stabbed in Ishwardi of Pabna yesterday.

His wounds were said to be serious, and the BNP leader was flown to Dhaka in a helicopter in the afternoon for treatment.

""He has four stab injuries on his hip and all the wounds are deep. So after primary treatment, he was taken to Dhaka for better treatment,"" said Abul Kalam Azad, emergency ward record keeper at Pabna Medical College Hospital.

It comes a day after BNP candidate Goyeshwar Chandra Roy and 30 others were injured in an attack by alleged AL men in Dhaka's Keraniganj.

Since election campaign officially began on December 10, at least 53 BNP and Jatiya Oikyafront candidates have now been attacked allegedly by AL men. Two AL aspirants have also come under attack allegedly by their opponents.

The polls violence, which seems to be escalating despite army deployment across the country, left some 1,100 people, mostly BNP men, injured.

Witnesses said some 12-15 men wearing AL badges attacked Habib from behind with knives and machetes soon after he joined a pre-scheduled election rally on Alhaj School premises in Ishawardi around 12:00pm.

His supporters then shielded him and took him to a nearby house from where he was first taken to the upazila health complex and then to the medical college hospital, before being shifted to Dhaka.

Five of his supporters were also injured in the attack.

Bahauddin Faruki, officer in-charge of Ishwardi Police Station, confirmed the attack and said they detained eight people from the spot over the attack.

He, however, refused to disclose the identity of the detainees, citing ongoing investigation. But law enforcers frequently disclose the names of suspects and even parade them before the media during ongoing investigations.

He added, ""An investigation will be conducted to verify authenticity of the documents.""

Haripal Singh's son Shubham and two others had also been booked in another case of alleged kidnapping and gangrape of the Unnao victim in 2017.

The Unnao rape case had come to light in April this year, when the victim had tried to immolate herself outside Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's residence, alleging police inaction against the accused. Her family had alleged that she was raped by BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and his accomplices last year. The victim's father had filed a complaint in court alleging Sengar raped his daughter at his house on the pretext of helping her to get a job. On April 3, the victim's father was beaten up allegedly by the MLA's brother Atul Singh and others in the village. He was later sent to jail on various charges as well as under the Arms Act. On April 8, his condition deteriorated inside Unnao jail and he died during treatment next morning.

Later, Unnao police lodged an FIR on rape charges against MLA Sengar and another FIR into the murder of victim's father. On the state government's recommendation, the investigation of the case was transferred to CBI. The CBI had chargsheeted MLA Sengar and Shashi Singh in the rape case, and the MLA's brother Atul Singh and four others in the murder case of the victim's father. Another chargesheet was filed by the agency against 10 accused, including Sengar, Atul Singh and three policemen, for allegedly being part of a conspiracy in falsely implicating the rape victim's father in the Arms Act case. Sengar and Shashi Singh are presently in jail."

In a major twist to the Unnao rape case against a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator, a first information report (FIR) listing charges of fraud, forgery and tampering with documents to frame innocent people has been registered against the victim, her mother and uncle.

The FIR was registered at Unnao's Makhi police station on Sunday, December 23, following directions from a local court on a petition filed by Haripal Singh, whose son Shubham Singh and wife Shashi Singh were also accused in the FIR lodged in connection with the rape.

The mother and son, along with BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar and eight others, were arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and have been in jail since April.

The court directed Unnao police to register the FIR on the complaint of Haripal Singh after considering some crucial facts mentioned in his application. Inspector of Makhi police station Dinesh Chandra Mishra confirmed the FIR had been registered against the girl, her mother and uncle on the court's directive and a probe was underway.

Singh mentioned in his application that the woman reported to have been raped by Sengar had had an affair with a person whom he identified as Awadhesh Tewari and eloped with him in September last year.

He alleged her family members started pressuring his wife Shashi to get their son Shubham married to the woman when she returned. The complainant said the woman's family falsely framed his wife and son when they spurned marriage. He also alleged that the family also prepared a forged school certificate with a false date of birth to prove the woman was a minor. He said the certificate presented by the family bore signatures of Basic Shiksha Adhikari (BSA), Rae Bareli and principal of the school where she reportedly studied. He said the BSA and the principal denied having signed the certificate presented by the family to the investigation agency."

The Associa­tion said that the fee was charged after examining and scrutinizing its income and expenses. President JKJCCPS Showkat M Chowdhary said the Fee Fixation Committee, as per the High Court directions, approves the fee for a full calen­dar year and not on monthly basis. He said the schools submit all the documents, income and expenses attested by Chartered Accountant, undertakings and declarations to the Fee Fixation Committee on the basis of which the fee is fixed.

""The private schools hire staff on yearly basis who are provided salary and provident funds for full year. No school hires staff as daily wagers. Accordingly, the schools charge tuition for full calendar year. The schools also make it sure that the teachers and other staff are paid properly. They also upgrade its in­frastructure and other facilities on regular basis in an effort to impart quality education to the students so that they can compete not only at state or national level but at in­ternational level."" About the trans­portation charges, JKJCCPS said the private schools charge for only 10 months even though they provide salary to the drivers and conductors for full year. ""Besides other charges including road tax, insurances are also borne by the schools for 12 months and there is no exemption from any authority or company to schools for the school buses dur­ing winter months. The schools only save fuel during the winter months on the basis of which only 10 months transportation fee is charged from the parents."" JKJCCPS said transport facilities are provided to the students on no profit no loss basis. ""This facility is for the smooth transportation of the students so that they reach the schools and re­turn back home on fixed times. It is neither prudent to say that schools will ply buses on losses.""

JKJCCPS said it is not mandatory for the parents to avail transport facility. ""If parents feel the trans­port is not viable, they can opt out of this facility and drop the students at schools on their own."" It said the Coordination Committee has al­ready given clear-cut instructions to the schools not to charge arbitrarily or make unnecessarily charges.

""We have also urged parents to register their complaints with the Coordination Committee for its prompt redressal."" JKJCCPS urged parents no to resort to media trails instead seek better education for the wards. ""In today's modern world when competition is very high for the students, parents should ex­hort upon the school management to further upgrade infrastructure in terms of latest teaching aids and other facilities which should be in­tegral part of class room.""

JKJCCPS further urged parents' association to sit with coordination committee over the issue and clear doubts, if any, regarding the fee charged from the students.

""We believe that media trials will serve no purpose but only hamper the school functioning and derail our effort to impart quality educa­tion. We will also like to invite me­dia for open discussion and clear any doubts on the matter so that we focus on providing quality education to the students and help parents lay a strong foundation of their children."""

We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period -- and we're tracking every last dollar.

Today, a summer intern working in land management who makes $9.25 per hour and spends some of her money this week on mango kombucha. Note: this diary was written last summer and is the last entry in our Your Spending In Your State series.

Occupation: Summer Intern

Industry: Land Management and Development

Age: 20

Location: Kauai, Hawaii

Salary: $9.25/hour

Paycheck Amount (Biweekly): $533

Monthly Expenses

Rent: $0 (I'm living with my parents for the summer back home. It's my last summer before graduating and entering the ""real world,"" and my first one since high school that I've spent at home.)

Spotify Student: $5

Hulu Basic: $8 (I pay for this, my parents pay for Netflix, and we all have access to both accounts.)

Phone: $0 (My parents pay.)

Health Insurance: I'm on my parents' plan until I turn 26. (#ThanksObama)

College: I'm on an academic merit scholarship that covers my tuition, and other outside merit scholarships cover most of my other costs. Since my scholarship renewal is contingent on maintaining a high GPA, grades are very important to me. My parents contribute about $2,500/semester from a college fund to cover basic costs like books and transportation.

Savings: I put $500 into my Roth IRA every six months and am trying to build up my checking account for next semester, as it was decimated during my study abroad semester (I was not permitted to get paid at my internship because of my student visa).

6:30 a.m. -- I wake up and have scrambled eggs with leftover gyoza filling from last night for breakfast, along with fresh mangos from my best friend's farm and figs from our backyard! Being home for the summer makes me appreciate the wonderful things from my island that I took for granted before moving away.

10 a.m. -- Two hours into work, I have a coffee from the office Keurig and a KIND bar.

1 p.m. -- Lunch from home: shiso musubi (rice balls), leftover gyoza, takuan, and ahi poke. My mom just returned from a trip to Japan and is way too excited about using the kawaii bento accessories she picked up.

4:30 p.m. -- I fill up gas at Costco using my mom's card ($23.33). Gas here is so expensive that this is the only place we fill up for the rebate, and I don't have my own Costco card.

5 p.m. -- Finish work and stop at my local juice shop to pick up a mango kombucha. (I get 50 cents off for bringing a reusable bottle!) This company supports a total of 30 local farms on the island and only sells reusable bottles. And their workers are the sweetest! $4.50

5:15 p.m. -- I go for a three-mile run along the ocean. Not paying for a gym, plus killer views, and occasional whale spottings make me wonder why I go to college on the East Coast.

8 p.m. -- Mom and I cook sukiyaki and brown rice for dinner with fresh watercress on the side, and I pack the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

6:30 a.m. -- I wake up and see that my grades from my semester abroad came in! I did well in most of my classes but got one unexpected B. I shoot off emails to the professor and my advisor while eating an avocado and chicken sandwich for breakfast. (The avocados are free from our friend's farm.)

7:30 a.m. -- I call my best friend from study abroad on my way into work to vent about the grade. She's the best and I miss her.

9:30 a.m. -- Office Keurig coffee and leftover KIND bar for snack.

1 p.m. -- Leftover sukiyaki and rice for lunch with a raw egg. A coworker went to a Filipino restaurant nearby and brought back cascaron for dessert, and another coworker brought in homemade matcha ice cream!

5 p.m. -- I meet my dad after work for our favorite hike and we trail run three miles up and down the mountain. He is 56 and still kicks my ass.

7:30 p.m. -- I make beef, broccoli, salad, and brown rice for dinner for my dad, my grandma, and myself. (My mom is working.) Afterwards, I read more of Labor of Love by Moira Weigel, a really interesting book about the history of dating that I'm renting as a free library eBook!

6:30 a.m. -- Wake up and eat breakfast: avocado sandwich on whole grain again with fresh mango.

7:30 a.m. -- I study economics and love that there are so many accessible, well-made, and free podcasts available on the topic! I listen to Planet Money on my way into work.

12 p.m. -- I'm selling a bathing suit that doesn't fit me properly on eBay, so I run to the post office during lunch. I make $152 after fees and spend $28.78 on expedited shipping for the buyer, so I net $123.22.

12:15 p.m. -- I'm tired of Japanese food, so I go to the Costco food court (my happiest place) and get a chicken bake for lunch. I also grab a free strawberry guava juice from the company fridge. $2.33

5:30 p.m. -- There's a swell on the south side of the island, so I meet up with my dad after work and we surf until the sun goes down. When we get out of the water, we realize someone has stolen our car keys! This has never happened to us before on the island, and it's super disappointing. We call a friend to bring us a spare.

9:45 p.m. -- By the time our friend comes and we get back to our side of the island, everything but fast food is closed. I'm starving and exhausted, so I go through the Taco Bell drive-through and get a cheesy potato burrito. $3.68

6:30 a.m. -- Up and at 'em! I have cereal with chopped apples and bananas from our friend's farm and fresh pineapple.

8 a.m. -- Get to work and make a Keurig coffee.

12 p.m. -- I go on a lunch run with my boss and she treats me to a pineapple tea. I eat leftover beef broccoli and brown rice for lunch.

5:30 p.m. -- I stop at my local juice shop to pick up more kombucha. Mango mint jalapeño for me and strawberry guava for my mom. I get a free shot of ginger juice, cinnamon, lemon, and honey. $9

6 p.m. -- I would usually go for a run now, but I'm exhausted, so I FaceTime with my friend instead. He is interning in Silicon Valley this summer, and I try to convince him to use that sweet tech cash to come visit Kauai for a weekend.

7:30 p.m. -- I treat my friend to dinner as a thank you for driving 90 minutes roundtrip to bring us our keys last night. My parents have a date night, so I bring my grandma with us as well. We go to her favorite sushi restaurant and order miso soup, seaweed salad, three rolls, and green tea. $77

8:30 p.m. -- I crack open my AFOQT book for an hour. I'm studying to become an officer in the Air Force after graduating - I want a break after undergrad before hopefully going to law school. I also feel strongly that our military should be more diverse, and I'm ready to put my money where my mouth is.

5:30 a.m. -- I wake up early for a phone interview for a fall internship at a cool start-up. It goes well, and I'm excited about the prospect! Afterwards, I eat a BLT with avocado from our friend's farm and some honeydew melon.

7:30 a.m. -- New Freakonomics Radio episode! The drive to work flies by.

8 a.m. -- Work! My coworker gives me the top of a pineapple we ate yesterday and suggests I try to plant it in my house. I do some research and decide to give it a try.

12 p.m. -- Our office is playing tennis today! And my coworker brought in Chinese chicken salad and homemade banana lumpia for everyone for lunch.

5 p.m. -- I go home and help my mom prep for the dinner party we're throwing to thank our farmer friends for all of the recent goodies - five of our good friends come over and we make slow roasted salmon, garlic risotto, chicken masala, eggplant parm, and a caprese salad! I've typically only come home for a couple of weeks every year since I graduated high school because my college is so far away, so spending time with my family and friends feels absolutely amazing.

8 a.m. -- I wake up and text my friends about breakfast. My friend's roommate from college is visiting Kauai for the first time, so we go to our favorite local diner and order loco mocos, oxtail soup, and banana macadamia nut pancakes to split. $15.08

11 a.m. -- We stop at our favorite local boutique to check out the new arrivals, but I ate too much at breakfast and feel too bloated to try anything on. We go for coffee at another local shop and I get an iced coffee. $3.05

12 p.m. -- I get home and nap, clean, and watch a few episodes of The Handmaid's Tale on Hulu. I read the book a few years ago and loved it, and the show is just as good!

6 p.m. -- It's Bon Dance season -- a Buddhist summer festival that we look forward to every year. I meet a friend and we drive down to the Bon Dance with my grandma in tow. (She's too old to dance now, but likes to sit and watch.) We dance for hours while snacking on shaved ice, daikon, musubi, and nishime. As per tradition, the church provides free dinner for dancers.

10:30 p.m. -- I get home, finish up the leftover risotto, and sleep. After studying abroad, living a more chill lifestyle has been exactly what I need.

8:30 a.m. -- It feels so nice to sleep in! I make avocado toast for breakfast.

12 p.m. -- It's a family tradition to do a deep clean every Sunday, so I help out by scrubbing the toilets and folding towels.

2 p.m. -- More of The Handmaid's Tale! I'm officially hooked.

5 p.m. -- My dad, mom, grandma, and I pile into the car and drive to the south side. Grandma is stoked to see a couple of monk seals chilling on the shore! We swim for a while and then go to our favorite hot dog place, where I get a Polish dog with Lilikoi mustard and mango relish and then chocolate gelato for dessert ($12, Mom pays). I'm so lucky to have parents that can afford to have me home for the summer.

8 p.m. -- We drive home. I hop in the shower and then scroll through Instagram before going to sleep."

The gathering, rather, was a ceremony at which he and other senior oil ministry officials asked God to boost oil output.

""This place of peace and spirituality,"" read a release by the Oil Ministry that was later scrubbed from its web site, ""was the site of prayer by workers for the recovery of production of the industry.""

President Nicolas Maduro turned heads in November 2017 when he named a National Guard general with no oil experience to lead PDVSA. Quevedo's actions since have raised even more doubts that he and the other military brass now running the company have a viable plan to rescue it from crushing debt, an exodus of workers and withering production now at its lowest in almost seven decades.

Aside from beseeching heaven, Quevedo in recent months has enacted a series of controversial measures that oil industry experts, PDVSA employees and contractors, and even everyday citizens say are pushing the once-profitable and respected company toward ruin.

Soldiers with AK-47s, under orders to prevent cheating on manifests, now board tankers to accompany cargo inspectors, rattling foreign captains and crews.

Workers who make mistakes operating increasingly dilapidated PDVSA equipment now face the risk of arrest and charges of sabotage or corruption. Military chieftains, moonlighting in the private sector, are elbowing past other contractors for lucrative service and supply business with PDVSA.

In a little-noted reversal of the Socialist government's two-decade drive to nationalize the industry, the lack of expertise among military managers is leading PDVSA to hire outsiders to keep afloat even basic operations, like drilling and pumping oil. To the dismay of many familiar with Venezuela's oil industry, some of the contracts are going to small, little-known firms with no experience in the sector.

Combined, industry veterans say, the steps leave Venezuela's most important company - which accounts for over 90 percent of export revenue - with even fewer means to rebuild the nation's coffers, pay its many creditors and regain self-sufficiency as an oil producer.

""What we are witnessing is a policy of destroying the oil industry,"" said Jose Bodas, general secretary of the Oil Workers Federation, a national labor union. ""The military officials don't listen to workers. They want to give orders, but they don't understand this complicated work.""

Maduro defends the military managers, arguing they are more in synch with his Socialist worldview than capitalist industry professionals who exploit the country for personal profit. ""I want a Socialist PDVSA,"" the president told allied legislators earlier this year. ""An ethical, sovereign and productive PDVSA. We must break this model of the rentier oil company.""

Quevedo, who holds the title of oil minister as well as president of PDVSA, didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. Neither Venezuela's Information Ministry, responsible for communications for the government and senior officials, nor PDVSA's press office returned phone calls or emails from Reuters.

PDVSA and the Oil Ministry disclose scant information about Quevedo, who is 51, according to his social security registration. He seldom makes public speeches. But at an industry event in Vienna last June, Quevedo told journalists PDVSA is aware of its challenges and hoped within months to make up for plummeting output.

""We hope by year end to recover the lost production,"" he said in a forecast that has been missed. ""We have the capacity and we have summoned the strength of the workers.""

Nearly 20 years after the late Hugo Chavez launched his ""Bolivarian revolution,"" much of Venezuela is in tatters. Food and medicines are scarce, hyperinflation has gutted purchasing power for increasingly desperate citizens and roughly three million Venezuelans have fled the country in search of a better life.

At PDVSA, managers long sought to keep the company running, even if the economic meltdown and falling oil prices meant they had fewer resources to invest in exploration, growth and basic maintenance. Despite their efforts, decay led to dwindling production, deteriorating facilities and a progressive loss of skilled workers.

Now, critics say, military officials atop PDVSA have put aside any pretense of running it like a proper business, doing little to stem the fall in production or improve the company's financial, operational and staffing problems.

No matter the dysfunction, PDVSA remains a rare and crucial source of foreign currency in the enfeebled Andean country. For Maduro, who became president after Chavez died in 2013, handing the company over to the military is seen by many as a calculated move to buy loyalty from officers.

""No one will be able to remove the military from PDVSA now,"" said Rafael Ramirez, a former oil minister. Ramirez ran the company for a decade under Chavez before clashing with Maduro, who accuses him and many other former executives of corruption. ""PDVSA is a barrack.""

PDVSA is struggling to fulfill supply contracts with buyers, including major creditors from China and Russia who have already advanced billions of dollars in payments in exchange for oil. Last month, the head of Rosneft, the Russian oil company, flew to Venezuela and complained to Maduro about the delays, Reuters reported.

Demand remains healthy for Venezuelan oil. Operational problems under Quevedo, however, have caused production to drop 20 percent to 1.46 million barrels per day, according to the latest figures Caracas reported to OPEC, the oil cartel, of which it is a member.

Quevedo in January will assume OPEC's rotating presidency for one year. PDVSA's financial problems are likely to demand much of his attention.

The gross value of PDVSA's oil exports is expected to fall to $20.9 billion this year compared with $24.9 billion last year, according to a calculation provided to Reuters by the International Energy Center at IESA, a Venezuelan business school. Exports a decade ago were over four times as much, reaching $89 billion, according to PDVSA's accounts for 2008.

PDVSA didn't publish a 2017 report and hasn't released financial results in 2018.

Little has been publicly disclosed by PDVSA or Maduro's government about the military transformation within its ranks.

A Reuters examination based on confidential PDVSA documents - as well as interviews with dozens of current and former employees, shippers, traders, foreign oil executives and others who do business with the company - shows how Quevedo's National Guard is seeping into every facet of its operations. The documents include employment records, agreements with contractors and internal staff memos.

Quevedo has appointed more than 100 aides and advisors from the military and from a previous post as a government minister to senior positions, according to a person familiar with PDVSA's human resource records.

At its shabby concrete Caracas headquarters, once brimming with suited executives, military officers are now in charge of operations. Workers say offices in Quevedo's penthouse sanctum remain luxurious. But in the run-down halls below, socialist propaganda, including portraits of Fidel Castro and Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, is among the scant decor left on the walls.

The shift toward military management was the result of a purge of PDVSA leadership.

Allegations of corruption have been rife across the Venezuelan government in recent years; Maduro himself is the target of U.S. sanctions for graft and human rights violations, which he denies.

In 2017, the president leveled his own accusations against PDVSA, describing it as a den of ""thieves."" He accused many former executives of skimming from contracts and laundering money and argued that their graft worsened the country's crisis.

He ordered the arrest of dozens of top managers, including PDVSA's two previous presidents, chemist Nelson Martinez and engineer Eulogio Del Pino. Martinez died at a military hospital earlier this month, suffering a heart attack while undergoing kidney dialysis, two people familiar with the circumstances said.

Del Pino remains detained, awaiting trial. Reuters was unable to reach his lawyers for comment. A person familiar with Del Pino's defense said he has yet, after a year in jail, to have an initial court hearing.

At the time of the purge, Quevedo had risen from the National Guard ranks to become a prominent government loyalist.

Quevedo's Twitter profile often features a photo of the general, a stocky and balding man with heavy eyebrows, reviewing paperwork with the president or smiling happily alongside him. His feed consists almost exclusively of retweets of Maduro's posts.

Since 2001, the general has moved between military and civilian positions. He has a longstanding relationship with Diosdado Cabello, the powerful vice president of the Socialist party: The two were classmates as young men at military school.

Those ties led to senior posts for Quevedo at the Defense Ministry and a program created by Chavez for low-income housing, according to official government gazettes and people who know his trajectory.

In 2014, back in a command role with the National Guard, Quevedo led a unit that clashed with demonstrators during protests that shook Venezuela for four months. At least 43 people, on both sides, died during the demonstrations, sparked by the onset of food shortages.

Quevedo was criticized by many government opponents for using excessive force, which he denied. He appeared frequently on state television at the time, donning an olive-green helmet and bullet-proof vest. ""These are terrorist groups,"" he said of the protestors, who eventually dissipated, leading him to declare that ""the coup has been defeated.""

Pleased with Quevedo's performance, Maduro in 2015 named him housing minister. In his two years in the post, he again became a fixture on state television, often wearing the red shirt of the Socialist movement and praising Maduro's ""humane"" housing policies.

Opposition leaders scoffed at what they saw as Quevedo's outsized boasts, including an unsubstantiated claim that the government constructed more than 2 million homes, despite widespread shortages of basic building materials. The housing ministry didn't respond to requests for comment.

In November 2017, intelligence agents arrested former PDVSA chief Del Pino in a predawn raid on unspecified graft charges. By then, Quevedo was Maduro's choice to lead the all-important company. The announcement prompted widespread skepticism in the industry.

Quevedo said he would need little time to get a handle on the oil businesses. ""Give me 10 days,"" he told acquaintances, according to one person who spoke with him at the time.

From the start, Maduro made clear the challenge ahead. In a public address during ""Powerhouse Venezuela 2018,"" a government conference meant to showcase business potential, the president ordered Quevedo to boost oil output by a whopping 1 million barrels per day - roughly a 50 percent increase at the time.

Over the past year, though, Quevedo has failed to reverse the slide.

One of his first challenges, according to people within PDVSA, was to stanch the flow of workers, many of whom deserted the company and Venezuela altogether. PDVSA hasn't disclosed recent employment figures. But estimates by IPD Latin America, an oil and gas consultancy, indicate PDVSA has about 106,000 workers - 27 percent fewer than in 2016.

Because of cost-of-living increases that now top 1 million percent per year, according to Venezuela's National Assembly, PDVSA salaries have crumbled to the equivalent of a handful of dollars a month for most workers.

With no money, and little real work to do at idle and faulty facilities, some employees only show up to eat at the few company cafeterias that remain open. Shippers told Reuters that PDVSA workers at times board vessels to ask for food.

To boost manpower, Quevedo has been staffing some jobs, including posts that once required technical knowledge, with National Guard recruits. The terminal of Jose, a Caribbean port in northeast Venezuela, is one of the few remaining facilities from which PDVSA exports crude oil.

The changes are disturbing buyers here. Some tanker captains complain that young soldiers are woefully unprepared to verify technical details, like whether crude density, a crucial attribute of quality, complies with contract specifications, according to three shippers and one PDVSA employee.

Crews fret a stray bullet from the soldiers' rifles could spark fires and complain that some of the crime afflicting the country is making its way on board. Although Quevedo has tasked the soldiers to help spot graft, some of the low-paid recruits ask for bribes themselves, shippers said, for signing off on paperwork or completing inspections.

""There are many risks,"" one captain told Reuters.

Venezuela's Defense Ministry, which oversees the National Guard, didn't respond to Reuters phone calls or emails requesting comment.

Even with soldiers as substitutes, PDVSA can't find the workers it needs to man many posts. From the processing of crude at refineries to contract negotiations with buyers, the shortage of skilled staffers is hobbling the company.

In a recent internal report, PDV Marina, the company's maritime unit, said staffing was in a ""critical state"" on PDVSA's own tankers, forcing some workers to toil far more than allowed by union rules. The ""alarming deficit of main staff,"" the report read, means ""we cannot honor labor agreements.""

Tensions with military managers are causing even more departures, some workers say.

Consider an incident in June, when two tankers docked at Jose. One prepared to take on heavy crude, the other a lighter grade of oil.

As the tankers loaded, PDVSA port employees noticed a mixup - the two crudes had blended. The mistake, the government said later, forced PDVSA to pay the buyers, because of contractual penalties, $2.7 million.

It would also be costly for nine PDVSA employees.

Shortly after the error, soldiers and intelligence agents arrested the workers, and prosecutors charged them with sabotage. ""This was premeditated,"" said Tarek Saab, Maduro's chief prosecutor, announcing the arrests on television. ""The actions go beyond negligence - there was malice here.""

After three days in an overcrowded military jail, they were released, pending trial. Two workers in the oil industry familiar with their case said poor maintenance, not sabotage, caused the mishap. A faulty valve system, flimsy after years without upkeep, caused the fuels to mix, they said.

Six months later, the government has presented no evidence against the workers.

Reuters was unable to reach the accused or to independently determine the cause of the mishap. Colleagues said the workers are under orders not to speak publicly of the incident.

The arrests have rattled PDVSA employees, especially because soldiers and intelligence agents have also detained workers at other facilities after mistakes.

In July, four PDVSA employees were arrested after crude spilled into a river near an oilfield in the state of Monagas, according to workers and media accounts there. One worker in Monagas told Reuters that faulty turbines caused the spill and that a vehicle shortage kept employees from reaching the site to stem the flow.

""We don't understand how a lack of resources becomes an excuse to accuse workers of negligence or sabotage,"" he said. ""They're being asked to work without safety equipment, tools, even without being able to feed themselves or their families.""

Quevedo has been creating new partnerships that are meant to shore up PDVSA. In August, for instance, the general said the company was ""opening its doors"" for seven private companies to pursue unspecified ""service contracts"" across the country.

The move raised eyebrows here, because it ran counter to longstanding efforts to nationalize the entire industry. Chavez himself phased out similar contracts, arguing that they enriched private enterprise for work that the state should do itself.

According to a document seen by Reuters, the companies obtained six-year agreements to operate oilfields on behalf of PDVSA in return for boosting output, financing investments and procuring equipment.

But the companies are unfamiliar even to veterans of Venezuela's oil industry. None are recognized as having experience operating oilfields. Consorcio Rinoca Centauro Karina, one of those listed on the document, doesn't appear to have a web site. Reuters was unable to reach it or any of the others.

Critics of the arrangements, and government opponents, say the transactions aren't transparent. By keeping details from the public, they argue, the company faces little scrutiny over whom it chooses to do business with.

""PDVSA is looking to maintain its confederation of mafias, its quota of looting,"" said Jorge Millan, an opposition legislator who in September led a push in the National Assembly to denounce the contracts.

While Quevedo's militarization of PDVSA hasn't reversed the company's decline, the government shows few public signs of displeasure. In October, the government announced a PDVSA board shuffle. Among the changes: Jose Rojas, another National Guard general, replaced a civilian director.

Past executives joke that Quevedo knew what he was doing when he prayed for help.

""He's right,"" said Jose Toro Hardy, an economist who served on PDVSA's board of directors in the 1990s. ""A miracle is needed for an increase in these conditions.""

"232","1026834010","2018-12-26","https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/special-report-oil-output-goes-awol-in-venezuela-as-soldiers-run-pdvsa-1730769","Special Report: Oil output goes AWOL in Venezuela as soldiers run PDVSA","investing.com",FALSE,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Last July 6, Major General Manuel Quevedo joined his wife, a Catholic priest and a gathering of oil workers in prayer in a conference room at the headquarters of Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA.

The career military officer, who for the past year has been boss at the troubled state-owned oil company, was at no ordinary mass. The gathering, rather, was a ceremony at which he and other senior oil ministry officials asked God to boost oil output.

""This place of peace and spirituality,"" read a release by the Oil Ministry that was later scrubbed from its web site, ""was the site of prayer by workers for the recovery of production of the industry.""

President Nicolas Maduro turned heads in November 2017 when he named a National Guard general with no oil experience to lead PDVSA [PDVSA.UL]. Quevedo's actions since have raised even more doubts that he and the other military brass now running the company have a viable plan to rescue it from crushing debt, an exodus of workers and withering production now at its lowest in almost seven decades.

Aside from beseeching heaven, Quevedo in recent months has enacted a series of controversial measures that oil industry experts, PDVSA employees and contractors, and even everyday citizens say are pushing the once-profitable and respected company towards ruin.

Soldiers with AK-47s, under orders to prevent cheating on manifests, now board tankers to accompany cargo inspectors, rattling foreign captains and crews.

Workers who make mistakes operating increasingly dilapidated PDVSA equipment now face the risk of arrest and charges of sabotage or corruption. Military chieftains, moonlighting in the private sector, are elbowing past other contractors for lucrative service and supply business with PDVSA.

In a little-noted reversal of the Socialist government's two-decade drive to nationalize the industry, the lack of expertise among military managers is leading PDVSA to hire outsiders to keep afloat even basic operations, like drilling and pumping oil. To the dismay of many familiar with Venezuela's oil industry, some of the contracts are going to small, little-known firms with no experience in the sector.

Combined, industry veterans say, the steps leave Venezuela's most important company - which accounts for over 90 percent of export revenue - with even fewer means to rebuild the nation's coffers, pay its many creditors and regain self-sufficiency as an oil producer.

""What we are witnessing is a policy of destroying the oil industry,"" said Jose Bodas, general secretary of the Oil Workers Federation, a national labor union. ""The military officials don't listen to workers. They want to give orders, but they don't understand this complicated work.""

Maduro defends the military managers, arguing they are more in synch with his Socialist worldview than capitalist industry professionals who exploit the country for personal profit. ""I want a Socialist PDVSA,"" the president told allied legislators earlier this year. ""An ethical, sovereign and productive PDVSA. We must break this model of the rentier oil company.""

Quevedo, who holds the title of oil minister as well as president of PDVSA, didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. Neither Venezuela's Information Ministry, responsible for communications for the government and senior officials, nor PDVSA's press office returned phone calls or emails from Reuters.

PDVSA and the Oil Ministry disclose scant information about Quevedo, who is 51, according to his social security registration. He seldom makes public speeches. But at an industry event in Vienna last June, Quevedo told journalists PDVSA is aware of its challenges and hoped within months to make up for plummeting output.

""We hope by year end to recover the lost production,"" he said in a forecast that has been missed. ""We have the capacity and we have summoned the strength of the workers.""

Nearly 20 years after the late Hugo Chavez launched his ""Bolivarian revolution,"" much of Venezuela is in tatters. Food and medicines are scarce, hyperinflation has gutted purchasing power for increasingly desperate citizens and roughly three million Venezuelans have fled the country in search of a better life.

At PDVSA, managers long sought to keep the company running, even if the economic meltdown and falling oil prices meant they had fewer resources to invest in exploration, growth and basic maintenance. Despite their efforts, decay led to dwindling production, deteriorating facilities and a progressive loss of skilled workers.

Now, critics say, military officials atop PDVSA have put aside any pretense of running it like a proper business, doing little to stem the fall in production or improve the company's financial, operational and staffing problems.

A PURGE

No matter the dysfunction, PDVSA remains a rare and crucial source of foreign currency in the enfeebled Andean country. For Maduro, who became president after Chavez died in 2013, handing the company over to the military is seen by many as a calculated move to buy loyalty from officers.

""No one will be able to remove the military from PDVSA now,"" said Rafael Ramirez, a former oil minister. Ramirez ran the company for a decade under Chavez before clashing with Maduro, who accuses him and many other former executives of corruption. ""PDVSA is a barrack.""

PDVSA is struggling to fulfill supply contracts with buyers, including major creditors from China and Russia who have already advanced billions of dollars in payments in exchange for oil. Last month, the head of Rosneft, the Russian oil company, flew to Venezuela and complained to Maduro about the delays, Reuters reported.

Demand remains healthy for Venezuelan oil. Operational problems under Quevedo, however, have caused production to drop 20 percent to 1.46 million barrels per day, according to the latest figures Caracas reported to OPEC, the oil cartel, of which it is a member.

Quevedo in January will assume OPEC's rotating presidency for one year. PDVSA's financial problems are likely to demand much of his attention.

The gross value of PDVSA's oil exports is expected to fall to $20.9 billion this year compared with $24.9 billion last year, according to a calculation provided to Reuters by the International Energy Center at IESA, a Venezuelan business school. Exports a decade ago were over four times as much, reaching $89 billion, according to PDVSA's accounts for 2008.

PDVSA didn't publish a 2017 report and hasn't released financial results in 2018.

Little has been publicly disclosed by PDVSA or Maduro's government about the military transformation within its ranks.

A Reuters examination based on confidential PDVSA documents - as well as interviews with dozens of current and former employees, shippers, traders, foreign oil executives and others who do business with the company - shows how Quevedo's National Guard is seeping into every facet of its operations. The documents include employment records, agreements with contractors and internal staff memos.

Quevedo has appointed more than 100 aides and advisors from the military and from a previous post as a government minister to senior positions, according to a person familiar with PDVSA's human resource records.

At its shabby concrete Caracas headquarters, once brimming with suited executives, military officers are now in charge of operations. Workers say offices in Quevedo's penthouse sanctum remain luxurious. But in the run-down halls below, socialist propaganda, including portraits of Fidel Castro and Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, is among the scant decor left on the walls.

The shift toward military management was the result of a purge of PDVSA leadership.

Allegations of corruption have been rife across the Venezuelan government in recent years; Maduro himself is the target of U.S. sanctions for graft and human rights violations, which he denies.

In 2017, the president leveled his own accusations against PDVSA, describing it as a den of ""thieves."" He accused many former executives of skimming from contracts and laundering money and argued that their graft worsened the country's crisis.

He ordered the arrest of dozens of top managers, including PDVSA's two previous presidents, chemist Nelson Martinez and engineer Eulogio Del Pino. Martinez died at a military hospital earlier this month, suffering a heart attack while undergoing kidney dialysis, two people familiar with the circumstances said.

Del Pino remains detained, awaiting trial. Reuters was unable to reach his lawyers for comment. A person familiar with Del Pino's defense said he has yet, after a year in jail, to have an initial court hearing.

LOYALIST

At the time of the purge, Quevedo had risen from the National Guard ranks to become a prominent government loyalist.

Quevedo's Twitter profile often features a photo of the general, a stocky and balding man with heavy eyebrows, reviewing paperwork with the president or smiling happily alongside him. His feed consists almost exclusively of retweets of Maduro's posts.

Since 2001, the general has moved between military and civilian positions. He has a longstanding relationship with Diosdado Cabello, the powerful vice president of the Socialist party: The two were classmates as young men at military school.

Those ties led to senior posts for Quevedo at the Defense Ministry and a program created by Chavez for low-income housing, according to official government gazettes and people who know his trajectory.

In 2014, back in a command role with the National Guard, Quevedo led a unit that clashed with demonstrators during protests that shook Venezuela for four months. At least 43 people, on both sides, died during the demonstrations, sparked by the onset of food shortages.

Quevedo was criticized by many government opponents for using excessive force, which he denied. He appeared frequently on state television at the time, donning an olive-green helmet and bullet-proof vest. ""These are terrorist groups,"" he said of the protestors, who eventually dissipated, leading him to declare that ""the coup has been defeated.""

Pleased with Quevedo's performance, Maduro in 2015 named him housing minister. In his two years in the post, he again became a fixture on state television, often wearing the red shirt of the Socialist movement and praising Maduro's ""humane"" housing policies.

Opposition leaders scoffed at what they saw as Quevedo's outsized boasts, including an unsubstantiated claim that the government constructed more than 2 million homes, despite widespread shortages of basic building materials. The housing ministry didn't respond to requests for comment.

In November 2017, intelligence agents arrested former PDVSA chief Del Pino in a predawn raid on unspecified graft charges. By then, Quevedo was Maduro's choice to lead the all-important company. The announcement prompted widespread skepticism in the industry.

Quevedo said he would need little time to get a handle on the oil businesses. ""Give me 10 days,"" he told acquaintances, according to one person who spoke with him at the time.

From the start, Maduro made clear the challenge ahead. In a public address during ""Powerhouse Venezuela 2018,"" a government conference meant to showcase business potential, the president ordered Quevedo to boost oil output by a whopping 1 million barrels per day - roughly a 50 percent increase at the time.

Over the past year, though, Quevedo has failed to reverse the slide.

One of his first challenges, according to people within PDVSA, was to stanch the flow of workers, many of whom deserted the company and Venezuela altogether. PDVSA hasn't disclosed recent employment figures. But estimates by IPD Latin America, an oil and gas consultancy, indicate PDVSA has about 106,000 workers - 27 percent fewer than in 2016.

""MALICE""

The changes are disturbing buyers here. Some tanker captains complain that young soldiers are woefully unprepared to verify technical details, like whether crude density, a crucial attribute of quality, complies with contract specifications, according to three shippers and one PDVSA employee.

In an article written for the Sangh mouthpiece Organiser, Vaidya praised the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan founder ahead of his birth anniversary on December 30. Acknowledging that the Somnath Temple and Ram Temple issues are different, Vaidya wrote: ""The Supreme Court's decision to not expedite the Ram Mandir case reminded me of a debate that took place in 1948 about the reconstruction of Somnath Mandir -- a magnificent temple destroyed by the Muslim invaders.""

Munshi's debate with Nehru over the Somnath Temple was recorded by the former in his book Pilgrimage to Freedom, which Vaidya elaborately cites in the article. ""Despite opposition from Pandit Nehru, Somnath was rebuilt and today the shrine attracts lakhs of devotees from across the world,"" Vaidya said.

The reconstruction of the Somnath Temple was initiated by Sardar Patel, then home minister, and was executed by KM Munshi, a cabinet minister in the central government. It was inaugurated by then president of India Dr Rajendra Prasad.

Vaidya writes that when Munshi went on a ""sort of pilgrimage to the broken shrine"" in December 1922, he saw it ""desecrated, burnt and battered"".

""It still stood firm -- a monument to our humiliation and ingratitude. I can scarcely describe the burning shame, which I felt on that early morning as I walked on the broken floor of the once-hallowed Sabha mandap..."" Munshi wrote.

Sardar Patel and Pandit Nehru on Somanth

As per the account of KM Munshi that Vaidya discussed in the article, in November 1947, Sardar Patel visited the temple. At a public meeting, he announced, ""On this auspicious day of the New Year, we have decided that Somnath should be reconstructed. You, people of Saurashtra, should do your best.""

Munshi also wrote about Nehru in his papers. ""The temple of Somnath is not just an ancient monument; it lived in the hearts of the whole nation and its reconstruction was a national pledge. But Jawaharlal called me and said, 'I don't like your trying to restore Somnath. It is Hindu revivalism'.""

In his article, Vaidya writes that the difference of opinion between Patel, Munshi and Nehru is illustrative of ""two different ideas of Bharat"".

""Pandit Nehru was not anti-Bharat but his idea of Bharat was rooted in a Eurocentric school of thought. On the other side was an idea of Bharat rooted in this soil and our ancient spiritual tradition,"" he writes.

Munshi's Response to Nehru

In his response to Nehru, Munshi wrote: ""When the whole scheme was discussed by Sardar with Bapu, he stated that it was alright except that the funds necessary for reconstructing the temple should come from the public. Thereafter, the idea that the Government of India should finance the reconstruction of the temple was given up.

""You pointedly referred to me in the cabinet as connected with Somnath. I am glad you did so; for I do not want to keep back any part of my views or activities, particularly from you who have placed such abundant confidence in me all these months. I have helped in building up several institutions. If similarly I am now helping to build Somnath as a center of religion (Dharma) and culture, a university and a farm, it is only as a humble task to which I have been called...I can assure you that the 'Collective Sub conscious' of India today is happier with the scheme of reconstruction of Somnath sponsored by Government of India than with many other things that we have done and are doing,"" Munshi wrote.

Replying to then PM's 'Hindu revivalism' remark, Munshi said: ""I know your views on the subject; I have always done justice to them; I hope you will equally do justice to mine. Many have been the customs, which I have defied in my humble way through literary and social work to shape or reintegrate some aspects of Hinduism, in the conviction that that alone will make India an advanced and vigorous nation under modern conditions.""

The reply to Munshi came from VP Menon, who was then advisor to the States Ministry. ""I have seen your masterpiece. I for one would be prepared to live and, if necessary, die by the views you have expressed in your letter.""

And so the reconstruction of Somnath Temple went ahead. When the time came to install the deity, Munshi approached Dr Rajendra Prasad and asked him to perform the ceremony, but added a rider -- he should accept it ""only if he was prepared not to fail us"".

Munshi wrote, ""He promised that he would come and install the deity whatever the attitude of the Prime Minister because he 'would do the same with a mosque or a church if I were invited'.""

Claiming that Nehru ""vehemently protested"" Prasad's acceptance of Munshi's invite, Vaidya said that even the president's speech was censored out of the official organs. ""It is ironical that Nehru, the Indian icon of liberalism and freedom of expression, should make sure that the speech of the President is censored. In this manner despite opposition Somnath was rebuilt and today the magnificent shrine attracts lakhs of devotees from across the world,"" Vaidya writes.

""History is repeating itself and the opposition to the Ram Temple in Ayodhya is even more vocal,"" Vaidya added."

A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and P Rajamanickam passed the interim order on a plea by Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK)'s Cheyyur town secretary M Thiagarajan seeking action against the correspondent of RC Middle School, a government aided institution for allegedly compelling students to clean the toilet.

This apart, the petitioner also wanted the court to set up a district level committee of officials known for their integrity and commitment to cause of student welfare to inspect all government and government-aided schools to ensure adequate toilet facilities are provided along with sanitary workers.

According to the petitioner, his wife Parvathi was working as a science teacher in the school for the past 10 years on consolidated pay. But after the incident came to light and the petitioner sent representations to various authorities seeking action against the management, his wife was terminated without any reason, he said. It was purely to take revenge against him, the petitioner submitted. The management claimed it was the petitioner's wife who made the children clean toilets and that was why she was sacked.

The petitioner further submitted that undeterred by the action of the management he continued to petition the collector to take appropriate action against the correspondent and ensure toilets were cleaning only by sanitary workers.

The act of the school management not only amounted to abuse of children against the Constitution it also meant forced manual scavenging as they were compelled to clean the toilets without any safety gadgets, the petitioner submitted.

The criticism against the on-field conduct of Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli seems to have no end. The latest to join the chorus trying to shame Kohli is former Australian captain Mark Taylor.

Taylor appreciated Kohli's off-the-field conduct in one of their encounters but felt the Indian captain's confrontational approach on the field was something ""the game does not need."" Recalling a meeting with Kohli from four years ago, he said, ""We were filming in a studio at Adelaide Oval the day before the Test when the national anthems blared out on the loudspeakers, as part of rehearsals for the following day, forcing us to take a break. When the anthems stopped after some 10 minutes, the India media manager told me my half-hour was up and gestured for Kohli to leave. Instead of trotting off, as he was entitled to do, Kohli turned to me and asked if I needed more time. I told him I still had a few questions I wanted to ask. 'Come on' he said. 'Let's sit back down, let's do it'. I thought that was terrific.""

However, speaking about Kohli's aggression on the field, Taylor said, ""He is an outstanding batsman but also hard-nosed and confrontational. I would not be surprised if most Australians mainly see him as the latter, which is unfortunate. While he generally captains the side well, the way he behaves at times does not do himself or his team any good. His goading of Tim Paine into a confrontation in Perth worried me. He was trying to elicit a reaction from Paine: 'Where are you at, mate? Are you prepared to take me on?' That's exactly what the game does not need. Cricket is a game about bat versus ball with a bit of theatre when required.""

Sounding a note of caution, Taylor said, ""That sort of behaviour leaked into the Australian cricket team over the years and is partly the reason we are here today. India, with Virat as their leader, can learn a lot from what has happened to Australia.""

Taylor is also not a fan of the way the contents of the stump microphone were made public. He said, ""Players will start saying things for the sake of getting on television. Perhaps I am an outlier, but I prefer to watch the game and hear an expert commentator talk rather than a wicketkeeper ranting for six balls. Maybe that's because I've heard it all before standing at first slip my whole career.""

An update from Ranji Trophy now. An all-round good performance by Bihar saw them win big over Nagaland while former Ranji champions Mumbai played out an exciting draw against Saurashtra at the Wankhede Stadium.

Bihar's left-arm spinner Ashutosh Aman picked up 12 wickets against Nagaland to help his side win by a huge 273 runs. Nagaland did well in the first innings to skittle out Bihar for just 150, with Rachit Bhatia picking up six wickets. But Bihar had Nagaland all out for 209 as Aman picked up seven wickets. Bihar then scored 505/8 in the second innings, with Mangal Mahrour scoring 177 and Rahmatullah making 107. That meant Nagaland had to chase a massive 447 in their second innings. While Captain Rongsen Jonathan scored a nearly run-a-ball 100, the rest of Nagaland's batting collapsed. Ashutosh claimed 5 wickets as Bihar wrapped up Nagaland's innings at 173. It was Bihar's fourth win in six matches. They now have 27 points, which leaves them just 10 points behind leaders Uttarakhand.

Meanwhile, in Mumbai, the home team was involved in an exciting draw with Saurashtra. Mumbai have won the Ranji Trophy 41 times while Saurashtra have never won it, having lost the finals to Mumbai on two occasions. So there is some history between the two teams. Saurashtra won the toss and chose to field. Mumbai, always happy to bat first, scored 394 in their first dig, with Siddhesh Lad making 108 and Jay Bista making 127. Bista's innings included 21 boundaries. Saurashtra finished their innings with 348 runs, giving Mumbai a lead of 46 runs. Sheldon Jackson and Chirag Jani top scored with 95 and 85 respectively. Mumbai declared their second innings with the score at 238/8, setting Saurashtra a target of 285 in 72 overs. Shreyas Iyer was the top scorer with 83. Chasing a fairly achievable total, Saurashtra received a couple of jolts and were 79/2 but a 113-run third wicket stand between Viswarajsinh Jadeja and Sheldon Jackson brought them closer to the target.

Jadeja was run out by a direct throw from point by Jay Bista that broke the partnership at 192. Soon after, a double strike in one over by medium pacer Minad Manjrekar, courtesy two well-directed short balls, put the brakes on Saurashtra's scoring. Four balls into the final over of the match, with Saurashtra requiring 19 runs for a famous win, the match was called off as a draw.

An update from the exciting Premier Badminton League, now. Hyderabad Hunters defeated the Chennai Smashers 5-0 on Tuesday.

The South Korean pair of Kim Sa Rang and Eom Hye Won beat Chris Adcock and Gabby Adcock 14-15, 15-13, 15-14 to seal a convincing victory for Hyderabad. The only respite for Chennai was in the women's singles match where Ji Hyun Sung defeated Olympic and World Championship silver medalist PV Sindhu 15-13, 14-15, 15-7.

Hyderabad began season four by defeating Pune 7 Aces on the opening day in Mumbai. Yesterday, they were five points away from their first defeat on their own trump. Kim Sa Rang and Bodin Isara had to summon all the guile and experience they could in order to beat Sumeeth Reddy and Chin Chung Or. They prevailed 13-15, 15-12, 15-10 to earn two crucial points for Hyderabad. Then, it was the turn of veteran Lee Hyun Il, the 38-year-old from South Korea, to school Chong Wei Feng, as he won 15-11 15-13. The battle of the left-handers saw many rallies played from the back of the court.

Those two wins meant that Sindhu's win against her former team could seal the tie for Hyderabad. But that was not to be. Sung Ji Hyun never allowed Sindhu to settle into a rhythm and won the first game 15-13. Sindhu found some form in the second to take the game 15-14 but Sung brushed her aside in the third game winning it 15-7.

It then fell to Kim Sa Rang and Eom Hye Won to see Hyderabad through, and they defeated the Adcocks to see Hyderabad through.

The sixth season of the Pro Kabaddi League is in its 12th and final leg, which ends on Thursday. Four days from the two eliminator playoffs in Kochi, the action is heating up. Bengal Warriors continued their unbeaten streak at home as they defeated Telugu Titans 39-34 on Tuesday, while the Tamil Thalaivas and Haryana Steelers played out a thrilling 40-40 tie.

Maninder Singh scored 12 raid points for Bengal Warriors, which made him the fastest man to reach 500 points in the Pro Kabaddi League - he achieved the milestone in just 56 matches. For Telugu Titans, Armaan top scored with 11 points.

Bengal Warriors, who have already qualified for the playoffs, ensured that Telugu Titans ended their campaign with a defeat. They got off to a flying start with Jang Kun Lee getting a super raid two minutes into the match. The Titans fought back to equalize the score to 7-7 after five minutes. However, Maninder continued to pick points for Bengal, and at the end of the first half, the Warriors led 23-15. They then inflicted an all-out in the 26th minute to lead 30-18. For Telugu Titans, Anand was a revelation as he picked up raid points at will. But Bengal were too far ahead, and Telugu Titans struggled to keep up, ending five points short and crashing out of the league.

The other match between Tamil Thalaivas and Haryana Steelers ended in a tie as Haryana scored two crucial points in the last minute. Monu Goyat and Ajay Thakur top-scored for Haryana and Thalaivas respectively, with 17 points each. The 40-40 tie meant that both teams finished bottom of the table in their respective zones.

Written by Dave Philipps

The US Navy has come a long way, from its first wooden frigates to today's nuclear carriers. But in all that time, one thing remained almost as fixed as the North Star: A skipper's power to throw troublesome sailors in the brig with nothing to eat but bread and water.

Though it sounds like something from an old pirate movie, the antique penalty is not only still on the Navy's books, it is still actually imposed, despite a century of abolition efforts.

On New Year's Day, it will finally go by the boards.

Advertising

A sweeping update of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, passed by Congress in 2016, will take effect Jan. 1, bringing dozens of changes that are intended to make the system fairer and more efficient. Most are the kind of procedural tweaks that concern lawyers, not sailors. But the bread-and-water part will be felt on all decks.

Commanders throughout the armed services will still have the authority to punish minor misconduct in various ways without a trial. But the new law deletes the regulation that authorized ship commanders to confine low-ranking sailors on ""diminished rations"" -- bread and water -- for up to three days at a time.

That regulation is no mere neglected relic from a bygone era. As recently as 2017, a destroyer in the Pacific was known as the USS Bread and Water because of the skipper's liberal use of the penalty to punish missteps like missing a curfew or drinking under the legal age.

Many in the Navy will be happy to see it go. But some mourn what they see as an expedient and effective tradition of the seas.

""It sounds medieval, and that is sort of the point,"" said Capt. Kevin Eyer, who regularly sentenced sailors to bread and water for minor misconduct before he retired in 2009. ""Sometimes you just need to scare a kid. We want them to succeed, but you need to give them a kick in the pants.""

Eyer said that when he joined the Navy in 1982, the penalty was common and never frowned upon by the top brass, who traditionally give ship commanders broad authority.

But just as attitudes about spanking children have shifted, the culture in the Navy has drifted away from corporal penalties like bread and water, and officers increasingly view them as counterproductive.

""It just seems anachronistic and stupid,"" said Capt. Scott Tait, who joined the Navy in 1992 and has commanded two destroyers.

""I actually can't believe it's still around,"" Tait said, adding that he had never imposed the punishment himself, nor had he seen it used. ""People used to joke about putting guys on bread and water, but I was well into my career before I realized I was actually allowed to do that.""

When young sailors need a minor course correction, he said, instead of ordering a spell in the brig, he often orders them to write reports on works by authors like Patrick Henry or Ayn Rand.

""Some people need to think about character and the consequences of their actions,"" he said. ""But I don't want it to impact their permanent record, which could hurt their chances of promotion down the line.""

The change was recommended by an independent Defense Department review group. Asked if the Navy supported the move, a spokeswoman said, ""Once drafted, the Navy did not oppose the legislation.""

That bread and water survived so long after the days of tall ships and daily grog rations illustrates the unique requirements of military justice. For major crimes, the military has a justice system somewhat like the civilian courts, with judges and juries, lawyers and formal proceedings. But it also empowers commanders, who may be at sea or in battle, to deal swiftly themselves with minor offenses like disobeying an order or shirking duty. In all military branches, this nonjudicial punishment can include docking pay, reducing rank or restricting troops to quarters.

The Navy is perhaps the most tradition-bound of the services when it comes to discipline. It still refers to the ceremony in which punishment is meted out as ""captain's mast,"" recalling the days when a guilty sailor would be tied to the ship's main mast and flogged with a cat-o'-nine-tails until his back was bloody.

Congress outlawed flogging in 1862, after repeated complaints from sailors that tyrannical captains were wielding the lash unfairly. But ships still had to spend months at sea, far from the police, courts or jails, so commanders insisted on retaining special authority to summarily punish and confine sailors.

In those days, bread and water was seen as a humane, progressive alternative to flogging. Under 19th century naval regulations, commanders could impose it for up to 30 days at a time, and had the option of adding thick iron shackles. Civilian captains used the practice as well.

A New York Times correspondent described the effects of the punishment in 1887 when a sailor in San Francisco was pulled from the dark hold of the US merchant clipper Undaunted: ""Heavy irons encircled both his ankles and wrists. His cheeks were hollow, his eyes sunken, his lips were bloodless, and his entire countenance bore signs of great suffering."" The sailor said his only offense was to have refused a promotion.

Sailors soon complained that commanders could be just as tyrannical with bread and water -- or as crews wryly call it, ""cake and wine"" -- as they had been with flogging, and there were repeated attempts to end the practice. One secretary of the Navy called for abandoning it in 1882, saying it ""meets with the disapprobation of the department""; another tried in 1921 to get Congress to abolish it, saying that using it to try to instill discipline and order ""has the opposite effect, and less and less have wise officers resorted to it.""

The punishment was originally modeled on a British naval practice. But the Royal Navy stopped using it in 1891, a spokesman said, adding, ""In my experience, we have always fed our people.""

Though ship commanders in the United States managed to keep bread and water on the books, criticism steadily whittled away its severity. New regulations in 1909 limited sentences to seven days instead of 30, and sailors could no longer be clapped in irons. In 1951, the limit came down to three days. By the 1980s, a medical examination was required before the sentence was imposed.

Today, the rules say sailors are entitled to three unlimited servings of bread each day. Sailors also can typically have their choice of religious books to read in the brig.

""It's not that bad -- that's why I like it,"" Eyer said. ""It sounds scary, but it's just three days, you get as much bread and water as you want -- a captain can do much worse things.""

Punishments that captains will still be able to impose include extra duty for up to 45 days, restriction to the ship for up to 60 days, loss of rank, and half-pay for two months.

""If you are married, every punishment I give you is also a punishment for your family,"" Eyer said. ""I take your pay, I take away your family's pay. I don't like to do that. With cake and wine, the main impact is to the person causing problems.""

But Tait said that even under modern rules, bread and water can still be needlessly harsh.

""Being at sea, there is a lot of sensory deprivation,"" he said. ""Everything is the same, every day. Meals are one of the few things that actually change. To take that away from someone is more meaningful than people would think.""

In online forums where sailors sound off about Navy life, the views posted on bread and water are mixed. Some said three days in the brig was better than losing pay or being stuck onboard when a ship made a port call. Others saw the punishment as demoralizing and the mark of a poor leader.

Legal experts say bread and water's demise will not free the military justice system of all its troublesome relics. Eugene Fidell, who teaches military law at Yale Law School, pointed to how authority over legal proceedings remains in the hands of commanders, rather than an independent judiciary. And he noted that military cases cannot be appealed to the Supreme Court unless the military agrees to grant review, which he said rarely happens.

Advertising

""That's the real archaic part of this -- our troops have fewer legal rights than detainees at Guantánamo Bay,"" Fidell said. ""We adopted that practice from the British centuries ago. The British gave it up a long time ago, but we never did. We're more British than the British now."""

The application brought by the hospital relied on the parens patriae jurisdiction in case of refusal of consent to a blood transfusion by D1.

Mercy Hospitals Victoria brought an urgent application to seek a declaration to administer blood products to a pregnant 17-year-old young woman of the Jehovah's Witness faith in the event that blood products were needed during the lead up to birth, during labour or after her child was born. The hospital relied on the Supreme Court's parens patriae jurisdiction. The court looked at Dept of Health and Community Services (NT) v JWB and SMB (Marion's case) (Marion's case), in which the High Court described the common law in Australia with respect to the legal capacity of minors to give or refuse consent to medical treatment.[3] In the present case, the court considered the balance between Gillick competence and the parens patriae jurisdiction in the context of the overriding duty to do what is in the best interests of the child.

At the time of the application, the first defendant (D1) was a 17-year-old woman who was 38 weeks pregnant. D1 consented to induction of labour to take place at the hospital operated by the plaintiff. She also consented that, if necessary, a caesarean section be performed to deliver her baby. D1 was of very small stature, it was her first baby and the baby was quite large, so the risk of requiring a caesarean section delivery and of associated post-partum haemorrhage was a significant one.

D1 is an adherent of the Jehovah's Witness faith. The hospital sought her consent to the administration of blood or blood products during or after delivery, if necessary to prevent serious injury or save her life. D1 refused such consent, because such administration is contrary to her faith as a Jehovah's Witness. D1 was a minor under law and so consent was sought from D1's mother, the second defendant (""D2""), who is also an adherent of the Jehovah's Witness faith. D2 informed the hospital that, if asked, she would not provide consent to the administration of blood or blood products to D1.

The hospital brought an urgent application to the court for a declaration:

that the [hospital] is authorised to administer to [D1] blood and/or blood products as considered reasonably necessary by her treating medical practitioners to save her life or to prevent serious injury during the course of induction of labour, labour, caesarean section and related procedures and the postnatal period in regard to her pregnancy.

Five issues required determination by the court:

The court briefly answered the first three of these questions. Firstly, a pseudonym order was made to protect the identities of the defendants together with a suppression order.Secondly, the requirement of a litigation guardian was dispensed with as D1 had representation comprised of counsel and instructing solicitor. And thirdly, the court found that it was not necessary for the unborn baby to be separately represented at the hearing.

Therefore the court focused on the remaining two questions: namely, whether the court's parens patriae jurisdiction is affected by certain statutes that provide for the making of medical treatment decisions and whether the court should make the declaration sought.

The parens patriae jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Victoria is preserved by way of s 85(3) of the Constitution Act 1975 (Vic). The High Court in Marion's case illustrated that the parens patriae jurisdiction is an inherit jurisdiction to do what is for the benefit of the child. The court's care is a direct responsibility for those who cannot look after themselves.

An issue in this case concerned the capacity of D1 to refuse medical treatment, that is, whether she was Gillick competent. The court noted the proposition for Gillick competence, as summarised by the High Court, as follows:

... parental power to consent to medical treatment on behalf of a child diminishes gradually as the child's capacity and maturity grow and that this rate of development depends on the individual child ... A minor is, according to this principle, capable of giving informed consent when he or she ""achieves a sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable him or her to understand fully what is proposed.

Macaulay J considered several Australian cases where, in the exercise of the parens patriae jurisdiction, the courts have been asked to authorise the administration of blood or blood products to a minor, who along with their parent, and for reasons associated with the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses, have refused to give such con- sent.

In Minister for Health v AS it was Pullin J's view that the paramountcy of the welfare of the child meant that protection of the child was to be elevated above all other interests, although those other interests were not to be disregarded and as such, the court ordered the child receive treatment.

In X v Sydney Children's Hospitals Network, Basten JA noted that religious beliefs, particularly minority religious beliefs, are not to be disregarded because they may be deemed irrational by broader community standards; his Honour observed that religious beliefs are internationally accepted as an aspect of an individual's fundamental autonomy which the state cannot interfere with and must not disregard. The Court said that:

To accord a religious belief weight is not to treat it as determinative. There may be cases in which the strength with which a belief is held, and the distress which would be caused by treatment which overrode that belief, might diminish the effectiveness of the treatment[.

Macaulay J then considered a Canadian decision of Malette v Shulman (Ontario Court of Appeal), conceding that the following statement was not made in the context of the exercise of the parens patriae jurisdiction but, in the light of autonomy of choice for the ""mature minor"", Macaulay J deemed it helpful:

The state's interest in preserving the life or health of a competent patient must generally give way to the patient's stronger interest in directing the course of her own life... Recognition of the right to reject medical treatment cannot, in my opinion, be said to depreciate the interest of the state in life or in the sanctity of life. Individual free choice and self-determination are themselves fundamental constituents of life. To deny individuals freedom of choice with respect to their healthcare can only lessen, and not enhance, the value of life.

Ultimately, Basten JA provided helpful guidance when considering a choice made by a child, even a child thought to be Gillick competent:

The interest of the state in preserving life is at its highest with respect to children and young persons who are inherently vulnerable, in varying degrees... Vulnerability lies at the heart of the disability identified by legal incapacity.

The following statutory provisions were considered by the court in their impact on the exercise of the court's parens patriae jurisdiction.

Section 24 of the HTA makes provision for administration of blood transfusions to children without consent. In defined circumstances, it relieves medical practitioners from criminal liability for administering a blood transfusion to a child where the consent of a parent of the child or some other person having authority to consent has been refused or not obtained. It applies where, in the opinion of a registered medical practitioner, the blood transfusion is a reasonable and proper treatment and without it the child is likely to die. A second concurring medical opinion must also be obtained or, in the case of an emergency or the unavailability of a second opinion, specified senior hospital officers may give consent. Section 24(2) provides that a blood transfusion administered to a child in accordance with the section, the transfusion is for all purposes ""deemed to have been administered or taken with the consent of a parent of the child or of a person having authority to consent to the administration of the transfusion.""

The court was informed by the hospital that it considered that it could administer a blood transfusion to D1 in the circumstances contemplated by and in accordance with the procedures outlined in s 24 and rely upon it for its own protection. However, the court was not convinced that it should equate the welfare of the child, as understood in the parens patriae jurisdiction, with the interests of the child as protected by the HTA. The relevant provisions of the HTA are only engaged if and when the child is ""likely to die"", and authorises lifesaving blood transfusions on medical considerations alone.

The parens patriae jurisdiction exists so that, in appropriate circumstances, even the parents' wishes (deemed or otherwise) can be overridden. Despite the existence of s 24 of the HTA, the parens patriae jurisdiction serves a vital purpose beyond the narrower concern of that Act. The scope of the protective jurisdiction is larger, to take into account all of the welfare interests of the child -- medical, spiritual, personal autonomy and identity. The two do not cover identical territory.

The MTPDA came into force on 12 March 2018. Relevantly, one of its main purposes was to provide for a person to execute an advance care directive (ACD) that gives binding instructions or expresses the person's preferences and values in relation to the person's future medical treatment.

Section 17 of the MTPDA requires that any witness to an ACD must certify that the person giving it appeared to have ""decision-making capacity"" in relation to each statement and, in particular, appeared to under- stand the nature and effect of each statement in the directive.

Decision-making capacity is defined in s 4 to require that the person be able to:

However, even if a child gave an instructional ACD to refuse consent for a blood transfusion, s 24 of the HTA would still permit a hospital to administer blood in an emergency in order to save the child's life without rendering the hospital criminally liable. Indeed, providing s 24 was complied with, the procedure would be deemed to have taken place with the parents' consent.

The court noted that, for children to make an ACD to effect or limit the court's parens patriae jurisdiction in relation to children, three things should be noted:

In this case, no ACD was certified for D1, thus none was in force. Therefore, there was no need to consider if and to what extent a binding ACD should affect the court's exercise of its protective jurisdiction.

The hospital filed two affidavits of Simon John Cooke - the affidavits exhibited various passages of D1's medical and social work records and a report prepared by Dr Jacqueline van Dam, the Director of Maternity Services at the hospital. Mr Cooke's affidavit also disclosed that Dr van Dam had arranged for D1 to be examined by Associate Professor Campbell Paul, a consultant infant and child psychiatrist at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, on 28 August 2018 in order to establish his opinion about the capacity of D1 to refuse her consent to the administration of blood or blood products in the course of, or following, the birth of her baby.

Also exhibited to the affidavits were two partially completed ACDs signed by D1, some information pro- vided to D1 about ACDs and the report of Associate Professor Paul. Associate Professor Paul and Dr van Dam were called to give evidence and were both cross-examined. D1 and D2 declined to give any evidence at the application, however D2, through an interpreter during final submissions, made several state- ments to the court that were in the nature of evidence.

D1 was born overseas on 26 August 2001. D1 arrived in Australia in 2009 as an 8-year-old with her family as refugees. Her parents subsequently divorced and D1 lived with her mother and her six siblings. D1 informed the hospital that her pregnancy was planned with her former partner, with whom she had no contact with for 2 months prior to presenting to the hospital.

In early March 2018, D1 was 12 weeks pregnant and she booked the birthing of her baby with the hospital. At this time D1 was 150 cm tall and weighed 44 kg. Dr van Dam reported her to be a ""very small built girl"".

During D1's pregnancy she had been receiving some support from a refugee support agency and from the student wellbeing staff at her school. D1 was continuing with her studies and was focused on her exams until they were completed in mid-June 2018. On 2 July 2018, it was reported that D1 had passed her year 10 exams.

By 9 July 2018, social work records revealed that a person from D1's maternity support group was informed by D1 that she and her family were Jehovah's Witnesses and accordingly, did not believe in blood transfusions. There was no reference to this in the medical records. Social work records dated 31 July 2018 revealed that D1 was advised ""as a priority"" to organise an appointment with either a midwife or an obstetrician to discuss an advance care plan because of the impact her religious beliefs could have on the health of her and her baby. On 1 August 2018, the social work records revealed that the above was reiterated to D1 again.

On 7 August 2018, the social work records confirmed that D1 would not receive blood products and D1 was again advised to organise a obstetric appointment. On 7 August 2018, the medical records for the first time made reference to D1 being a Jehovah's Witness -- by which time D1 was 34.6 weeks pregnant. The medical records stated:

SW notes advise [D1] is Jehovah's Witness. [D1] and mother confirmed this and will decline any blood products. Require OBS appointment to complete advance care directive/ refusal of treatment form and arrange anaesthetic referral.

On 10 August 2018, the medical records noted that D1 attended with D2 to discuss D1's treatment in light of her religious beliefs. The records indicated that D1's brother was included in the conversation by telephone. D1 was asked to have an open discussion with her family and clergy and to put clearly in writing a plan for the blood products she would or would not accept in the event of hypovolemia or volume resuscitation. D1 was asked to return for review on 15 August 2018.

On 15 August 2018, D1 consulted Dr van Dam; D1 was then 36 weeks pregnant. In attendance at this appointment were D1, D2 and a person from D1's Jehovah's Witness community named ""Jill"". According to the medical records, the discussion about blood products was postponed, as D1 was ""not ready to discuss"". Dr van Dam informed D1 that she would need to give specific instructions in relation to what specific products or procedures she would accept. D1 was given written information about ACDs and a form to fill out which outlined her ACD. Dr van Dam noted the need to review the option of having a child psychologist present.

On 22 August 2018, D1 was then 37 weeks pregnant. The medical records were silent as to any further discussion relating to the ACD. The notes stated that the baby was measured as being on the 88th percentile for growth.

In her report, Dr van Dam stated that she had to prompt D1 several times to inform the midwife about her religious beliefs regarding blood or blood product transfusions. Dr van Dam also pointed out to D1 that she had not completed the part on her registration form that required details about her religion.

Dr van Dam's report outlined observations made about D1:

At the consultation on 15 August 2018, Dr van Dam asked D1 why she didn't carry the usual Jehovah's Witness card that states the refusal of blood products. Jill replied on behalf of D1, stating that D1 had not yet been baptised and was not recognised by the church to be able to carry the card. Dr van Dam asked D1 why she had not completed her religious preference on her registration form, and Jill answered for D1 again, stating that D1 had only started her religious studies and was not yet comfortable stating that on the form.

Dr van Dam was concerned that D1 did not have the understanding or conviction to refuse the blood in case of dire emergency. Dr van Dam then arranged for D1 to be assessed by Associate Professor Paul.

Dr van Dam, in her report, identified the risks associated with bleeding during pregnancy; in D1's case being that it is her first baby and a big baby and the labour will possibly be long or obstructed with a retained placenta. Dr van Dam identified that, in the event of a post-partum haemorrhage, the following options were available to a patient:

The court noted evidence from Dr van Dam (whether in a report or as part of oral evidence is unclear) that a 20% loss of total blood volume triggers the need for blood volume resuscitation, as the patient will begin to show signs of hypovolemic shock. Some symptoms, Dr van Dam explained, can be treated by infusion of clear fluids and volume expanders -- but those products do not assist in the transport of oxygen. Transfusion with whole blood and blood products allows replacement not only of the volume but also the oxygen carrying and clotting factors in the blood. Ongoing blood loss without replacement of blood will leave to multi-organ failure and ultimately, death.

Associate Professor Paul is a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Royal Children's Hospital. He saw D1 for 2 hours on 28 August 2018, speaking with her alone extensively.

D1 informed Associate Professor Paul that she had attended the Jehovah's Witness church since she had been in a refugee camp with her family overseas. D1 continued to attend Sunday school at the church whilst living in rural Victoria, but in recent years had attended once or twice a week including taking formal bible studies. D1 informed Associate Professor Paul that she was not yet baptised, but especially liked reading bible stories.

D1 told Associate Professor Paul she had been in a relationship with the father of her child for some months before becoming pregnant; D1 also said she was happy to become pregnant. D1 knew that having sex before marriage was against the values of the Jehovah's Witness community. Although D1 had broken the community rules she said she might be forgiven if she was remorseful. D1 reiterated to Associate Professor Paul a number of times, and in writing, that she did not want to receive any blood or blood products during the course of her pregnancy or delivery, even if there were very serious complications and even if she might die without them.

Associate Professor Paul considered D1 was lucid and fully coherent. He did not believe D1 had any significant ongoing mental health disorder. He examined her attitude towards potential treatment with human blood products. He said D1 willingly completed the ACD in his presence with no pressure from others; D1 was very clear in a statement both written and verbal that should she become acutely ill during pregnancy or delivery and require emergency treatment she would refuse any human blood products.In support of her refusal, D1 went on to quote the part of the bible that refers to the eating or drinking of blood being prohibited, and her desire to make Jehovah happy, stating she would rather die than receive blood products.

Associate Professor Paul asked D1 to consider the potential impact on her baby if there were serious complications during labour. D1 said she had not thought about it; but went on to say that ""if the baby has to die, she has to die"".

Associate Professor Paul believed that D1 had ""a clear and consistent belief that she must not receive human blood products"", although she told him that she held her beliefs freely. He expressed that it could be possible that D1 was to ""some degree"" dependent on her family and community in making decisions about her life so as to accord with the Jehovah's Witness' values and beliefs.[57] This was especially so in the circumstances where D1 had transgressed a major rule not to have a sexual relationship before marriage. Associate Professor Paul thought D1 might have been unduly dependent on her community and feel the need to comply with its strict religious values given her present circumstances.

Associate Professor Paul expressed three important views about D1:

In light of the above factual matrix and aforementioned legislative requirements, Associate Professor Paul was asked to witness D1 completing an ACD made under the MTPDA.[59]Ultimately he felt unable to witness D1's ACD.

Despite not giving oral evidence, through an interpreter in final submissions, D2 made several statements to the court that were in the nature of evidence. D2 was not tested on them.

D2 told the court that she believed:

The evidence relied upon was taken from the affidavits of Mr Cooke, the medical and social work records of the hospital in the report of Dr van Dam and the report of Associate Professor Paul and oral evidence given at the hearing. The court, after considering the evidence, made the following observations about D1:

As a result of these various considerations, the court found it difficult to be confident that D1's expressed choices were the product of an independently formed, carefully considered and long-held adherence to the tenets of the Jehovah's Witness faith.

At the time the judgment was handed down D1 had turned 17 less than a week beforehand. The court noted that evidently, s 24 of the HTA was not at that time engaged and as such the court reminded the parties that, the parens patriae jurisdiction at this time invoked, enjoyed a wider purview regarding the interests of the child beyond mere physical survival. The critical issue for the court to decide was whether it considered that the expressed view of D1 and her mother, D2, should be allowed to direct the hospital in its medical treatment should an emergency arise and D1's life was put at stake without a blood transfusion.

The court considered D1's level of maturity, her understanding of what her best interests are, whether she had sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable her to understand fully what is proposed and the consequences of her decision and what her beliefs are. Ultimately, the court was not satisfied that D1 had a sufficient understanding of the consequences of her choice. The court was further not convinced that D1 had based her choice on a ""maturely formed and entrenched religious conviction.""

The court thought it appropriate that any declaration be made upon the undertakings that the hospital agreed to give; accordingly the court ordered:

For a judgment of only 24 pages, this decision packs a punch in reiterating the far-reaching parens patriae jurisdiction for the ultimate protection of children, and children against their own interests in light of Gillick competence. For those in the medical and legal professions, it serves as a reminder of the important and complex balance between a medical practitioner's duty of care and the observation of religious rights of patients; it also reminds readers that applications of this kind are not taken lightly and there must be a bona fide risk to the patient for an application of this kind to be heard."

From its hillside overlooking the Ethiopian capital, Berhanu Mengistu's century-old, gabled family home has seen emperors and governments rise and fall. (AFP)

From its hillside overlooking the Ethiopian capital, Berhanu Mengistu's century-old, gabled family home has seen emperors and governments rise and fall.

It has withstood economic stagnation and the rapid population growth that replaced its once-patrician neighbours with a rabble of shacks.

But it now stands lonely in a field of weeds, the house's corrugated roof and red plaster walls stark against a fast-changing cityscape of cleared slums, tower cranes and glinting high rises.

Palatial homes like Berhanu's are scattered throughout Addis Ababa, built for imperial-era courtiers and foreign business moguls, but most have slid into dire neglect as the government focuses on an aspirational building boom.

""Nowadays, most of the buildings you see are more of the European architecture,"" said Berhanu, a supply chain manager whose house has been in his family for seven generations.

Across the capital, older, poorer neighbourhoods -- like the one that once surrounded Berhanu's home -- have been levelled to make way for glass-and-concrete towers, lauded by the government as a symbol of the rapid economic expansion transforming one of Africa's poorest countries.

But preservationists worry that the breakneck development comes at the cost of the capital's architectural heritage.

""There are isolated efforts of protecting, saving historic buildings, but it's really very limited,"" said Fasil Giorghis, a well-known architect.

""It is not even a given that you should protect a historic building.""

A young city

Addis Ababa was founded in the late 19th century by Emperor Menelik II as he expanded the Ethiopian empire from the country's northern highlands to its modern boundaries.

The young city soon filled with houses belonging to members of Menelik's government, among them Berhanu's ancestor Yemtu Beznash, the family matriarch and administrator of a powerful law court.

Menelik, who died in 1913, also hired Armenians as city engineers, while merchants came from India and Yemen.

That cosmopolitanism was upended in 1974 with the arrival of the Derg military junta, which dismantled the Ethiopian empire.

Fasil recounted how, as foreign traders fled, the communist-leaning Derg handed their former mansions to poor tenants, who could not afford to maintain the earthen walls and wooden floors.

'Ideological shift'

The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which evicted the Derg in 1991 and continues to rule today, has presided over an economic boom.

This has seen contractors from China and elsewhere set to work on half-built skyscrapers that give the capital's skyline a jagged, unfinished feel.

Maheder Gebremedhin, an architect who hosts a radio show discussing the trade, says the neglect of the old buildings is due to the cost and complexity of renovation, as well as a lingering ambivalence towards the imperial past.

""Because of the ideological shift, there is not a real interest to keep these buildings,"" Maheder said.

Heritage, abandoned

Government and private donors have successfully restored a handful of buildings, including one of Menelik's palaces and the mansion of a former defence minister that's been converted into a museum.

But city authorities acknowledge that most of the 440 buildings that have been designated heritage sites are rundown.

""Because of our capacity as a developing country, they can't be repaired all the time,"" said Worku Mengesha, a spokesman for Addis Ababa's tourism office.

A decade ago, foreign embassies and Ethiopian preservationists tried to restore the Mohammadali house, once the property of a wealthy Indian businessman featuring prominent Indian and Arabian architectural elements in addition to its imperial-era Ethiopian style.

However, bureaucracy and shoddy construction scuppered the effort, Fasil said.

As a result, it is padlocked and abandoned, with parked cars sheltering beneath its Indian-inspired arches and a pair of discarded trousers draped across its faded cream staircase.

Other historic buildings continue in their Derg-era role of housing for the poor, or in their slow decrepitude.

The expansive former palace of Hojele Al-Hassen, a wealthy traditional ruler during the Menelik era, still houses people from his western region, who spend after-work hours socialising on the wraparound veranda.

But it's increasingly dilapidated, with an entire decaying wing that once served as a school classroom sealed off for safety.

Family history, city history

Three years ago, as city authorities levelled the homes that had mushroomed around Berhanu's house, he kept the bulldozers at bay by having his home designated an historic building.

Berhanu now hopes to turn his family history into national history.

Standing near a large portrait of the matriarch Yemtu, he spoke of his dream to make a museum of the house whose rooms are filled with family photographs and heirlooms, including a wall-spanning snake skin.

""This is not only our property. It belongs to all Ethiopians and people of Addis Ababa,"" he said.

He hopes the city will agree.

Across the street in the slum area the government wants cleared, his neighbour Solomon Damana had recently resolved a dispute with city authorities and was following orders to demolish the small family home in which he was born and raised and move to a one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of town.

""I'm happy that one isn't demolished,"" he said, gesturing at Berhanu's place. ""It's an historic house."""

2018 has been a very significant year for privacy and data protection in India, triggered in part by the Aadhaar case and the affirmation of the fundamental right to privacy by the Supreme Court in 2017. A growing privacy consciousness can be seen among the people, with a view to safeguarding their data and their freedom, as can be seen with the outrage that followed the recent MHA notification.

The same consciousness can be seen in the government as well, but from the perspective of recognising the potential of data, and of privacy and data protection laws as a means to enable this, as opposed to protecting the people. The focus of laws and proposed laws thus, by and large, seems to be with the aim of maximising control and utilisation of data, as opposed to safeguarding people's rights. The recently released draft Intermediary Guidelines are reflective of this as well.

Draft Intermediary Guidelines

Meity released a draft of the Intermediary Guidelines for public consultation on 24 December this year. These guidelines, in addition to various proposed provisions in relation to content regulation, propose a 72-hour time limit to respond to government requests for information. Given the broad definition of 'information' under the IT Act, this could include data of any form, even text, images, messages, databases, etc.. This also includes a requirement to trace the originator of such information on its platform. The proposed requirement is reflective of the traceability requirements which were to be imposed on WhatsApp for dealing with the fake news menace.

Such requirements are being proposed without any clarity on corresponding privacy protections for the people. It must be remembered here that while intermediaries like Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, etc. are often at the receiving end for their lack of privacy protections in relation to the use they make of the data, they have often turned out to be the only protection people have against governmental access of data (the FBI-iPhone struggle, for instance). These rules put in question the extent of governmental access to data with such intermediaries, and also with the use of encryption as a means of protection for users.

The MHA Notification

The recently issued MHA notification is another such instance, which appointed 10 governmental bodies such as the Intelligence Bureau as agents for the purpose of interception, monitoring and decryption. While the notification was widely misunderstood to be conferring unbridled surveillance powers on these agents, it did have the effect of bringing state surveillance to the forefront of people's privacy concerns.

For the sake of clarity, the notification did not make any change to the existing situation or confer any new surveillance powers on the agents (Read here for a full explanation on this). These powers are already within the IT Act, and the issue with their constitutionality existed from the moment of their introduction into the IT Act, and not with this notification.

Another reason for the huge outrage that followed this notification was possibly owing to the introduction of the need for judicial oversight as a procedural safeguard for sharing of data under the Aadhaar judgment (the striking down of Section 33(2)). As a result, any step forward in relation to Section 69 was expected to be in relation to testing its constitutionality and those of the procedural safeguards under related rules. What was seen instead was the government taking the next steps for more efficient exercise of the existing surveillance powers.

Section 69 of the IT Act and its procedural safeguards have long since been in question for their constitutionality. This is owing to, firstly, their failure to meet privacy standards for surveillance possibilities today, the lack of judicial oversight as required under the Aadhaar judgment, and failure to meet the proportionality test as required under the Right to Privacy Judgment. The safeguards, moreover, are on the lines of those prescribed under the PUCL judgment, a judgment which was delivered almost 20 years ago (1996) and in relation to telephone tapping only. Review of these for their constitutionality is thus essential.

The Personal Data Protection Bill

The attitude of the state towards data protection is further reflected in the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, released in July 2018. On the one hand, it was a good step forward for India to move from next to no privacy law at all to a comprehensive privacy law. On the other hand, the fiduciary relationship put forth by the Bill leads to a situation where instead of giving the individual the ultimate control and ownership of his data, once he hands his data to a data fiduciary or controller, he can only trust that the data fiduciary will handle his data in compliance with the law. This is reflected primarily in the omission of the right to erasure (the right to have a data fiduciary delete all data that he has on the individual) among the rights granted to the individuals.

The effect is thus that while the law imposes a number of welcome obligations on the data fiduciaries, the people are not sufficiently empowered in relation to their data. The broad scope of exemptions for State related processing and provisions for non-consensual processing only adds to the lack of control that people have been given, particularly vis-à-vis the State.

TRAI Recommendations on Privacy

In particular, the Bill was a disappointment in comparison with TRAI's Recommendations on Privacy released just prior to the Bill. This was not without its own problems, for instance, that the scope of the Recommendations, which were to apply to the entire digital ecosystem, encompassed a range of entities far beyond TRAI's jurisdictional boundaries, such as browsers, handsets, tablets, OTT services, applications and the like. However, the recommendations put the individual squarely as the owner of his data. The recommendations thus placed the individual in a much stronger position in relation to his data than under the Bill.

Data Localisation

Yet another consequence of the Data Protection Bill was the suggestion of data localisation of 'critical personal data', an undefined term, in a move that was criticised far and wide for its detrimental effects on innovation. This implies, for instance, that companies can no longer rely on global cloud storage, and that there will be a significant increase in compliance costs.

This is also supported by the RBI's move to mandate data localisation for the data with payment service providers such as card networks and mobile wallets. While the scope of data localisation requirements under the Bill is still unclear, the impact of the RBI's data localisation requirements is already being felt with the launch of payment services like Apple Pay being put on hold. While the aim of retaining the data within India might serve the aim of retaining governmental control of the data, it is unlikely to actually contribute to better security or privacy of the data itself.

The Aadhaar Judgment and its impact

The most significant development for privacy was, of course, the Aadhaar judgment. In a final hearing that spanned 38 days over almost five months, this was the second longest one in Indian history, and the people's involvement, whether for or against Aadhaar, was just as tremendous.

After major arguments against Aadhaar, such as with the privacy implications of the large-scale collection and storage of biometric data, and its potential as a surveillance tool, among others, the Supreme Court finally gave a judgment which supported Aadhaar but largely reduced the wide-scale impact it was having. The major cause for this was the limitation of the use of Aadhaar to Section 7 benefits, as well to governmental use.

Thus, while the biometric database with all of its privacy and security concerns has been retained, the uses it can be put to has been limited, for the present. The limiting of its sharing with private companies has had wide implications, including with bringing an end to its rampant mandatory use, such as for children's school admissions, the NEET, hospital admissions, etc. This has also brought an end to eKYC, in a move that affected not only several digital payment companies but also drone companies. This was followed with debates on whether voluntary use of eKYC was possible, and with the introduction of new, offline methods of verification such as the use of QR codes.

Mandatory linking to bank accounts and SIM cards, which was coupled with the threat to disable those accounts/numbers that were not so linked, was thankfully also brought to an end. However, since the judgment, rumours have already started to surface, of the possibility of the bringing in a new law which mandates the same.

The linking of Aadhaar with Voter IDs was another cause for strife that arose this year, with allegations that non-consensual Aadhaar-EPIC seeding was the primary cause for thousands of voters being missed from Telangana electoral lists this year. Among others, these allegations raise questions on whether the Aadhaar database and access to it are really as private as is claimed.

Others

In addition to these primary concerns, a number of other concerns have emerged, which include, among others, the proposed Social Media Communications Hub which has been challenged before the Supreme Court at present, introduction of the draft DNA bill in Parliament for the creation of a national DNA databank for certain categories of persons, and the proposal of a national AI marketplace for data aggregation.

2019 for Privacy?

Looking at the year gone by for privacy, one can look ahead at 2019 only with concern, since many of these developments discussed here are currently in draft form. 2019 may well see these laws taking concrete form by being enacted. The involvement of the people has played a crucial role in reducing the rampant use of Aadhaar, if not bringing it to a complete halt. While there is a huge movement in the field of privacy and data protection, the people will have to continue playing this role to ensure that it takes the right direction.

The girl's widowed mother told the court that she treated G Santosh like her brother and asked him to spend time with her daughter as she would be alone at home, but the cabbie betrayed her trust.

Similarly, Basavanagudi police recently arrested an autorickshaw driver for raping the eldest of his five daughters on the pretext of giving her sex education.

These Bengaluru cases registered under the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act are no aberrations, says police. Children in Karnataka are most vulnerable to sexual assaults from people who know them or are their custodians, they say, pointing out the findings from a review of Pocso cases reported from Karnataka.

The review by state police found that 40% of men who sexually assaulted children were known to the survivors. In fact, 30% of the predators attacked children from their own families.

""There is a need to create more awareness among children, schoolgoing kids in particular, about their rights and to report any form of molestation and sexual abuse. The concept of good touch and bad touch should be included in school curriculum at an early stage. Further, sensitising parents, guardians and teachers to keep a watch on abnormal behaviour in children due to bad influences is also important,"" said MA Saleem, additional director general of police (ADGP), crime and technical wing.

Pocso cases, meanwhile, continue unabated in Karnataka. In 2016, 1,614 cases were reported from across the state, while the number climbed to 1,875 in 2017. In the first 11 months of this year, 1,705 cases have been reported.

Police record in pursuing the cases though is a mixed bag. While 60 Pocso case accused were convicted in 2016, the number dipped to 32 the next year. This year, only four accused have been convicted. Police admit collecting evidence and taking statements from eyewitnesses and others are major challenges they face in Pocso probes.

""In many cases, survivors and complainants turn hostile due to many reasons, including fear of getting defamed in society. Neighbours or relatives of survivors hesitate to make statements or appear in court during trial. These are the main reasons for such low rate of convictions. Despite best efforts, over 25% of the cases are dismissed due to lack of cooperation from the survivors and their family members,"" a senior police officer said."

Police used tear gas and fired in the air Tuesday to disperse thousands of protesters attempting to march on the presidential palace to demand that Omar Bashir, Sudan's president of 29 years, step down, according to activists and video clips posted online. Organizers say hundreds were injured and at least eight received gunshot wounds.

The clips purported to show crowds of several hundred each gathering on side roads and headed toward the palace on the bank of the Blue Nile in the heart of Khartoum. They sang patriotic songs and chanted ""freedom,"" ""peaceful, peaceful against the thieves"" and ""The people want to bring down the regime."" The latter was the most popular slogan of the 2010 and 2011 Arab Spring revolts.

One clip showed the seemingly lifeless body of a protester in Khartoum being carried away and placed inside a car that drove away. The protester's head showed a gaping wound and the voice of another protester could be heard saying he was deliberately shot by a sniper. Earlier images circulated by activists showed police snipers on rooftops near the palace ahead of the march.

Another clip purported to show two other protesters suffering gunshot wounds to the head and the legs as they were being attended to in a clinic. There were no reliable casualty figures available.

The march's organizer, an umbrella of independent professional unions, said at least eight protesters received gunshot wounds, three of whom were in serious condition and that hundreds were hurt when police hit them with batons or used tear gas to disperse them.

Large numbers of security forces were deployed across much of Khartoum Tuesday in anticipation of the march, with soldiers riding in all-terrain vehicles. Police fired in the air, used tear gas and hit demonstrators with batons to disperse them, only for the crowds to assemble again and try and continue their march in pitched battles. Activists said the fighting continued after nightfall.

The protest was called by the umbrella of independent professional unions and supported by the country's largest political parties, Umma and Democratic Unionist. The organizers want to submit a petition demanding that Bashir, who has ruled since he seized power in a 1989 military coup, step down.

It said late Tuesday that it would continue to work for the ouster of Bashir, an objective that ""we trust we are more able to collectively realize now than at any time before.""

Tuesday's march follows nearly a week of protests initially sparked by rising prices and shortages of food and fuel, but which later escalated into calls for Bashir to go. The Sudanese leader was in the al-Jazeera region south of Khartoum on a previously scheduled visit Tuesday. Live TV coverage showed him addressing supporters there in a rally and the country's state news agency said he inaugurated a road and a girls' school there.

In an address in which he frequently quoted verses from the Quran, Bashir, who is an Islamist, blamed the country's economic woes on international sanctions and enemies of Sudan who don't want it to progress.

The petition the protesters wanted to submit at the palace demands that the general-turned-president hand over power to a ""transitional government of technocrats with a mandate agreed upon by all segments of Sudanese society.""

""We are asserting that we will continue to exercise all popular and peaceful options, including general strike and civil disobedience, to bring down the regime,"" it warned.

The march followed a joint statement late Monday by the United States, Britain, Norway and Canada, which said they were concerned by ""credible reports"" that Sudan's security forces have used live ammunition against demonstrators. They urged all parties to avoid violence or the destruction of property while affirming the right of the Sudanese people to peacefully protest to express their ""legitimate grievances.""

The London-based rights group Amnesty International meanwhile said it had ""credible reports"" that Sudanese police have killed 37 protesters in clashes during the anti-government demonstrations.

An opposition leader said over the weekend that 22 protesters were killed. The government has acknowledged fatalities without providing any figures.

The military vowed Sunday to rally behind Bashir and emphasized in a statement that it was operating in harmony with the police and Sudan's feared security agencies. Also Monday, Bashir said his government would introduce measures to remedy the economy and ""provide citizens with a dignified life."" He also warned citizens against what he called "" rumour mongers.""

The protests over the past week have been met with a heavy security crackdown, with authorities arresting more than a dozen opposition leaders, suspending school and university classes, and imposing emergency rule or nighttime curfews in several cities. There has also been a near-total news blackout on the protests and tighter than usual censorship of newspapers.

Bashir, in his mid-70s, overthrew an elected but ineffective government when he seized power in 1989 in collaboration with Islamists. He is wanted by the International Criminal Court for committing crimes against humanity and genocide in the western Darfur region, where disgruntled ethnic African tribesmen revolted for a larger share of the nation's resources and an end to discrimination by the Arabized and mostly Muslim north.

Bashir has ordered the use of force against protesters in the past _ including in the last round of unrest in January _ successfully crushing them to remain one of the longest-serving leaders in the region. Although his time in power has seen one crisis after another, he is seeking a new term in office, with loyal lawmakers campaigning for constitutional amendments that would allow him to run in the 2020 election.

Venezuela saw bloody protests in 2018 and January 20 was like no other.

Security forces clashed with mourners for Oscar Perez at the main morgue in the Venuzuelan capital, Caracas.

Oscar Perez had been the leading man in an action film, a pilot who fought crime from parachutes with a dog strapped to his back.

In June, he commandeered a helicopter during protests, fired on the Venezuelan supreme court and unfurled a banner urging Venezuelans to rebel.

Perez was an actor, a detective and an insurgent.

To the government he was a terrorist.

To his followers he was a freedom fighter, a modern folk hero like Che Guevara.

Perez's end came on January 15. His body sat in a freezer at the Caracas morgue, with two bullet wounds and a cracked mandible, under armed guard.

On January 21, the government released the corpse, which was buried naked, except for a white sheet wrapped around it.

UIDAI has asked the school authorities and their managements to ensure that no child is denied admission for lack of Aadhaar.

Aadhaar issuing body UIDAI has asserted that schools cannot make the 12-digit biometric identifier a pre-condition for student admission and warned that doing so will be against the recent order of the Supreme Court. The word of caution from UIDAI comes at a time when admissions to nursery and entry-level classes have just begun in over 1,500 private schools in Delhi.

However, there have been reports of certain schools insisting on Aadhaar as one of the documents required for admission.

The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has said it is aware of the reports that some schools are asking for Aadhaar cards for student admission.

""This is not right. This is not as per the provisions of law...school admission and other facility to children cannot be made conditional to production of Aadhaar,"" UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey told PTI.

""In fact, schools should admit children without Aadhaar and ensure that children are given Aadhaar once they are in schools by arranging special camps for them,"" he said.

Asked what action could schools face if they continued to insist on Aadhaar, Pandey said that it will clearly be seen as contempt of court.

In September this year, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar but clipped the scope of the biometric identity project, ruling it was not mandatory for bank accounts, mobile connections or school admissions.

The apex court held that Aadhaar would remain compulsory for filing of Income Tax (IT) returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN), as well as welfare schemes.

The SC verdict emphasised that it would not be mandatory for school admissions, as also for the examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for medical entrance and the University Grants Commission."

Following a committee meeting of the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) on Monday, 24 December evening, its president actor Vishal said that show-cause notices would be sent to around 25 people who locked up the council offices early this week.

A rival faction of the council had alleged that Vishal was functioning unilaterally and locked up the offices. A day later, Vishal was detained when he attempted to enter the premises.

""There were a few non-members involved in this as well and legal action has been initiated against them. We have reviewed the CCTV footage available as well as and based on the people who were present at the time of the incident, action has been taken,"" he said.

Actor and Producer R Partheipan was appointed as vice president in the council at the meeting.

It has warned that those schools insisting on Aadhaar will be doing so against the recent order of the Supreme Court.

The warning came at a time when admissions to nursery and entry-level classes have just begun. There were reports that certain school in the National capital were insisting that parents produce Aadhaar cards as one of the documents required for admission.

""This is not right. This is not as per the provisions of law...school admission and other facility to children cannot be made conditional to production of Aadhaar,"" said UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey. The authority also asked the school authorities and their managements to ensure that no child is denied admission for lack of Aadhaar. ""In fact, schools should admit children without Aadhaar and ensure that children are given Aadhaar once they are in schools by arranging special camps for them,"" he said.

Asked what action schools might face if they continued to insist on Aadhaar, Pandey said that it will clearly be seen as ""contempt of court"".

In September this year, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar but clipped the scope of the biometric identity project, ruling it was not mandatory for bank accounts, mobile connections or school admissions.

Preparations for the congregation at Mir Alam Idgah in Hyderabad, to start December 29, have been going on at a brisk pace.

Hyderabad ulema and Sufi leaders said on Tuesday they would approach a court if permission for the Sunni Ijtema was not withdrawn. According to them, the Dawat-e-Islami holds views which are against the beliefs of majority Muslims in Hyderabad and India. They said even the Pakistan government had restricted the Dawat-e-Islami from preaching to soldiers in the Pakistan army.

The Sufi leaders feared that the meeting would disturb peace in Hyderabad and create a wedge between Sunnis and Shias. Posters of Dawat-e-Islami founder Maulana Mohammad Ilyas Attar Qadri against the backdrop of the historic Charminar have been pasted at different places in the old city.

Maulana Syed Auliya Hussaini Murtaza Pasha, founder-president of the Sunni United Forum of India, told TOI that though Dawat-e-Islami of Pakistan follows the Barelvi school of thought, the religious views its followers hold are different from those of the mainstream Barelvi sect of Sunni Islam. ""Hyderabad has been a shining example of inter-faith harmony and permission to organisations like Dawat-e-Islami, which are linked to terror activities, will vitiate the peaceful atmosphere,"" he said, demanding that the police stop the organisers from holding the Sunni Ijtema.

Stating that the views of Dawat-e-Islami on the Caliphate and the succession of the Caliphate are contrary to majority Sunni belief, Maulana Syed Aale Mustafa Quadri, president of the All-India Ulema and Mashaik Board, Telangana and AP, said the proposed meeting would create differences among Sunnis and Shias. ""People influenced by Dawat-e-Islami teachings have been linked to terror activities, including murderous assaults in Pakistan,"" he said.

Maulana Mustafa Quadri, also an executive member of the World Sufi Forum, said India has the world's largest number of Islamic scholars. ""Indian Muslims do not need Pakistani religious scholars to preach to them,"" he said.

However, Abdul Khayyum Attari, one of the organisers of the Sunni Ijtema, told TOI that only Indian religious scholars would address the congregation. ""We are a peace-loving organisation. No Pakistani scholar has been invited,"" he said.

Maulana Syed Ghulam Samdani Ali Quadri, president of the Serat'un Nabi Academy, said the antecedents of the organisers should be checked thoroughly."

At the Aspinwall House grounds is an encircled glass structure where the patterns change every few minutes -- with their brush, people are free to paint with water on the translucent surface. It vanishes in minutes, like much else that is impermanent, notes Beijing-based Song Dong. His installation, Writing Diary with Water is an older work that acquires new meaning in the context of the floods, where people participate in a shared act and play with water.

Temsuyanger Longkumer

As Kerala slowly picks up pieces after the recent floods, the London-based artist is

attempting to give people in the state hope through a rainbow at Pepperhouse. In the lawns of the sea-facing heritage property is a metal frame that sprinkles water every few minutes and those who stand underneath can see the drizzle produce a temporary rainbow. ""It is often considered a symbol of hope, and promise of better things to come,"" says Longkumer, adding that we need to see beauty in the things around. He also projects it as a celebration of the recent striking down of Section 377 by the Supreme Court of India.

Monica Mayer

Known for her participatory projects, where Monica Mayer often interacts with the viewers and seeks their opinion, in Kochi, the Mexican artist has brought her celebrated installation titled The Clothesline. She invites people to share their experiences of sexual assault, and also of trauma from the recent floods in Kerala. Hundreds have already responded to her question on an empty postcard: ""What did the flood give you"". Some respondents share their grief -- ""I lost almost everything I had in my house"", ""My wedding got cancelled by the floods and all my savings were in it"" and ""The burden of debt"" . Others share hope for a better future and recall the good that people did -- ""Happiness in watching the youngsters in my locality working together and helping in putting things back together"", ""Love and Compassion for others"".

Marzia Farhana

Dhaka-based Marzia Farhana spent weeks collecting discarded material and household commodities that were washed away during the recent floods. In her exhibition space in Aspinwall House, everything is suspended upside down -- from a blue refrigerator to a washing machine, typewriter and chair. Her hanging showcase represents we are ""trapped within an irresistible fall.""

The video installation that comments on the perils of rapid modernisation, acquires new meaning in the aftermath of the floods in Kochi, where the artist photographs fishermen pushing rickshaws underwater, coming to the surface intermittently to breathe. When the task begins to seem impossible, they swim to an underwater city with numerous mosquito nets -- a tribute to the numerous boat people who drowned.

Julie Gough

The Australian aboriginal artist often critiques history through her work comprising found material. In her installation Distance is a Stage of Mind, she brings together the remains of the dreadful floods, from furniture to rocks and shells washed away by the waters. Inspired by the natural environment in Kerala, the work comments on ""loss and renewal"".

Barthelemy Toguo

In in his woodcut prints titled Urban Requiem: New World Climax, the Cameroon-born artist documents popular protests -- including #MeToo and the Chengara Land Struggle. Another set of work titled Head Above Water emerged from his interaction with the people in the state. He asks school children to write about their memories of the recent floods in Kerala on postcards.

The announcement from the Aadhaar issuing body came in the backdrop of the start of admission process in Nursery and entry-level classes in over 1,500 private schools in the national capital. As per media reports, several schools are insisting parents to submit their Aadhaar as one of the documents required for admissions.

Speaking about the same with news agency PTI, UIDAI chief Ajay Bhushan Pandey has said that the department is aware about the fact that some private schools are demanding Aadhaar cards for admission of students. ""This is not right. This is not as per the provisions of law...school admission and other facility to children cannot be made conditional to production of Aadhaar,"" Pandey told the news agency.

The Supreme Court, in September this year, upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar and stated that it would remain mandatory for filing income tax returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN). However, the top court also mentioned that the 12-digital unique identification number will not be mandatory for opening bank accounts, mobile connections and school admissions.

The apex court's directive also stated that Aadhaar would not be mandatory for school admissions, as also for the examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE), National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical entrance and the University Grants Commission (UGC).

At a distance, lights of residential blocks and street lights on the main road glimmer like the stars. However, for nearly 3,000 people who call a series of slums at Thubarahalli their home, sunset would shroud their homes in darkness.

Nearly three weeks ago, the High Court came to their rescue and stayed the civic body's plan to demolish their tin-shed houses. The relief, however, was short-lived, as the electricity supply is yet to be restored.

The enforced blackout has led to another concern. Borewells, which are a critical source of water for the slum-dwellers, are not operational.

""Only if we have electricity can we access to water through borewells. We have to instead pay a lot of money for tanker water,"" says Laltu S.K., 35, who has been working as a school bus driver for over two years. With no water in the community toilets, most have had to resort to open defecation, he said.

In the darkness, the buzz of mosquitoes and the nibbling of rats running amok in their house keep Narijeen Bibi, 36,, a homemaker, and her 11-year-old daughter Kulchand awake through the night. ""I couldn't even study for my mid-term exams, as there was no light,"" says Kulchand who studies in Standard IV in a nearby school.

Electricity supply was cut to the area on December 3 as a 'precaution' before Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials commenced their exercise to demolishing the ramshackle houses built on private land. Officials said they were acting on complaints of garbage burning in the slums by neighbouring residents as well as pressure from the local MLA who claimed the slum-dwellers were 'illegal immigrants' though the police have not found any evidence to this effect. A couple of days later, the court issued a stay order.

""Without electricity, even small things like cooking food or bathing our children are arduous tasks. We have met multiple officials, but nothing has changed. How long must we wait in the dark?"" said Dafadar Sherful, 50, a barber.

'Status quo'

A senior official with BBMP said they are 'only following' the court order. ""We have not received a formal court order. But, from what we've been told, the court order has ordered status quo. On the day of the order, the electricity supply had been cut. We have maintained status quo,"" said the official.

However, with protests mounting near the zonal office, BBMP officials were forced to 'relent' and agree to allow authorised connections to be restored. However, this is hardly a relief, admit officials, as an overwhelming majority of the slums have not taken legal power connections."

A World Cup soccer match was playing on the shelter's TV when the two older teenagers tackled Alex on July 1 and dragged him into the empty bedroom. Wrestling him onto his stomach, one of them, a tattoo on his forearm, got on top. As Alex struggled to move, he said he could feel the teen's penis grinding against his butt.

""Take off his shorts!"" he heard the other teen, who'd bragged he'd been a gang member in Honduras, shout. ""Let's get him naked!""

Just 10 days earlier, Alex, 13, had been caught by the Border Patrol after travelling from Honduras with his 17-year-old sister and 5-year-old stepbrother, to flee the country's gang violence. Now, they were being held at Boystown outside Miami, one of more than 100 youth shelters in the government's sprawling system meant to provide a temporary haven for migrant children caught crossing the border.

The two teens had been taunting Alex since he'd arrived at the shelter, making crude sexual jokes about his pregnant sister. Now, in the bedroom, Alex said, they yanked down the front of his shorts.

""At least your sister has already tasted a man,"" he heard one of them sneer. ""But you haven't even tried a woman.""

Alex said he fought as hard as he could, somehow managing to pull up his shorts and kick until he broke free. As he lay on the floor catching his breath, he said, the boys fled, warning him to keep his mouth shut.

Over the past six months, ProPublica has gathered hundreds of police reports detailing allegations of sexual assaults in immigrant children's shelters, which have received $4.5 billion for housing and other services since the surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America in 2014. The reports, obtained through public records requests, revealed a largely hidden side of the shelters -- one in which both staff and other residents sometimes acted as predators.

Several of the incidents have led to arrests of shelter employees or teenage residents. And in one particularly heinous case, a youth care worker was convicted in September of molesting seven boys over nearly a year at an Arizona shelter. The employee had worked for months without a full background check.

Coverage of such incidents by ProPublica and other media triggered demands for investigations.

Arizona's governor ordered a statewide inspection of the shelters, leading to the shutdown of two centres run by Southwest Key after the nonprofit failed to provide proof that its employees had completed background checks.

And late last month, federal investigators warned that the Trump administration had waived FBI fingerprint background checks of staffers and had allowed ""dangerously"" few mental health counsellors at a tent camp housing 2,800 migrant children in Tornillo, Texas.

But ProPublica's review of the hundreds of police reports showed something else about the assaults. Something that went beyond background checks. Kids at shelters across the country were, indeed, reporting sexual attacks in the shelters, often by other kids. But again and again, the reports show, the police were quickly -- and with little investigation -- closing the cases, often within days, or even hours.

And there are likely even more such cases. ProPublica's cache of records is missing many police reports from shelters in Texas, where the largest number of immigrant children are held, because state laws there ban child abuse reports from being made public, particularly when the assaults are committed by other minors.

Now, as the immigration system struggles to house and care for 14,600 children -- more than ever before -- an examination of how federal and state authorities investigated the assault against Alex, one of those children, reveals startling lapses.

For a few days, Alex said, he didn't report his assault, heeding his attackers' warning, worried that speaking up would delay his release from Boystown. But as they continued to harass him, he decided to tell his counselor.

The counsellor told him that a surveillance tape had captured the teenagers dragging him by his hands and feet into a room, and that there might have been a witness.

But Alex's report did not trigger a child sexual assault investigation, including a specialized interview designed to help children talk about what happened, as child abuse experts recommend.

Instead, the shelter waited nearly a month to call the police. When it finally did, a police report shows, the shelter's lead mental health counselor told the officers ""the incident was settled, and no sexual crime occurred between the boys like first was thought among the staff.""

And instead of investigating the incident themselves, officers with the Miami-Dade Police Department took the counselor's word for it and quickly closed the case, never interviewing Alex.

A spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Miami, which received $6 million last year to care for about 80 children at Boystown, said it handled Alex's case correctly, blaming him for any delays. In response to questions, a Miami-Dade police spokesman said the department was reopening the case.

An examination of Alex's case shows that almost every agency charged with helping Alex -- with finding out the full extent of what happened in that room -- had instead failed him.

The police closed Alex's case 72 minutes after responding to the call.

Alex's mother, Yojana, had just gotten off work on July 27, bone-tired after another hot day installing swimming pools in southwest Missouri, when the call came from Boystown. She'd been expecting her regular chat with her children, so when her cellphone showed a Florida number, she answered excitedly.

Yojana had left them behind in Honduras four years earlier to seek a better life in the United States. Now after a month in the shelter, they'd soon be reunited.

But instead of her children, she heard the unfamiliar voice of a shelter staff member. Something had happened to Alex.

There was surveillance video, the woman said, showing two older teenagers grabbing Alex, throwing him to the floor and dragging him into a bedroom.

""But there are no cameras in the room,"" she said, ""so we couldn't see the rest.""

The woman passed the phone to Alex, who sobbed as he told his mother what happened in the bedroom.

When she hung up, Yojana was furious. The attack had happened more than three weeks ago. Why was she only finding out about it now? Where was the staff? Why wasn't anyone watching them? And what if the attack had been worse than Alex said?

As a mother, Yojana said her instincts were to go to the police -- to break down any door she had to -- to make sure the shelter and the teens were held accountable. But she knew that in the US, she wasn't just any mother. She and her husband, Jairo, had separately crossed the border illegally several years earlier and had been living in the country without permission ever since. The family agreed to let us tell their story as long as we didn't use their last names.

Yojana had reason to worry. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been arresting parents and family members, or members of their households, who are in the country illegally when they come forward to claim their children. This month, ICE said it had arrested 170 such sponsors, or people connected to them, between July and November; 109 of those people had no criminal record.

If Yojana and Jairo went to the authorities, or pressed too hard, they could risk everything they'd worked for.

Weeks earlier, Alex had started on a path he thought would lead to help. Four days after the attack, he finally got up the courage to report it to his counsellor. ""She told me it was very sad what happened to me and that she was very sorry,"" Alex recalled. His counselor took him to the office of her supervisor, Marianne Cortes, where he repeated his story.

Then, he said, Cortes told him that she and his counsellor would watch the surveillance video and ""if it's like you told me, we'll put in a report."" After they watched the video, Alex said, his counselor told him that there was something else on the tape, something he hadn't realized during the attack. There'd been a witness.

""In the video, my counselor told me there was another boy in a window,"" he said.

But then, after those revelations, nothing happened. There was no further investigation.

In an interview, archdiocese spokeswoman Mary Ross Agosta said at that time there was no reason for one. Alex ""was interviewed by staff, and he claimed it was verbal harassment, sexual gestures and teasing about his sister, but no nudity,"" she said.

The staff had reviewed the surveillance footage, she said: ""They did grab him by his hands and feet and take him in the room."" But, she said, it was ""humiliating,"" not criminal.

The shelter reported the incident to federal regulators as sexual harassment. Staff didn't call the police, she said, ""because there was no sexual contact or inappropriate behaviour -- other than making fun of him.""

Waiting three weeks to call Yojana was ""an oversight,"" Ross Agosta said, which Cortes noticed when she prepared to call Yojana to begin the reunification process.

It wasn't until July 30, she said, that Alex told staff that something sexual had happened. But Alex said by that time, Cortes knew the full story. He'd told her when he first reported it in early July and she heard it again as she stood by while he told his mom on July 27.

On July 30, Ross Agosta said, the shelter called the Miami-Dade police and the Florida Department of Children and Families.

Child abuse experts say waiting in such a situation goes against best practices. Regardless of what Alex revealed the first time, they said, counsellors who work with children should know that it's common for assault victims to withhold details initially.

""Sometimes it can be overwhelming,"" said Chris Newlin, the lead author of a US Justice Department report on best practices for interviewing children in abuse cases. Young victims may be unsure of what to do, what will happen if they tell or how the system works, he said. They may have been threatened or they may be traumatized.

Newlin said a child in Alex's situation would be even less likely to report because of his immigration status. That's why it's critical, he said, for staff members to take every case seriously and look for signs of trauma.

Ross Agosta said the police came to the shelter on July 30 followed the next day by DCF investigators. And both agencies, she said, determined there ""was no sexual assault.""

After the call from Alex, Yojana and Jairo dropped everything and started driving across the country to Boystown. It was supposed to be a happy time, but now they were filled with worry.

Yojana, 33, had come to the US from Honduras in 2014, leaving behind Alex, then 9, and his sister, Yemerly, 13. She joined a sister in southwest Missouri and found work at a chicken plant, packing frozen pieces on the graveyard shift.

She kept up with her kids through video chats and posted pictures on Facebook of Alex's face painted like a clown at a birthday party she missed.

The money she sent to Honduras allowed Alex and Yemerly to attend private school, a rare privilege she hoped would insulate them from the country's gang violence. Yojana hadn't made it past the sixth grade, but Yemerly was studying to be a civil engineer.

But that display of economic success made them vulnerable to kidnappers, she and Jairo said. One night, after not hearing from Yemerly for several days, Yojana saw a TV news report about five young girls being kidnapped and decided it was time.

""If we didn't send for them to come, we might regret it for life,"" Jairo said.

Alex, Yemerly and their stepbrother Amahury set off from Honduras in June with their 8-year-old cousin. They travelled in a packed refrigerated trailer through Mexico and, 11 days later, crossed the Rio Grande in a green inflatable raft. They were quickly caught by the Border Patrol and taken to Catholic Charities' Msgr. Bryan Walsh Children's Village -- a facility most people call Boystown.

Five weeks later, on the day they were finally reunited in the Boystown cafeteria, photos show Yojana didn't even stop to put her handbag down before hugging her children tightly to her. Alex was now taller than her with a new haircut, a thick wave of black hair on top with the sides shaved to a point in the back like the soccer stars he worshipped. Yemerly cried in her mother's arms.

""Right there, in that moment,"" Yojana said later, ""it felt like the children that I left in Honduras had come back to life.""

But, she said, she could feel a part of Alex was closed off. The kids wouldn't be released for two days, so when Alex called her at the hotel, Yojana decided to press for more details about the attack and record it on her phone.

During the call, Alex told her the police were coming and he'd been told they ""are going to interview me."" But he was scared that anything he said could interfere with his getting out. ""I just don't want to be here anymore.""

Yojana urged him to tell the truth. ""When the police arrive, you tell them the exact same thing you told me,"" Yojana said. ""Don't be afraid of what those kids did. You must tell them what happened.""

Yojana could hear the staticky sound of a walkie-talkie in the background.

""Hold on,"" Alex said, ""the counsellor is coming for me.""

What happened next is disputed. Alex said after he hung up he was never interviewed by police or anyone else.

The Miami-Dade police initially told ProPublica it couldn't find any reports about an alleged sexual assault at Boystown despite being provided with Alex's full name, the shelter's address, the date and a description of the incident.

After culling through a log of 145 calls the police had received from the shelter since 2013, we found it under the vague label ""Conduct Investigation.""

According to the report, Miami-Dade police officers arrived at Boystown at 4:42 p.m. on July 30 and completed their investigation at 5:54 p.m. The report doesn't describe what they did for that 72 minutes. The narrative is three sentences long.

Cortes, it said, had called the police ""to advise that on the listed date and approximate time"" Alex had ""an incident"" with two other boys. But she ""advised the incident was settled and no sexual crime occurred between the boys like first was thought among the staff.""

That was essentially it. The police left. There was nothing about a surveillance video. They didn't interview the teenagers or the potential witness. They didn't talk to Alex. There was no mention of how Boystown had come to its conclusion -- or why the police believed it.

Under ""Case Status,"" an officer had typed ""CLOSED.""

In a brief phone call, Cortes said she couldn't discuss how she and others in the shelter responded because of privacy rules and referred questions to the archdiocese.

""The only thing I could tell you is that we advocated the most for him and his care,"" Cortes said. ""Anything that happens with any child there that might be a trauma, we take it for face value. We don't minimize it. We take everything very serious.""

Detective Alvaro Zabaleta, a Miami-Dade police spokesman, said he didn't know if the officer who responded had been told there was video. But he didn't want to second-guess his judgment in not interviewing Alex.

Shelter staff members, Zabaleta said, are trained to work with immigrant children and the issues they face. So when ""you're dealing with kids and you have their counsellor,"" he said, ""they become their voice, and they're there to look out for the best interest of the child.""

But the officer's decision not to interview Alex struck child abuse experts we spoke with as unusual.

""How can you possibly conduct an investigation without getting input from the one person who you think can be your most credible witness about what may or may not have happened?"" Newlin said. ""How do you know who to talk to? How do you know what evidence to possibly look for if you don't obtain a statement from that individual?""

Mike Haney, who formerly oversaw abuse prevention and intervention at DCF and the Florida Department of Health, said the state developed its model for abuse investigations in 1978 when it created ""child protection teams"" made up of pediatricians, social workers and child psychologists. The teams work with local law enforcement agencies and DCF to assess child abuse reports, provide services and conduct what are known as ""forensic interviews.""

Haney said such interviews should occur ""as soon as it's reasonably appropriate for the child,"" but generally within 24 to 48 hours. That's because children come under a lot of pressure when a report is made to law enforcement and DCF, he said.

""For an officer to respond to that type of allegation and not interview the kid, I'm not sure what the officer was thinking,"" Haney said. ""And if the clinician said, 'I talked with the kids, they said this,' I'd want to know that the child gave me the same story.""

Still, under Florida law, Haney said, the officer was under no obligation to call in a child protection team to conduct a forensic interview. That's because the law only requires such interviews when the child alleges abuse by a parent or caregiver. And what Alex says happened to him is what's known in Florida as a ""child on child.""

""In my opinion, we should be referring any child if there's an allegation of sexual abuse for a professional assessment,"" Haney said. ""But that becomes a resource issue, a funding issue, a staff issue. That's the biggest reason. There would be a significant cost increase if we make it available to any child.""

The hundreds of police reports reviewed by ProPublica revealed many hastily dismissed incidents like Alex's in immigrant youth shelters.

In 2016, a staff member at a shelter outside Phoenix observed one boy making hip-thrusting movements on top of another boy with a blanket in between them. The victim couldn't stop crying and wouldn't speak to the staff member. A police officer took a report and the case was closed.

A year earlier at the same facility, a youth care worker walked in on a boy who had his shorts partially down and was standing behind another boy who also had his pants down and was bending over a bed. The next day, during a medical exam, the boy told a nurse that one of his roommates had held him down while the other raped him. Five days later, however, when he was finally brought in for an official interview, the boy denied that anything had happened. That case, too, was closed.

In March 2017, a 16-year-old Honduran boy told a shelter employee in New York that his roommate had raped him while he'd been at a shelter in Renton, Washington. After nearly two months of back-and-forth, a detective finally interviewed the teen. But by that time, the boy no longer wanted ""to do anything about it."" Like the others, the case was closed.

In many cases, the responding officers simply filed brief information reports about the incidents, without investigating them as potential crimes.

Critics say this highlights a flaw of the system. Because immigrant kids are typically only in the investigating agencies' jurisdictions for a few weeks, even if a detective wanted to pursue a case, it wouldn't necessarily be easy. Kids get moved around a lot in the shelter system, sometimes without warning or in the middle of the night. When they're released, they're often sent out of state to live with parents or relatives who might want to avoid interactions with police because they're undocumented themselves or living with someone who is.

When Boystown finally released Alex and his siblings on Aug. 1, they handed Yojana a folder. It contained Alex's intake papers, vaccination records and blood tests. There was information for Yojana about how to be a good sponsor and how to follow up with immigration court. But there wasn't anything, not even an incident report, about what happened to Alex.

When Jairo asked to see the surveillance video, a staff member informed him that the security cameras were on a loop.

""They said that after 30 days, the video is erased, and much to our regret, today is the 31st day,"" Jairo said. ""How convenient.""

But in that moment, he and Yojana didn't want to press. They had their children again. And for the first time in their lives, they could step outside and into America together.

After leaving Boystown, the family huddled at a nearby Honduran restaurant to decide if they should go to the police or if they should just get home.

They'd only been given a few days off work, and Jairo felt pressure to get back. On the other hand, somebody should pay for what happened to Alex, if not for his sake, to prevent other children from being harmed in the shelter.

Then again, the shelter said it filed a police report. Even if Alex hadn't been interviewed yet, surely an officer would follow up.

""I wanted to grab my phone and break it because I couldn't stand it anymore -- the pressure,"" Jairo said. ""I have so many responsibilities on my shoulders and this was another on top of that. Plus, we already had our children, and that was good.""

They decided to leave.

Back in Missouri a few days later, Alex squeezed into the backseat of Jairo's pickup, tagging along on a swimming pool job.

As they drove east on Interstate 44, passing the exit-ramp oases of Waffle Houses, Best Westerns and Flying J truck stops, Alex stared out the window silently, occasionally resting his head on the window or running his fingers nervously along the seams of his jeans.

For days, Yojana and Jairo had been wavering between wanting to seek justice but feeling powerless over how to go about it. Jairo said he had a business card for a lawyer in Kansas City who could take Alex's case and maybe get to the bottom of what happened. But Jairo and Yojana hadn't called for an appointment.

There was a lot they were trying to sort out. They weren't sure if Alex was telling the whole story of what happened at Boystown or keeping something even worse from them. Yojana said she'd tried to broach the subject, but Alex told her not to ask him about it anymore.

Alex said that on the day the police came, he and his counsellor ""were waiting for the police to talk to me, but Marianne Cortes spoke with them, and then my counsellor told me they didn't need to interview me anymore.""

Alex said he was left confused. He'd wanted to tell the police what the two boys did to him and didn't understand why the shelter had talked to the police on his behalf.

When asked what he wanted to happen, Alex was unequivocal. ""I want to report them,"" he said. ""To go to the police.""

In mid-August, DCF released a report citing Boystown for three violations of the state's rules regarding residential child care facilities.

The report said the shelter had been understaffed. It had failed to report suspected child abuse in a timely fashion. And it had failed to notify a child's parents or legal guardian after a critical incident.

The records didn't mention Alex or describe what prompted the investigation. But they show that on Aug. 16 -- a little over two weeks after Alex was released -- Boystown agreed to a ""corrective action plan."" It promised to retrain employees and file biweekly reports that would allow the state to check that Boystown had enough staff to supervise the kids.

DCF spokesman David Frady said he couldn't speak about Alex's case or even confirm that there'd been an incident at Boystown because of privacy concerns.

""I'm not able to confirm or deny whether or not we've spoken to an alleged victim,"" he said.

Miami-Dade police denied a request to interview the responding officers and refused to release body-camera footage of their visit to Boystown. Of the 17 minutes of video and audio that exists, the department said only 12 seconds was public because Florida law prohibits release of any body-cam recording taken within a ""private residence.""

ProPublica challenged the decision, but the department said the conversation occurred in an office, a place where the social worker could expect privacy.

However, after receiving our questions about the handling of the case and reviewing the incident, Zabaleta said, the department had assigned an investigator to take a second look -- effectively reopening the case.

The department then said it wouldn't even release the 12 seconds of footage because the case was still under investigation.

The federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, which funds and regulates the shelters, said that after the incident, Boystown transferred the ""perpetrators"" to a different dorm. But the agency declined to answer questions about whether Boystown had handled the incident properly or what, if anything, ORR had done in response.

""Our focus is always on the safety and best interest of each child,"" spokeswoman Lydia Holt said in an email. ""We have no additional information to share regarding this case.""

Today, Alex's case remains in the hands of the state attorney's office. But child abuse experts say the likelihood of learning the truth of what happened to him in the bedroom at Boystown grows dimmer every day.

This much is clear: If Alex's case is any guide, the thousands of children passing through the nation's overburdened shelter system -- understaffed and increasingly akin to long-term orphanages -- should not expect a rigorous investigation if they suffer abuses in the shelters.

""Somebody has to pay for these mistakes because these are monstrous things,"" Jairo said. ""It can't go unpunished. If it stays that way, in many centers, this is going to continue to happen."""

Korea To Pay $501m In Student's Death  ","Sakshipost",FALSE,"Washington:A federal judge in Washington ordered North Korea to pay $501 million to the parents of Otto Warmbier, holding the country accountable for the ""barbaric mistreatment"" and death of the University of Virginia student in 2017.

Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell of the US District Court for the District of Columbia ruled on Monday that North Korea should pay damages to Fred and Cindy Warmbier, the parents of the student who died shortly after being released from a North Korean prison.

Warmbier was visiting North Korea with a tour group when he was arrested and sentenced to 15 years of hard labour in March 2016 on suspicion of stealing a propaganda poster. He died in June 2017, shortly after he returned to the US in a coma and showing apparent signs of torture while in custody.

Warmbier's parents had filed a wrongful death suit against North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in April and appeared in court last week for the first hearing.

They sued the North Korean government for more than $1 billion, saying they were seeking ""closure"" and wanted to ""obtain justice for the severe injuries"" they say their son and family suffered.

Howell found North Korea liable for ""the torture, hostage taking and extrajudicial killing of Otto Warmbier"" as well as the injuries to his parents.

""An American family, the Warmbiers, experienced North Korea's brutality first-hand when North Korea seized their son to use as a pawn in that totalitarian state's global shenanigans and face-off with the US,"" the judge said.

Howell demanded from North Korea $450 million in punitive damages as well as $51 million for the personal anguish and economic loss both Warmbier and his parents experienced, the Washington Post reported.

The ruling, however, was mainly symbolic as North Korea was unlikely to pay the damages.

Before Warmbier went on what was intended to be a short visit to North Korea with a tour group, Howell said: ""he was a healthy, athletic student of economics and business in his junior year at the University of Virginia, with 'big dreams' and both the smarts and people skills to make him his high school class salutatorian, homecoming king and prom king.

""... He was blind, deaf, and brain dead when North Korea turned him over to US government officials for his final trip home.""

In a statement, Warmbier's parents thanked Howell and called the decision a ""significant step on our journey"".

""We are thankful that the US has a fair and open judicial system so that the world can see that the Kim regime is legally and morally responsible for Otto's death. We put ourselves and our family through the ordeal of a lawsuit and public trial because we promised Otto that we will never rest until we have justice for him,"" the couple said.(IANS)"

Amendments to the Information Technology (IT) Act

Context: In its bid to crack down on spread of fake news and rumours circulated on online platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook and other online platforms, the central government has proposed stringent changes under the draft of Section 79 of the Information Technology (IT) that govern online content.

The proposed amendments in the draft of the Information Technology [Intermediaries Guidelines (Amendment) Rules] 2018, Rule 3(9) is bound to force social media platforms like Whatsapp, Facebook and Twitter to remain vigil and keep users on their toes before posting or sharing anything that is deemed as ""unlawful information or content"".

The changes proposed by the central government is aimed at curbing fake news or rumours being spread on social media and check mob violence ahead.

The changes will require online platforms to break end-to-end encryption in order to ascertain the origin of messages. The social media platforms to ""deploy technology based automated tools or appropriate mechanisms, with appropriate controls, for proactively identifying or removing or disabling access to unlawful information or content"".

As per the amendment, the social media platforms will need to comply with the central government ""within 72 hours"" of a query.

There should be a 'Nodal person of Contact for 24X7 coordination with law enforcement agencies and officers to ensure compliance. The social media platforms will be keeping a vigil on ""unlawful activity"" for a period of ""180 days"".

With concerns over ""rising incidents of violence and lynching in the country due to misuse of social media platforms"", there is now need for online platforms to shoulder the ""responsibility, accountability and larger commitment to ensure that its platform is not misused on a large scale to spread incorrect facts projected as news and designed to instigate people to commit crime"".

The proposed changes have once again given rise to a debate on whether the government is intruding into the privacy of individuals, evoking sharp response from opposition parties. Similar apprehensions were raised with the Section 66A of the IT Act that enabled authorities to arrest users for posting content which was termed as offensive. However, the Supreme Court on March 24, 2015, struck down the law.

India has the second highest number of internet users in the world after China, an estimated 462.12 million. Among them, 258.27 million were likely to be social network users in the country in 2019.

Mains Question: Mandating messaging apps to screen messages to curb the problem of fake news is wrong at multiple levels. Discuss

Context: A review petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking re-examination of its verdict by which the centre's flagship Aadhaar scheme was held as constitutionally valid.

While declaring the scheme as constitutionally valid, the top court had struck down some of its provisions including its linking with bank accounts, mobile phones and school admissions. The constitution bench had held that Aadhaar would remain mandatory for filing of Income Tax returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN).

What was the contention against Aadhaar before the Supreme Court?

The main questions raised during the hearing on Aadhaar were:

Mains Question: The Supreme Court finds a pragmatic middle path between the Aadhaar scheme excesses and its benefits to the marginalised. Analyze.

The Chabahar Agreement was signed in June 2015 and approved by Iran's Guardian Council in November 2016. Chabahar is being seen as a gateway for trade by India, Iran and Afghanistan with Central Asian countries.

Iran's Chabahar port is located on the Gulf of Oman and is the only oceanic port of the country. The port gives access to the energy-rich Persian Gulf nations' southern coast.

The first and foremost significance of the Chabahar port is the fact that India can bypass Pakistan in transporting goods to Afghanistan. Chabahar port will boost India's access to Iran, the key gateway to the International North-South Transport Corridor that has sea, rail and road routes between India, Russia, Iran, Europe and Central Asia.

Chabahar port will be beneficial to India in countering Chinese presence in the Arabian Sea which China is trying to ensure by helping Pakistan develop the Gwadar port. Gwadar port is less than 400 km from Chabahar by road and 100 km by sea.

With Chabahar port being developed and operated by India, Iran also becomes a military ally to India. Chabahar could be used in case China decides to flex its navy muscles by stationing ships in Gwadar port to reckon its upper hand in the Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf and Middle East.

With Chabahar port becoming functional, there will be a significant boost in the import of iron ore, sugar and rice to India. The import cost of oil to India will also see a considerable decline. India has already increased its crude purchase from Iran since the West imposed ban on Iran was lifted.

Chabahar port will ensure in the establishment of a politically sustainable connectivity between India and Afghanistan. This will in turn, lead to better economic ties between the two countries.

From a diplomatic perspective, Chabahar port could be used as a point from where humanitarian operations could be coordinated.

Mains Question: India has formally taken over operations of Iran's strategic Chabahar Port. Why is investing in this port so important for India? Examine.

Context: Andhra Pradesh government has launched works for erection of the first radial gate - the 41st one - at the Polavaram project site. The state hopes that the project works would be completed by May 2019 and water would be released to canals under gravity by December 2019.

The Polavaram project was accorded national status in 2014 in the Andhra Pradesh Bifurcation Act and its design was changed.

The dam across the Godavari River is under construction located in West Godavari District and East Godavari District in Andhra Pradesh state and its reservoir spreads in parts of Chhattisgarh and Orissa States also.

Context: The latest information obtained by an activist under the Right to Information (RTI) has revealed that Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project may turn out to be a loss-making proposition and burden Maharashtra's already dwindling finances.

Both Planning and Finance departments have called for a thorough study of bullet train economics in other countries before a decision is taken on its feasibility in India. Additionally, the departments said the Centre must clarify the formula for sharing the loan burden if the project remains loss-making for a long period of time. Since the State is coping with serious loss in income and further burden of loans, the impact of this project on government finances needs to be considered.

The train, with a capacity of 750 passengers, will travel at speeds between 320 km/hr and 350km/hr and is expected to reduce travel time between Ahmedabad and Mumbai to three-and-a-half hours or less from the present eight. The project is expected to be completed in seven years.

High-speed connectivity - This will facilitate economic growth. Smaller cities along the way can also be connected with high-speed transit facility to these economic Centres through the bullet train network.

The bullet train project is expected to create 4,000 direct job opportunities, along with 20,000 indirect jobs. 20,000 construction workers will also be employed during the set up period of Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train.

Urban expansion - New bullet train stations set to come up along the route will attract urban growth. This will again shift the pressure of urbanisation from the existing urban Centres.

Open new avenues - When completed, the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project will present as a favorable destination for high-speed train technologies, attracting other parties working in the field.

The geostrategic importance of Bullet trains is:

Mains Question: Investment in infrastructure development has always acted as a catalyst in the economic growth of India. Does huge investments in bullet trains yield dividends to India? Examine."

Excerpts... -- Editor

By N. Niranjan Nikam

SOM: Psychiatry is all to do with man's mental health. You have been in the field for the last 20 years in the US. Why did you choose this field which still has very less takers?

Dr. Sanjay Sreenivas Chandragiri: It is true that Psychiatry had very less takers when I chose it; the Psychiatric training positions in India would go unfilled. But now it is in great demand and actually all the positions get filled and people take it as their first choice. Why I took it is because for some reason towards the end of finishing my medical school, MBBS, I got interested, maybe, because it was interesting to read about it at that time and it somehow suited my personality.

But now, for instance in the US, it is in much greater demand than medicine or paediatrics. It has changed a lot in the last ten years and more so in the last five years.

SOM: Despite the need for more Psychiatrists in the US, mental health care, it is said, is not treated the same way as physical health. Is this true?

Dr. Chandragiri: It is both yes and no. In the US there is a greater need for Psychiatrists. But what happened is, the slot for Psychiatry were frozen for nearly 15 to 20 years. So there have been fewer programme openings and if there are openings they have not been keeping in pace with the population growth.

There has been a shortage of Psychiatrists for a long time now, where I practice. I am the Psychiatry Residency Programme Director and one of the reasons we started the programme was to increase the supply of Psychiatrists locally for us.

Mental health care, in some ways is not, but more recently now, we have mental health parity, that is, mental health care should be treated on par with physical health care. For a long time some insurance companies were not covering Psychiatric treatment. That is no longer the case. It has improved. It is not one hundred per cent there, but definitely it is a lot better.

SOM: Where does Psychiatry in India stand as there are less than 4,000 Psychiatrists in the country for a population of 1.2 billion. That is just about one Psychiatrist for over 13,000 people.

Dr. Chandragiri: I am not an expert about work-force requirement in India but 4,000 we know are very low. Again it is the same thing. But every slot gets filled and it is not that Psychiatrist PG training slots get unfilled. Everything gets filled and lots of people choose Psychiatry as their first choice, but the problem is that not enough people are being trained to be Psychiatrists.

SOM: Since you are associated with Manipal University as Adjunct Visiting Professor, Department of Psychiatry, Kasturba Medical College, what are the changes you have seen here in the last 27 years since you passed out?

Dr. Chandragiri: The changes I have seen in Psychiatry are that gradually the stigma towards seeking Psychiatric treatment has decreased. Maybe the decrease is more in the metropolitan areas and among more educated people. But I think overall the stigma has decreased and more people are seeking treatment. The quality of treatment is not just training Psychiatrists but there are other programmes like social workers for example and the training for Psychiatrists for medical students has improved a lot. At least the MCI (Medical Council of India) guidelines have changed and they require more training. Whether it is actually implemented everywhere we don't know. But in Manipal it is implemented.

SOM: Your License is unrestricted in States of Pennsylvania. What does this kind of License mean?

Dr. Chandragiri: Oh, that just means everyone gets unrestricted license. We put that in CVs, because when you apply for a job or something, they know that it is unrestricted, that is the norm. Unrestricted License is the default license. Restricted license means you are in trouble that you might have committed something like you have over-prescribed or you did something unethical or usually for people who had substance use problems like alcohol or drug use...

SOM: Even the doctors have these problems?

Dr. Chandragiri: Yes. So if something like that happens, you lose your license for a period of time and then you have to demonstrate that you are maintaining sobriety or something like that. They may restore your license but for a year or two you have to work under someone else's supervision.

SOM: Is this rule also there in India?

Dr. Chandragiri: I think it must be there in the rulebook. But I do not know how strictly it is enforced. There are many examples that I personally know of in the US where the Psychiatrists' Licenses have come under restricted category where they have to go for treatment and maintain sobriety. It is usually for people with alcohol problems. If a crime is committed then the license is not going to be restored.

SOM: As Psychiatrists, do you have emergency cases like for instance you have to face as a Surgeon or even as a Physician?

Dr. Chandragiri: Yes, you do have a lot of emergencies and especially in the US it is a little more. For example, somebody may come in a very, very agitated state because they are psychotic, talking to themselves, they are out of touch with reality, have been destructive. So you have to assess and control them. Lot of times, somebody comes in, who is suicidal, very depressed and you have to make a decision whether to admit that person or you can discharge them home and they can be followed as outpatients. So those are the kind of emergencies we get.

SOM: Any examples you can share?

Dr. Chandragiri: Like a person may come in totally psychotic believing that people are trying to hurt him, hearing voices of people who are not actually there, the person's thinking is highly disorganised and then you have to decide whether this is schizophrenia or a drug induced psychosis. Sometimes if it is what we call stimulate induced psychosis then the treatment is slightly different from the person who just came with schizophrenia. So that can happen at any time of day or night.

Where I work, we actually have a separate Psychiatric Emergency room. It is in the regular emergency room but separate part of it where we treat these kinds of patients.

SOM: But are there any separate mental hospitals like we have NIMHANS (National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences) in Bengaluru?

Dr. Chandragiri: There are. I worked for a while in a State Psychiatric Hospital. But those places are decreasing in numbers. More and more psychiatry is being treated in general hospitals.

In India though there is a separate one like NIMHANS, there are many Psychiatric Wards in many hospitals. For example in Manipal, the Psychiatric Unit is in the general hospital, I think they have one in JSS too; in Mysore Medical College again it is within the general hospital. That is the way it is being treated and Psychiatrists are trained everywhere.

SOM: What about NIMHANS?

Dr. Chandragiri: Yes, NIMHANS used to be a mental hospital but now it is a major research institute known worldwide. It has changed, its primary function is not a mental hospital. They treat a lot of mentally ill people. A long time ago, the reason was, a lot of psychiatric illnesses could not be treated. So, many of them were being kept in large mental hospitals, many times, forever. There are still some patients who may not respond to many medications, other treatments and may need longer term treatments. But the number of patients who need long term treatments are steadily decreasing because we have better treatments and better outcomes.

SOM: You have presented a paper 'A treatment Dilemma' at the International College of Neuropsychopharmacology (CINP) World Congress, Vienna, Austria, in June this year. What is this dilemma about?

Dr. Chandragiri: Oh that dilemma was about a young patient who had schizophrenia, who had not responded to many different medicines. In the middle of the treatment we said we will put him on a medicine called clozapine which will treat schizophrenia. Then we had to do a blood test where we discovered that he had low platelet count and then we saw that we could not give clozapine because of low platelet count. Then we realised that with every medicine we started he would get low platelet count and when we stopped it, his platelet count would increase and then we didn't know whether it is Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia, in which the treatment is to take out the spleen. In his case it seemed like it was drug induced because whenever a drug was given his platelet count was going down. We consulted a Haematologist and other specialists, but it was still unclear. Finally, his spleen was taken out and then the platelet count came back to normal so that we could give him this clozapine and his condition improved. And also because he had schizophrenia, he couldn't even give consent, he couldn't agree to the surgery. So his mother had to go to court and take power of attorney over him. We decided to submit the paper which was accepted in the World Congress.

SOM: How much of teaching and private practice are you involved in and which gives you more satisfaction?

Dr. Chandragiri: This time it is almost 50/50. Both of them give me lot of satisfaction. I teach medical students and residents and so teaching residents gives me a lot of satisfaction because with teaching you have to continuously strive to improve. In practice you still have to keep up developments but not in great depth. You have to know enough to keep using them.

For instance when I gave a talk at Manipal, one was about a treatment called TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) that is relatively new for depression for other psychiatric conditions too but mainly for depression in which there is a big machine where you put a magnet over the head and then stimulate the brain.

SOM: Do you have this machine in Manipal?

Dr. Chandragiri: In Manipal they don't but they have something similar to that. But I have that in Pennsylvania. It is there all over the world. Even in the US it is slowly increasing. So that means for people for whom other treatments for depression do not work, you can use that machine.

SOM: Depression is a huge problem. For instance one person who has openly talked about it is actress Deepika Padukone. In US, many celebrities have talked about depression. Tell us something about it.

Dr. Chandragiri: The important thing for people to know about depression is, it is an illness, and it is a disease just like one has a heart disease or hyper-tension, asthma. Depression happens because there are changes in your brain, the changes in how the nerve cells communicate with each other because there is some chemical imbalance.

In depression, one is feeling down, has no energy, no motivation, feels guilty about things they don't need to feel guilty about, cannot sleep, cannot get up, and that person may be labelled as lazy, or as lacking ambition, whereas, the fact is they cannot help themselves. Many times, I think others will look at it as weakness of character.

SOM: Have you come across any celebrities and have you yourself treated any of them?

Dr. Chandragiri: Celebrities I have not, but possibly if I did I would not reveal it. But there are celebrities who have had depression and admitted to seeking treatment.

Three others - her Facebook boyfriend, S Suresh, and two minors aged 16 and 17 - have also been arrested.

The girl, identified as S Devipriya, a resident of Anjaneyapuram in Tamil Nadu's Thiruvallur, is a second year Bachelor of Commerce student at a college in Avadi.

Devipriya allegedly got her mother Banumathi killed for opposing her relationship with Suresh.

""Devipriya had befriended S Suresh, who is also 19-years-old and a resident of Kumbakonam, Thanjavur district, last year through Facebook. Though they had not met in person, they had developed a strong relationship through Facebook. Suresh had claimed to be an IT professional in Mysuru. Devipriya had told her Facebook love story to her mother Banumathi, who had advised her to disbelieve Facebook love proposals and to concentrate on her studies,"" Tamil Nadu police sources told Hindustan Times.

Banumathi also restricted Devipriya from using her mobile phone. ""Angry at this, Devipriya managed to call Suresh and sought his help in killing her mother. Suresh, in turn, sent two school dropouts, both minors aged 16 and 17, to help Devipriya execute the deed on Monday,"" police sources said.

Devipriya introduced the two minors to her mother as her friends. ""When Banumathi was alone at home, Devipriya and the two minors attacked her with sickles and killed her,"" police said.

Alerted by Banumathi's screams, the neighbours chased and caught the two minors. The two minors confessed during interrogation and revealed the details of the case which led to Suresh's arrest on Tuesday.

During preliminary investigations, it came to light that Suresh was not an IT professional as he had claimed. ""He was working at a factory in Sri City of Andhra Pradesh. He had lied to Devipriya about his background to make her fall in love with him,"" police claimed. Both Devipriya and Suresh have been produced before a city court which has remanded them to police custody."

Raising concerns over the harmful impacts of pollution on the Taj Mahal, Chandrakant Khaire, Member of Parliament from Aurangabad district, raised questions during the ongoing winter session of Parliament.

Posing the questions to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Mr. Khaire asked whether the marble of the Taj Mahal is getting dis-colored due to air pollution. In response to this question, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, the Minister of State in the Ministry quoting the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) said in a written reply,

Pollutants from various sources have been superficially depositing on the marble surface of Taj Mahal as particulate matter and due to scattering of light by these particles, the marble surface of Taj Mahal appears to have changed in color.

The color of the Taj Mahal has changed over the years from white to first yellow and now brownish and greenish in color.

The bacteria from the polluted River Yamuna are also a threat to the monument, according to experts.

Swarms of bugs are breeding in the stagnant water and infesting the marble walls of the monument, resulting in greenish black patches in several places of the intricate floral inlay works.

According to Mr. Braj Khandelwal, the founder ofRiver Connect Campaign, a people's movement in Agra to save the River Yamuna,

Due to pollution and lack of flowing water, all the structure built on the bank of Yamuna are bound to collapse sooner than later.

When asked by Mr. Khaire whether the foundation of Taj Mahal was becoming weak due to polluted water of River Yamuna, Mr. Sharma, citing the ASI, said,

The water level of the river was away from the northern wall of the monument. Therefore, a specific study on the link between Yamuna water and the strength of the foundation of Taj Mahal has not been conducted.

Mr. Khaire asked about the efforts being made by the government for protecting the Taj Mahal. To this, the Minister of State replied that to restore the beauty of the Taj Mahal, ASI has formulated scientific cleaning and conservation plan. The plan includes protecting the surface of Taj Mahal from deposited pollutants. He said,

All four minarets, eight facades, four pedestal marble walls, the interior portion of periphery up to human height and four chhatris at the rooftop of the main mausoleum, have already been cleaned and treated. However, the cleaning of the main dome requires some technical studies.

The Supreme Court had earlier expressed concern over the change of color of the Mughal-era monument and it being infested by insects. It asked the Uttar Pradesh (UP) State government to bring in world experts to help preserve the country's 17th century white marble mausoleum.

The UP government had recently told the apex court that it had asked Delhi-based School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) for a vision document for the protection of Taj Mahal.

Earlier this year, the Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the the government had taken a serious note of Supreme Court's observations on the situation of the Taj Mahal. He further added that the use of biofuel, green fuel, and electric vehicles would be popularised in Agra to deal with air pollution and to protect the monuments of Agra."

Around 200 Sabarimala Samrakshana Samithi protesters gathered on the premises of the house and started chanting since the morning after news spread about Bindu' attempt to enter the hill shrine. The agitation continued until around 1.30 pm when the woman stopped the trekking and returned to Pampa.

Senior advocate Indira Jaising said the review petition has been filed against the September 26 verdict of the five-judge constitution bench which had said there was nothing in the Aadhaar Act that violated right to privacy of an individual.

The bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra had also upheld the passage of the Aadhaar Bill as a Money Bill by the Lok Sabha.

The review petition has been filed by one Imtiyaz Ali Palsaniya, who had also filed interim applications when the apex court was examining the validity of the Aadhaar scheme.

The petition has also sought an open court hearing in the matter.

In the 56-page petition, the petitioner has said it has been preferred in a ""narrow compass"" seeking to challenge only those aspects of the Aadhaar program as well as the Aadhaar Act, 2016 which were held to be constitutionally valid by the constitution bench.

While declaring the scheme as constitutionally valid, the apex court had struck down some of its provisions including its linking with bank accounts, mobile phones and school admissions.

The constitution bench had held that Aadhaar would remain mandatory for filing of Income Tax returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN).

""The judgement sought to be reviewed has also not considered a crucial aspect of PAN-Aadhaar linkage, since it fails to satisfy the test laid down by the same court in the very same judgement,"" the review plea said.

It claimed that the Aadhaar program, which had been in existence prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, had itself become an ""instrument of transfer of sensitive personal data"" belonging to citizens to foreign entities acting as biometric service providers at a time when the UIDAI in 2010 had no cyber or technical infrastructure to store such information.

This, the petition claimed, poses a massive national security risk, more so when, according to a Press Information Bureau notification, 100 crore enrolments had already taken place before April 4, 2016.

In its verdict, the apex court had said that Aadhaar would not be mandatory for school admissions, as also for the examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for medical entrance and the University Grants Commission.

The bench had also struck down the national security exception under the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016.

Three sets of judgements were pronounced in the matter.

The first one was pronounced by Justice A K Sikri who wrote the judgement for himself, Misra and Justice A M Khanwilkar.

Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice Ashok Bhushan, who were also part of the bench, wrote their individual opinions.

While Justice Chandrachud had said he was expressing certain views different from that of the judgement of the three judges, Justice Bhushan had said he concurred with the views of the majority."

He died in 2017, showing apparent signs of torture while in custody.

A federal judge on Monday ordered North Korea to pay more than USD 500 million in a wrongful death suit filed by the parents of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who died shortly after being released from that country.

US District Judge Beryl Howell harshly condemned North Korea for ""barbaric mistreatment"" of Warmbier in agreeing with his family that the isolated nation should be held liable for his death last year.

She awarded punitive damages and payments covering medical expenses, economic loss and pain and suffering to Fred and Cindy Warmbier, who alleged that their son had been held hostage and tortured.

Warmbier was a University of Virginia student who was visiting North Korea with a tour group when he was arrested and sentenced to 15 years of hard labour in March 2016 on suspicion of stealing a propaganda poster. He died in June 2017, shortly after he returned to the US in a coma and showing apparent signs of torture while in custody.

In holding North Korean responsible, Howell said the government had seized Warmbier for ""use as a pawn in that totalitarian state's global shenanigans and face-off with the United States.""

""Before Otto traveled with a tour group on a five-day trip to North Korea, he was a healthy, athletic student of economics and business in his junior year at the University of Virginia, with 'big dreams' and both the smarts and people skills to make him his high school class salutatorian, homecoming king, and prom king,"" the judge wrote.

""He was blind, deaf, and brain dead when North Korea turned him over to US government officials for his final trip home.""

The arrest and death of Warmbier came during a time of heightened tension between the US and North Korea over the country's nuclear weapons program. President Donald Trump held a first-of-its-kind summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June 2018 and plans another next year.

The judgment may be mostly a symbolic victory since North Korea has yet to respond to any of the allegations in court and there's no practical mechanism to force it do so.

But the family may nonetheless be able to recoup damages through a Justice Department-administered fund for victims of state-sponsored acts of terrorism, and may look to seize other assets held by the country outside of North Korea.

Fred and Cindy Warmbier, who are from a suburb of Cincinnati, said they were thankful the court found the government of Kim Jong Un ""legally and morally"" responsible for their son's death.

""We put ourselves and our family through the ordeal of a lawsuit and public trial because we promised Otto that we will never rest until we have justice for him,"" they said in a statement.

""Today's thoughtful opinion by Chief Judge Howell is a significant step on our journey."" The lawsuit, filed in April, describes in horrific detail the physical abuse Warmbier endured in North Korean custody, recounting how his parents were ""stunned to see his condition"" when they boarded a plane to see him upon arrival in the US.

The 22-year-old was blind and deaf, his arms were curled and mangled and he was jerking violently and howling, completely unresponsive to his family's attempts to comfort him.

His once straight teeth were misaligned, and he had an unexplained scar on his foot. An expert said the injuries suggested he'd been tortured with electric shock, and a neurologist later concluded that the college student suffered brain damage, probably from a loss of blood flow to the brain for five to 20 minutes.

North Korea has denied Warmbier was tortured and has said he contracted botulism, though medical experts said there was no evidence of that.

The complaint also said Warmbier was pressed to make a televised confession, then convicted of subversion after a short trial. He was denied communication with his family. In June 2017, his parents were informed he was in a coma and had been in that condition for one year.

Though foreign nations are generally immune from lawsuits in US courts, Howell cited several exceptions that she said allowed her to hold North Korea liable. Those include the fact that North Korea has been designated by the U.S. as a sponsor of terrorism, that the Warmbiers are US citizens and that the actions of the North Korean government involved torture and hostage taking.

The penalty awarded to the Warmbiers and to Otto Warmbier's estate includes punitive damages as well as damages for economic losses, pain and suffering and medical expenses.

The lawsuit was brought on the Warmbiers' behalf by Richard Cullen, a prominent Virginia lawyer and former US attorney. He told The Associated Press that while ""nothing will ever bring Otto back to the Warmbiers or erase their memories of his horrid last 18 months,"" the judge's decision was ""very good news for his family and friends."""

A delegation of 10+2 lectur­ers called on the Advisor and de­manded humane view in the case of their immediate regularization into the department.

A deputation of south Kashmir's Nowgam, Kuthhar, Tehsil, Shangus reiterated their demand for estab­lishment of Women Government Degree college in the area. They said that the locals were ready to provide free land for the col­lege project. They also appealed Advisor Ganai for construction of boundary wall of the PHC Now­gam. A delegation of persons duped in Hajeej India tour and travels case urged the advisor to direct concerned authorities to ad­dress their genuine grievance. The Advisor was informed that the ac­cused tour operator siphoned off their money leaving them to suf­fer over all these years. They also informed the Advisor that the ac­cused in the case is not attending to the court hearings. A delegation of Dangiwacha of south Kashmir sought functioning of degree col­lege on the priority basis.

Scores of people from Pulwama raised the issue of land encroach­ment in their area. They com­plained that revenue authorities were not cooperating with the locals.

The Advisor issued on the spot directions to the Revenue officials to take all the possible measures under the law to retrieve the en­croached land. He directed the of­ficials to hold a detailed meeting with the higher-ups and report the matter immediately to the Gov­ernor's Grievance Cell. The locals appealed Advisor Ganai that the encroached land in the area should be dedicated to the school or hos­pital. A delegation of south Kash­mir's Tral town projected many issues to which the Advisor as­sured prompt redressal.

Known for his industrialisation drive as part of the first government of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Sen has a controversial past with alleged link to the Sainbari incident.

Searching the web for Nirupam Sen, the former Industries Minister in the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government who died in Kolkata Monday (24 December) morning of multiple organ failure, throws up the link to a wikipedia page titled ""Sainbari Incident"".

Sen (a full-time member of the Communist Party of India [Marxist]) allegedly led a mob of frenzied party activists who attacked the Sain family (prominent supporters of the Congress) in Bardhaman town on the morning of 17 March 1970 in what has come to be known as one of the most horrific political murders in the country.

It was the brutality of the incident that shocked people across the country. The Sain family had gathered at their ancestral house for the naming ceremony of a baby born to the family. The CPI(M) activists, led by Khokon Sen (who allegedly changed his name later to Nirupam Sen), had taken out a procession to celebrate the fall of the second United Front government a day earlier. The Sain family, steadfast Congress supporters, had refused the blandishments and threats by the CPI(M) to join the red party. And they, thus, became the target of the Marxists' ire.

Rekha Rani Sain, the widow of Naba Kumar Sain, the eldest son of the family, still recounts the horror of that morning in 1970 (read here). A few hundred CPI(M) activists started shooting arrows and pelting stones at Sainbari (the name of the family home), after which a few dozen of them entered the house and went on a looting spree. First, they gouged out the eyes of Naba Kumar and then hacked his two brothers - Pranab Kumar and Malay Kumar - to death in front of their mother, the widowed Mrignayana Devi. When she tried to save her sons, they hit her as well. Jiten Ray, a private tutor who had gone to Sainbari to tutor Rakha Rani's daughter, was also killed brutally.

The Sain family was in a festive mood that day, a child born to a daughter of the family, Swarnalata Jash, was to be named. The child was a month old. The CPI(M) murderers did not spare the infant and threw him into a fire that was lit for the havan ceremony, but family members rescued the baby, who was later named Amrit Kumar and is now 48 years old. He still has burn marks on his body.

It was, however, what the Marxist murderers did after that which horrified everyone. They reportedly mixed the blood of Pranab and Malay, who they had killed, with rice that had been cooked for offering to the family deity, and forced Mrignayana Devi to eat that rice! They also smeared the blood of her sons on Mrignayana's forehead!

The old lady never recovered from the shock and died a mental wreck in 1978. Then, Indira Gandhi, the prime minister at the time, visited the bereaved family and led the nation in condemning the horrific act.

Their bloodlust not fulfilled, CPI(M) activists murdered Naba Kumar (whose eyes they had gouged out in March 1970) a year later. A National Students' Union of India (NSUI) activist Gunamoni Roy, who was a witness to the massacre, was murdered when he had gone to depose before the Tarapada Roy Commission that was instituted to probe the massacre by then chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray in 1971.

Many other witnesses were threatened and silenced into submission while others were reportedly bought off with offers of jobs and 'blood money'. Around 83 CPI(M) activists were named in the first information report (FIR) filed with the police and the names of Sen and Benoy Konar (another CPI(M) leader who became a Politburo member) figure in the eleventh and sixty-third in the list of accused named in the FIR. Later, after the CPI(M) came to power in 1977, files pertaining to the case went missing.

The police filed a charge sheet (number 22, filed on 8 February 1971) that named 56 persons including Benoy Konar (accused number 11 in the charge sheet). The same charge sheet also names 56 'absconders', in which the name of Bhujanga Sen's son Khokon Sen figures at number 23. The names of Rajat Bandopadhyay, Amal Haldar, Pabitra Bhattacharya, Kalyan Kanta Mondal, Sudin Chattopadhyay, Mridul Sen, Suhas Chattopadhyay, Binoy Konar's brother Sushanta Konar, Sishir Chakraborty, Amiya Saha, and Brajaraj Mukhopadhya also features among the chargesheeted absconders. All of them are CPI(M) leaders. Khokon Sen is Nirupam Sen.

It was only after the Trinamool Congress came to power in 2011 that some files pertaining to the case were dug up from old records at Writers Building (the Raj-era structure that used to house all major government departments till a few years ago) in 2012 (read here). The All India Legal Aid Forum is pursuing the case and its general secretary, Joydeep Mukherjee (a Supreme Court lawyer), who had filed a petition before the Supreme Court, holds that Sen was never exonerated or even granted bail in the case.

Mukherjee is also critical of a commission (under Abhinava Basu, a retired judge of the Calcutta High Court) set up after the Trinamool Congress came to power in 2011. The commission, Mukherjee says, has not examined all witnesses. ""I hear the Commission has submitted its report. If that is true, the state government should reveal the findings. A lot of time has passed and many witnesses have died. One of the prime accused, Khokon Sen, just died. The Sain family is awaiting justice,"" Mukherjee told Swarajya (read here).

Sen was born in October 1946 into a family of communist supporters. His father, a school teacher, was part of the communist movement from the British days and had joined the communist chorus of ""yeh azadi jhoota hai (this freedom is a lie)"".

Indoctrinated at a young age, Khokon (later Nirupam) joined the Students' Federation of India (SFI), the students' wing of the CPI(M), when he was in school and became the organisation's Bardhaman district secretary in 1966 at the age of 20. He became a full-time member of the CP(M) in 1968, the party's Bardhaman district secretary in 1989 (he held the post till 1995), and was elected from Bardhaman South Assembly constituency in 1987, 2001, and 2006. He became a member of the CPI(M) Central Committee in 1998 and the party politburo in 2008.

Sen led the industrialisation drive when he joined the first government of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as Industries and Commerce Minister in 2001. The CPI(M)'s promise of industrialising the state and creating jobs led to its resounding victory in the 2006 elections. But the ground started slipping from beneath the Marxists' feet later that year with protests gaining ground over Singur (where land was forcibly acquired for the Tatas' Nano car project) and Nandigram (where land was sought to be acquired for a chemical hub). The rest, as they say, is history.

On Wednesday (26 December), when comrades stream past his body at the CPI(M) party headquarters in Kolkata to pay their last respects, many would be wondering if it was this man who brought about the downfall of the party with his industrialisation mantra. And the surviving members of the Sain family are also unhappy that the man who brought them such misery was never brought to justice.

Sen, in death as in life, remains a controversial figure."

Warmbier was a University of Virginia student who was visiting North Korea with a tour group when he was arrested and sentenced to 15 years of hard labour in March 2016 on suspicion of stealing a propaganda poster. He died in June 2017, shortly after he returned to the US in a coma and showing apparent signs of torture while in custody.

In holding North Korean responsible, Howell said the government had seized Warmbier for ""use as a pawn in that totalitarian state's global shenanigans and face-off with the United States.""

""Before Otto traveled with a tour group on a five-day trip to North Korea, he was a healthy, athletic student of economics and business in his junior year at the University of Virginia, with 'big dreams' and both the smarts and people skills to make him his high school class salutatorian, homecoming king, and prom king,"" the judge wrote.

""He was blind, deaf, and brain dead when North Korea turned him over to US government officials for his final trip home.""

The judgment may be mostly a symbolic victory since North Korea has yet to respond to any of the allegations in court and there's no practical mechanism to force it do so.

But the family may nonetheless be able to recoup damages through a Justice Department-administered fund for victims of state-sponsored acts of terrorism, and may look to seize other assets held by the country outside of North Korea.

Fred and Cindy Warmbier, who are from a suburb of Cincinnati, said they were thankful the court found the government of Kim Jong Un ""legally and morally"" responsible for their son's death.

""We put ourselves and our family through the ordeal of a lawsuit and public trial because we promised Otto that we will never rest until we have justice for him,"" they said in a statement.

""Today's thoughtful opinion by Chief Judge Howell is a significant step on our journey."" The lawsuit, filed in April, describes in horrific detail the physical abuse Warmbier endured in North Korean custody, recounting how his parents were ""stunned to see his condition"" when they boarded a plane to see him upon arrival in the US.

The 22-year-old was blind and deaf, his arms were curled and mangled and he was jerking violently and howling, completely unresponsive to his family's attempts to comfort him.

His once straight teeth were misaligned, and he had an unexplained scar on his foot. An expert said the injuries suggested he'd been tortured with electric shock, and a neurologist later concluded that the college student suffered brain damage, probably from a loss of blood flow to the brain for five to 20 minutes.

North Korea has denied Warmbier was tortured and has said he contracted botulism, though medical experts said there was no evidence of that.

The complaint also said Warmbier was pressed to make a televised confession, then convicted of subversion after a short trial. He was denied communication with his family. In June 2017, his parents were informed he was in a coma and had been in that condition for one year.

Though foreign nations are generally immune from lawsuits in US courts, Howell cited several exceptions that she said allowed her to hold North Korea liable. Those include the fact that North Korea has been designated by the U.S. as a sponsor of terrorism, that the Warmbiers are US citizens and that the actions of the North Korean government involved torture and hostage taking.

The penalty awarded to the Warmbiers and to Otto Warmbier's estate includes punitive damages as well as damages for economic losses, pain and suffering and medical expenses.

The lawsuit was brought on the Warmbiers' behalf by Richard Cullen, a prominent Virginia lawyer and former US attorney. He told The Associated Press that while ""nothing will ever bring Otto back to the Warmbiers or erase their memories of his horrid last 18 months,"" the judge's decision was ""very good news for his family and friends.

US District Judge Beryl Howell harshly condemned North Korea for ""barbaric mistreatment"" of Warmbier in agreeing with his family that the isolated nation should be held liable for his death last year. She awarded punitive damages and payments covering medical expenses, economic loss and pain and suffering to Fred and Cindy Warmbier, who alleged that their son had been held hostage and tortured.

The arrest and death of Warmbier came during a time of heightened tension between the US and North Korea over the country's nuclear weapons program. President Donald Trump held a first-of-its-kind summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June 2018 and plans another next year.

It had its highs and it had its abysmal lows. One constant was the books that held it all together. Sometimes, we are at a loss of words and at others we do not realise that we need to address certain things with words. Books help at such times. Here are some of the books that opened up our worlds a tad bit more and led to late night conversations over mugs of hot chocolate.

By Tanu Shree Singh

Thukpa For All

Author: Praba Ram & Sheela Preuitt

Illustrator: Shilpa Ranade

Age Group: 5+

We live in our cocoons. Not aware of other cultures, people and foods. Thukpa for all beautifully rounds everything up. This book, told from a blind child's perspective, opens up an important conversation about the differently-abled and how they are usually treated. The story revolves around Tsering inviting his friends and neighbours over for a delicious meal of Thukpa cooked by his grandmother. But then the power cut strikes. While everyone wonders what to do, for Tsering, it is business as usual. He is just a normal child who does things a bit differently.

On our trip to Ladakh, we tasted thukpa, and learnt that power cuts were a way of life. It is a world far removed from the isolated existence of a city. The community thrives on cooperation, mutual trust and care. And life waits for a warm bowl of thukpa despite what we might see as hurdles. The story normalises differences beautifully.

Susie Will Not Speak

Author: Shruthi Rao

Age group: 7+

The younger one used to speak with a slight lisp when he started talking. By the age of four he had figured out how to say 's.' At that time it used to sound cute. But today when I think back, I shudder at the horrors he would have had to face had it not gotten resolved on its own.

Advertising

Children can be fairly mean to people who are different. And articulation and phonological disorders are just not considered serious enough by our society to evoke any kind of empathy training in kids. In fact, just like an adult in the book Susie will Not Speak (written by Shruthi Rao; illustrated by Lavanya Naidu) most of us end up making fun of it all. Movies freely use such characters as a comic relief. It is simply acceptable to laugh. Very few stop to think.

Books like these are the precise reason why I love hOle Books. They bring issues relevant to the targeted age group without the story sinking into seriousness of the problem. They make it relatable. Susie has a lisp and she could be any of our children's classmates. The kids in the park who tease her exist. So does the boy who decides to be her friend. The speech therapy is bugging her as much as the people who find her strange. The last straw is a school assignment that would require her to make a presentation on a topic with an overdose of the alphabet 's.' The story follows her troubles, her friend standing by her side and Susie eventually finding her way.

Shruthi Rao deftly opens up a conversation about an issue mostly ignored. Books like these are important if we are to raise mindful kids. Give it a go.

The Manic Panic

Author: Richa Jha

Illustrator: Mithila Ananth

Age: 5+

As an exercise, try noting down the time you are on devices. You'd be surprised! As a second exercise, look around you - on the metro, in the mall, markets - everywhere we find people on devices. Even more worrisome are the little babies happily swiping on the screen.

Manic Panic is a take on that. Daddy and Mommy are mostly found glued to their devices. One fine day, the wi-fi betrays them and all hell breaks loose. They whine and howl much to the child's dismay who finally declares, 'Mommy! Daddy! BEHAVE! It is NOT the end of the world'

The child then goes on to drag them to the big world out there. The story is hilarious and worrisome at the same time. It talks about our times, it talks of us. And it gives us a glimpse of possibilities without screens! And the twist at the end will get you rolling on the floor.

Manic Panic achieves a rare balance. There is a message in there for all of us - grown-ups as well as kids who are screen dependent. Yet the story is hilarious with the illustrations making it all funnier and even more ridiculous.

Soda and Bonda

Author: Niveditha Subramaniam

Age: 3+

I have five dogs and a cat. And believe me they are walking lessons in accepting differences. The Rottweiler is scared of the slightest sounds, the cat thinks he is one of the dogs, the oldest dog thinks he is the family elder, the smallest thinks she is a ninja. Soda and Bonda is easily as much their story as it is ours.

Bonda the cat feels and behaves like a dog. The story is about Bonda coming out and Soda accepting her as a dog. Sound familiar? We are all stuck in roles defined by different conditions - age, gender, religion, culture, caste - the list never ends. Soda and Bonda gently shake that all up and form a welcome platform to discuss differences and acceptance. I do not think it is limited to a toddler picture book. It transcends ages and should be read by all.

The illustrations mae me fall in love with my mad band of dogs and a cat all over again!

When Morning Comes

Author: Arushi Raina

Age :14+

My love and appreciation for history is fairly recent. So to go to another continent for something which never found a mention in our history books was out of question. My introduction to South Africa was limited to Gandhi and what he did there. It is no different for our children. I know apartheid existed but it was this clinical, objective condition, limited to a few paragraphs in a long forgotten history textbook. I'd frown, thinking about it but that's about it. There was a comfortable emotional detachment. It was the same for the boys.

Then we read When Morning Comes by Arushi Raina. It is the kind of book that needs you to rest between pages, to find your breath, to hope that things go well, that the characters live. That Zanele lives.

The Soweto Uprising changed the course of history for the region and to think it was a group of school kids who started it all! Fiction gives voices to the people who might have existed around the time. There might have been a Zanele fighting for her basic rights as a human being, there might have been a Jack, who despite being white and completely ignorant of what was going on around him, cared very little about the skin colour. There might have been an impossible love story that could have existed and quietly faded away. There might have been a Meena, who despite being brown, found herself at the centre of it all.

On 16th June 1976, I was not even a year old, happily bundled up in my mum's arms, protected in my privileged life. And on that very day about 700 people, mostly school students were killed. Because they decided that it was them who had to stand up, and do something about their rights. Little children, the age of my own and perhaps younger.

Zanele, Thabo, Jack and Meena - they together reveal a forgotten part of world history that today, more than ever, is significant. The story moves forth in their voices, their lives and their changing perspectives. The story needs to be read, for on the foundation of history, future stands.

Pink and Blue

Author: Ritu Vaishnav

Age Group: 5+

Pink and Blue, written by Ritu Vaishnav and illustrated by Vishnu M Nair is a perfect starting point for conversations on gender stereotypes. Girls like pink, boys don't cry, and many more such stereotypes are called out one by one without the book receding into a serious monologue. The illustrations ensure that the balance is maintained and the detailing would get the reader to linger on the pages a tad bit longer. Since the concepts are simply stated, they leave a lot of scope for discussion. Colours, hair length, sports, tears - none of them have a gender and our kids not only need to know it, they need to see it in terms that are familiar to them. Pink and Blue does just that - uses everyday situations in a child's life to gently put across the ridiculousness of gender stereotyping.

Ahimsa

Author: Supriya Kelkar

Age: 12+

Supriya Kelkar's Ahimsa is the kind of book I wish we had when we were kids. Anjali is a 10-year-old girl living in a fictitious small town called Navarangpur somewhere in India around the time just before we gained independence. The story revolves around the struggle as seen through the child's eyes. Gandhi's philosophy in current times incites extreme reactions like everything else. So to see the narrative treat Gandhi as a human who was also capable of making mistakes was extremely refreshing. The story leaves windows for thought and discussion. It makes the reader question at places and nod at others. I have no memory of an inclusive book from recent years, at least none that stuck past the last page was turned.

Ahimsa is different. It talks about the riots, it discusses Gandhian philosophy, it questions ideas, introduces Ambedekar's journey, it makes Dalits visible, and introduces the reader to their struggles without mollycoddling. And while it does all this, the plot is not lost. It is all conversational and provides perfect grounds for opening discussions with children around freedom struggle, different philosophies and the caste system.

The Seed Savers

Author: Bijal Vachharajani

Illustrator: Jayesh Sivan

Age: 8+

The beauty of Pratham books is that they travel to unexpected places and hence the stories that these books tell become even more impactful. The Seed Savers is a story inspired by real life events. This is a story of possibly the most important people in our society who are also one of the most neglected. This story is also about the power of choice and community. The people of the village choose to stick to organic seeds, and they come together to form a seed bank when they face a crunch. The Seed Savers is important not only as a conversation starter on the issues that our city-kids stay blissfully ignorant of, but also has the potential to be the seedling of an idea in a community facing similar problems.

This book can be most suitably used to discuss the problems that our farmers face and also possible solutions to the problem. We need to talk to our children if we hope for a better tomorrow.

Year of the Weeds

Author: Siddhartha Sarma

Age 13+

The path-breaking decision by the Supreme Court on the Niyamgiri Hills is lost in the pages of history. Most of us have either forgotten or have no clue about it. Siddhartha Sarma's Year of the Weeds is set in a small Gond village on Odisha based around the same judgment.

Korak is a teenaged boy quite content in being a gardener at the Forest Officer's home. He speaks very little, unlike Anchita, the Forest officer's daughter who likes to sketch and considers Korak her friend. Korak's very common, unnoticeable life changes when the Government tells the Gonds to vacate their land since a company wants to mine the sacred hill for bauxite. What follows is the circus we see everyday from the other side, sitting pretty in our living rooms and lapping it all up. The difference here is that the circus is seen through the eyes of the Gonds. Korak's innocent observations are cleverly layered by the writer shoving the truth gently in your face leaving no room for the reader to hide.

Without naming any names, he has managed to take a potshot at every politician and system running the show today. Little things that went into the making of this story get you to think. Anchita's insistence on feeding Korak 'kek ' (cake), for instance, is something we, standing from where we do would see as a perfectly normal thing to do. What if stuff we think of as delicacy and hence a privilege, is unpalatable to the one who seems (to us) to be in need of everything ? It gets you to stop and rethink. And hence opens up yet another world to discover with your teenager.

Flying with Grandpa

Author: Madhuri Kamat

Age: 8+

I read it this book and emerged with mixed feelings. What age group do I pin it to? Just the middle graders? Or all the way up to the forever-worrying parents? Xerxes's mother wants him to be like JRD Tata but Xerxes just wants to be like his grandpa, Mamavaji as he fondly calls him. Both of them indulge in imaginary games, share laughs and take life as it should be taken - with a bucketful of fun and a just a pinch of worry. But his mum disagrees like all mums of her generation. And she frowns. A lot.

This is a must read for both parents and children as it has the potential to open conversations up and help parents address their anxieties while understanding the child's perspective. I felt truly sorry for Xerxes. He represents the children of today, fighting to retain their dreams while trying to fullfil those that are not theirs. Do read. And reflect. And talk."

We weren't even a single mass of land. Mumbai, or Bombay -- I'm not getting political here, but the city has had over 20 names since its inception -- started off as an archipelago of seven islands, which were just part of one ruling empire or another. Not till the seven islands were gifted as a dowry to the King of England in 1661, and eventually handed over to the British East India company in 1667 for a princely sum total of 10 Pounds per annum, did the development of Mumbai as the trading hub we know it as today, began.

While the Portuguese arrived in Mumbai much before the British, ruling the seven islands from the northern bastion on Bassein (current day Vasai), part of their key responsibilities was missionary work. Till the 1660s, the islands of Bombay were dotted with Catholic Churches, with St Michael's Church in Mahim dating back to 1534, St Andrews in Bandra established in 1575, followed by other churches in Dadar (Church of Our Lady of Salvation aka Portuguese Church), Byculla (Gloria Church) and so on.

Well, the English settlers weren't Catholics and in effect, only had makeshift chapels to worship in.

The first place of public worship for the followers of the Anglican Church came up on Christmas day, 300 years ago, in the form of St Thomas' Church.

But first, some history

Back when Mumbai was still an archipelago, the first thing that was done on the main H-shaped island of Bombay, was fortification. Be mindful that the East India Company was a trading company and India was not under the British Crown yet. So like any trading organisation at the time, they had to protect their land. The reason that the area around the current day CST station is called Fort is that there actually stood a fort surrounded by a moat -- protecting the island of Bombay and its natural deep-water harbour (the reason the East India Company was interested in Bombay in the first place) from marauders and pirates.

To enter this fortified city, there were three gates which led the way in. The gate at the northern-most end was called the Bazaar Gate -- that's where the Crawford Market exists now. The southern-most gate which was called the Apollo Gate is where current day Gateway of India stands currently. The gate in between was called the Church Gate -- the location of Flora Fountain. And no, that naming convention had nothing to do with the railway station of the same name nearby. In fact, it was the other way round.

Why it was called the Church Gate, you ask? Well, imagine you are standing outside this Church Gate before the 1860s, what you would then see in front of you was an archway, and through this archway you could see the spire of the St Thomas' Church.

St Thomas' Church is what gave the name to the gate, and eventually to the station beside it.

St Thomas' Church was the first Anglican Church in Mumbai, named after St Thomas, one of the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ and among the only ones to have had come to India. The foundation stone was laid in 1674 after the then Governor of Bombay Presidency, Gerald Aungier wrote to the Court of Directors for assistance ""to erect a small church for public worship in the centre of town"" according to Dr V Gupchup's St Thomas Cathedral Bombay: A Witness to History. But from 1675 to 1715, barely any work took place. The funds collected for the construction of the cathedral mysteriously disappeared. What we had, instead of a fully constructed church, was five metre high walls.

After 40 year slumber, church work begins

From 21 September 1714 to 19 June 1715, the then East India Company Chaplain, Richard Cobbe, carried out the service inside two rooms in a building in Fort. Cobbe wasn't too pleased with the unsuitable nature of these services which were carried out in such a private manner. In 1715, Cobbe took over the second part of the construction of this church with a resolve to finish it.

""I ventured to propose the building of a Church for God's honour and service, according to the rule of the Church of England, that all island might feel we had some religion among us,"" writes Cobbe in his book, Bombay Church: Or, a True Account of the Building and Finishing the English Church at Bombay in the East Indies.

19 June 1715, being the first Sunday after Trinity, is when Cobbe recommended a Sermon to preach about building a proper church to have a more public celebration of God. After that, work on the incomplete church began in all earnestness. Cobbe wrote to a whole bunch on probable financiers, requesting them to donate funds for the building of this church. Everyone from the East India Company to businessmen operating out of Surat to Persian businessmen were approached and they donated. The exchange of letters between Cobbe and the benefactors went on from July 1715 to 1720. A sum total of Rs 43,992 was collected in all.

On Christmas Day in 1718, 300 years ago, is when the first service was held in this church.

But it wasn't until July 1837 that the Church was consecrated as a Cathedral, which coincided with the appointment of the first Bishop of Bombay Thomas Carr -- a life-size memorial to whom lies just on the right side of the altar.

A work in progress, reflecting the growing city

The St Thomas' Cathedral as it exists today, was not how it looked in 1718 when it began its public services. In fact, the neo-gothic style of architecture whose interiors are inspired by St Thomas Cathedral in Ireland, got additional elements as the decades passed and funds were easier to come by. Thanks in part to the cotton and opium traders of the time. Many portions of the church were added in the following years. For instance, the tower and clock were added in 1838. The inner chancel was renovated and enlarged in 1860 along with the external buttresses.

It was almost like the church was growing along with the city. From a non-important back of the beyond, to a powerful financial hub during the British era -- the seeds for making Mumbai the financial hub that it is today were planted back in those days.

More than a church

St Thomas' Cathedral is unlike most other churches in Mumbai. The walls of the cathedral are decorated with beautiful poignant sculptures and bas-reliefs of soldiers lost to war, memorials to prominent personalities who have left their stamp in Mumbai's history, such as JA Ballard (after whom the Ballard Estate is named), and much more. The marble plaques remembering fallen soldiers have been financed mostly by their comrades or family members. Unlike the Afghan Church in Colaba, which was built in memoriam of Indian and British soldiers who died in the Anglo-Afghan War, the St Thomas Cathedral has more Anglican memorials.

The altar windows were designed in the 1800s by Victorian stained glass designer and manufacturer, Charles Kempe. There's an interesting bit of anecdote behind that as well. Kempe had hoped to become a priest of the Cathedral, but was prevented by his stammer. However, he said, ""If I was not permitted to minister in the Sanctuary, I would use my talents to adorn it."" And his artwork is there for all to see. The Cathedral is blessed with some impressive stained glass work. Enter the church and look right and you have a stained glass work showcasing St Thomas with the Holy Bible flanked by St Gabriel and St Michael. As you walk down towards the apse, the semi-circular wall also has fine stained glass work, some of which had to be restored over the years.

Back in those days, every church was associated with a school and St Thomas' Cathedral was instrumental in the creation of one of the most popular schools in Mumbai, the Cathedral and John Connon School in 1860.

The Cathedral also saw almost all the baptisms that took place among all the Anglican churches in Bombay back in the 1800s and early 1900s. It kept records of not just baptisms but also marriages and death in all of Bombay Presidency (an area encompassing Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, and parts of Sindh region). A register of these records has an entry of a very prominent person's baptism on 22 January 1866. The son of John Lockwood and Alice Kipling -- Joseph Rudyard Kipling -- was baptised in this very Cathedral. Yes, the author of books such as The Jungle Book and Kim, was a Bombay boy.

It was also considered to be the 'Zero Point' or the centre of the city. The 16 milestones laid across erstwhile Bombay used the Cathedral as the starting point. Come to think of it, the towering spires of the Cathedral back in the day made it the most prominent landmark on the Bombay island.

For probably the first time in the Cathedral's history, some of its artefacts -- around 41 in all -- have been showcased at the ongoing exhibition The Living Cathedral at the Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vaastu Sangrahalay. These artefacts include the Holy Bible that was used to read out from 1870, silver chalices and flagons, a Bishop's staff which has carvings of Jesus as a shepherd, fading black and white portraits of Bishops from years ago and much more. The exhibit is a good journey of the cathedral along with the city in which it existed.

But I'd say, visit the Cathedral instead if you haven't already. Even if you have, visit again, especially now that it has been decorated like a shining star. Walk around its premises, admire the supporting buttresses behind the chancel.

If there was one underrated gem in Mumbai, this is it.

A proposal for 20 such schools with low enrolment was cleared by the north corporation's House meeting on Monday. These will give rise to 10 new schools.

Located mostly in the Karol Bagh, Narela and Rohini zones, these schools are currently running at places like Inderpuri, Pyare Lal Road, Shahbad Daulatpur, Nimari Colony, Shiv Nagar, Pratap Kunj, Avantika, Sangam Park, Molar Basti, Old Ranjeet Nagar, Azadpur Colony and Auchandi.

A senior corporation official attributed the decision to low enrolment, poor finances, and proper utilisation of resources. He gave the example of the proposal to merge Municipal Corporation Primary School (MCPS) Pyare Lal Road 2 and MCPS New Dev Nagar Co-ed School. ""Keeping in view better management, saving of posts and the poor economic condition of north corporation, it would be feasible to merge schools in case of availability of accommodation,"" he said.

The proposal also argues that more and more parents want to educate their wards in morning-shift schools. ""MCPS Pyarelal Road has 202 kids while the Dev Nagar school has 265. After merger, a school with 467 kids and 12 sections will be formed,"" the official said.

He added: ""There are many vacancies in other schools and the staff from the schools being closed down can be sent there. At the same time, we will be able to use the buildings and other infrastructure for purposes such as sports academies.""

The merger of the two schools alone would lead to a surplus of a principal, five teachers and two Class IV employees who could be reassigned. The official also said that 29 schools with low enrolment had been similarly shut down two years ago. But education experts have been criticising the corporations for their failure to enrol more children.

Khagesh Jha, a Supreme Court lawyer and education activist, remarked, ""If the corporation has extra land, why not add to the capital's school infrastructure so that more kids can be brought in the school system? There are more than 20 lakh kids outside the school system in the city. Besides, children from unrecognised schools too need to be brought to government schools.""

The north civic body runs 714 municipal primary schools, in which children, mostly from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, study. Enrolment in all corporation-run schools, however, has been declining steadily. Around 70,000 students have opted out of north schools since the 2012 trifurcation. It then had 3,70,648 students in its primary schools. This figure slid to 3,50,611 in 2013-14 and 3,14,022 in 2016-17. At present, around three lakh students are on the rolls."

US District Judge Beryl Howell harshly condemned North Korea for ""barbaric mistreatment"" of Warmbier in agreeing with his family that the isolated nation should be held liable for his death last year. She awarded punitive damages and payments covering medical expenses, economic loss and pain and suffering to Fred and Cindy Warmbier, who alleged that their son had been held hostage and tortured.

Warmbier was a University of Virginia student who was visiting North Korea with a tour group when he was arrested and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in March 2016 on suspicion of stealing a propaganda poster. He died in June 2017, shortly after he returned to the US in a coma and showing apparent signs of torture while in custody.

In holding North Korean responsible, Howell said the government had seized Warmbier for ""use as a pawn in that totalitarian state's global shenanigans and face-off with the United States.""

""Before Otto traveled with a tour group on a five-day trip to North Korea, he was a healthy, athletic student of economics and business in his junior year at the University of Virginia, with 'big dreams' and both the smarts and people skills to make him his high school class salutatorian, homecoming king, and prom king,"" the judge wrote. ""He was blind, deaf, and brain dead when North Korea turned him over to US government officials for his final trip home.""

The arrest and death of Warmbier came during a time of heightened tension between the US and North Korea over the country's nuclear weapons program. President Donald Trump held a first-of-its-kind summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June 2018 and plans another next year.

The judgment may be mostly a symbolic victory since North Korea has yet to respond to any of the allegations in court and there's no practical mechanism to force it do so. But the family may nonetheless be able to recoup damages through a Justice Department-administered fund for victims of state-sponsored acts of terrorism, and may look to seize other assets held by the country outside of North Korea.

Fred and Cindy Warmbier, who are from a suburb of Cincinnati, said they were thankful the court found the government of Kim Jong Un ""legally and morally"" responsible for their son's death.

""We put ourselves and our family through the ordeal of a lawsuit and public trial because we promised Otto that we will never rest until we have justice for him,"" they said in a statement. ""Today's thoughtful opinion by Chief Judge Howell is a significant step on our journey.""

The lawsuit, filed in April, describes in horrific detail the physical abuse Warmbier endured in North Korean custody, recounting how his parents were ""stunned to see his condition"" when they boarded a plane to see him upon arrival in the US

The 22-year-old was blind and deaf, his arms were curled and mangled and he was jerking violently and howling, completely unresponsive to his family's attempts to comfort him. His once straight teeth were misaligned, and he had an unexplained scar on his foot. An expert said the injuries suggested he'd been tortured with electric shock, and a neurologist later concluded that the college student suffered brain damage, probably from a loss of blood flow to the brain for five to 20 minutes.

North Korea has denied Warmbier was tortured and has said he contracted botulism, though medical experts said there was no evidence of that.

The complaint also said Warmbier was pressed to make a televised confession, then convicted of subversion after a short trial. He was denied communication with his family. In June 2017, his parents were informed he was in a coma and had been in that condition for one year.

Though foreign nations are generally immune from lawsuits in US courts, Howell cited several exceptions that she said allowed her to hold North Korea liable. Those include the fact that North Korea has been designated by the US as a sponsor of terrorism, that the Warmbiers are US citizens and that the actions of the North Korean government involved torture and hostage taking.

The penalty awarded to the Warmbiers and to Otto Warmbier's estate includes punitive damages as well as damages for economic losses, pain and suffering and medical expenses.

The lawsuit was brought on the Warmbiers' behalf by Richard Cullen, a prominent Virginia lawyer and former US attorney. He told The Associated Press that while ""nothing will ever bring Otto back to the Warmbiers or erase their memories of his horrid last 18 months,"" the judge's decision was ""very good news for his family and friends."""

A month back Saraswati Mandir Education Society, Mahim removed their signboard announcing Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) affiliation (proposed) school. One of parents got suspicious and applied a Right to Information (RTI). The reply revealed that the school didn't have CBSE board affiliation.

After removing the signboard from the main gate of the school, the school has conducted a meeting with the Parent Teacher Association. But not all parents are aware of the status about CBSE affiliation as the school has decided to inform about the same in January month next year.

One of the parents, said, ""The school represented themselves in front of child rights commission and also in Bombay high court as CBSE board affiliated school despite not getting any affiliation from the board which is illegal. We took admission for our children thinking its CBSE affiliated school and now school says they have not yet received affiliation. This amounts to cheating the parents.

Another parent of the school, said, ""We are in the dark about the affiliation of the school. After removing the signboard the school has still not clarified anything with all the parents. We have taken admission in school thinking the school is CBSE board and we are charged fees also accordingly.

He was 72. He is survived by his wife and a son.

His cremation has been deferred by a day to Wednesday as Tuesday is Christmas.

The leader had been ailing since November 2013 when he suffered a cerebral attack. He was also suffering from kidney ailment since 2015 and had been undergoing dialysis regularly.

Born on October 8, 1946 at Govindapur area in Burdwan district, Sen's father, Bhujangabhushan Sen was a teacher by profession at Raipur High School in the same district. Nirupam, a meritorious student, too completed his school from there and in 1961 joined college for his graduation in Science.

He joined the students' movement at that time and quickly became very popular owing to his skill as an orator. As a result of this, he won a membership in the highly regimented CPI(M) even when he was a student. His membership was proposed by CPI(M) leader Madan Ghosh and was seconded by Sushil Bhattacharya.

In 1966, he was elected as the district secretary of the students federation of Burdwan district. After completing his studies, he worked as a teacher for a brief period of time and then in 1968 he became the full-time party member.

Since then Sen rose steadily in the party hierarchy. When the then chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya stepped up on the industrialisation drive, Sen was the one who worked behind the scenes to bring in investment in Bengal, which, at that time had somewhat gained the reputation of being not so investor-friendly state.

One of the projects which were very close to his heart during his stint as the industry minister was the Tata Nano project. He initiated discussion with the Tatas in 2004, but even after the project was completed it had to be scrapped in 2008 and that, ironically was one of the pillars on which the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC built its ascent on to the power of West Bengal.

Another project during his term, a chemical hub by the Salims, an Indonesian group, at Nandigram led to a movement by the TMC which moved majority of the support away from the Left bringing an end to the end of a 34-year government.

Administrative officials during Sen's time swore by his simple lifestyle and said that unlike most communist leaders, he encouraged others opinions in any subject and was very careful about his choice of words whenever he spoke.

One of the biggest controversies in Sen's life had been the massacre at Sainbari in Burdwan district on March 17, 1970. It had been alleged that he had led a mob to the Sain family, where two family members - Pranab Kumar Sain and Malay Kumar Sain, and a private tutor Jitendranath Rai - were stabbed to death and their blood was mixed with the cooked rice lying there and forced into the mouth of one of the ladies of the family who was present there. Their fault: they were Congress supporters.

After TMC came to power in 2011, Mamata Banerjee put up an inquiry commission in 2012 under retired high court judge, Justice Arunabha Basu but it had not yet submitted its report.

He had contested Assembly elections three times in 2001, 2006 and 2011 from Burdwan South constituency. He was defeated only in 2011, to a TMC candidate.

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had succeeded Jyoti Basu as the Chief Minister of West Bengal but there was a good number of people within the party who believed that Sen would have made an equally good if not better CM.

Tomorrow being Christmas Day, his body has been kept at Peace Haven, a mortuary on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and on Wednesday his body would be taken to CITU and CPI(M) office for people to offer their last respect and then would be taken to his native village of Burdwan for cremation.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee posted a twitter message of condolence following Sen's death.

The unprovoked firing and shelling from across the border started in Keri, Lam, Pukharni and Peer Badaser of Noushera at around 9:30 am and continued intermittently for over five hours."

It's BSP (Bijli, Sadak and Pani) for a common man. In a city like Nagpur, it means Metro rail, cement roads, international schools and institutions like IIM, AIIMS and VNIT. Even for the Centre and state governments, the definition more or less remains the same.

Just 40km from the city, this definition, however, has gone for a toss. A visit to a couple of villages under Kuhi tehsil in Nagpur district, which have been affected by Gosikhurd dam, would shatter anything imagined under the name of development.

These remote villages, Sonarwahi and Pipri Munje, which lack even basic amenities, were partially submerged by the rising dam waters when the diarist visited them.

It all started when the aggrieved villagers, who had approached the high court with their grievances, bumped into the diarist. None believed them till they showed us actual photographs of how their everyday life is nothing short of a struggle.

Prodded by a colleague, we decided to visit ground zero. On reaching close to Sonarwahi, we were told to park our taxi near an Anganwadi, as road didn't exist beyond that point. The village was over 3km away from there and we had to walk through a marshy land. Thankfully, there was no rain, else we would have to wade through knee-deep water, something which the villagers are accustomed to.

On reaching the destination after a long trek, the situation seemed grimmer than we expected. About 16-odd families lived there under constant fear of submergence as the dam water had reached just half km from their huts and had already submerged their farms. With this they had lost their only source of income.

The kids weren't attending school for a year as the nearest Anganwadi is over 3km away. The power supply is erratic and available only in the night hours. Degree-holder youths work as farm labourers in nearby villages due to lack of jobs.

Pipri Munje was nothing short of a nightmare. We travelled on a small boat for about six kms, without any life jackets or safety gear. We waded through uneven surfaces, our boat got stuck in soil at some places while the water was very deep in other parts. At some places, top of big trees were at handshake distance, while at some places even the grass could be touched.

About 400 persons are unwilling to move to their rehabilitated place which lacked any facilities. Many of them were forced to buy boats after dam water turned their village into an island. The villagers somehow survive on crops grown on their partially submerged farms, and face problems like lack of water and erratic power supply. Most of the youths in both the villages weren't getting brides to marry them due to these issues.

Our tour was nothing short of an adventure. But the villagers there still live in dark ages and in constant fear of death. It's very unlikely the situation will change.

But they, too, had to turn back.

The two came as close as a little over a kilometre from the main shrine but proceeding further would have required the police to use force against a massive crowd of protesters and the consequences of such action were unpredictable.

Industries minister and senior CPM leader E P Jayarajan said on Monday that ""the protesters are behaving like Taliban militants"" but in the same breath said the government would not ""take any stand which will destroy the peace in Sabarimala"".

Bindu (42), from Koyilandy in Kozhikode district, who works as guest faculty at the School of Legal Studies, Thalassery, under Kannur University, and Kanakadurga (44), a civil supplies employee from Angadipuram in Malappuram, reached Pamba by 3.30 am and started trekking uphill.

The police were unaware of their plan till they reached Pamba. Sources said the pilgrims didn't wait for police clearance and began the trek by themselves and the police had no option but to escort them. As the trekking path was not crowded at the time, they managed to reach Appachimedu where a group of devotees blocked them. More police personnel reached the spot and removed these protesters.

But as news spread and hundreds of protesters gathered, it became impossible for the police to take the two women beyond Marakoottam. The protesters hovered menacingly while the police considered the options. The standoff continued for about an hour. The tension was rising and it was clear that the police couldn't force their way through unless they resorted to force. Kanakadurga said she was feeling faint but Bindu insisted on continuing to the temple a little more than a kilometre away. ""I am here to uphold constitutional values. There is the Supreme Court ruling allowing us to have darshan. Please make arrangements for that,"" she told the reporters accompanying them.

The police special officer in charge of Sannidhanam, G Jayadev, urged the women to go back as the situation was becoming volatile. Bindu remained adamant but eventually the police convinced her to turn back. The two women were escorted back to Pamba, given first aid at a hospital, and then taken to Kottayam Medical College.

The opposition Congress attacked the Left government, saying it was playing a ""double game"". ""What was witnessed in Sabarimala on Sunday and Monday is a drama, which is an insult to Kerala, the police and the people of the state,"" opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said.

A case has been registered against 150 people for rioting and causing obstruction, police said. On Monday, some BJP workers raised slogans at Thiruvananthapuram railway station against three women activists of ""Manithi"" who had tried to reach Sabarimala on Sunday and were returning to Tamil Nadu this afternoon.

Since the Supreme Court verdict on September 28, no woman in the 10-50 years age group (traditionally barred from entering the shrine) has been able to worship Ayyappa at Sabarimala. The two-month-long Sabarimala pilgrimage season began on November 16 and the first phase will end on Thursday."

Vibrant and despairing, diverse and parochial, hyper-traditional and quick to change, rural India is more than the sum of its contradictions

Let There Be Light

Governments are generally bigger on promises than on delivery. On rural electrification, though, PM Narendra Modi has been keen to trumpet his achievements. Modi promised that 18,452 villages that were yet to be 'electrified', out of India's 600,000 villages, would be connected to the grid in 1,000 days. On April 28 this year, he announced that the target had been achieved. Leisang, in Manipur, was the last place in the country to officially receive electricity, ""a historic day in the development journey of India"", as the prime minister tweeted. But there appears to be a difference between being 'electrified' and actually having access to electricity. Recent studies by academics show that power supply and billing in rural areas are significant hurdles, so while households are connected, are they necessarily availing the benefits of having electricity? As the photograph suggests, solar-generated power is crucial to India's commitment to clean energy. Despite solar power being cheaper than its coal-generated equivalent, and despite the rapid increase in India's solar capacity, it is still too small-scale to meet demand.

Battle for Ambedkar

Dr B.R. Ambedkar has always been a celebrated figure, the country's first law minister and architect of the Constitution. But appreciation of his legacy has become a curiously political enterprise of late. Dalits are increasingly an important aspect of the BJP's political calculations, and part of the party's outreach has been for the prime minister to talk up his personal veneration for Ambedkar. Opening a memorial for Ambedkar in April, Narendra Modi claimed that other governments (read Congress-led ones) had paid lip service to Ambedkar while doing nothing to shore up his legacy. BJP leaders, including the likes of party president Amit Shah, have made it a point to be photographed showing obeisance to Ambedkar, but is it helping the party retain the votes it won so comprehensively in 2014? Signs, particularly in the recent assembly polls in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, are not encouraging, with SC votes in the rural heartlands swinging comprehensively towards the Congress.

Fragile Threads

India's traditional textiles have been treasured by people across the globe for centuries. They brought traders and invaders to our shores and may have spun the competitive engines of the industrial revolution which would later all but vanquish them. Today, powerlooms provide some 70 per cent of all Indian fabrics. Yet an astonishing diversity of handloom and handicraft fabrics survives in the Indian countryside, most of it produced by women weavers and embroiderers. While the state has played an important role in preserving these livelihoods-for example, by winning GI or Geographical Indication certification for the phulkari embroidery of Punjab-government policies can also endanger this fragile sector. The roughshod implementation of new GST rules proved a particular threat to the delicate economy of handloom weavers in small towns and villages.

Transports of Delight

The bail gaadi or bullock cart was perhaps the most persistent emblem of rural India-for a couple of thousand years. In the 20th century, the infernal combustion and horsepower of motorised transport made steady inroads into that romantic image. It's a transformation that has moved so fast that younger generations will probably view this image of a 'Tempo' taxi (right) in rural UP with nostalgia. The bhat-suwar, as it is fondly remembered in North India, along with its fellow travellers like the hand-made 'Marutas' of UP or 'vans' of Bengal, is now giving way to new models such as the chhota haathi (the Tata Ace), the Mahindra Jeeto or the Ashok Leyland Dost, as major corporations rediscover rural markets. Tata, for example, saw its rural sales expand by 38 per cent this year-almost twice its growth in urban markets.

Cock-fighting, popular around the country, is just as cruel, and arguably even more vicious than the bull-taming exercise, jallikattu. Both 'pastimes' are banned by the courts. But advocates have successfully argued that on some occasions, particularly on temple premises, cockfights ""held in the traditional manner"" should be permitted. The Hyderabad High Court, however, banned cockfights even during the Sankranti harvest festival in January, an order the SC upheld and led to the arrest of roosters. Yes, roosters.

Cries Over Spilled Milk

LAND OF MILK AND...Dairy farmers at a street protest in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. (Photo: Raju Sanadi)

Farmer anger has been a major story of recent years. And it's still building. Protests have been numerous and vociferous, with thousands marching through New Delhi just last month. Many analysts argue that agrarian distress contributed substantially to the BJP's damaging defeats in the five recent assembly elections. In the past two summers, farmers across the country threw their milk onto the streets in protest at falling prices. Farmers have been demanding greater subsidies to prop up their increasingly meagre earnings. Before milk was being thrown in the streets, it was vegetables and sugarcane. Data from the National Crime Records Bureau show an eight-fold increase in farmer protests between 2014 and 2016. Solutions beyond loan waivers and fiddling with minimum support prices are thin on the ground. Climate change and dwindling groundwater supplies mean the future holds little promise of a 'technological fix'. With a looming general election, politicians are likely to continue to offer financial quick fixes. But a serious conversation about an agrarian crisis that is claiming the lives of thousands of farmers each year is long overdue.

Striking Oil

Little used to happen in Barmer, a dusty, yawning stretch of Rajasthan desert- one of the country's biggest parliamentary constituencies in terms of area- barring the odd cattle fair. In 2004, though, over three billion barrels worth of oil was discovered to be lying under the sands, causing a sudden surge in excitement, and demand for such things as upmarket hotels and luxury cars. In October this year, a subsidiary of Vedanta Resources, the mining company, agreed to a 10-year extension of its contract to produce oil from the Mangala area. Since 2013, Pachpadra, another village in Barmer, has been waiting for a refinery and the promise of wealth and jobs. In July, eight people were arrested for conspiring to steal 50 million barrels of crude oil from the Barmer fields and sell it on for Rs 25 per barrel. Nice work if you can get it?

In the Name of the Cow

RED MEAT: A lull in the fatal lynching of Alimuddin Ansari in Ramgarh, Jharkhand, June 2017. (Photo: Somnath Sen)

Conservative estimates suggest that some 30 people have now been killed by 'gau rakshaks' since 2014, the attackers apparently emboldened by government moves to penalise cow slaughter. Among those lynched was Alimuddin Ansari in Jharkhand last year. Eleven men were sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime by a fast-track court in March. Out on bail, the men were warmly received by their local MP, a Union minister, at his official residence. Earlier this month, in Bulandshahr, an alleged case of cow slaughter led to riots in which a police inspector was shot in the head. As a result of the new wave of 'cow protection', many farmers, unable to feed cows that no longer give milk, have turned their animals loose. Government shelters, such as the one in the picture in Madhya Pradesh, are filled to capacity.

Healthcare on the Hoof

One of the more irritating cliches about India is that it is the land of jugaad, a land where everyone can fashion a bandage out of rags to staunch the bleeding, if only temporarily. And then along comes a picture like this and you have to acknowledge the cliches exist for a reason. For some years now, the government has made certain basic diagnostic tests free of charge. Drugs and diagnostic tests make up as much as 70 per cent of the costs that push millions of people below the poverty line in India each year. To get tests done, people have to go to their nearest clinics, though 'nearest' is a relative term in rural India. Vans were perhaps what they had in mind. But, for these patients in a village in the Sawai Madhopur district of Rajasthan, a camel will do just as well.

The Maggi Index

India has had over two decades of solid economic growth. Disposable incomes have been rising, if faster in some places and for some people than others. And people all over the country, not just in the metropolitan centres, have access to and want a part of the consumer lifestyle. The scene in this photograph is an example of the spread of 'cityfied' lifestyles. The phenomenal popularity of Maggi in India has always been something of an oddity. The nutrition may be questionable, but Maggi became an urban staple. And perhaps, as a sign of the inexorable march of urbanisation and urban habits, a rural one too.

Business of Beauty

TRADE SECRETS: Beautician Puneeta on a home visit to a client in Malikpur village near Sonepat, Haryana. (Photo: Chandradeep Kumar)

Economic growth may be robust, but jobs remain hard to come by. The government has suggested that self-employment might be the way of the future. This is, of course, a familiar experience for many Indians, particularly those who live in rural India. The great majority of Indians, urban and rural, work in the casual economy. The young beautician pictured here goes door to door, providing a valued service. The salon may be makeshift but the customer isn't complaining. And even the buffaloes seem to approve.

Road to Normalcy?

In April, the now ex-chief minister of Chhattisgarh boasted that the building of roads in the state had progressed to the extent that in ""districts like Bastar and Dantewada you can now go anywhere"". Later that same month, Maoist guerrillas killed 25 CRPF men guarding the highway linking Dantewada to the Sukma district. An extensive government plan is in place to connect some of India's most remote rural areas by road, to enable these villages to participate in countrywide development. Many of these villages are in Chhattisgarh, in the 'Red Corridor' plagued by running battles between the Maoists and security forces.

Reading, Writing and Terrible arithmetic

India's record in education is a deceptive image. Despite the gains made in achieving benchmarks of universal enrolment and better gender parity in primary education in the early 2000s, recent studies have revealed that the country is failing in secondary education. The ASER study in 2017 found that 57 per cent of 14- to 18-year-olds can't solve basic division problems and a government survey in 2014 concluded that only 16 per cent of Class X students could correctly answer more than half the mathematics questions put to them. Rural students from disadvantaged communities risk higher dropout rates and poorer learning. It doesn't help that government expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP fell from 3.1 per cent in 2012-13 to 2.6 per cent in 2016-17.

The Ghost Villages

While migration from the countryside to the cities is an ancient and universal story, it has reached stark proportions in some parts of the country. In the foothills of Uttarakhand, in particular, the phenomenon has begun to spook even the state government, which in 2017 appointed a 'Migration Commission' to look into the proliferation of bhootiya or 'ghost' villages. The commission found that some 119,000 people had abandoned their homes and agriculture, leaving some 700 villages deserted. The village pictured here, once one of the wealthiest settlements in Kumaon, has been reduced to ruins by the loss of border trade and migration to towns better integrated into the economic mainstream."

Interestingly, Telangana's Varshith is the only one from south India to get this privilege along with nine others selected from a pool of 1,800-odd kids across four metro cities in the country.

""Even as I chase the dream of playing a Grand Slam one day, this one should be truly memorable,"" he says. ""After seeing the advertisement, I approached my mentor, Shiva sir (ITF official J. Shiva Kumar Reddy) and he encouraged me to try my luck,"" he adds.

The path was not easy. Varshith had to be trained in techniques, speed, endurance, agility, accuracy and court awareness which are the traits of ball kids.

He underwent training at Vasishta Tennis Academy here in the company of coach Dinesh. ""I am fortunate to have Shiva sir as my mentor for he knows the rules and regulations of tennis tournaments having officiated in major events across the world,"" Varshith says.

The Delhi audition, the teenager says, was the toughest as more than 600 kids participated in it. Of them, only 25 were shortlisted for the final round of trials. ""It was a five-drill test in the first round of trial i.e., servicing technique for ball kid, on-court agility speed test time trial, short sprint time trial, viva voce with videography, vocabulary and confidence test, questions about tennis knowledge, rolling the ball with speed and consistency etc.,"" says the young talent ranked No.3 in the State and 60th in India in the under-14 category."

Fab@40

Last November, when Prithvi Theatre turned 40, it ensured there is enough drama as part of the birthday celebrations. The theatre -- built in Mumbai's Janki Kutir by Jennifer Kendal and Shashi Kapoor in memory of Prithviraj Kapoor -- for the last four decades has been the backbone of Mumbai's theatre culture by consistently trying to build an audience as well as nurturing talents. The celebrations kicked off at Mumbai's Royal Opera House on November 3 with the revival of thespian Prithviraj Kapoor's play Deewar opening the theatre's annual festival. Sunil Shanbag reimagined Deewar, which had originally premiered in 1945 at the Opera House and talks about divisive politics. Another highlight of the festival was Ratna Pathak Shah-directed The Truth.

Women First

The voices of women resounded through plays being staged in various languages. Hojang Taret, a Manipuri play, takes off from a Greek myth, while The Caucasian Chalk Circle revolves around a peasant who is forced to flee after a revolt. Item (pictured), which won Best Play at META, focussed on B-grade Hindi cinema through the life of an actress. Menghaobi, which premiered in Mumbai, questions the perspectives of who is included in the

nation called India.

Foreign Spectacles

This year, Cirque du Soleil, a company that has close to 30 productions showing across the world, broke its tradition of opening its shows in Montreal, where it is headquartered and premiered Bazzar (pictured) in Mumbai. With a heady mix of songs, dance and acrobatics, the extravagant production follows the changing relationship between a clown, who is the maestro at a circus, and his disciple, a floating woman. The 30-artiste troupe had a roster of 64 shows of Bazzar across Mumbai and Delhi. Other lavish productions, such as Disney's Aladdin: The Musical and Geronimo Stilton played out in Mumbai and Delhi to an audience of thousands, not all of them children.

This Land of Mine

The Best Play for the Mahindra Excellence of Theatre Awards this year went to India Integrated (pictured). Actually, the name of the play was Nona. The title means ""lie"" in Malayalam, the language of the play, and the narrative focusses on a man who makes a map of India in a courtyard and lets his idea of nationalism destroy the social fabric of the village. Jino Joseph, who works with rural labourers and small traders in Kerala, also picked up the Best Director award. The festival, which showcases some of the best new productions, also included Abhishek Majumdar's Muktidham. Around Independence Day, Jan Natya Manch in Delhi held shows of a play called Tathagat, where a sculptor is under trial for making a statue of Buddha with black stone and not white marble. As the debate rages about the colour of god, the play throws up questions about caste, nationalism and the power of a king and

his kingdom.

Olympic Scale

The National School of Drama in Delhi pulled out all the stops in hosting the eighth Theatre Olympics in India. The 51-day event, which began on February 17, featured 450 shows, 600 ambiance performances and 250 youth forum productions from 30 countries in 17 cities. The first play was Shikhandi: The Story of the In-Betweens. Among the few good foreign productions was Encore, directed by Theodoros Terzopoulos. Some of the top names of Indian theatre stayed away from the festival, including Sunil Shanbag and Deepan Sivaraman.

In the very first years of his life, Asif Ali Haider inherited theatre. In a faded memory, he is toddling backstage while the air is full of the Spartas' cry for freedom in Spartacus and the odour of cheap make-up. ""The make-up, that smell. In those days, there used to be a make-up mask; it was an inexpensive tube for theatre makeup. That smell, even today, works as a kick for me. If I go to backstage and get a whiff of that smell, I feel the need to get on stage immediately and do something,"" says Haider.

At National School of Drama (NSD), where he studied and, now, teaches, the lawns are awash in sunshine on the bitterly cold December afternoon. Ignoring the benches, Haider plonks himself on the grass. Just a few days ago, he had watched his adapted script of Berolt Brecht's Turandot enacted at the NSD's hall, Abhimanch. The plot revolves around a Chinese emperor who is manipulating the cotton market, his dissatisfied subjects and a revolutionary rising in the background. The emperor invites the intellectuals or, as Brecht called them, the ""tui"", to court to find solutions to the cotton crisis. The best tui will win the hand of the princess Turandot; the rest would lose their heads.

The performances by the NSD students were middling and the play needed to be tightened, but Haider managed to capture Brecht's balance of uproarious comedy and scathing satire. He also made the story resound with contemporary events, especially the toppling of institutions and attack on intellectuals. In one scene, a student stands before the head of his teacher mounted on a spike and says, ""You were a master of grammar. Why did you talk in court about things you do not specialise in?""

Advertising

Haider laughs as he draws parallels with real life. ""The problem with intellectuals is that we want to talk about a lot of things. That's why we become miserable and fail,"" he says, adding that he had not read Turandot, one of Brecht's unfinished plays and less known, until Robin Das, who directed this production, called him. ""The moment I saw his call, I tried to avoid because I knew he will want to make me write something and I was busy,"" he says. Das had been his teacher and, eventually, Haider took on Turandot.

This has been a pattern in Haider's career that turned him towards playwriting. Haider has become the go-to person for playwriting by directors. When he was in second year, until which he had not written a thing, another Brecht play, The Good Woman of Setzuan was going to be staged and the designated playwright couldn't deliver the script as his mother was ill. ""Somehow, everybody in my class felt that I was the person to adapt the play for us to perform,"" he says. He did. Directed by Bansi Kaul, the play was titled Door Gaon ki Bhali Aurat and included folk art forms from Dang district of Gujarat. When he was at the NSD Repertory, Haider was playing the lead in a play to be devised from the novel Anamdas ka Pota by Hazari Prasad Dwivedi. The plan to devise the script was't working so Das, who was directing it, called upon Haider to adapt the novel. ""It was a complex piece of work. The novel dealt with Indian philosophy, among others, there were multiple characters, locations and meta narratives. Internet wasn't commonly used so I would have t sit in the library for hours reading up on Vedanta and other thoughts,"" he recalls. The script was a resounding success, especially among Hindi writers. ""For the first time I thought, 'Maybe, I can write,'"" he says.His grandfather used to be a poet and his childhood reading had a high literary content, such as the works of Tagore and Premchand. ""Even the comics I was given had a literary angle to it,"" he says.

During the past decade, there has been a lack of new Hindi writing for theatre. Ashgar Wajahat was among the few still active when Haider started out as a playwright but stalwarts such as Bhisham Sayni had passed away and Surendra Verma was tilting towards novels. ""Maybe that's why I began to be called upon much more and became prominent before my time,"" says Haider In the last decade, he has written 30 plays, among them

What drives his writing? ""Irritation,"" he answers, ""If I am not irritated, I cannot write."" The Gujarat riots fuelled his play, Saaye Humsaaye, Turandot, in a scene that was edited out of the performance, has an ironmonger trying to hoard books and documents as a means of preserving knowledge for the future generations. A play he is writing dwells with a question of bonging and ownership. ""Who does the and belong to? Who owns a home or a country?"" asks Haider. The central protagonist of this play is an elephant, an animal present in a variety of traditions in India.

Haider has appeared on stage, famously as Jawharlal Nehru in Azad Maulana, and directed plays for the NSD students. But, his writings are better known. ""When I started writing, a teacher of one had said, 'Be careful that you don't lose your acting,'"" says Haider. The playwright can see the irony in that."

It was the summer of 2007, a landmark year for Bengal's political history as many would later look back and say, and the Marxist government of the day had well and truly started implementing its industrial reforms policy by inviting the Tatas to set up their small car factory in Singur.

Sen was perceived to have masterminded that reforms drive as the number two man in Buddhadeb Bhattacherjee cabinet and as the chief minister's most trusted lieutenant in the CPI(M)-led Left Front government. For a party that had industry way down in its priority list when it assumed power in the state back in 1977, so much so that the department was only earmarked for Front ally Forward Bloc with Kanailal Bhattacharya as minister, these were exciting times for the CPI(M).

For the first time in almost three decades, Sen, a CPI(M) heavyweight from Burdwan district, had taken up the mantle for industry and industrial reconstruction in 2001 and was on the verge of taking the next big leap of faith in lines with Jyoti Basu's new industrial policy of the mid-90s: government acquisition of farmland for private sector industry. It was, doubtless, a bold move for a government which was voted back to power with an overwhelming majority in 2006 for its record seventh consecutive term.

The fact that move later turned out to be the nemesis for the longest-standing government of Independent India and catapulted Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress to power is, needless to say, history.

It was in this context that Sen had agreed to sit for a crucial interview. A dark-complexioned Sen was seated opposite me in his quintessential milky white, half-sleeve shirt when my cameraman was trying to get the lights right. Acknowledging the difficulty of getting the proper exposure of the two contrasting shades, Sen then went on to divulge his interest in photography, albeit in his typical low-key demeanour. It surely was an interesting note to start an interview where focus would lay on politics, policies and number crunching.

Sen's mild-mannered yet firm attitude at work is recalled by his comrades and political opponents alike. Son of a school teacher, he started off following his father's footsteps before becoming a party whole-timer in 1968. Twenty-one years later, in 1989, Sen became the CPI(M)'s district president of Burdwan in central Bengal, a region where the Congress continued to wield considerable influence. And by the time he was offered the charge of Bengal's Industry, Public Undertakings and Industrial Reconstruction, Planning and Development departments in 2001, Sen was already a member of his party's highest decision-making body -- the Central Committee.

At that time, many believed that the Bhattacharjee-Sen duo, who reflected the majority opinion of the CPI(M)'s so-called Bengal Brigade on how to tackle the crisis generated on account of the state's stunted growth figures and unemployment-related angst, exercised their growing influence within the party to fast track industrialisation in the state. Arguably the most successful economic reform in Bengal achieved by the Left, the Land Reforms programme, was already showing signs of backfire because fragmented landholding was failing to provide for the enhanced aspirations of the peasantry.

Sen's initial efforts gave dividends. The IT sector received boost. Investments started trickling in the manufacturing sector. The small and medium industries started looking up. Restructuring the state's power sector was successfully concluded. And divestment of loss-making public sector units, including the iconic Great Eastern Hotel in Kolkata, could be carried out without major hurdles from trade unions. But then, Singur and Nandigram happened.

Much to the chagrin of some senior comrades in the CPI(M), the perception was that the Bhattacharjee-Sen duo steamrolled the industrial reforms process without considering the pulse of the grassroots. Some, during later introspection, even called it ""arrogance"" of power. But Sen was always sure about what he was doing. He never regretted a single move he made, some of which had allegedly changed the political fortunes of his party.

Singur and Nandigram weren't the only places which singed Sen's political career. He was forever blamed by his political opponents for having led the massacre on the Sain family residence in Burdwan in March 1970 where two brothers of the family and an unrelated person were brutally murdered and the eyes of a third brother gouged out allegedly by CPI(M) workers for supporting the Congress. Sen was never found guilty by court and his party cried hoarse at ""Congress conspiracy"" for involving him in the case to exact political vendetta.

But these controversies notwithstanding, Sen would be remembered for his grit to try and exorcise the political past of Bengal, which rendered it from being the most industrially advanced state of the country at the time of Independence to one which began witnessing record brain drain a few decades later. He struggled to achieve that goal as much within his party as outside of it. Whether his ""right ideas"" could have been implemented better is another debate. But few question his vision of Bengal where fulfilment of youth aspiration acquired centre stage.

Sen used his oratory skills to keep voicing his views within and outside his party, even after he was voted out of power in 2011, lock stock and barrel until a cerebral stroke in 2013 left him partially paralysed and confined him to a wheelchair. His quiet exit from the party Politburo two years later signified he had given up.

But not before he gave it his best shot... in his firm, yet mild-mannered demeanour."

The Modi-led government started the Swadhar Greh scheme for homeless women in 2015. The Ministry of Women and Child Development released funds to the tune of nearly Rs 200 crore to 559 shelter homes. What is all that money meant to do?

The funds are supposed to be used to house homeless women in need of shelter, and to provide skills training so that they can look for work and become financially independent. They are supposed to shelter women between the age group of 18-60 years.

But the National Commission For Women (NCW) submitted a report to the ministry in December revealing the 'poor and deplorable' condition in 25 out of 26 homes in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal.

According to the Chairperson of NCW, Rekha Sharma, the licences of the NGO running these homes should be cancelled immediately.

""They (Ministry for Women and Children) have a mechanism to check on shelter homes immediately. If we (Central government) are providing money to the shelter homes, then it should go into the right hands, it shouldn't be misused. Before giving out the next budgets, a proper check should be carried out on each and every NGO that is running a shelter house. Or else their licences should be cancelled, or we should invite new NGOs.""Rekha Sharma, Chairperson, National Commission for Women

The government is yet to take any action based on the report.

Major Findings

Some of the major findings of the NCW mentioned inadequate facilities and unclean, even dangerous conditions in the shelter homes: ""Unkempt mentally ill-women with no medical aid,"" ""dirty and unhygienic kitchens,"" ""cramped rooms, no beds or mattresses to sleep on"".

The report says some women complained of being forced to live in the shelter home rather than just stay to gain skills, while others detailed accounts of physical torture and a lack of counselling facilities. Some NGOs were even running these government shelters as hostels, illegally charging these destitute women fees for their stay.

The NCW has made strong recommendations to the Ministry of Women and Child Development to try and address these problems. They include measures like only employing women to run the homes, ensuring these homes aren't located in isolated, remote areas, and insisting that proper records of all these homes are maintained across the country.

Jayaprakash Institute of Social ChangeWhen the women were questioned, they informed the NCW Committee that the NGO workers go out and solicit donations of food and clothes for the women staying there. These shelter homes are receiving crores in funding from the Central government, and are not supposed to fund care of the women through begging for donations.Many women also complained that they are subjected to physical torture by the counselor of the Swadhar Greh.The Committee found that seven of the women were intellectually disabled, and observed that this Swadhar Greh was run like a 'congested prison'.The women were not receiving proper medical care.

Amid the row, many wonder, with the non-implementation of the previous act, does creating a new draft make sense?

Jameela and Afzal were still dreamy teenagers when they had their coup de foudre (love at first sight) moment. One mutual friend describes the lovebirds as ""rebels"", who wanted to 'throw caution to the wind'. But while that mindset appeared a far-fetched 'quixotic outlook', their strong emotional relationship soon shocked everyone.

They were yet to write their class 10 papers when they decided to marry.

As expected, the decision was firmly opposed by their families. But they were unyielding. Soon, the fresh-faced teenagers showed up in a court. They met a lawyer and told them, much to his disbelief: ""We want to go for court marriage.""

The lawyer could make out from their faces that both were too young for marriage. ""I tried to counsel them and suggested them to rethink about their decision, but as they say love is blind,"" says the lawyer, sitting in his cubicle in Srinagar's Lower Court. ""They were stubborn to change their decision.""

To dodge the eager-to-get-married juveniles, the lawyers asked them to get their certificates and prove their age. To which, the lawyer says, they replied that they've no legal document. ""Get the documents first,"" he told them. ""Otherwise, it won't happen.""

The lawyer says that he knew they had documents because both were studying in the same school and the original documents would prove that they were juveniles.

""I thought that was it and that they wouldn't come back, but I was wrong,"" the lawyer smiles over reminiscence in his office space.

Both of them came back after a few days, with Aadhar cards as age proof. Jameela, the lawyer says, was too excited. ""She put up a forthright face and vowed in an unwavering voice: 'Marungi bhi toh issi ke sath, Jiyun gi bhi toh issi ke saath' (I'll live and die only with him [Afzal].)

While the lawyer doesn't have any idea about the young couple right now, but he laments the prevailing law and order system in the state, where a juvenile could easily get an Aadhar card with fake age.

And once documents are being procured illegally, the legal practitioner says, the system is forced to accept them as valid proof.

Since the implementation of the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) in 2013, the state of Jammu and Kashmir is the only state that could not secure any funds for the scheme for the first six years.

In August 2014, Indian Union Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi informed Rajya Sabha that no proposal had been received from Jammu and Kashmir for the release of grants under the ICPS in the last six years.

According to a report by the ministry, from 2009 to December 2016, Rs 2,141.50 crore funds have been sanctioned to 38 states and union territories under the ICPS. Also under the scheme, the grants for the children were enhanced from Rs 750 to Rs 2,000 per child per month.

Given its paltry response, Jammu and Kashmir received Rs.1.56 crore during 2015 and 2016, the lowest fund granted to any state.

These figures paint the grim picture of the Juvenile Justice system of the state. With the result, the child protection officers are nowhere on the ground to monitor cases that need attention.

Also, by calling for the setting up of Juvenile Justice Boards headed by a Magistrate, the Juvenile Justice Act provides a detailed roadmap for the protection and rights of vulnerable children.

""I get upset at times by witnessing such cases where we often see an unhappy ending because the Juvenile Justice system that is created to take care of the children is nowhere in the field,"" the lawyer says.

The Juvenile Justice Act was first passed in 1986 across India and was later amended in 2000 and 2006. In 2013, the amended Jammu and Kashmir Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children), was launched in line with the Central Act.

The Act includes the creation of observation homes and special homes in each district and mentions that any apprehension of a juvenile in the conflict of law should be produced before the juvenile justice board within a period of twenty-four hours.

Advocate Jahangir, who works as an independent lawyer in district Islamabad, says that juveniles are the worst victims and being in conflict zones adds to their miseries. ""The lack of implementation of the act makes juveniles suffer and exposes them to more violence at the hands of police,"" he says.

The Act explains Juvenile as any children who are in need of shelter, are begging, are involved in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substance. Also, the Act takes care of every detail that is sensitive when dealing with Juveniles and also ensures that if a Juvenile is booked under non-bailable offence, he should in no circumstance be sent to a lock-up or jail.

But in the case of Aamir, the juvenile who landed in police lockup over his street dissent in 2016, these norms never proved to be of any relief. Today, after multiple stints in jails where he shared space with some senior resistance activists, the minor is seen as an ""outcast"".

He first came to public notice when his video from a police lockup, where he is shown roped with two other boys went viral on social media. The minor Aamir can be seen shouting ""Bharat mata ki jai!"" slogans on insistence of the livid paramilitary men. In case he fumbles, he receives physical abuse in the form of punches and blows.

""Today, Aamir is no longer that confident boy we once knew,"" says Showkat, who lives in Aamir's neighbourhood. ""It's not about him alone. There are many like him who used to be at the forefront of the protests in old city, but after landing in prisons, many of them come out as changed persons. They are young and impressionable and once they are put through any ordeal, they seem to get affected.""

As a person, Aamir is indifferent and a reluctant schoolboy. While his neighnbours and friends blame the prison-time for his transformation, the unimplemented Juvenile Justice Act clearly emphasises on the setting up of a special Juvenile police units and treatment of reports has to keep confidential. The Act even says that a police officer should be in plainclothes when dealing with a juvenile and he should not be handcuffed.

But the irony is that all this remains on paper and nothing much has been done on the ground. No proper district courts and juvenile centre were formed.

Like Aamir, Ahmad landed in a police lockup as a juvenile. Police claimed to have recovered weapons from his custody. He was sent to the only juvenile home in the valley at Harwan.

After the investigation, police claimed: ""Ahmad was taught about jihad at the madrassa which motivated him to take this extreme step."" At a very young age, Ahmad who lives in Budgam was sent to a seminary in Lucknow.

Being a minor, he was later released and charges against him were withdrawn. Ahmad was in need of proper counselling and guidance but the juvenile home and the lack of implementation of the Act failed to provide him anything. The only benefit that the Act had on him was that he was dealt with 'softly' and given a chance to reframe his life.

While the state has failed to implement the old Juvenile Act, Governor Satya Pal Malik is all set to bring in the new Act.

The new draft has two major changes; one is to bring down the age limit, implying that anyone below the age of 16 is a juvenile.

Chairman, Selection-cum-Oversight Committee, Justice (retd.) Hasnain Masoodi, says that Juvenile Justice Advisory Committee (JJAC) is an ""evolving concept"". Incidents like Nirbhaya rape case in Delhi and gang-rape of a minor in Kathua have pushed the authorities to make changes with regard to the age of criminals, he says: ""In Nirbaya's case, the Juvenile was a few weeks away from turning 18 but he was considered 18 and punished.""

The other addition in the new draft, is adoption and fostering.

The draft states that the child should be declared legally free for adoption by the set committee. A child line service and specialized adoption agency have also been mentioned in the draft.

Advocate Jahangir also stresses on the fact that delay in the establishment of special courts and homes at the district level is creating a psychological impact on juveniles as 'they are logged and present in the same court as adults.'

""Lack of proper counselling sessions and mishandling by police like detaining a juvenile despite knowing the fact also make them volatile and vulnerable,"" the advocate says.

While other states have made a lot of progress over the years, Jammu and Kashmir hasn't achieved much on the foster front. The adoption law in the state works as per Shariah as of now.

According to the new draft, no child regarded as 'adoptable' will be given for long-term foster.

Heinous offences have also been included in which the minimum punishment will be given as per Ranbir Penal Code, but the term heinous remains ambiguous.

""We divide juveniles into 2 groups,"" continues justice Masoodi, while defining the term heinous crimes, ""Below 16 and between the age of 16-18 years."" Likewise, he says, offences are divided into heinous offences and other offences. ""Heinous offences are punishable with a sentence of more than 7 years.""

The Act also emphasises on sponsorship which will be provided by the government at different levels, like individual, group or community level. The criteria for the sponsorship includes a mother, who's a widow, divorcee or abandoned by her family.

""But the special status of the state does not allow the implementation of such laws in the state,"" says advocate Jahangir.

However, based on his extensive south Kashmir experience, Jahangir feels that the state of juveniles is pathetic in the state. And instead of bringing in a new law which will take another 5-6 years in implementation, he says, it's necessary that ""we focus on the present Juvenile Justice Act and bring some relief to the victims"".

But from the developments and lessons learnt since 2013, argues Justice Masoodi, the Act needed to be changed.

""After Nirbhaya, the juveniles at an advanced age from 16-18 years cannot be treated at par with the juveniles below the age of 16 years. At least, not when it comes to heinous crimes,"" he says. ""When it comes to the juveniles of age 16, we don't intend on treating them like adults. But we don't intend to treat them like minors also. They will be tried in special courts called the court of sessions.""

In reference to the difference in crimes committed in the conflict-ridden valley and various states in India and vulnerability of minors to be jailed for pelting stones, Justice Masoodi says that juvenile offenders cannot be overlooked.

""There is always an element of misuse in any Act but you have to look at the larger good,"" he says.

But it's still a draft, he stresses, and the committee is looking at what should be in the draft and what not.

""Child rights activities and academicians are being taken on board for the new draft.""

Also in the last meeting, he says, the age categorization was disagreed upon and even the new adoption chapter has also been debated upon and it has been decided that as of now only 'within state adoption' will take place.

""The new draft will undergo many more brain storming sessions till we reach to a point where this draft becomes perfect and in the best interest of the Juveniles,"" he says.

Intermediary Rules Made in 2011 Were 'Vague'

These rules are called the Intermediary Rules, 2011 made under the Information Technology Act, 2000 that provide immunity for online platforms, ISPs -- big, large, and tiny -- for the content which is transmitted and published by end users.

This allows these conduits of information to facilitate a core function of free expression and prevents them from throttling content or overbroad censorship which is termed as a, ""chilling effect"".

In return, they have to comply with legal requests for takedown of content and providing information on users - basically comply with the law. This was a principle recognised in Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (as amended in 2008).

But principal legislations such as Section 79 leave the details to subordinate rules. This is exactly what are the Intermediary Rules, 2011 which were made after public consultation around March, 2011. There was dispute on how this consultation was carried out, but still the draft rules were published online and comments were invited by the Ministry of Electronics and IT.

However, these rules were unclear and vague. For instance, they did not clearly state what was, ""actual knowledge"", and due to this in the Shreya Singhal case (yes, the Section 66A one), the Supreme Court said, that, ""actual knowledge"" came only when these platforms received a legal notice from the police or a court, not from private parties. So what is being changed? And what is at stake?

5 Top Concerns1. On Process:

First let us start with how these draft rules are being made. This is a serious development and is eerily reminiscent of the calls for pre-censorship made for, ""pre-censorship"" in December, 2011.

As reported by the Indian Express the process is closed, being held between officials of the Ministry of Electronics and IT and a handful of large social media and messaging companies who have been allowed to give comments by 7 January.

But the changes, as we go on to explain, will impact users like you and me. It will impact our right to privacy and freedom of speech and expression. Why is the public being kept out?

2. Breaking Encryption:

Draft rule, 3(5) introduces the requirement of traceability which would break end-to-end encryption.

Many platforms (Whatsapp, Signal, Telegram and even other platforms) retain minimal user data for electronic information exchange and also deploy end-to-end encryption to provide reliability, security and privacy to users. These are used by millions of Indians to prevent identity theft, code injection attacks. Encryption becomes more important as for most of us, our lives now involves personal data. Without thought or involving technical experts in an open consultative process, without any data protection law or surveillance reform, this is being tinkered with by introducing the requirement of, ""traceability"". This has important consequences for everyday users of online services and should also be seen in the context of the MHA notification which activates the 2009 rules with the power to direct, ""decryption"". We do not have any proper parliamentary oversight or judicial check on surveillance and the latest draft rules if they go through would be a tremendous expansion in the power of the government over ordinary citizens eerily reminiscent of China's blocking and breaking of user encryption to surveil its citizens

3. Longer, Even Indefinite Data Retention:

Draft Rule 3(8) increases the data retention period from 90 to 180 days and provides for further discretionary retention on the discretion of ""government agencies"". The phrase, ""government agencies"" is not defined and the specific conditions or any outer limit for data retention at the end of the online platform is also not limited.

Hence, by a mere letter on behalf of any government department, arguably a private platform can be required to store a users' data indefinitely, without even letting him know about it. It is important to remember that such retention will be possible despite the user deleting the data on the servers of the intermediary.

4. Pro-active Censorship:

Draft Rule 3(9) is the most dangerous bit which would be sledgehammer to online free speech. Not abuse, harassment or threats, but legitimate speech by requiring online platforms to become pro-active arbiters and judges of legality (not their own terms of use which is a contract between the user and a platform).

Placing such a requirement for a platform to obtain immunity from prosecution and actively sweep its platform would result in widespread takedowns without any legal process or natural justice. This violates the reasoning of the Shreya Singhal judgment which noted, ""it would be very difficult for intermediaries like Google, Facebook etc. to act when millions of requests are made and the intermediary is then to judge as to which of such requests are legitimate and which are not."" It shifts the duty of the state to a private party.What is worse? It will be done by, ""technology based automated tools or appropriate mechanisms"". Such tools have been shown to be faulty, have coding biases and prone to overbroad censorship. Should we subject our fundamental right to free speech on the basis of a developing technology measure? AI censorship is the Chinese model of censorship.

5. The Nanny Requirement:

Draft Rule 3(4), inserts a monthly requirement (at the least) to inform users about the legal requirements such as the terms and conditions and privacy policy. At first blush this may seem as a needed measure, with rampant online abuse and trolling. But consider the change in the environment from a public park to a guarded school yard in which you are constantly reminded that you are under watch and you better behave yourself.

It will turn the internet in India into a corporal environment which is bad for users. Rather than letting market mechanisms figure out a notification for good conduct, which is in the best interests of platforms themselves, such a measure by law will require product side changes for smaller startups and entrepreneurs as well.

There are many more problems which we will comment upon and analyse during the day and the coming week.

At IFF we believe there are better ways to check misinformation and threats to Indian elections. These can be achieved as per our fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The instant proposals seen alongside the recent MHA notification activating the 2009 interception rules is taking India close to a chinese model of censorship. Yes, online platforms are problematic, they require fixes.

But driving changes through a closed and secretive process in which measures that undermine fundamental rights is a harmful approach for all of us.

To us the path to disinformation is by first checking and bringing in a comprehensive privacy law which brings the power and control of smartphones in the hands of ordinary Indians. This will help bring accountability to large data controllers, from online companies which target us with advertising that is used by political parties.

We also need to focus on steps and support the Election Commission. But right now, today, we all need to push back and speak up to #SaveOurPrivacy and #RightToMeme.

The Class 12 board examination will start on February 15 and conclude on April 3 while the Class 10 board examination will commence from February 21 and end on March 29.

In a notification issued with the date sheet, the board said that it has tried to give students sufficient time between the exams of important subjects and kept in mind that dates of competitive examinations may not coincide with the boards examinations. The board further said that it has also taken care of the Delhi University admission schedule, as per orders of the Delhi high court, while preparing the board exams schedule.

However, students across India gave a mixed reaction, when HT asked them how satisfied they were with the boards examination date sheet released on Sunday.

Lucknow

In Lucknow, a number of CBSE students expressed unhappiness over the examination date sheet for examination. They were a little surprised with the date sheet and said that the gaps given in between the two difficult papers were far too less.

Swaraj Tiwari, a student of Class 12 at the GD Goenka Public School said in her opinion this year the date sheet was quite a surprise. ""As a student who has taken humanities with maths there will be no gap between my two major subjects, that is math and political science,"" says Swaraj. However, Swaraj believes that challenges such as these are essential and will prepare her for the challenges ahead and therefore welcomed the date sheet with open hands.

Pratyush Singh a Class 12 student of the same school said, ""The first core subject exam has been scheduled on March 2 for English and this would be fine as we can prepare ourselves well in advance. The second exam of physics is scheduled on March 5. I feel that we should have been given at least five days to prepare because physics is a vast subject and needs time. The fourth exam of Biology is scheduled on March 15. Here I feel that the gap is quite short and we would have to work a bit faster to prepare"".

""The fifth exam is of math is scheduled on March 18. In this exam I feel students would not find it difficult to prepare as there is enough gap for them, but for PCMB students the gap could have been a bit longer. The physical education paper has been scheduled for March 30 and I feel this gap could be shortened as it would not take so many days to prepare for physical education. The main concern is of the physics paper since the gap will not be enough to prepare the subject,"" he said.

Avinash Nair of Class 12 said being a PCM with physical education, he found it quite outrageous that CBSE gave them about a week to prepare for both chemistry and mathematics, and almost two weeks for physical education, but only two days for physics.

""We all know that physics is a very technical subject. This year, we have 15 chapters to prepare in physics, each one requiring some kind of detail, skill or special attention to it. Even if he has studied before, a mere two days is most definitely not enough to even revise the massive syllabus of the subject, let alone go through it thoroughly,"" said this student of GD Goenka Public School.

Bhopal

CBSE students from Bhopal mostly expressed satisfaction over the time table of the exams released by the board on Sunday.

A class 10 student Nandita Gaur said, ""We are happy with release of exam schedule eight weeks before exam. Now we will prepare accordingly.""

A class 12 science stream student Anurag Chauhan said, ""CBSE has given sufficient time between two consecutive papers to reduce pressure. I am satisfied with the time table.""

A Class 12 commerce student Abdul Sami said, ""I didn't see any flaw in the schedule. Now, we can start preparation accordingly.""

Sahoday group state secretary PK Pathak said, ""CBSE did commendable job by giving ample time to students for the preparation. The gaps are also sufficient.""

Chandigarh

Simran Singh, a student studying in Government Model Senior Secondary School, Chandigarh said, ""I think the date sheet of the board exams is fine, however, we were not expecting the exams this early. Usually exams start in March. It's very unusual.

Madhur Vaidya, a student in KBDAV sector 7, said, ""I am very nervous, especially for exams of Maths and science. This year there's hardly any time for preparing. Its December and within a month we have our board exams.""

Manpreet, a student of Government Model School Maloya said, ""This year there is not even a single gap between exams of political science and mathematics. I am worried how will students who have arts and mathematics as combination will study these, for Class 12.""

Kunal Kumar, another student of Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 37 said, ""I am very confident, I know I will pass.""

Prayagraj

Many students may have reached out to CBSE for rescheduling the Class 12 exam dates for biology, chemistry and physics and a few other examinations but many students in Prayagraj consider the time table to be perfect.

Saumya Maniyar, a Class 12 student of MPVM Ganga Gurukulam School said that she considers two days gap between chemistry and biology to be ideal.

""The chemistry exam is scheduled for March 12 and the Biology exam is on March 15, which is fine by me. This ensures that you remain in the rhythm of studies and the exam. The tightly spaced exam also means that the entire exercise gets over in a shorter period of time and someone like me can start preparing for the competitive exams like NEET set to be held on May 5, 2019.""

She maintained that most of her friends too were happy with the board exam schedule.

Navneeta Nandan, a Class 12 (commerce) student is also satisfied with her board exam schedule. ""My exams kick off on March 2, 2019 with English and would conclude on March 28 with my optional paper of IT. I have got good gap between my business studies paper on March 14 and next paper economics on March 27. As a result, for IT I have got no gap but the 12-day gap between business studies and economics exams gives my adequate time to revise IT,"" she maintained.

Navneeta also said that the fact that the exam gets over in a month, gives her adequate time to prepare for her college entrance exams that would start from May end or so. This would give students like her enough time to battle for a college or university of their choice.

Laxmi Mishra and Abhas Singh, both Class 10 students of MPVM Ganga Gurukulam school said that their exams were starting on February 21 and ending on March 29 and all subject exams have gap od a day or two, which was enough. ""The fact that the exams would get over in just a month, has all of us smiling,"" they held.

Jharkhand

Gayatri Kumari, a Class 10 student of DAV Public School Tenughat (Bokaro) said, ""Propone of the examination came as setback for us, as we were thinking that the examination would be held in March. Now, we have the pressure to complete the syllabus at the earliest. Early examination could impact our papers.""

Priyanka Kumar, a Class 12 student of DAV Public School, Sindri (Dhanbad), said, ""Now, we have to work hard for the examination. We were preparing keeping the target of March. But, we have to devote more time on revision to match the gap.""

Some students of Class 10 and Class 12 said CBSE should have announced the examination date sheet two or three months before so that students get time for revision.

DAV, Sindri principal, Ashutosh Mairh said, ""Now, we have bigger challenge to prepare the students for the examinations. Students are not psychologically ready for the examination in February. We have to make them mentally prepared so that they could appear fearlessly.""

Bihar

Neha Verma a Class 12 student of Notre Dame Academy, Patna said, ""My combination is PCBM and there is only two days gap between English and physics and in between biology and math. Physics and math are tough papers and we need more time to revise. However there is a gap of 11 days for physical education paper which is useless.""

Ask her if she has raised any objection on this, she says, ""Every year some or the other objection is raised by the students when the date sheet is out and nothing changes. So I think it is a waste of time to hope that anything will change now."""

This year continues with the tragic statistic of there being almost as many mass-shooting incidents as there have been days in 2018.

At last count, with 335 days into 2018 the U.S. has seen 324 recorded cases of mass shootings. There is no clear definition of what constitutes a mass shooting except for the number of casualties. Both Gun Violence Archive and a Congressional research paper take four or more deaths in a gun-shooting related incident as a case of mass shooting.

Here are the worst incidents of mass shooting that the U.S. witnessed in 2018.

Parkland, Florida: The year got off to a bloody start. In February of this year, the affluent community of Parkland in Florida saw a former student shoot down 17 people in Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The victims included 13 students and four staff including a sports coach and injured 17 others.

The Parkland shooting is the deadliest shooting at a high school in United States history, surpassing the Columbine High School massacre of 1999. It is also the deadliest mass shooting incident of 2018.

Santa Fe, Texas: Another teenager shot dead ten people and injured ten others at a school in the city of Sante Fe in Texas. The 17 year old used a shotgun and a revolver to shoot dead people he did not 'like'. After being arrested he admitted he meant to kill the people he shot at. The shooter also told the investigating officer he spared people he liked because he wanted his story told.

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: In the worst anti-Semitic attack in the history of U.S. a 46 year-old gunman shot and killed 11 Jewish people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Seven people were injured and the gunman was apprehended from the scene with some injuries after being engaged by the police.

While charges were filed against him in court, the gunman spewed anti-Jewish rant which made the Tree of Life synagogue mass shooting an act of religious hate against the Jewish community.

Thousand Oaks, California: A former member of the US marines, who had served as a soldier in Afghanistan turned into a mass shooter in California. The 28 year-old marine veteran shot dead 11 people with his hand gun at bar in Thousands Oaks in California. He died at the scene of the shooting due to self-inflicted wounds. His mother feared her son's mental health and many now suspect that the shooting was a result of his breakdown due to Post-traumatic stress disorder suffered due to his time served as a marine.

Trenton, New Jersey: An art festival in New Jersey was the sight of a mass shooting in June when a gang member began shooting at the venue due to a gang dispute. Twenty-two people were injured, 17 with gun shot wounds, marking this incident as the highest number of people injured in a mass shooting in 2018. The shooter was shot dead by police officers on the scene. The shooter had already served time in jail on murder-related charges.

A staggering 13, 376 number of people have died in the U.S. due to gun-related violence. Of this almost 3,000 are children 0-17 years of age. Yet, the Trump Administration seems firmly in the grips of the gun lobby with no intention of doing anything to curb gun-related violence. It seems 2019 will bring more tragedy as did 2018 and 2017 and so forth."

After twists and turns in 2018, led by the landmark Supreme Court ruling on the constitutional validity of Aadhaar, the UIDAI's efforts around offline modes like eAadhaar and QR code that can leverage the unique ID without any access to biometrics or even revealing the 12-digit number would gather pace in 2019.

From school admissions to getting marriage certificates to paying taxes to taking new mobile connections, Aadhaar touched multiple facets of people's lives as it became the default identifier.

This was true for around 1.22 billion Aadhaar holders till doubts emerged that collection of biometric details, even for general service, could infringe on a citizen's privacy rights.

Then, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the world's largest biometric identification database but spelt out its new limitations.

ALSO READ | Ban on Aadhaar linking may crimp growth of financial players

After last year's assertion that Indians have a right to privacy, the apex court in September 2018 redefined the boundaries of the biometric authentication -- Aadhaar can be used for payment of government benefits and taxation records but private companies were barred from accessing it.

In a 4-1 judgement delivered by the Constitution Bench, the Supreme Court held that Aadhaar would remain compulsory for the filing of Income Tax (IT) returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN) However, Section 57 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 that permitted private entities like telecom companies or other corporates to use the biometric data was struck down, dealing a body blow to the government's ambitions to make the world's largest biometric project mandatory for a slew of services.

The landmark ruling sent banks, telecom operators and fintech companies -- who relied heavily on Aadhaar eKYC -- scrambling in search of other viable means of customer verification.

As the verdict meant that fulfilling regulatory Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements would have again involved a lot of paperwork for verification purposes, Aadhaar-issuing authority, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), quickly came up with alternate modes like QR (Quick Response) codes, e-Aadhaar and offline methods.

Just as 2018 started to wind down, came another twist in the plot.

Earlier this month, the government decided to propose changes to existing laws - Telegraph Act and PMLA - in order to allow the use of Aadhaar as an ID verification tool for opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections, albeit on a voluntary basis.

Additionally, fresh penal provisions have been proposed - through an amendment in Aadhaar Act - to deter companies from insisting on Aadhaar or misusing the biometric data.

The proposed amendments, which will be placed before the Parliament during the ongoing Winter session, propose to arm UIDAI with regulator-like powers to take enforcement actions on the misuse of the national biometric ID and impose stiff penalties on violations.

The compelling reason behind this seems to be the government's belief in the transformative potential of Aadhaar -- the system is so cheap and efficient that it is estimated to have accounted for over 90 per cent of new subscriptions in the telecom sector, according to experts.

More stringent deterrents are likely to be put in place in the coming months.

These might include a penalty for failure to obtain consent for authentication or offline verification -- up to three-year imprisonment or fine of up to Rs 10,000 --, penalty for unauthorised use of core biometric information.

The latter could attract imprisonment between 3-10 years and a fine of up to Rs 10,000.

Even as it dons regulatory role, the UIDAI would continue to accelerate efforts to transform and scale up Aadhaar enrolment and update services, currently available through 30,000 centres operating in designated bank branches, post offices and government premises across the country.

'Aadhaar Seva Kendras', similar to the concept of Passport Seva Kendras, will come up in 53 cities across India at an estimated project cost of Rs 300-400 crore.

These swanky new centres will be operational by August next year, dishing out appointment-based enrolment, update and other miscellaneous services around Aadhaar, under the watchful eyes of authority's own employees.

Earlier this year, former UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey, recalling his early years as a small-town boy who didn't hold a photo identity for a long time, had reportedly said that Aadhaar offered an answer to an ancient question that was asked by sages -- who am I? The year that was, ensured that the answer continues to be the 12-digit identifier, at least for those who choose to use it."

PUBG Mobile is the new gaming sensation that has smartphone users on the edge. From thrilling excitement to fears of addiction, PUBG Mobile players are trying to strike a balance. But reports of PUBG Mobile causing misbalance in life, to the extent where some players are seeking medical help to overcome the addiction. Educational institutes have warned against the gaming habits of students and one university even banned playing the game on the campus.

With all that's going on, PUBG Mobile is still growing by leaps and bounds. It has finally surpassed its chief rival Fortnite with higher daily active users. According to a recent report, PUBG Mobile has 200 million downloads and 30 million daily active users. PUBG Mobile witnessed overnight success in India, where the game also showed the country's first-ever TV commercial for a mobile game.

As the roaring success of PUBG Mobile continues to rise in India, concerns regarding the game's effect on students are persistent. With that lingering fear, a government notice has been making the rounds on WhatsApp forwards suggesting banning of the popular battle royale game, which makes it more believable.

The government notice appears to be coming from Maharashtra High Court with the subject ""Alliance on ban of game PUBG."" In that letter, dated Saturday, December 22, PUBG Mobile is said to be banned for ""creating a lot of nuisance and irrespective activities and many students spoiling their own lives...""

Even though the circumstances would make us believe the PUBG Mobile ban notice is for real, looking at the details makes us question the authenticity of the letter. Let us show why the notice is nothing but a hoax and PUBG Mobile players shouldn't fear to get the game banned in India.

The format: The notice has an unusual (amateurish) format with a dramatic ""Legal Action"" watermark. The date, time, subject, matter and the closing looks like a leave letter to be submitted in school rather than a legal notice.

Grammar: It's uncommon to see grammatical errors in a legal notice and this one has got one too many. Errors like ""All we have knew"" to wrongful punctuation suggests nothing but an amateur attempt at striking fear among PUBG Mobile players.

The signing judge: A quick search on Google will give you details of the judge in any particular court. Looking for ""K.Srinivasulu"" in Maharashtra High Court does not show any results, which only means this is not a legit order.

Although we have deciphered how the PUBG ban notice is anything but real, we've reached out to Tencent Games for a comment on the matter. While it's clear the game publisher will agree that it's a hoax, we hope to get more information on why the game could not be banned in the country."

Nirupam Sen, who served as the industry minister of West Bengal during the tumultuous days of Singur and Nandigram movement, died on Monday at a private hospital in Salt Lake. He was 71.

Sen is survived by his wife and a son. He will be cremated on Wednesday.

Recognised as the quiet, non-flashy priest of Communist Party of India (Marxist)'s industrialisation drive in Bengal between 2001 and 2011 -- the last 10 years of the Left Front rule -- Sen suffered a cerebral attack in November 2013.

A soft spoken man of few words and frugal lifestyle, Sen was easily the second most influential minister in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee's cabinet. He rarely wore anything but light-coloured half-sleeve shirts, trousers, open leather slippers and lived in a 940-sq ft apartment in Salt Lake with his spouse who was a school teacher.

Sen, widely held to be one of the hardliners in the party's Bengal arena, steered the industrialisation drive of the state when chief minister Buddahdeb Bhattacharjee took it upon himself as his top priority.

Though the reformist Bhattacharjee became the face of the drive, Sen was the quiet performer, the back room boy who went through the grind of marketing the state to investors and trying to polish the image of Bengal that acquired a degree of notoriety in the industrial circles, thanks largely to militant trade unionism in the sixties and seventies.

The Tata Nano project was closest to his heart during his 10-year stint as the industry minister, and the slipped into despair after the project was abandoned in October 2008.

He started negotiating with the Tatas in 2004 and continued the exercise assiduously for two years to woo the most discussed automobile project of the country, though there are lingering doubts whether Sen agreed to the relocation of the factory from its initial site in Kharagpur to Singur, a move that ignited the land agitation that rebuilt Mamata Banerjee's career.

Bureaucrats who worked with him recalled how, unlike a textbook Communist, he not only tolerated different opinions, but actually encouraged it.

Unlike Bhttacharjee, Sen spoke in measured, well-thought-out words, was never ebullient but always full of calibrated optimism.

That understated confidence deserted Sen before the Assembly elections of 2011 when the Trinamool Congress routed the Left to end the 34-year record breaking rule of the party. While he still believed that the government taking up the cause of the Tata Motors plant in Singur was justified, he was not so sure about the chemical hub project to be built by the Salims, a controversial industrial group of Indonesia, which resulted in the Nandigram movement that eventually turned out to be the single biggest factor to mobilise public opinion against the Left Front government.

For a number of years, Nirupam Sen was dogged by the shadow of Khokon Sen, who was named as one of the marauders in Sainbari in Burdwan district. In March 1970, a group of youths stormed the house of the Sains, speared two brothers Pranab and Moloy to death, and forced their mother to swallow rice stained with the blood of her sons.

The Sains were supporters of the Congress, and political opponents of the CPI(M) kept alleging down the years that Nirupam Sen was, in fact, Khokon Sen, who reinvented himself in a new avatar thanks to the cooperation of his party and the government that came in power in June 1977.

In 2012, the Mamata Banerjee government set up a commission of inquiry to probe the incident by retired high court justice Arunabha Basu. The commission is yet to submit its report though about Rs 50 million has already been allocated for the probe.

Sen contested Assembly elections in 2001, 2006 and 2011 from Burdwan South constituency. He won twice and lost the last elections to a Trinamool candidate.

A follower of B T Ranadive, one of the nine founding fathers of the CPI(M), Nirupam Sen rose to be a politburo member and was respected by most in the party. He was an organisation man and initially worked in Burdwan district known to be Bengal's rice bowl.

After 10 years as minister in charge of the industry department apart from industrial reconstruction and a brief stint in the power portfolio too, the total assets of Sen and his school teacher wife stood under Rs 2.3 million.

When Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was made the chief minister after Jyoti Basu, some even believed that Sen would have made a more competent and balanced, though less charismatic, head of government."

RK Singh, Union Minister of State for Power and New and Renewable Energy said in a statement, ""India's current renewable-based power capacity stands at 70 GW, and we will cross the 175-GW target well before 2022. We have new schemes like offshore wind, floating solar, which will help us over-achieve the current target.""

What makes some images memorable and others easily forgotten? It's a question I've been studying for nearly 20 years.

Estimates suggest that more than 1 trillion photos were taken in 2018.

With so many in circulation, it's difficult for any single photo to capture our attention and become a famed iconic image.

In the golden age of photojournalism, news photographs became iconic largely because they appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world - think Iwo Jima and the Hindenburg.

But that age has come to an end: Digital journalism and social media have changed the way we consume images. Each day, audiences are bombarded with photos. Many are shocking, inspiring and heartbreaking. But in their overwhelming volume, they're easily forgotten.

The model shows that certain characteristics of an image - such as its timeliness, its cultural resonance, its political potency or its likelihood of being turned into a meme - can influence its rise and reach.

Images that exhibit these qualities can quickly go viral, turning them into what communication scholars call ""instant news icons."" While these images don't typically endure to become truly historic, they nonetheless help citizens navigate and understand complex events.

On Feb. 14, a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people and injuring 17 others. Following such a mass shooting, there's a predictable pattern of news media coverage - breaking news reports filled with speculation, details about the perpetrator, elected officials responding with ""thoughts and prayers"" and debates about mental health and gun control.

But after the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School, we saw something new: images of resistance. The students there spoke fervently, demanding action from elected officials.

These images of resistance spurred school walkouts and nationwide protests, culminating in the March For Our Lives.

During the devastating Carr Fire that burned more than 200,000 acres and claimed the lives of three firefighters, Redding, California resident Richard Tuggle captured a photo of five firefighters resting in a backyard in his neighborhood on July 27. The firefighters were clearly reeling from the exhaustion of battling the deadly fire.

What's particularly interesting about this photo and its rise to prominence is that it was captured by a citizen rather than a journalist. The photo went viral on social media and was ultimately picked up by news outlets across the country, showing how instant news icons can come from citizens as well as journalists in this new age of photography.

Kavanaugh confronts #MeToo

Amid controversy and protests, the Senate narrowly confirmed Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court on Oct. 6.

In early October, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared. The Saudis initially denied that they had anything to do with his disappearance.

But security-camera footage emerged showing Khashoggi entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. It served as evidence to support the claim - later confirmed - that he was killed inside.

In this case, the image was captured by a security camera, rather than a photographer. Nonetheless, it became an instant news icon. It's just another example of the changing nature of the production and consumption of news imagery.

A devastating war in Yemen has led to economic instability and widespread food shortages.

On Oct. 26, The New York Times published photojournalist Tyler Hicks' gut-wrenching images of starving Yemeni children.

A few days later we learned that Amal Hussain, the 7-year-old girl in Hicks' haunting photo, had died.

Political, economic and ethical debates about immigration dominated the year, with two photos driving the conversation.

Getty photographer John Moore's image of a 2-year-old Honduran girl in a pink shirt sobbing as U.S. Border Patrol agents searched her mother became the face of Trump's ""zero tolerance"" family separation policy. The image was even modified for a Time magazine cover under the headline ""Welcome to America.""

The image continued to spur discussion after it was made clear that the mother and daughter were not actually separated. However, hundreds of other children have been separated from their parents and recently a 7-year-old girl in Border Patrol custody died.

Then, on Nov. 25, Reuters photojournalist Kim Kyung-Hoon snapped a picture of a mother and her twin daughters fleeing tear gas at the border wall between the U.S. and Tijuana, Mexico. Appearing in news outlets and on social media feeds across the country, it spurred further public and political outrage.

Some said the photo effectively contradicted Trump's narrative that refugees were dangerous. Others noted that the photo evoked the iconic image of a naked Vietnamese girl screaming in pain following a napalm attack."

The royal court said prayers for Prince Talal, who died on Saturday, will be held in Riyadh on Sunday.(AP)

Prayers were held Sunday for Prince Talal bin Abdulaziz, a senior member of the royal family who supported women's rights and once led a group of dissident princes, who died at the age of 87.

Prince Talal was an older brother to King Salman and the father of businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. He is the son of the founder and first ruler of modern Saudi Arabia, the late King Abdulaziz, whose sons have ruled since his death, with the throne passing from brother to brother.

Prince Talal's son Prince Abdulaziz bin Talal announced on Twitter that his father passed away on Saturday. The royal court also released a statement about his passing.

Prince Talal served as minister of communications in the 1950s and minister of finance in the early 1960s. In 1957, Prince Talal founded the first school for girls in Riyadh, according to the Saudi newspaper Arab News. The school was founded at a time when females had no access to formal education in the landlocked capital and schools were open to boys only.

Soon after he was appointed finance minister, he struck out and led a group of princes who called for a constitutional monarchy that distributes some of the king's powers. The royals, who became known as the Free Princes Movement, called for a constitution to govern the kingdom, rather than rules based solely on clerical interpretation of the Quran and other religious doctrine.

Prince Talal led the group from Beirut and Cairo, which under then Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser was an adversary of Riyadh. The prince's assets were seized by Riyadh, but he was not stripped of his nationality -- a punishment Gulf monarchies have employed against dissidents.

After rifts emerged between Prince Talal and Cairo, he was allowed to return to Saudi Arabia in 1964 under King Faisal, who had deposed his brother King Saud that same year.

Prince Talal served until 2011 as a member of the Allegiance Council, a body of senior princes who are meant to meet and choose the next king from among themselves. He'd reportedly left the council after questioning its efficacy when a senior prince was appointed to the line of succession without the council being fully consulted."

I do solemnly swear!

The world watched as Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified before the US senate judiciary committee on a hearing on Ford's sexual assault allegations against the then US supreme court nominee in September.

Ford alleged that in high school, a drunk Kavanaugh pinned her down and tried to remove her clothes while he held his hand over her mouth to prevent people from hearing her scream.

Kavanaugh denied the incident had taken place.

After much tumult in the US senate, Kavanaugh was confirmed as a supreme court judge.

Ford faced continuous threats after she testified and was forced to move to temporary housing.

A political standoff

This photograph released by German Chancellor Angela Merkel during the G7 summit in June caused a social media sensation.

With both hands down on the table in front of her, Merkel leans in during what appears to be a tense discussion, staring straight at her American counterpart and cast in a light that presents her as the central figure, the power.

Also pictured are Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with arms crossed and an uncertain look on his face; John Bolton, the US national security adviser, staring blankly; British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is identifiable here only by her hair; and French President Emmanuel Macron, with one hand on the table.

Trump arrived at the summit with the suggestion that Russia should, again, have a seat at the table, following its ouster in 2014 over Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea.

Safe and sound!

Was it a miracle?

We won't know, but the rescue of 12 Thai boys -- making the Wild Boars soccer team -- and their coach was what movie scripts are made of!

On July 18 -- almost a month after they entered the Tham Luang Nang Non cave and were trapped by the rain -- they were released from hospital and cleared to return to their families.

The boys addressed the public for the first time at a press conference and spoke about what they had learned from the ordeal.

One boy said he would be 'more careful and live my life the fullest.'

Another said, 'This experience taught me to be more patient and strong.'

The mission to rescue the boys and the Wild Boars coach was an extraordinary international operation with hundreds of cave and rescue experts and military personnel from several countries pitching in.

Rescue divers first delivered food and medical supplies, and then an air tube to the boys to make sure they had enough oxygen to breathe.

They then escorted them out of the cave on stretchers guided by expert divers, one by one.

Rain can't stop us!

The final whistle was blown and France was ecstatic as they won the World Cup on July 15 after beating Croatia 4-2.

Even the rain couldn't dampen the mood of the victorious French.

As Reuters Photographer Kai Pfaffenbach said, 'Usually a football World Cup is all about the action, goals and emotions on the pitch. This World Cup's final had a lot of that too, but despite the 4-2 result my favourite picture is this.'

'As soon as the victory ceremony started, a heavy downpour began.'

'A helper had an umbrella for Russia President Vladimir Putin quickly on hand, while his counterparts from France and Croatia enjoyed a little shower along with FIFA President Gianni Infantino.'

'France President Emmanuel Macron didn't seem to care and enjoyed himself -- and his team's victory -- while Croatia President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic comforted her team's coach.'

The hearing came after reports emerged that Facebook allowed political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest 50 million users' data.

Rising from the ashes

On February 14, a gunman opened fire at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 students and staff members and injuring 17 others.

What happened next was historic: The students of the school led a march for gun control, what they called a March for Our Lives on March 24 in Washington, DC with over 880 sibling events throughout the US and around the world.

The children's demand was simple: They wanted concrete legislative solutions to the epidemic of mass shootings and an end to the influence of the US National Rifle Association.

At this march emerged Emma Gonzalez, a shooting survivor from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school.

'In a little over six minutes, 17 of our friends were taken from us, 15 more were injured, and everyone -- absolutely everyone in the Douglas community -- was forever altered,' Emma said.

She spoke for less than two minutes and then suddenly fell silent, marking the length of time it took for the gunman to kill 17 people in the rampage at her school.

She stared straight ahead, breathing deeply while tears streamed down her face.

The crowd of thousands cheered her name and chanted, 'Never again!'

Making history!

US congressional candidate Ilhan Omar is greeted by her mother-in-law at an election night party in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Omar became the first Somali-American Muslim to become a US legislator and, as of November 2018, the first Somali American elected to the US congress.

Omar fled the civil war in Somalia with her family in 1991 and spent four years in the Utango camp, near the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa, before arriving in the US with six brothers and sisters under a resettlement programme.

Omar, a Democrat, will assume office in January, sharing with Rashida Tlaib, the historic distinction of being the first Muslim women elected to the US congress.

MBA students from colleges affiliated to Anna University have sent representations to the university requesting amendments to the regulation, which permits students to reappear for arrears (backlogs) only after a year. They said this affected their career prospects. Engineering students from Chennai had also made a similar representation.

According to the previous regulation, students from affiliated colleges were allowed to take up a supplementary or instant exam soon after the semester exam results were released and arrear exams were held in subsequent semesters.

Against this backdrop, Anna University adopted Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) in four university departments in Chennai Madras Institute of Technology in Chrompet, College of Engineering, Alagappa College of Technology and School of Architecture & Planning in Guindy. CBCS was extended to affiliated colleges offering two-year MBA course under the 2017 PG programme regulation.

Following this, final year MBA students from Coimbatore approached the Madras High Court seeking exemption as they were forced to wait for over a year to clear backlogs and were unable to attend campus placements.

S Megharaj, one among the petitioners, said he quit work from a private firm and joined MBA. ""But finishing the course itself has become difficult under the new regulation,"" he said.

Though the court dismissed their plea stating that it can't interfere in academic matters, it directed the university to respond to the representations made by the students.

""There has been no response till date and students are facing a bleak future,"" said R Saravanan, principal of a Anna University affiliated college from Coimbatore.

Responding to this, Anna University officials promised to look into the representations and arrive at a decision soon."

Six film producers from the Tamil industry have moved the Madras High Court against music composer Ilaiyaraaja's claim that he holds the copyright to songs contained in their films. The plaintiffs have moved the court seeking a permanent injunction and to make them absolute owners of the copyrights of the film.

The group of six producers including PT Selvakumar and R Chandrasekhar, submitted that Ilaiyaraaja cannot claim copyright ownership for songs he had composed. The producers further contended that if Ilaiyaraaja was allowed to do this then all artistes including their hero, comedian, technicians and the art director would claim ownership over their contribution and scenes in the film, leaving those who are investing enormous amounts in the film 'high and dry'.

This was true for around 1.22 billion Aadhaar holders till doubts emerged that collection of biometric details, even for general service, could infringe on a citizen's privacy rights.

Then, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the world's largest biometric identification database but spelt out its new limitations.

After last year's assertion that Indians have a right to privacy, the Supreme Court in September 2018 redefined the boundaries of the biometric authentication -- Aadhaar can be used for payment of government benefits and taxation records but private companies were barred from accessing it.

In a 4-1 judgement delivered by the Constitution Bench, the Supreme Court held that Aadhaar would remain compulsory for the filing of Income Tax (IT) returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN)

However, Section 57 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 that permitted private entities like telecom companies or other corporates to use the biometric data was struck down, dealing a body blow to the government's ambitions to make the world's largest biometric project mandatory for a slew of services.

The landmark ruling sent banks, telecom operators and fintech companies -- who relied heavily on Aadhaar eKYC -- scrambling in search of other viable means of customer verification.

As the verdict meant that fulfilling regulatory Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements would have again involved a lot of paperwork for verification purposes, Aadhaar-issuing authority, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), quickly came up with alternate modes like QR (Quick Response) codes, e-Aadhaar and offline methods.

Just as 2018 started to wind down, came another twist in the plot. Earlier this month, the government decided to propose changes to existing laws - Telegraph Act and PMLA - in order to allow the use of Aadhaar as an ID verification tool for opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections, albeit on a voluntary basis. Additionally, fresh penal provisions have been proposed - through an amendment in Aadhaar Act - to deter companies from insisting on Aadhaar or misusing the biometric data.

The proposed amendments, which will be placed before the Parliament during the ongoing Winter session, propose to arm UIDAI with regulator-like powers to take enforcement actions on the misuse of the national biometric ID and impose stiff penalties on violations.

The compelling reason behind this seems to be the government's belief in the transformative potential of Aadhaar -- the system is so cheap and efficient that it is estimated to have accounted for over 90 per cent of new subscriptions in the telecom sector, according to experts.

More stringent deterrents are likely to be put in place in the coming months. These might include a penalty for failure to obtain consent for authentication or offline verification -- up to three-year imprisonment or fine of up to Rs 10,000 --, penalty for unauthorised use of core biometric information. The latter could attract imprisonment between 3-10 years and a fine of up to Rs 10,000.

Even as it dons regulatory role, the UIDAI would continue to accelerate efforts to transform and scale up Aadhaar enrolment and update services, currently available through 30,000 centres operating in designated bank branches, post offices and government premises across the country.

'Aadhaar Seva Kendras', similar to the concept of Passport Seva Kendras, will come up in 53 cities across India at an estimated project cost of Rs 300-400 crore. These swanky new centres will be operational by August next year, dishing out appointment-based enrolment, update and other miscellaneous services around Aadhaar, under the watchful eyes of authority's own employees.

Earlier this year, former UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey, recalling his early years as a small-town boy who didn't hold a photo identity for a long time, had reportedly said that Aadhaar offered an answer to an ancient question that was asked by sages -- who am I?

The year that was, ensured that the answer continues to be the 12-digit identifier, at least for those who choose to use it."

That was true for Nicholas II of Russia, the last ruler of the 300-year-long Romanov dynasty and the subject of the exhibition ""The Reluctant Autocrat: Tsar Nicholas II,"" organized by the Georgia Museum of Art at the University of Georgia and on view there December 22 through March 17.

The museum has been building a collection of Russian art for several years and has developed several exhibitions from the gifts that make up that collection. The majority of objects in ""The Reluctant Autocrat"" come from the Parker Collection, assembled over more than four decades and including more than 2,200 separate objects. Asen Kirin, Parker Curator of Russian Art at the museum and professor of art history at UGA's Lamar Dodd School of Art, focused this exhibition on objects related to Nicholas II and his father, Alexander III. The year 2018 marks the centennial of the end of World War I and the fall of the Romanov dynasty during the Russian Revolution, which also meant the murder of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra and their five children. As such, it presents a unique opportunity to consider the relationship between the villains and heroes of history and the reality of their individual human lives.

Kirin tells the story of Nicholas' life, from his childhood as tsarevich (crown prince) to his ill-fated military command during World War I, through objects including military and court costumes, medals and orders of chivalry, lithographs, porcelain, devotional icons and the then young technology of photography. As visitors move through the galleries, they can draw connections among these items and begin to assemble a picture of the world at the time, caught between the ancient idea of the ruler as God's representative on earth and the new, modern age.

Objects from Bob Jones University Museum & Gallery and from the gift of Princess Marina Belosselsky-Belozersky Kasarda help round out that picture. The latter also make up the exhibition ""One Heart, One Way: The Journey of a Princely Art Collection,"" on view at the museum through February 10. Kirin was even able to attribute one icon borrowed from Bob Jones to a famed 15th-century painter, Theophrastos, by interpreting its signature.

Kirin's labels and wall texts bring out the human nature of the royal family, pointing out, for example, that Alexander III and his wife prepared their own simple breakfast of bread, butter, boiled eggs and coffee every morning. At the same time, they unpack the layers of meaning in objects like a copper bowl made by Fabergé as a gift (the simpler material signified frugality at the beginning of the world war) or the importance of military regiments as social networks. The result is a rich and complex portrait of a world undergoing massive change.

The exhibition is generously sponsored by the Fraser-Parker Foundation.

Circuit Keeps Clean Power Plan Litigation on Hold for Sixty More Days","pressreleasepoint.com",FALSE,"(Washington, D.C. - December 21, 2018) The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit today announced that long-pending litigation over the Clean Power Plan, our only national limits on carbon pollution from existing power plants, would remain in abeyance for 60 more days.

The court also denied without comment a motion by EDF and a coalition of 17 states and the District of Columbia, six municipalities, and 14 other public health and environmental organizations to rule on the merits of the Clean Power Plan. At the same time, the court directed EPA to continue filing status reports every 30 days.

The full D.C. Circuit heard oral argument en banc in litigation over the Clean Power Plan more than two years ago - in September 2016. The court has yet to rule on the case.

""The Clean Power Plan is a vital tool to help us address the severe and growing threat of climate change,"" said Tomás Carbonell, Directory of Regulator Policy and Lead Attorney for EDF, which is a party to the case. ""We need to enforce the Clean Power Plan - and strengthen it - to protect American communities and all of our futures.""

The Clean Power Plan is the single largest step the U.S. has ever taken to address the threat of climate change. When fully implemented, it will reduce greenhouse gases from the power sector to 32 percent below 2005 levels - and will save up to 4,500 lives, prevent up to 90,000 childhood asthma attacks, and avoid more than 300,000 missed school and work days each year, according to EPA's own analysis.

Opponents of the Clean Power Plan challenged it in court as soon as it was published in 2015. The Trump Administration has since filed requests for indefinite abeyance while it considers whether to roll back the Clean Power Plan. The court placed the case temporarily in abeyance starting in April 2017 but has repeatedly denied EPA's request to put the case on hold indefinitely.

The Trump EPA has proposed a sham Clean Power Plan ""replacement"" that - compared to the original plan - would increase pollution and cost American lives, and does not fulfil EPA's legal obligation, repeatedly upheld in court, to protect Americans from the dangers of climate pollution. In comments on the proposal, EDF explained how the replacement would be an appalling abandonment of EPA's statutory responsibility. The replacement also completely disregards the public health impacts of climate change on American families."

I'm an American journalist who lives in Beijing, but I just happened to be visiting South Korea when news broke that Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co., had been arrested in Canada on Dec. 1. She was detained at the behest of the US for allegedly misleading financial institutions about the company's Iran business, causing them to violate US sanctions. I called my wife, who works in the Chinese capital too, and joked about this ominous turn in Chinese-American relations: ""Maybe it's safer not to go back.""

The quip turned out not to be very funny after I did return. Within days, Chinese authorities scooped up two Canadian citizens who, despite Beijing's denials, were soon seen by the outside world as pawns in China's attempts to extract Meng from Canadian -- and potential US -- custody. In Vancouver, Meng received a public hearing in an independent court. That's in contrast to China, where it's still unclear why the Canadians were detained and where, more fundamentally, law can be contravened by power and judges are instruments of the Communist Party. Even foreign nationals can vanish into prison cells. For now, the detention of Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat who works for a policy think tank, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, have made expatriate Americans like me worry how much we're at Beijing's mercy. In a similar way, Chinese businessmen saw Meng's arrest as a disincentive to traveling to and investing in the US.

The detentions are the most frightening development yet taken in the widening confrontation between the US and China. What started as a scuffle over tariffs and trade balances, then expanded into a battle for control of future technologies, may be degenerating into an intimate war against each other's people. That makes it directly personal in a way trade and tariffs weren't.

In a remarkable comment when asked on CNBC if a senior US tech executive should be in China right now, Leland Miller, chief executive officer of research firm China Beige Book, said, ""I would not. Too much risk."" According to Reuters, the US department of state is considering issuing a travel warning to Americans about visiting China. ""Now the US and Canadian executives could be a bit nervous traveling to China,"" one Chinese newspaper editor tweeted in the wake of the Meng arrest, ""and even more so for Chinese executives traveling to the US and Canada.""

Is this how far we've fallen? The sad irony is that this ugly saga is unfolding as China celebrates the 40th anniversary of its embrace of the world. It was in December 1978 that paramount leader Deng Xiaoping told party members to ""emancipate the mind"" -- to break with Maoist orthodoxy and revel in fresh thinking to help the nation. That launched his country's capitalist reforms, a central pillar of which was ""opening up"" to end China's poverty-creating isolation and integrate with the global economy. In flowed the capital and technology that contributed to China's economic miracle and built the nation into the superpower it is today.

An often underappreciated aspect of that great integration is the people. Foreigners played an unheralded role in rebuilding China's economy and fortunes. We tend to think of ""intellectual property"" as proprietary software code or secret cola recipes, but it's more than that. It's also the know-how about running modern factories or managing money that countless expatriate executives from the US and around the world imported into China for industries from automobiles to fast food. And there's been a return for that: The riches amassed by the Chinese are being spent on Buicks and Starbucks lattes and filling hotels from Times Square to Walt Disney World.

In the decades since China's opening, Americans and Chinese have for the most part been able to set aside the vast divergence in their political systems to find common ground that their governments sometimes haven't. For Americans, the fascination with the fabulous Middle Kingdom is a modern extension of the wonderment Marco Polo first sparked in the 14th century with tales of great ""Cathay."" China was, and is, a fairytale land of imperial palaces, untold riches, and limitless opportunity. For Chinese, the US remains something of the old ""city on the hill,"" whose lights may have dimmed a bit but is still a beacon of freedom and hope. That's why more than 360,000 Chinese students were enrolled in US universities in the last academic year, the most from any country and a record for China. I myself have become an avid student of Chinese history and philosophy since relocating to Beijing seven years ago.

Now we have to worry that those doors are closing. The Trump administration has started restricting visas for certain Chinese students, fearing they'll steal US technology, and he supposedly considered an outright ban. China's government doesn't go out of its way to encourage its citizens to visit anyway. Beijing's embassy in Washington issued a warning for Chinese travelers this year about the frequent shootings and expensive health care in the US.

China isn't rolling out the red carpet for foreigners, either. Officials sometimes run campaigns with videos and posters warning locals of foreign ""spies."" Although policymakers profess to be wooing foreign talent to China's tech sectors, in practice they're scaring people off. The government in 2019 will increase the tax burden on some foreign residents, rendering the country, with its toxic air and rising costs, an even less attractive place to live. In a 2018 survey of US businessmen by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, a staggering three out of four said they feel increasingly unwelcome in the country. That's due in part to their belief that Chinese regulators do not treat them on equal terms with their domestic rivals. Beijing can also be quick to penalize foreign companies that run afoul of its political sensitivities. Earlier this year, authorities ordered Marriott International to shut down its website in the country after the hotel operator distributed a questionnaire listing Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Tibet as independent countries. (Beijing sees all of them as part of China.)

Perhaps shifting politics in the two countries made such antiforeign sentiment inevitable. In China, a surveillance-obsessed police state has intensified efforts to snuff out any civic action or alternative thinking -- dangerous foreign ideals included. President Xi Jinping's government launched a campaign against ""western values"" and purged foreign content from school textbooks. He'd prefer that educators teach Chinese literature and morality -- or better yet, Communist Party ideology -- that the regime considers more appropriate. The ""opening up"" so core to Deng and China's success has become more rhetoric than reality as an increasingly nationalist government has stalled market reforms in favor of statist programs to develop Chinese champions. In a closely watched Dec. 18 speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of reform, Xi struck a defiant tone, saying no one can dictate to the country. Meanwhile, Trump's ""America First"" mantra paints China as a technology-swindling, job-stealing threat to US national security and economic primacy. In addition to trade-restricting tariffs, Washington has introduced more stringent controls on foreign investment -- a move clearly designed to keep vital US technology out of Chinese hands.

These policies on both sides of the Pacific have already started disentangling two economies tightly intertwined by supply chains, trade, and capital. A recent survey of US companies in China discovered that nearly a fifth of respondents were considering relocating manufacturing operations out of the country because of the trade dispute and deteriorating US-China relations. Trump is encouraging this withdrawal by attacking American companies from General Motors Co. to Apple Inc. for manufacturing in China rather than creating more jobs in the US Chinese investment in the US has plunged, not only because of perceived American hostility but also because China's government has started controlling how its companies can invest abroad.

It then seems not all that surprising that a disengagement of the Chinese and American people would come next. Already, they're divided digitally. China blocks major American social media -- including Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram -- along with a host of other prominent US internet services. That's locked many Chinese in their own digital universe, where they communicate on Tencent Holdings's WeChat instead of WhatsApp, microblog on Sina Weibo, not Twitter, and search on Baidu in place of Google -- all are Chinese companies with a limited international presence.

Economic and political division is bad enough for the US-China relationship. Curtailing exchanges between citizens would arguably be more worrisome. If executives, students, and tourists begin to fear traveling between the two countries -- or aren't permitted to -- maintaining peaceful relations between the world's greatest powers will be more difficult.

What would be lost is the mutual understanding -- of each other's cultures, societies, and ambitions -- fostered by personal conversations and experience. Without that, there might be nothing left to prevent relations between Beijing and Washington from freezing over into a renewed cold war.

Sure, there are signs the current tussle might get resolved. At a December dinner after the latest Group of 20 summit in Argentina, Trump and Xi were able to call a truce in their trade war and restart negotiations. As it turned out, Huawei's Meng was arrested the same day as Trump and Xi's peacemaking dinner -- but in a positive sign, Beijing so far has remained committed to pursuing trade talks anyway. It even appears Xi might be willing to compromise on China's state-led industrial policies, a key concern of the White House that Beijing has previously considered sacrosanct. Trump has hinted (to the horror of those committed to an independent judiciary) that he could intervene on behalf of the arrested Meng to speed a trade deal. Skepticism reigns among China watchers that Xi will sincerely drop the ""state"" from China's ""state capitalism."" But maybe six months from now, tensions will ease and Americans can feel comfortable visiting the Great Wall without worrying about being trapped within it.

Or maybe not. We have to consider that the level of trust between China and the US has diminished to an alarming degree, and rebuilding may take more than cutting tariffs. In the US, China has become in many eyes the new evil empire, a larcenous cheater bent on world domination at America's expense. To the Chinese, the US often seems an overbearing foreign power, intent on frustrating China's rise. Deng's spirit of openness, 40 years later, is in grave danger. That's a setback not just for China and the US, but for the world."

Hasina's ten-year tenure as Prime Minister, from 2009 till date, has been marked by very impressive economic growth. It has been 6% on an average and 7.8% this year. Nikkei recently ran a special story on the ""Rise and rise of Bangladesh"".

According to an IMF report of June 2018, growth in the last ten years has significantly lifted per capita income. Poverty has declined steadily. Gender disparity in education and maternal mortality, has also come down.

Throughout this process, the country has diversified away from an agrarian to a more manufacturing-based economy with rapid growth in the ready-made garment industry, the IMF said. The government showed its humanitarian outlook by opening its doors to 700,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in a very short period.

Bangladesh has been a pioneer in financial inclusion, the IMF noted and added that the introduction of microfinance, mobile financial services, and agent-based banking have been notable initiatives. The government has also been promoting lending for small and medium-sized enterprises and women entrepreneurs.

These efforts have improved the ratio of bank deposit accounts in the adult population and credit provided to small and medium-sized enterprises run by women. They have also helped to boost the number of women entrepreneurs and the number of active mobile money accounts. The forthcoming National Financial Inclusion Strategy will carry forth this momentum, the IMF avers.

Writing in www.bookings.edu, leading Indian economist Dr. Kaushik Basu says that Bangladesh has made significant strides toward educating girls and giving women a greater voice, both in the household and the public sphere.

""These efforts have translated into improvements in children's health and education, such that Bangladeshis' average life expectancy is now 72 years, compared to 68 for Indians and 66 for Pakistan,"" Basu points out.

""Among Bangladeshi adults with bank accounts, 34.1 percent made digital transactions in 2017, compared to an average rate of 27.8 percent for South Asia. Moreover, only 10.4 percent of Bangladeshi bank accounts are dormant (meaning there were no deposits or withdrawals in the previous year), compared to 48 percent of Indian bank accounts,"" Basu notes.

In contrast to India, entrepreneurs in Bangladesh have the advantage of weak labor laws which allow them to hire and fire workers and expand capacity to exploit economies of scale.

Downside

But there is a downside to the economic growth story. Corruption, cronyism, and inequality have tended to increase with economic growth. For instance. Non-Performing Loans in 14 banks had led to the loss of US$ 2.5 billion. Weak labor laws have made industrial safety an issue.

The Hasina regime has been lambasted for the use of the law and the police to suppress opponents. an unbridled force has been used to suppress Islamic terrorists and drug dealers, though observers note that vast sections of people are relieved that these vicious elements have been defanged.

The government had been indifferent to emotional protests such as the school kids' nation-wide agitation against the recklessness of bus drivers this year. World famous photographer Shahidul Alam was arrested and tortured for speaking to Al Jazeera on the agitation.

A 2014 promise to rule by consultation with various groups before taking key decisions has not been kept. This has given rise to a movement against a ""One Person State"" led by Dr.Kamal Hossain of the Jatiya Oikya Front (JOF), which includes the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by three times Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.

Prof. Ali Riaz of Illinois State University, writing in East Asian Forum says that the space for dissent in Bangladesh has shrunk ""remarkably"" in the past five years. The media has either been muzzled or co-opted, and journalists tend to exercise self-censorship. In November, the government enacted a draconian Digital Security Act which curtails freedom of expression.

Bangladesh has also experienced an ""exponential rise in extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances"". At least 456 people were killed and 83 people disappeared between January and November this year, Riaz notes.

But as pointed out earlier, it is learnt that the common man is more keen on law and order, fewer disruptions to his life, and lesser radicalism, than on adherence to Western standards of law enforcement.

Riaz says that the Election Commission (EC) has been failing to ensure a level playing field as it turns a blind eye to the ruling party's election code violations. Another observer said that the EC is going by the letter and not the spirit of the law. This has resulted in some anomalies. Candidatures have been rejected on technical, or as some say, frivolous grounds.

The Daily Star notes that as polling day gets nearer, more and more opposition BNP leaders are ""skidding off the race"". On Friday, five opposition aspirants lost their candidacies following a High Court order. The court had pointed out that the government had not accepted their resignations from the post of Upazila Chairmen. According to the Representation of the People Order (RPO), anyone holding ""an office of profit"" like that of an Upazila Chairman is barred from running for parliament.

With the five gone, the BNP now has no contenders in 15 of the 300 seats up for grabs in parliament (50 of the total of 350 seats are reserved for women chosen by Proportional Representation).

The High Court on Thursday directed the EC to allocate the BNP's symbol ""Sheaf of Paddy"" to four BNP candidates instead of their rivals who had been given the symbol earlier. This was because the candidates who had been given the symbol earlier, had not submitted their resignations to the concerned government department within a ""reasonable"" period.

Pale Shadow

One of the reasons for nominations backfiring is that the BNP of today is disorganized, and is but a pale shadow of what it was earlier. It's Supremo, the aging and unwell Khaleda Zia, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for corruption. Rules bar the use her pictures on BNP posters. Her son and political heir, Tarique Rahman, is a fugitive in the UK.

The BNP's structure is in disarray also because it debilitated itself by opting out of the last elections held in 2014. It quit the arena saying its demand for an independent election-time caretaker government was rejected.

Twenty two Jamaat-e-Islami leaders contesting under the BNP's electoral symbol ""sheaf of paddy"" await the Election Commission's decision on their candidacies. They had taken the BNP's ticket since the EC had scrapped the radical Islamic party's registration as a political party following a High Court ruling.

Aware that she had ruled with an iron fist and that she had not met all the expectations of the electorate, Sheikh Hasina has sought pardon and asked the people to give her another chance.

""To err is human. My colleagues and I might have made mistakes while performing our duties. I, on behalf of myself and my party, fervently request the countrymen to look kindly on our mistakes I promise to build a more beautiful future by learning from the past,"" Hasina she said when releasing her party Awami League's manifesto.

Awami League aims to increase GDP growth to 10% per annum from the present 7.8% in the next five years. It wants to bring down, by 2041, the poverty rate to zero from about 22% now. It promises to create jobs for 10 million plus youths, with foreign employment for 1,000 youths from each Upazila.

In contrast to Khaleda Zia, who alienated India, Hasina has been balancing varying interests very judiciously. She has been very friendly with India despite the dispute over Padma river waters. She pleased New Delhi by crushing Islamic terrorism. But she curbed Islamic terrorism without antagonizing the moderate Islamic lobby. She co-opted the Islamist Hifazat-e-Islam. And she accepted huge investments from China without antagonizing India in the process."

Under a full moon, as a stream of air force transports from a nearby base drone overhead, I join an enraptured crowd of parents at my daughter's school, as our children take the stage, bringing us music and messages, from new Indians for a new India. For four hours, they sing, reminding us of faith, discrimination, despair and the eventual triumph of hope.

They sing, in Kannada, keertanas of Kanakadasa, the 17th-century poet and musician who questioned the purity of caste. They use Bengali for Rabindranath Tagore's Chandalika, the drama of an ostracised, depressed low-caste girl and a Buddhist monk who changes her life by accepting water from her. In Tamil and Malayalam, they sing and dance to a theyyam, a ritual form of worship, in which a Hindu high priest, a shankaracharya, is taught a lesson against discrimination. In English, they enact the story of Ekalavya, the boy from a low-caste forest tribe who bested Arjuna, the great warrior of the epic Mahabharata (with some writer's licence: when a disciple of guru Dronacharya hears Ekalavya learned some archery from his mother, he asks, ""A woman knows archery? Kaise din aa gaye?"" The quick response from his friend, ""Acche din."")

For the last hour, a 65-student choir brings alive the soaring, sometimes depressing but always powerful songs of segregation-era United States of America, old African-American spirituals and modern variations, delivered under balmy South Indian skies. These are, equally, songs for India, delivered under the theme ""Who tells your story?"" The theme for the evening is discrimination - a timely reminder of our multiple cultures and stories and the battles fought over the rights of the marginalised.

In the country beyond, the war for rights has intensified. This is a country that increasingly struggles with discrimination and violence against its minorities and whose rulers are willing to subvert the rule of law and the Constitution to pander to virulent majoritarianism. The concert reminds us that there are yet questions that must be asked, hope that must be spread and songs that must be sung.

Those questions may well be addressing the head of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, Amit Shah, who said a day earlier (on Wednesday) that the ""entire country wants a grand Ram temple"" in Ayodhya ""at the exact spot"" where once there was the Babri Masjid - of course, he would not take its name. His friendly advice to the Supreme Court: the Ayodhya case can be finished in 10 days if the judges conduct hearings every day.

To pick divisive issues - however irrelevant they may be to India's national interests or public concerns - is now standard operating procedure for the BJP. The party's chief minister in Uttar Pradesh, Adityanath, calls the murder of a police officer by cow vigilantes an ""accident"", at other times a conspiracy. His fellow member of the legislative Assembly, Sanjay Sharma, in dismissing the demand from more than 80 former civil servants for Adityanath's resignation - for perverting ""fundamental principles of governance, of constitutional ethics and of humane social conduct"" - says the ""enlightened minds"" could only see the death of two human beings and not 21 ""gau matas"" or mother cows.

From far corners of the country and the extended Hindu ruling party, the messages of hate and abhorrence of Muslims and Dalits pour out, intensifying as India stands on the threshold of its 17th general elections.

This is what India has come to - a grand idea of hope, togetherness and belonging, irrespective of caste and creed, reduced to the despair of divisiveness. In less than four years, the politics of development, sabka saath, sabka vikas, of being with everyone, of ensuring everyone's progress, has crumbled to the politics of the graveyard - the word itself used as a warning - statues and temples.

The BJP and its yet-mighty master, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, may or may not survive the party's politics of hype and hate, especially if the resurgence of the Congress and other contenders continues into 2019. But the messages that the BJP spreads in a desperate effort to realise Shah's ambition of a 50-year reign will not disappear easily.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi does speak, occasionally, of love and compassion, but he acknowledges his subservience to the BJP's message - by visiting temples, flaunting his sacred thread and tiptoeing around matters that test India's Constitution, its rule of law and secularism.

There appear to be more pressing concerns, the most important being the decline of Indian farming, which supports more than 670 million Indians. But no administration can hold together and focus its attention on agrarian transition and unemployment when its attention is diverted by the howling mob and the prospect of anarchy.

The mob is, usually, the semi-educated, semi-employed, semi-urban youth frustrated by the death of dreams. To reduce his - the mob is almost always male - dreams to a temple and clear his path to getting it somehow, anyhow, is to frustrate him further and threaten the foundations of the republic.

The radicalised youth, brainwashed and filled with hate, defines himself by his religion, but he does not know its practices and its traditions. He does not know of its infirmities, the inequities it spawns; he does not see why hate must be discarded, and he has forgotten the true meaning of his faith.

In speaking for all of us and demanding nothing but the grand temple to Ram, Shah urges more young men into the mob. What he will not discuss is the other tradition of Ram, derived from the glory of hope.

""Not a grand Ram temple, not a Ram colossus,"" the poet Ranjit Hoskote tells me on Twitter as I write this, ""but that forgotten ideal of whom Surdas sang and Gandhiji spoke: Nirbal ke bal Raam, the Ram who is the power of the powerless."" These are messages that must shine through the darkness, that give us glimpses of the glory that could be, of the battle ahead.

And, so, they sing into the night at the school in Bengaluru. ""One day, when the glory comes,"" they sing, ""it will be ours, it will be ours. One day, when the war is won, we will be sure, we will be sure."""

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

CRIMINAL APPEAL No(s). 2229 OF 2011

STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH Vs PREETAM

R. BANUMATHI, J.:

Citation: AIR 2018 SC 4212 : 2018 (4) JLJR 24 : 2018 (4) PLJR 62 : 2018 (11) Scale 120

(1) This appeal arises out of judgment and order dated 6th

January, 2010 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at

Jabalpur in Criminal Appeal NO.228 of 1995 in which the High

Court reversed the verdict of the conviction under Section 376

I.P.C. and also the sentence of imprisonment of seven years and

acquitted the respondent-accused.

(2) Despite service of notice, the respondent has not chosen

to appear and contest this appeal. Accordingly Ms. Nidhi,

Advocate, has been appointed by the Supreme Court Legal

Services Committee as amicus to contest the appeal on behalf of

the respondent.

(3) We have heard Ms. Swarupama Chaturvedi, learned counsel

appearing for the appellant-State and Ms. Nidhi, learned

amicus, and also perused the impugned judgment and the

evidence/materials on record.

(4) The facts of the case in a nutshell are as follows. On 6th

March, 1993 at about 9.00 p.m. the prosecutrix (PW-1) along

2

with her two sisters i.e. Hirkanbai (PW-3) and Anitabai had

gone outside the village to a field to attend nature's call and

while returning back the respondent-accused is alleged to have

forcibly taken the prosecutrix to the field and committed rape

on her.

(5) Since the Moti Ram (PW-2) who is father of Hirkanbai (PW-

3) and also uncle (chacha) of the prosecutrix was not in the

village, on his return a complaint was lodged on 8th March,

1993. The prosecutrix was medically examined on 9th March, 1993

by Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6), who has noted that the hymen of

prosecutrix was torn; swelling was present on the edges of torn

hymen. Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6) has opined that though vagina of

the prosecutrix was admitted two fingers easily, the

prosecutrix felt pain and the doctor (PW-6) has opined that the

prosecutrix was subjected to sexual intercourse within 2-3 days

of examination.

(6) Based upon the evidence of prosecutrix (PW-1) and

Mangrulal (PW-4) who went to the place of occurrence after

having been told by Anita and saw the accused running from

there and also on the evidence of Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6), the

trial court convicted the respondent-accused under Section 376

I.P.C. and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment for a period

of seven years.

(7) On appeal, the High Court has reversed the verdict of

conviction on the grounds:- (i) There was no external injury on

3

the person of prosecutrix (PW-1) which is indicative of her

consent for the sexual intercourse and, therefore, the story of

forcible rape does not find support from the medical evidence;

(ii) There was delay in registration of the FIR.

(8) As pointed out earlier as per PW-6-Dr. Vasnik's evidence

the hymen of the prosecutrix (PW-1) was torn and swelling was

present in the vagina having redness. Doctor has noticed that

even though vagina admitted of two fingers, the prosecutrix

felt pain which is suggestive that the prosecutrix was

subjected to sexual intercourse only in the occurrence.

(9) It is fairly well-settled that in the absence of external

injury on the person of the prosecutrix, it cannot be concluded

that the incident had taken place with the consent of the

prosecutrix. It depends upon the facts and circumstances of

each case. In B.C. Deva alias Dyava v. State of Karnataka,

(2007) 12 SCC 122, this Court has held that absence of injury

on the person of the victim of rape does not lead to an

inference that the accused did not commit forcible sexual

intercourse. It was further held that even in the absence of

external injury, the oral testimony of the prosecutrix that she

was subjected to rape, cannot be ignored.

(10) In the present case evidence of prosecutrix (PW-1) is

supported by the medical evidence and also by the evidence of

Mangrulal (PW-4) who saw the accused running away from the

scene of occurrence. Insofar as the consent of the prosecutrix

4

(PW-1) pointed out by the High Court is concerned, we find it

difficult to agree with the view taken by the High Court. In

her chief examination, Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6) has stated that

the age of the victim could be between 13 and 17 years. Of

course in her cross-examination, Dr. Vasnik has agreed to the

suggestion that the age of the victim could be 17 years.

(11) In our considered view, the answer elucidated in the

cross-examination of Dr. Vasnik (PW-6) cannot be taken as a

final opinion on the age of the prosecutrix (PW-1). It is to

be relevant to note that before the trial court the prosecution

has examined Bhaulal (PW-8), Head master/Head teacher of

Primary School Chor Pind Ke Par, District Balaghat. In his

evidence, Bhaulal (PW-8) has stated that the date of birth of

the prosecutrix (PW-1) was 16th May, 1981 which means that on

the date of the occurrence i.e. 6th March, 1993, the prosecutrix

(PW-1) was only aged about 12 years. The trial court has

neither acted upon the evidence of Bhaulal (PW-8) nor on the

school certificate on the ground that the person who has

admitted the prosecutrix in the school was not examined.

(12) In our considered view, the approach of the trial court

was not correct. In each and every case the prosecution cannot

be expected to examine the person who has admitted a student in

the school. The school registers are the authentic documents

being maintained in the official course, entitled to credence

of much weight unless proved otherwise. In our view,

considering the evidence of head master, Bhaulal (PW-8), and

the school certificate produced by him i.e. Ex.P/13-A, age of

the victim has to be taken as 12 years at the time of

occurrence.

(13) Of course, Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6) in her chief examination

has stated that the age of the prosecutrix would be between 13

and 17 years. At the most, adopting the doctor's evidence, age

of the prosecutrix at the relevant point of time can only be

around 15 years. As per Section 375 I.P.C. a man is said to

commit rape, Sixthly - ""With or without her consent, when she

is under sixteen years of age"". The prosecutrix being aged 12

years at the time of the occurrence, her consent or otherwise

was of no relevance to bring the offence within the meaning of

Section 375 I.P.C. In our considered view the High Court

ignored the material evidence adduced by the prosecution and

erred in reversing the conviction of the respondent-accused.

(14) So far as the other ground of acquittal - delay in

registration of the F.I.R. is concerned, it has come on the

record that the uncle of the prosecutrix, Moti Ram (PW-2), was

not in the village and returned back to the village only on 8th

March, 1993 and on his return his daughter-Hirkanbai (PW-3),

has narrated the whole incident to him as to what happened to

the prosecutrix (PW-1) and a complaint was lodged on the same

day i.e. 8th March, 1993. After medical examination of the

prosecutrix (PW-1) on 9th March, 1993, F.I.R. was registered on

10th March, 1993 and the delay in registration of the F.I.R. has

been properly explained, which has not been considered by the

High Court.

(15) The impugned judgment of the High Court reversing the

conviction of the respondent to acquittal, cannot be sustained

and the same is liable to be set aside and the judgment of the

trial court convicting the respondent under Section 376 I.P.C.

is to be restored. The trial court has sentenced the

respondent-accused to undergo imprisonment for a period of

seven years.

(16) Prior to the Amendment Act 13 of 2013 (w.e.f. 3rd

February, 2013) under Section 376(1) I.P.C. the sentence of

imprisonment for a term shall not be less than 7 years

extending for life. However, as per the proviso to 376(1)

I.P.C. (prior to amendment) discretion is vested with the Court

to impose imprisonment for a term of less than seven years for

adequate and special reasons to be recorded in the judgment.

In this case, the occurrence was of the year 1993 i.e. about 25

years ago. Having regard to the passage of time and other

facts and circumstances of the case, the sentence of

imprisonment of seven years imposed on the respondent-accused

is reduced to a period of four years.

(17) Accordingly the appeal preferred by the State is allowed

and the conviction of the respondent-accused under Section 376

I.P.C. as passed by the trial court is restored. However, the

period of sentence of seven years, as noted above, is reduced

to four years.

(18) In case the respondent has not already undergone the

sentence of imprisonment of four years, he is to surrender to

custody within a period of fours weeks from today to serve the

remaining sentence failing which he shall be taken to custody.

(19) A copy of this order be sent to the concerned trial court

for necessary action.

With no clear response from the school administration, Kharjana moved the Meghalaya high court.

He has presided over near constant turmoil as he has increasingly relied on his own instincts. In just the past week, the flurry of activity has rocked the government, the military and the markets.

Two of NYT's White House correspondents write:

""At the midpoint of his term, Trump has grown more sure of his own judgment and more cut off from anyone else's than at any point since taking office.""

Here's a look at the major events -- some high, some low -- that have undoubtedly shaped Trump's thinking heading into 2019.

January

-- The government shut down for three days starting at 12:01 am on January 20.

-- The US Embassy in Israel was moved to Jerusalem. The same day, mass protests along the Gaza border raged anew.

-- The Department of Homeland Security enacted a ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy, causing the forced separation of migrant families at the border.

June

The Moyar-Bhavani landscape in Tamil Nadu is flanked by Karnataka in the north and Kerala in the west. It represents a diverse habitat with dense forests, agricultural lands and human settlements. Here, invasive plants like Lantana camara and Prosopis juliflora impact the growth of local species, groundwater, availability of fodder, and thus the rural communities.

The Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), along with Keystone Foundation, a non-governmental organisation in Kotagiri, and World Wildlife Fund embarked on a citizen science approach to map invasive plants with an Android-based application.

Earlier on, ATREE had started off a campaign called ""Spotting Invasive Alien Species"" or SPAIS on India Biodiversity Portal, where anyone could easily record spotting these species. Inspired by South Africa's volunteer-driven invasive mapping tool called South African Plant Invader Atlas, ATREE launched SPAIS to map the occurrences of 20 common and easily identifiable alien invasive species anywhere in India. Almost 473 observations were recorded on this citizen campaign across India.

Ankila Hiremath, fellow, ATREE, said, ""We had two objectives with SPAIS. One, to create a lot of buzz about invasives because that is not something lot of people think about. The other one was to record occurrences.""

She added, ""Though a lot of people joined the campaign, we realised that in terms of information, it would be useful to know which species are more widespread than others. Non-occurrence does not mean that the species is not there. The map had a lot of holes. We thought that our next step would be to become systematic.""

Milind Bunyan, research scientist, ATREE, said, ""The campaign gave great information on invasives; however, what it did not give us was two things. One, it did not give us information on how bad the invasion is. For instance, was there only one lantana or was the area covered in lantana? Secondly, if we have a map where there is no lantana, does it mean that there was no lantana, no one went there, or even if they went there, were they not able to recognise it?""

As the earlier efforts could not capture this specific information, a new grid approach was started to map invasive plants. Called PARDESI (Participatory Assessment of the Regional Distribution of Exotic Species in India), the approach aimed to combine a systematic approach and vegetation sampling with citizen science.

The initial effort of mapping invasives (SPAIS) focused on country-wide mapping whereas the latest approach, PARDESI, looked at working at a more localised landscape and adopting a refined approach.

Bunyan said, ""This has been done in South Africa, one of the global leaders in invasive species mapping. Through SAPIA [South African Plant Invader Atlas], they imposed grids in the entire country. And on these grids, they mapped invasives. We thought why not take this and try on a smaller scale in India at Moyar-Bhavani basin.""

The researchers chose species that were most abundant and widespread.

""We made a list of 87 species and then shortlisted it to 27 with the help of experts,"" said Bunyan.

A 10 by 10 square km grid was created in the Moyar-Bhavani basin. Within each grid, invasive species were recorded using the Open Data Kit app, an open source software used for collecting and managing data. This Android application, which can be used on smartphones and tablets, makes data collection and recording easier for researchers, forest department officials, and school children.

A form was created in this app, where one could record the presence, density, type of invasives and GPS location. Density of invasives was recorded as a percentage cover from 10% as lowest to non-existent to 90%, where an invasive species covered large areas.

Keystone Foundation, an organisation that works in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, trained school and college students by introducing the concept of invasives, why they are a threat and their impacts on the ecosystem and indirectly on human health. For identification, a poster was designed specifically, with images of the 27 invasives shortlisted from the area.

Shiny Rehel, programme coordinator (biodiversity and eco-restoration), Keystone Foundation, said, ""One of the key areas was to involve local skills, like schools. For that, it was important for them to understand how to enter the data. We gave students hands-on training, took them to the field, and were ready to answer their queries. We also gave them devices to record information.""

Bunyan said, ""Lantana looks very different on the poster and very different on the field. We need to know what it actually looks like on field, and that was the actual idea. With Keystone Foundation, the students did an invasive species walk, and collected vegetation and invasives data.""

Rehel added, ""If they found species other than the listed 27 species, they would write notes - for instance, was it mosaic landscape, was it a shrub, and so on.""

As smartphones are equipped with GPS and camera, the data is verifiable. When volunteers are at a particular point, they record the GPS location, and can also take a picture of the species. ""We will know the area, can locate the space, and can check if there is any misidentification,"" said Bunyan.

As it was a volunteer effort, it did not require high investment and could be done part-time. However, volunteers could not be asked to venture into deeper forests for sampling, unlike ecologists. Also, they could not collect data only from one road, as this could sometimes lead to data bias.

""We had to balance this. As people are volunteers, we wanted this to be easy for them,"" said Bunyan. ""We asked teams to pre-identify roads that maximise coverage of the grid. You don't want three roads that are in one corner, you want to spread across the landscape. We tried to get the major land uses, for example, if you have towns, and a tea garden, they sampled a little bit of road, a little bit of tea garden. If there was a tea garden and a forest, the survey was distributed in both the areas than focusing on just one part of the landscape. These were some ways of getting around bias.""

There would be two outputs for PARDESI. One, an idea of how invasives occur across the entire landscape and how dominant they are. The data can also show how bad the invasion is in a certain point. Bunyan said, ""When you overlay the output for 27 species, you can identify 'invasive hotspots'. For instance, this is where five invasive species occur, or this is where lantana is abundant.""

The pilots were carried out over approximately 1,500 square km. The targeted information will be useful for land managers, forest managers, Public Works Department officials and so on.

Bunyan believes that the best place to remove invasives are those areas where they are just coming in, as compared to those where invasives are wide-spread. ""If we push back the area where invasives are just coming in, we could possibly save the landscape,"" said Bunyan.

With High Courts such as the Madurai High Court ordering the removal of invasives like Acacia and Prosopis, there is a serious effort to act on this issue. ""This invasive map will give them the data, and where they can actually target on removing these first,"" added Bunyan.

ATREE trained forest department officials on invasives and using the Open Data Kit app, and hopes to conduct more workshops in future.

Bunyan said, ""Some state forest departments, like the Tamil Nadu forest department, is showing interest. If this works out, we can do this across the entire Western Ghats, and have a similar atlas like South Africa.""

Hiremath added, ""We are in the process of looking at the data, and how we need to refine or tweak to take it further.""

Citizen science is slowly gaining popularity in India with such initiatives. Earlier, scientists had doubt of authenticity regarding data collected by citizen scientists. Hiremath said, ""Studies are showing that with a little bit of training, that is less of an issue. There is a lot of potential in the future. Further, there is indirect impact on conservation as well. It has created a larger population of people interested in conservation."""

For the first time in the history of Kerala a mass movement is building up against hartal which eats up around Rs 2,000 crore direct and indirect revenue of the state. Now, an anti-hartal movement is gaining momentum with numerous organisations coming out against this age-old mode of protest. The Joint Action Council Against Hartal (JACAH) hopes to put pressure on political parties to end such strikes, which paralyse normal life.

Stakeholders in sectors like industry, tourism, retail, transport, realty, hotels and education have already expressed their resentment toward hartals. The JACAH, which comprises TiE, KMA, IMA, CII, FICCI, KSSIA, coir manufacturers, Kerala Chamber of Commerce, Cochin Chamber of Commerce, Indian Chamber of Commerce, NASSCOM, KTM, CREDAI, Private Bus Owners Association, Vyapari Vyavasai Ekopana Samithi, Hotel and Restaurant Association, Bakers Association and CBSE School Association, has decided to unitedly move against hartal in the state. Interestingly, there are around 10 villages in the state which do not cooperate with hartals.

Raju P Nair, who spearheads 'Say No To Hartal' campaign, said a collective effort from the public will put pressure on the political parties against announcing hartals. 'Say No To Hartal' began in 2010 and its members arrange transport facilities for those stranded on hartal days. ""Already, the public protest against hartal has forced political parties to reduce the number of state-wide hartals. Now, mostly district and regional-level strikes are being called by political outfits.

However, such a strike is an infringement of the rights of the public. So, by collective effort, the public should put pressure on political parties. There may be setbacks initially, but if the resistance lasts long, the political parties will have to give up hartals,"" said Raju, who is also the Congress DCC secretary.

According to him, during the tenure of the UDF Government, there was a study conducted about the losses incurred during a hartal. The direct loss for the government was estimated to be around Rs 900 crore from one hartal. If indirect revenue generation is taken into consideration, the loss is more than Rs 2,000 crore.

Dr S Sajikumar, Confederation of India Industry (CII) Kerala State Council chairman and MD of Dhathri Ayurveda Pvt Ltd, said the loss from the hartal is between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 crore. ""When attempts are made to attract new investors and industries to Kerala, hartals are affecting the perception of investors about the state. The production loss for the industries is severe during hartal days. The worst affected are daily wage workers. If the political parties have any consideration for these daily wage workers, they should give up this kind of protest,"" he said.

S Gopakumar, president of Better Kochi Response Group which is also part of JACAH, said attempts will be made for a political solution to tackle the hartal menace. Discussions have to be held with political parties against the total shutdown during such strikes.

""Our intention is to create a collective conscience against hartal among the public. We want the public to come out against hartals. There is a general fear among the public they will be attacked and vehicles will be destroyed. If a collective drive against hartal emerges, no one can forcefully stop people from going to work or opening shops. We are looking to counter hartal using the legal channel as well.

The person who announces a hartal should be held responsible for the damage. Insurance coverage for the destruction is under discussion which will help traders and bus operators to function during hartal days,"" he said.

Private Bus Operators Association president M B Sathyan said private buses are ready to operate on hartal days. A discussion will be held with traders' organisation over sharing the damage incurred while operating buses on a hartal day. For bus owners, the hartal is a nightmare. It is estimated a bus owner suffers a loss of Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 from a hartal.

""A bus owner has to pay a tax of Rs 30,000 for three months, and the insurance amount is in the range of Rs 60,000 to Rs 80,000. The buses are bought by taking loans from banks for which a hefty interest is paid. For operators, the daily collection is important for survival and such strikes severely affect the revenue. Political parties have nothing to lose from the hartal. Already, due to low profit, the number of private buses is coming down annually. Earlier, when there were 30,000 private transport buses in the state, it has come down to 14,000 now,"" he said.

The tourism industry is the worst hit from frequent hartals as it incurred a loss of Rs 300 crore per day. As the tourist footfalls have already come down due to the Nipah scare and the flood, the industry cannot afford frequent hartals. ""Each day, there are around 70,000 tourists staying in the state.

On a hartal day, a huge number of tourist are jailed in their hotels. After suffering from the hartal, the tourists will not prefer to visit Kerala again. During a hartal last month, a convoy of German tourist was attacked at Kozhikode. Such incidents will directly affect the tourism industry,"" Abraham George, convenor of Kerala Tourism Task Force and member of National Tourism Advisory Council, said.

Recently, tourism stakeholders held a meeting in Kochi and passed a six-point resolution to withstand hartals in future. They also decided to file contempt of court against non-implementation of directives by the Supreme Court and High Court against hartal. Kerala Vyapari Vyavasai Ekopana Samithi (KVVES) which held a meeting at Kozhikode decided to observe 2019 as a hartal-free year. KVVES president T Naseeruddin said traders will cooperate with hartals no more.

""We have directed all the traders to open the shops on a hartal day. The buses will operate and industries will function. Only a joint effort can put an end to this practice,"" he said.

Driving with headlights on during day to register protest against hartal

Kochi: In a novel way of protest, those opposed to hartal will drive their vehicles with the headlights turned on during the day on Monday. Already publicised through social media, Say No To Hartal, the organiser of the event, is looking for mass participation.

Raju P Nair, who leads Say No To Hartal, said people who are against hartal can keep the headlight of their vehicles on during the daytime. ""By joining the campaign, people are not only expressing their protest against hartal, but also emphasising protection of human rights. Every Indian citizen has the freedom to work and travel which is violated during hartals. We expect all the persons who support the campaign to keep the headlights of the motorbike, car and bigger vehicles on during the daytime on Monday,"" he said.

A vehicle rally will be carried out at Kaloor Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium premises protesting against hartal around 9 am. Apart from it, district-level protests will also be carried out in the coming days. Say No To Hartal has been actively campaigning against hartal for the past eight years. The campaign is gaining popularity as more number of people are joining it every year."

I am calling Shaktikanta Das as a corrupt person. I am surprised that the man I got removed from the Finance Ministry for corruption was brought in as governor.""

Das was appointed as the RBI Governor earlier this month after Urjit Patel announced his shock resignation from the top post of the Indian federal bank amidst serious differences with the government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Swamy said that he would preferred Professor R Vaidyanathan for the top post in the RBI since was an 'old Sangh man.' He was quoted by Indian Express, ""Professor R Vaidyanathan, former professor of finance (IIM-B), would have been much better. He is also old Sangh man. He is our man.""

Soon after Das was appointed to succeed Patel, Swamy had reacted angrily to his appointment. He had even written a letter to PM Modi against the decision. Swamy had said, ""Shaktikanta Das being appointed as RBI Governor is wrong, he has worked closely in corrupt activities with P Chidambaram and even tried to save him in court cases. I don't know why this was done, I have written a letter to PM against this decision.""

The appointment of Das had evoked angry reactions from journalists too because of his questionable role during the demonetisation. Journalist ParanjoyGuha Thakurta had written, ""Shaktikanta Das to be the next Governor of Reserve Bank of India: Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. He was a great supporter of demonetisation.

Aadhaar, India's extraordinary attempt to give every citizen a biometric identity, is set for a massive revamp with new offline verification tools and non-intrusive ways for people seeking to voluntarily use the 12-digit unique number for new bank accounts and mobile connections.

After twists and turns in 2018, led by the landmark Supreme Court ruling on the constitutional validity of Aadhaar, the UIDAI's efforts around offline modes like eAadhaar and QR code that can leverage the unique ID without any access to biometrics or even revealing the 12-digit number would gather pace in 2019.

From school admissions to getting marriage certificates to paying taxes to taking new mobile connections, Aadhaar touched multiple facets of people's lives as it became the default identifier. This was true for around 1.22 billion Aadhaar holders till doubts emerged that collection of biometric details, even for general service, could infringe on a citizen's privacy rights.

Then, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the world's largest biometric identification database but spelt out its new limitations.

After last year's assertion that Indians have a right to privacy, the apex court in September 2018 redefined the boundaries of the biometric authentication -- Aadhaar can be used for payment of government benefits and taxation records but private companies were barred from accessing it.

In a 4-1 judgement delivered by the Constitution Bench, the Supreme Court held that Aadhaar would remain compulsory for the filing of Income Tax (IT) returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN)

However, Section 57 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 that permitted private entities like telecom companies or other corporates to use the biometric data was struck down, dealing a body blow to the government's ambitions to make the world's largest biometric project mandatory for a slew of services.

The landmark ruling sent banks, telecom operators and fintech companies -- who relied heavily on Aadhaar eKYC -- scrambling in search of other viable means of customer verification.

As the verdict meant that fulfilling regulatory Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements would have again involved a lot of paperwork for verification purposes, Aadhaar-issuing authority, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), quickly came up with alternate modes like QR (Quick Response) codes, e-Aadhaar and offline methods.

Just as 2018 started to wind down, came another twist in the plot. Earlier this month, the government decided to propose changes to existing laws - Telegraph Act and PMLA - in order to allow the use of Aadhaar as an ID verification tool for opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections, albeit on a voluntary basis. Additionally, fresh penal provisions have been proposed - through an amendment in Aadhaar Act - to deter companies from insisting on Aadhaar or misusing the biometric data.

The proposed amendments, which will be placed before the Parliament during the ongoing Winter session, propose to arm UIDAI with regulator-like powers to take enforcement actions on the misuse of the national biometric ID and impose stiff penalties on violations.

The compelling reason behind this seems to be the government's belief in the transformative potential of Aadhaar -- the system is so cheap and efficient that it is estimated to have accounted for over 90 per cent of new subscriptions in the telecom sector, according to experts.

More stringent deterrents are likely to be put in place in the coming months. These might include a penalty for failure to obtain consent for authentication or offline verification -- up to three-year imprisonment or fine of up to Rs 10,000 --, penalty for unauthorised use of core biometric information. The latter could attract imprisonment between 3-10 years and a fine of up to Rs 10,000.

Even as it dons regulatory role, the UIDAI would continue to accelerate efforts to transform and scale up Aadhaar enrolment and update services, currently available through 30,000 centres operating in designated bank branches, post offices and government premises across the country.

'Aadhaar Seva Kendras', similar to the concept of Passport Seva Kendras, will come up in 53 cities across India at an estimated project cost of Rs 300-400 crore. These swanky new centres will be operational by August next year, dishing out appointment-based enrolment, update and other miscellaneous services around Aadhaar, under the watchful eyes of authority's own employees.

Earlier this year, former UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey, recalling his early years as a small-town boy who didn't hold a photo identity for a long time, had reportedly said that Aadhaar offered an answer to an ancient question that was asked by sages -- who am I?

The year that was, ensured that the answer continues to be the 12-digit identifier, at least for those who choose to use it.

However, Section 57 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 that permitted private entities like telecom companies or other corporates to use the biometric data was struck down, dealing a body blow to the government's ambitions to make the world's largest biometric project mandatory for a slew of services.

The landmark ruling sent banks, telecom operators and fintech companies -- who relied heavily on Aadhaar eKYC -- scrambling in search of other viable means of customer verification.

As the verdict meant that fulfilling regulatory Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements would have again involved a lot of paperwork for verification purposes, Aadhaar-issuing authority, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), quickly came up with alternate modes like QR (Quick Response) codes, e-Aadhaar and offline methods.

Just as 2018 started to wind down, came another twist in the plot. Earlier this month, the government decided to propose changes to existing laws - Telegraph Act and PMLA - in order to allow the use of Aadhaar as an ID verification tool for opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections, albeit on a voluntary basis. Additionally, fresh penal provisions have been proposed - through an amendment in Aadhaar Act - to deter companies from insisting on Aadhaar or misusing the biometric data.

The proposed amendments, which will be placed before the Parliament during the ongoing Winter session, propose to arm UIDAI with regulator-like powers to take enforcement actions on the misuse of the national biometric ID and impose stiff penalties on violations.

The compelling reason behind this seems to be the government's belief in the transformative potential of Aadhaar -- the system is so cheap and efficient that it is estimated to have accounted for over 90 per cent of new subscriptions in the telecom sector, according to experts.

More stringent deterrents are likely to be put in place in the coming months. These might include a penalty for failure to obtain consent for authentication or offline verification -- up to three-year imprisonment or fine of up to Rs 10,000 --, penalty for unauthorised use of core biometric information. The latter could attract imprisonment between 3-10 years and a fine of up to Rs 10,000.

Even as it dons regulatory role, the UIDAI would continue to accelerate efforts to transform and scale up Aadhaar enrolment and update services, currently available through 30,000 centres operating in designated bank branches, post offices and government premises across the country.

'Aadhaar Seva Kendras', similar to the concept of Passport Seva Kendras, will come up in 53 cities across India at an estimated project cost of Rs 300-400 crore. These swanky new centres will be operational by August next year, dishing out appointment-based enrolment, update and other miscellaneous services around Aadhaar, under the watchful eyes of authority's own employees.

Earlier this year, former UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey, recalling his early years as a small-town boy who didn't hold a photo identity for a long time, had reportedly said that Aadhaar offered an answer to an ancient question that was asked by sages -- who am I?

The year that was, ensured that the answer continues to be the 12-digit identifier, at least for those who choose to use it."

"367","1024946811","2018-12-23","https://indianexpress.com/article/business/ghosns-detention-puts-japan-justice-system-under-microscope-5505935/","Carlos Ghosn's detention puts Japan justice system under microscope","The Indian Express",FALSE,"Ghosn's case is drawing attention to the criminal justice system in Japan, where there is no presumption of innocence and the accused can be held for months before trial.

Since his arrest on suspicion of falsifying financial reports, Nissan's former Chairman Carlos Ghosn has been sitting in a humble cell for more than a month, interrogated day in and day out, without a lawyer present.

His case is drawing attention to the criminal justice system in Japan, where there is no presumption of innocence and the accused can be held for months before trial. The system, sometimes called ""hostage justice"" has come under fire from human rights advocates.

When a court denied Tokyo prosecutors' request to detain Ghosn another 10 days on Dec 20, it was so unusual that the Japanese media reported he might be released. But such speculation was dashed when prosecutors rearrested him a day later on suspicion of breach of trust, tagging on a new set of allegations centered on Ghosn's shifting personal investment losses of some 1.8 billion yen ($16 million) to Nissan Motor Co.

But his plight is routine in Japan. People have signed confessions, even to killings they never committed, just to get out of the ordeal.

Advertising

A trial could be months away and could drag on even longer. And his chances aren't good: The conviction rate in Japan is 99 percent.

Those close to Ghosn and his family say he is asserting his innocence. But it is unclear when release may come for Ghosn, who led a two-decade turnaround at Nissan from near-bankruptcy. Tokyo prosecutors consider Ghosn, a Brazilian-born Frenchman of Lebanese ancestry, a flight risk.

Other nations may have legal systems that are criticized as brutal and unfair. The U.S., for instance, has its share of erroneous convictions, police brutality and dubious plea bargains. But, in the U.S., a person is presumed innocent, has the right to have an attorney present and gets freed within 72 hours if there is no charge.

Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond's School of Law, said such a longtime detention is highly unusual in the U.S.

""Each time the government reaches a deadline where Ghosn might be released, the government files new allegations and rearrests,"" he said.

Deputy Chief Prosecutor Shin Kukimoto said prosecutors are merely doing their job of ""trying to carry out a proper investigation.""

When asked by a reporter about ""hostage justice,"" he replied: ""We are not in a position to comment on how the law has been designed.""

Under such a system, those who insist on innocence end up getting detained longer. Once the rearrest processes run out and a suspect is formally charged, bail is technically possible but often denied until the trial starts because of fears about tampered evidence.

""It is good that the world will learn how wrong Japan's criminal system is through the case of this famous person. It is something even many Japanese don't know,"" says Seiho Cho, a lawyer in Tokyo and an expert on criminal defense. ""Countless people have gone through horrible experiences.""

A famous case is Iwao Hakamada, a professional boxer, who served 48 years in prison, mostly on death row after he signed a confession under questioning and was convicted of killing a family of four. He was freed in 2014 after DNA tests determined blood at the crime scene wasn't Hakamada's, and a court ruled police had likely planted evidence. Boxing champions had rallied on his behalf.

A true-life story of a man who refused to sign a confession that he groped a woman on a crowded commuter train became a popular 2007 movie ""I Just Didn't Do It,"" directed by Masayuki Suo. The film depicts a five-year legal battle for exoneration, highlighting the burden of proof of innocence was on the accused.

In the U.S., defense lawyers tend to be vocal, but in Japan, it is fairly standard _ as in the case of Ghosn _ for them to stay silent, especially before trial, because that's considered better for the suspects. Lawyers are allowed to visit clients in detention.

Ghosn has been formally charged in the initial set of allegations, underreporting his income by about 5 billion yen ($44 million) for five years through 2015. The maximum penalty for violating Japan's financial laws is 10 years in prison, a 10 million yen ($89,000) fine, or both.

Greg Kelly, an American Nissan executive who was arrested with Ghosn, has been similarly charged with collaborating on underreporting Ghosn's income. Kelly was not rearrested on the latest breach of trust allegations. Kelly's U.S. lawyer says he is innocent and abided by company policy.

Nissan has also been charged as a legal entity, but no person besides Ghosn and Kelly has been charged or arrested. Nissan executives repeatedly say an internal investigation that began in the summer showed clear and serious wrongdoing, which went unnoticed for so long because of complex schemes ""masterminded"" by Ghosn and Kelly.

They went to the prosecutors, resulting in the surprise Nov. 19 arrests, and are cooperating closely with the investigation.

Being accused of a crime is devastating in a conformist insular society like Japan. Family members also become targets of discrimination, spurned for marriage and ostracized. Some commit suicide.

Cho, the lawyer, said the long detention and trial mean people lose their jobs, reputation, sometimes their families. But he still had this advice: Whatever you do, don't confess to anything you didn't do as that just makes it worse.

""Don't ever compromise on your innocence,"" he said."

This was the India-South Africa one-day international game at Nagpur. It was March 19, 2000; IPL wasn't yet born. India wasn't used to watching spinners bowl to opening batsmen. It was also the winter when a bunch of Delhi policemen became more insightful about the game than most top cricket pundits. While getting wiser, they would also get disillusioned.

Within 18 days, Inspector Ishwar Singh had filed a complaint with charges of match-fixing against Cronje, London-based businessman Sanjeev Chawla and four of his associates. It had details of how Chawla and Cronje fixed team scores, and mentioned the role of four other South African players, including Herschelle Gibbs. A couple of years later, Cronje died in a plane crash. Now, 18 years after he left the country, last month, a UK court ordered Chawla's extradition.

Recalling the untimely death of the cricket fan inside him, Om Prakash, now 49 and a head constable, laments, ""I loved Ajay Jadeja, but it all changed. I haven't seen a game since 2000.""

-- --

Nothing had prepared the two constables for the role they were to play in cricket's coincidental unmasking -- which started with their boss, Inspector Ishwar Singh, asking them to be part of an extortion investigation in early 2000. It was a textbook case of those times -- a suspected Chhota Shakeel and

D Company operative from Dubai, Shaheen Haitheley, had threatened an Old Delhi businessman to cough up Rs 5 crore.

A background check of those in touch with Haitheley threw up a Bollywood name -- Krishan Kumar, a failed actor and brother of late T-Series founder Gulshan Kumar. BSNL was roped in -- whenever Kumar's cellphone rang, a landline on the top floor of the Delhi Police's R K Puram office too came alive.

Ishwar is tickled as he recalls those early days of phone-tapping. ""It was all very primitive, nothing like the computers of today. We would strip the landline wires of their plastic cover and twist the metal wire inside tightly to a tape-recorder, that had those good old audio cassettes.""

Little did Ishwar or his men know then that this rudimentary contraption would connect them to cricket's seedy betting syndicate that dealt in hundreds of crores, and lead them to a catch that they would boast about for years to come.

Om Prakash and Ajit continued to work in shifts, hanging onto every word that Krishan Kumar spoke on the phone. With no headway, the surveillance was extended. After Kumar's Call Data Record analysis, it was decided to also closely observe his friends, Rajesh Kalra, Sunil Dara, and Man Mohan Khattar. The Crime Branch office was buzzing, the policemen were busy and the recorded cassettes were piling up.

On February 20, 2000, the Delhi Police got lucky. Kumar handed over his compromised phone to a London-based friend, Sanjeev Chawla, who had just landed in Mumbai and checked into Hotel Taj Mahal, that was also the base of the South African cricket team. Chawla was now being snooped on by proxy.

Meanwhile, the constables, programmed to look for extortion clues, were getting restless. One fine day, after another late-night vigil, Om Prakash bumped into DCP Pradeep Srivastava on the steps of the police headquarters. ""I casually asked Om Prakash about the case. He said there was no terror angle, all he got to hear was 'catch pakad liya', 'catch nahin pakda', 'out kiya'. I told him these could be code words, they might have been talking about money. He replied, 'Nahin janaab, aap hi sun lijeye (No sir, you hear yourself)',"" recalls Srivastav who, after retiring as DG, Chandigarh, lives in Delhi's Civil

When Srivastav heard the cassettes, he agreed with his junior. But what stuck in his mind was the unusual chatter. ""There was someone speaking in chiseled accented English to someone who spoke tooti-phooti angrezi (broken English). The man speaking broken English was complaining... 'You said you will do this but you didn't',"" says Srivastav.

A breakthrough came via yet another happenstance. A few days later, Srivastav was watching cricket at home when, during a game, South African skipper Hansie Cronje came to the commentary box. ""That's when it struck me, 'Aawaz jaani pehchaani lag rahi hai (The voice sounds familiar)'."" The mystery of the man who spoke that chiseled English had been solved.

Inspector Ishwar got in touch with Doordarshan for the game tapes to compare the voices. In the coming days, Om Prakash's ears would wait for the 'chiseled English' chatter to appear again. On March 14, 2000, it did. He would shout out to his senior in the next room. ""Sir kuchch English mein hai (There is something in English)!""

Ishwar still recalls Chawla's three words: ""Hello, Hi Hansie!"" And the reply: ""Hello,

Hi Sanjeev!""

In the rukka (short note of complaint) filed by Ishwar, as part of the chargesheet, ""Hello, Hi Hansie!"" would figure

Almost overnight, for Om Prakash and Ajit, watching cricket became work itself. On most days, thanks to the phone calls, they would have prior information on the playing eleven, the toss or, say, that Crookes would bowl the first over. It was watching sports without the thrill of suspense. Sometimes, when the game wouldn't go as per the pre-decided script, the landline in the R K Puram office would ring off the hook.

What was once whispered in hushed tones in the cricket circuit was now on page one of newspapers. As soon as the Delhi Police filed the FIR in the first week of March 2000, every cricket-playing nation had its eyes on India. The transcript of Cronje's conversations with bookies went viral.

Cricket's axis of evil -- the player-punter-bookie nexus -- was no longer a mere conspiracy theory. The rot, triggered by the proliferation of the game's shorter version, coinciding with the broadcasting boom and the multi-fold escalation in mobile phone users, and aided by India's weak anti-gambling law, ran deep. Anybody with a phone connection could have a syndicate of his own that was affiliated to big sharks abroad. Match-fixing had become the underworld's new ATM.

The controversy triggered probes around the world and forced the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form an anti-corruption unit. Kings Commission in South Africa and the CBI investigation in India found the game's leading lights, including Cronje, Gibbs, and Indian stars Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja, guilty. All were banned, for varying periods.

As for Chawla, he took a flight out of the country on March 15, 2000, four days before the final ODI. Police officials knew he was on way to the airport, but could only watch helplessly. ""The South Africans were still in India. Making an arrest would have meant naming the South African players he was in touch with and that might have meant a diplomatic issue. So we had to wait for the South Africans to leave,"" says an investigator.

The South Africans left on March 20.

Eighteen years later, Chawla happens to be the only accused in this case who hasn't been questioned by either the Delhi Police, CBI or Kings Commission; this despite figuring prominently in all the probe reports.

Arvind Kumar, then Operation Hansie's foot soldier, now ACP, Crime Branch, first calls Chawla the pivot, thinks for a while and changes it to ""sutradhar (main link)"". ""Woh Mahabharat dekha tha na TV pe aapne, Chawla 'Samay' hai (You saw serial Mahabharat on TV, didn't you? Chawla was the character 'Samay'),"" he says.

Anticipating his return, Ishwar smiles, ""Maybe he can even name a few Indian players.""

The CBI report did talk about Chawla's association with Indian players and his visits to the gym at Delhi's Hotel Park Royal, the watering hole where the key characters of this saga allegedly hung around. Everybody, from alleged punters Kalra, Dara, Krishan Kumar to players Ajay Jadeja, Manoj Prabhakar, Nikhil Chopra, reportedly regularly bumped into each other at this Nehru Place haunt. Kalra, the report also says, called the then India offie Chopra, on Chawla's insistence, before the Nagpur ODI (the Crookes game) to check if he was in the playing eleven. The CBI report, however, found nothing against Chopra.

In the almost two decades long lull, and the virtual closure of the case after Cronje's death in 2002, most of the tainted cricketers have got rid of the 'fixer' tag. They are now talking heads, coaches and selectors, and the return of the ghost from the past could be unsettling.

Chawla, 51, a UK passport holder, currently in London with his wife and two sons, tried his best to stonewall India's request. Westminster Magistrate's Court judgment shows how he raised issues of passage of time, prison conditions in India, human rights and right to family life. The hearing also discussed Chawla's wife's health issues, and mentioned the family's catering business and a restaurant let out on lease.

In his long career, Ishwar says, he has dealt with many suspects who run to court to avoid arrest. Back in 2000, Krishan Kumar too was a minor celebrity -- with hit songs like Sanam bewafa, Aacha sila diya tune mere pyaar ka, behind him, and those caterpillar-like eyebrows.

With policemen on his heels, Kumar first got himself admitted to Noida's Kailash Hospital and later moved the High Court to get anticipatory bail. The Delhi Police went to the Supreme Court for cancellation of bail.

Fifty-six-year-old Ishwar, now an ACP in the Capital's West District, remembers clearly the judge's caustically funny observation. ""R K Anand was Kumar's lawyer. The judge told him, 'Are you withdrawing the bail petition or should I pass an order? I was watching the match till 2 o'clock and wasting my time. If this isn't match-fixing, what is?' Ek minute mein bail plea uda di (He dismissed the bail plea in a minute), said go and surrender,"" says Ishwar, laughing heartily.

Srivastav too has one vivid memory from the episode. It was a line he heard in the Chawla-Cronje cassettes, after a game where apparently Gibbs was to score less than 20 runs but went on to make much more, thanks to several chances gifted by Indian fielders. ""I still remember Hansie's reply, 'If your b.....ds can't join their two hands, then what do I do?',"" Srivastav recalls, cracking up.

There was another, lesser-known character in this story: an Indian-origin restaurateur from Johannesburg who was ""the best friend"" of every Indian cricketer who stepped onto South African soil, a charismatic wheeler-dealer with that unforgettably dramatic name -- Hamid Banjo Cassim.

Touring Indian cricketers have a rather endearing nickname for men like Banjo. They are called ""Mamu"", the quintessential maternal uncles who spoil nephews during visits. These fans-turned-hangers-on-turned-groupies take a time-tested route to the heart of cricketers -- via the stomach.

On long tours, the easiest way to break the ice with India's cricketers is by arranging vegetarian food for home-sick players. If indulged, ""Mamus"" can be banked on for free SIMs and even all-paid shopping trips. In return, they ask for free match-day passes, selfies, signed memorabilia, and sometimes, a pound-and-a-half of flesh.

A giant of a man, Banjo was a school dropout and a failed entrepreneur. The father of three had a candy shop called Sweet Junction in Johannesburg's Fordsburg area, famous for a halal restaurant that served spicy curries.

Among the '90s South African players, he was the ""biltong"" man, someone who never tired of providing them the strictly carnivore nation's favourite snack, those dried and seasoned meat strips. He was more than a ""Mamu"" for the South Africans, especially Cronje. Records show he called the Porteas skipper 180 times in six months.

Indian cricketers from the 1996 tour remember Banjo for his extraordinary biryani delivery to the dressing room, lifted to the balcony from the grass banks by a rope. You could always trust Banjo to make things happen.

He told the Kings Commission that Kapil Dev was a good friend, close enough to introduce him to his wife. He wasn't lying, Kapil told the CBI about how he knew ""Hamid Mamu"" very well.

Banjo also flaunted how he arranged South African players for some friendly games that Kapil organised in India and how once, while driving the Indian star late one night in Johannesburg, he pranked his nephew. The young boy stood stunned at the counter of his truck shop seeing Kapil walk in and ask for a drink.

During the Kings Commission hearing, Banjo also said he had arranged SIM cards and phones for Bollywood stars when they visited South Africa. One pay-on-go SIM he provided to Amisha Patel -- that era's next big thing after her 2000 blockbuster Kaho Na Pyaar Hai -- was later used by Banjo to make calls to Chawla. Banjo also proudly told the Commission he had asked South African star Lance Klusener to arrange tickets for Patel for a Test at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.

So when Chawla wanted to get introduced to Cronje in South Africa in January 2000, a month before their India tour, Banjo was the obvious go-between. Details discussed during the Kings Commission hearing show Chawla was received by Banjo and taken to his shop for a meal.

A day before South Africa's tri-series ODI game against Zimbabwe on February 1, 2000, Banjo told the Commission, Chawla handed the South African skipper $15,000 at a Durban hotel in front of him. ""Mr Cronje took that envelope and I was surprised. He (Chawla) said, 'Keep this and I will talk to you at a later stage',"" Banjo said in his testimony.

During South Africa's subsequent series in India, Chawla kept talking to Cronje and, when he didn't take his calls, there was always Banjo who would mediate from Johannesburg. All through the hearing, the candy shop owner kept insisting that he was just a cricket enthusiast trying to be helpful. The advocates questioning him weren't always convinced. Chawla's return to India might add a new layer to this investigation.

This case has had a history of unexpected twists and turns. At every dead end, the Delhi Police have been lucky to find a new opening. DCP Srivastav has seen it first hand. The cold response of the government in the aftermath of the first FIR was disheartening for the team. ""My immediate superior, Joint CP, Crime, Dr K K Paul, was very supportive. But no one else was ready to believe us. The government asked why the FIR was filed prematurely, without proper evidence, and how it doesn't fall within the four walls of the law,"" he says.

The Delhi Police saw this as a case of cheating, both Chawla and Cronje were booked under IPC Sections 420 and 120B, but legal opinion was different. According to the law, cheating can only be established if somebody loses and somebody gains. Legal luminaries would ask: Whose loss is it if a match is fixed? That even if the outcome of a game was pre-decided, the spectators didn't know, they got their money's worth. Don't people pay to watch World Wrestling Entertainment, knowing those matches are fixed?

The Delhi Police tried to argue that the game wasn't ""fair"", which is what the fans pay for. ""We did register a case of cheating but there was always this grave doubt about it being tenable or not,"" says Srivastav.

And then came the turnaround. Another phone call, another accented voice. Srivastav was home for lunch when he was told by his helper that there was someone on line speaking ""angrezi"". ""I got on the line and heard English with a French accent. He was a reporter from a foreign agency. He said, 'Deputy Commissioner, you must be a very happy man. Each bit that you alleged against Hansie has been confessed by him last night',"" recalls Srivastav, adding how he will remain eternally grateful to the South African skipper for ""unburdening his conscience"".

Within minutes, the government's tone changed. Srivastav's voice has a crackle as he recalls, ""On television was then NSA himself, Brajesh Mishra. He came on screen to say: 'Satyamev jayate (Truth always prevails)... Whatever our officers were saying has been confirmed by Hansie himself'.""

Once again, the policemen gathered in front of the Crime Branch office television and exchanged amused smiles. It was a winter of crazy coincidences.

A new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. (Mohit Suneja/HT)

Mass hysteria breaks out in India every few years and is increasingly being fuelled by paranoia about the internet.

To the world, Manish Sarki was the perfect all-rounder.

A strapping boy of 18, Sarki worked hard in school during the day and sent fielders scurrying after his shots at the neighbourhood cricket ground in the evenings. He would never get home later than dinner time even when his friends were out chatting, his mother Chandra Maya remembers, and his closest friends joked about how he would blush talking to girls.

Everyone in the village of St Mary's Hill knew Sarki would grow up to be a policeman or join the army. Maybe because he was so well-behaved, no one noticed when he went quiet. They only noticed on the night of August 20 when he didn't come back home.

The village gathered around the Sarki house around 9pm. A chill was enveloping the small mountain village on the outskirts of Darjeeling in northern Bengal, but a small group of men and women trekked to the local police station a couple of kilometers away. Boys go missing all the time, they were told.

Undeterred, the villagers split into smaller search parties and fanned out into the jungles, determined to find Sarki. Their hopes were dashed around 1.30am when a search team stumbled on Sarki's body hanging from the ceiling of an empty pig warehouse on top of a hill.

Below, in spray paint, were the words ""half blood prince was here"" in what everyone recognised was Sarki's handwriting. On the wall behind was drawn a hangman with two victims, an older boy, and more chillingly, a younger one. Every wall of the building had been scribbled on - the words ""illuminati"", ""last king"", ""savage"", ""doped up"" and the number ""666"" appearing repeatedly.

In the light of day, some of the graffiti might have appeared benign - after all, some the walls displayed banalities like ""be the change you want to see"" or ""the thing you fear the most is fear itself"". But in the eerie quiet of a cold mountain night, the villagers were convinced Sarki's death was the doing of the satan. ""I was heartbroken for my son but also scared out of my wits. We were all scared about who the younger boy could be,"" said Chandra Maya.

By the time police arrived two hours later, a mist of rumours had cloaked the village. Wasn't Sarki always on his phone for the past few weeks? And, wouldn't he go out to the graveyard, barely a kilometer away, every night with his phone? ""I think he was going crazy. That's when I heard about the game,"" added Chandra Maya.

By sunrise, everyone had heard of the game: a shadowy application called the Momo Challenge that had apparently killed Sarki. Several explanations were offered. ""For the past few days, he was very sad and distracted. He would be lost in his phone. He never said anything to me, later I found out that he was playing the Momo game,"" said Sarki's friend Deekchen.

But how did he find out? Villagers say the local police first told them of the game, but the police deny ever saying anything. ""In fact, we have not been able to confirm any role of any Momo Challenge game. We never told the locals about the game. Maybe the graffiti made them think that,"" said Hare Krishna Pai, additional superintendent of police.

The next day, a second death, that of 26-year-old Aditi Goyal in Kurseong town, was also attributed to the Momo Challenge, turning the creeping fear into full-blown panic. By then, local politicians had put out statements about the supposedly lethal game, and everyone in the hills was talking about it.

""The whole area was in trauma and everyone was scared of their phones. We found young boys from Class 7 had started playing it. We started spreading awareness and seized phones from those who seemed vulnerable. Someone even sent a message to my daughter,"" said Raju Gurung, a local from Kurseong.

Hindustan Times spoke to at least 20 people in the area and everyone claimed to know a relative, friend or neighbour who had had a close shave with the game. But everyone had a different notion.

Some described the game, which supposedly sets self-harm challenges that finally end in suicide, as an app, some as a Whatsapp message. Some said they received texts, some described a phone number. Indeed, beyond the ubiquitous image of the oblong faced, bulbous eyed doll that has come to signify the game, every detail was foggy. ""Sometimes people are faking names and photos and sending messages 'Hi, I am momo. Let us play a game.' The fear of the game has hypnotised us,"" said Junita Rana, a schoolteacher in Kurseong.

It began with the braids. In June last year, a girl in Rajasthan claimed someone chopped off her braid while she was asleep. Dozens of women across Rajasthan followed up with similar claims. Over the following months, the pattern spread across north India like an epidemic: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi. By November, over 200 cases of braid chopping had been reported in Kashmir where the trend took its most vicious turn. Many women claimed to have seen Godmen, witches or cats before losing their consciousness. After finding their braids gone, many complained of aches and pains for days after. The police couldn't really find any culprits, so the people took the matter in their hands. In August, a poor woman was killed by a mob in Agra on the suspicion of chopping braids. In October, an old man in Anantnag was killed for the same reason.

Then there was the Blue Whale. In July, a schoolboy's suicide stoked the hysteria around the web-based game created by a Russian tech geek targeting teengers. The 50 challenges begin differently - from shutting yourself in or watching a horror film - proceed incrementally, and end the same way: suicide. Through 2017, more than 150 cases of young suicides across India - West Bengal, Delhi, Indore, Solapur, Dehradun - were blamed on the Blue Whale, often with no more proof that the young person was obsessed with smartphone and videogames. Every case was rife was contradictions and yet, websites were blocked, advisories issued, and in some cases, smartphones banned in schools.

Experts say that underneath the web-fuelled hysteria, something more sinister is going on with the mental health of young people. Samir Parikh, director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, insisted that we cannot dismiss these phenomena, but the focus should be on greater media literacy, on making children understand what is right and wrong content, and on teaching people to seek help if they are feeling vulnerable.

""Is there a component of hysteria in all this? Of course, there are lots of stories in the media and they have an impact. But we cannot deny the fact that there are pressures and problems that young people go through silently. If help and access is not given, they can be misused,"" he added.

Parikh is clear that any approach that aims at shutting down access to the internet is wrong, mainly because it is impossible. ""We need to understand that be it Blue Whale or Momo, if you are vulnerable, you might be pulled towards it. So you give people skills and teach people to not bottle it up, tell parents, block or involve authorities.""

India has had a long history of public panic. From a half-man half-monkey roaming the streets in Delhi, sometimes wearing a helmet, to the Munhnochwa (face ripper) of Mirzapur, claimed to be a flying object emitting beams of green or red light, sending shock waves through anyone who came in its contact, and leaving them with bites and scratches on their faces, to the Rathakaatteri (vampire) of Gundalpatti who allegedly sucked the blood of the village cattle, a new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. Many of these have been analysed as incidents of mass hysteria. The patterns have been revealing. Women are more likely to end up as victims than men, children turn to be more vulnerable than adults. The trends pick up in regions or communities marked by oppression of women, economic uncertainty or social anxiety.

Yet, questions remain about why a particular fear grips a set of people at a given time. Did every woman who complained of braid chopping do it herself? Was every alleged case of Blue Whale suicide made up by the parents or the police to evade responsibility? What do the women whose braids were chopped say now? And, did a year of fear and panic leave us any wiser?

In Kanganhedi, a village of 700 houses on the Delhi-Haryana border, Munesh Devi's hair has grown back just enough to tie it in a ponytail. A lot more has changed in her life since last year besides her hairstyle. ""I can no longer work in our field. I hardly leave the house, except being taken to the doctor by my son every two weeks. Any exertion leaves me tired. Even going to funerals gets up my blood pressure. I lie in bed almost all day. Daughters-in-law press my feet.They also bring me rotis to eat in bed,"" said Devi, sitting on a double bed in the living room. Its doors remain shut and its light dimmed to prevent Devi's recurring headache.

They began in July 2017, immediately after she found her braid chopped at the neck. It was there when she finished feeding the cows in the family's farm, she said, but gone when she got back home and slipped back her pallu. ""Must have gone missing while I was travelling home on the back of my son's motorcycle,"" she added. She remembers fainting after the realisation struck. She continues to feel giddy. ""My head spins. My whole body aches. My feet go numb. My teeth hurt."" She doesn't know what ails her; neither does her doctor. He prescribes her pills for each of her symptoms. She shows off the stash to people asking her how she has been doing since ""the incident.""

Munesh Devi's was one of three braids found missing in the area in the course of one eventful day. The other two women don't know, either, who chopped their braids or why they continue to suffer. Sri Devi said she lost her braid while sitting on a couch in the courtyard of her house. One moment it was hanging down her waist, the next moment it was lying on the floor. She had heard of the braid-chopping phenomenon only hours before. ""My uncle, who was visiting us from Pataudi, had told me about a video he had seen on Facebook. I said, 'Mama, please don't say such things.'"" Her son had called 100 after she fainted at the sight of her severed braid. ""The police are yet to tell us if they found anything,"" she said.

Devi also visited a psychiatrist in Dwarka along with her son, at the urging of the police. ""He asked my son some questions. Gave us no answers,"" she said. Her braid was taken away by a forensics team sent in by the police for further investigations. ""We haven't heard from them."" Perturbed by three incidents in a week, people in the village even consulted a tantrik (mystic). ""He spoke about the presence of a mysterious cat in the village. But no such cat or dog has been found,"" she said.

For many women, the disappearance of braids has been transformative. It has allowed them rightful rest after a lifetime's slog at home and farm, won them the nurturing attention of their families, and given them the chance to talk about themselves for the first time. The third ""victim"" in Kangnahedi, Ombati, a daily-wage labourer who found her braid gone while working around the house, is still waiting for her life to change, however. ""No government compensation, no one has even come to offer me a glass of juice,"" she said, lying on a cot and complaining of a headache.

""We sent a team to that village for a couple of hours after a request from the concerned division of the Delhi police, but we haven't received any formal communication from the top brass,"" explained Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, which had investigated the phenomenon of Delhi's Monkey-man in 2001. ""From the preliminary impressions of our team, in all probability, the incidents in Kanganhedi fit into the pattern of mass hysteria, which tends to subside on its own.""

In Kashmir, the last region to be swept up in the storm, over 100 FIRs were registered over six months. Many women alleged masked men entered their homes when they were alone, sprinkled sedatives in the air, and chopped their braids while they lay unconscious. Separatist leaders accused the Indian government, and armed militants suspected the evil hand of intelligence agencies. As locals flooded the streets in protest, shutting down shops and schools, the police resorted to extreme measures, from announcing an award of Rs 6 lakh for information to unleashing riot-control tactics to disperse the crowds. Several vigilante groups armed with lathis and axes emerged to patrol the streets at night. A 70-year-old man in Anantnag died after being hit by a brick by a group of people who suspected him to be a braid chopper.

But now, police say the paranoia and panic was fuelled by nothing substantive.

""Almost all the cases turned out to be without any substance. There were a few cases where the women had cut their hair themselves. In one case, a maid had cut the hair of a girl,"" said additional director general of police (law and order), Muneer Khan. In Kulgam, where 21 cases had been registered, the state government had formed a special investigation team(SIT). Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Kulgam, Aijaz Ahmad, who was part of the SIT, said that most of the cases have been closed because the allegations had no factual basis.

""In some of the cases, the culprits remain untraced, while maximum cases turned out to be of hysteria,"" Ahmad said. He said the lack of a single eyewitness in all of the cases was particularly baffling.

Across the valley, the police arrested between 70 and 80 people, including members of vigilante groups, for ""raising false alarm about braid chopping and creating disturbances"".

""We felt that this [braid chopping] was being done by agencies. It was a matter of honour of our women. Everybody wanted this should end. Stone pelting was the only option with us. Surprisingly it did end abruptly after that,"" said a villager from north Kashmir who requested anonymity. Some of them are still visiting the courts for hearings.

It was around 5pm on July 29 last year when Manpreet Singh Sahani climbed on the ledge of his fifth-floor apartment. As he teetered on the edge, neighbours and witnesses on the street below called out to him but could only watch helplessly as he jumped. Initial investigations by local police and testimonies of his friends exposed talk of the Blue Whale Challenge. Several of them took to social media to blame the game and link it to Sahani's death.

In 24 hours, reports of the supposedly lethal game had inundated media, and reports of copycat cases were streaming in from all parts of India, ratcheting up paranoia about mobile phone and internet use among teenagers and their parents. Over the next two months, more than 150 deaths or injuries across the country were alleged to be linked to the game.

But while police initially suspected the boy was an avid gamer and could have been influenced by the Blue Whale Challenge, detailed investigation indicated more offline triggers.

""The boy was in love with a girl who had left him for some other boy. We had gone through his email accounts and mobile phone and found a draft on the phone which clarified his intention to commit suicide,"" said Navin Reddy, deputy commissioner of police Zone 10.

This might not be an isolated phenomenon. Earlier this year, Union minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir told Lok Sabha that a committee formed under the chairmanship of the director general of the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) couldn't establish the involvement of the Blue Whale Challenge in any case.

""The committee analysed the internet activities, device activities, call records and other social media activity, other forensic evidences and also interacted with rescued victims associated with these incidents,"" the minister told the lower house.

Of course, by then several other central ministries, a number of state governments, the Central Board of Secondary Education and even the Supreme Court had got involved, with the apex court calling the game a ""national problem"".

But experts say official agencies may have jumped the gun. ""It was definitely a hoax. We need to shift focus from these voyeuristic things and to suicides, which is a big problem that kills a quarter of a million people. Some of these hoaxes have a life of their own because media makes them into a big story. We need long-term institutional solutions,"" said Soumitra Pathare, director of the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy.

Back in St Mary's hill, Chandra Maya Sarki has gone back to her old routine -- wake up at the crack of dawn to draw water, fix food for her husband before he leaves for his daily wage work, and then clean their small wooden house. She likes to keep the television on and stray dialogues from the afternoon soaps animate the living room. She stares not at the screen, however, but at the the small framed photo of Sarki hanging on the blue wall, wondering why the mysterious admins of the Momo Challenge chose her child as their prey.

She doesn't know yet that the cyber cell of the West Bengal police has completed its forensic probe of his phone and found no trace of any Momo Challenge. ""If any application is downloaded, the forensic machine would find a trace, even if it is an unknown application. But we have found no such application, or any message on WhatsApp motivating people to play the game. We have found nothing so far,"" said a senior official of the cyber cell on the condition of anonymity.

She doesn't know that police has ruled out any links between the game and the death of Aditi Goyal and that at least two other cases in the state have been found to be hoaxes traced back to mischief makers sending scary messages through WhatsApp. She doesn't know that Sarki's teacher Sarita Sharma has a simple explanation for why he and his friends would go to the graveyard at night -- the mobile network was the best at that spot.

All she knows is that her beloved younger son will no longer come back home at 8pm every day. That she will never make him his favourite meal of dal-aloo and dum-eggs. The money she had been saving with her husband to send him to Bengaluru for higher studies now seems meaningless. Sometimes she talks to Sarki's sister, now in college, about him and the day that took him away from her. She will probably never know what really happened to Sarki or what troubled him enough to withdraw from his friends. Momo Challenge or not, that is the biggest tragedy of all.

The woman was married to three different men earlier and had a child from each of them.

AFTER COMMUTING the death sentence of four rape and murder convicts this month, the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in a third case, has now changed the trial court sentence and awarded life imprisonment to the convict instead.

In September 2017, the 27-year-old youth had killed two minor children of a widow with whom he was in a live-in relationship for eight months. The woman was married to three different men earlier and had a child from each of them. The case is from Rupnagar district of Punjab.

A division bench of Justices A B Chaudhari and Surinder Gupta, in the judgment, said the accused was convicted on the basis of circumstantial evidence, he has no prior criminal history and even though the crime was serious and heinous, ""it is not a case which falls within the category of rarest of rare cases, hence we set aside the death sentence and award life imprisonment to the appellant for offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.""

The case was registered in September 2017 after the two minor children - one of them was studying in kindergarten and another in class III - went missing. The decision in the case has been expeditious right from the trial court level up to the High Court. Both the lower court and High Court took four months each in 2018 to pass their verdicts in the case. The lower court heard the case on 10 dates between February and May to conclude it was a rarest of rare case. The High Court heard the case on three dates between July and November to uphold the lower court verdict but did not confirm the death sentence.

The mother of the victims was previously married three times - her two husbands died a natural death and the third one left her after she refused to abandon the two children from her first two marriages. The two children, who were killed, belonged to the second and third husband. She had three children in total including a daughter - who was more than 20 years old and from her first marriage -- who is herself-married.

The convict in the disclosure statement told the police that he threw the two children, who were going to their school, in a pond and watched them till they died. According to the police, the reason behind killing the children was that the accused was forcing the woman to conceive again and give birth to his children, which she refused. She had also returned to her mother's house after staying at his house for eight months.

In two cases of rape and murder where also the victims were minor children and the trial courts had sentenced the accused to death, the High Court during the month commuted the sentences to 20 imprisonments in both the cases. High Court this year took a decision on four murder references. Only one of the death sentences was upheld but the same involving two accused has been stayed by High Court."

An official said cases of 14 had been so far cleared for jobs, out of which some have already joined while the final process for others was on.

MORE THAN seven months after Punjab government announced government jobs for the kin of men killed in Iraq, the government has now asked a number of families to clarify if the parents of the deceased men were willing to do government job.

In Amritsar district alone, seven applicants from the families are awaiting jobs. Among the cases which are stuck are applicants who are married, something which renders them ineligible for the job as they are hence counted as ""separate family or entity"" in the light of the definition of next of the kin.

A resident of Sangoana village in Amritsar district Sarwan Singh, whose brother Nishan Singh was among those killed in Iraq, and who had applied for the job, told The Sunday Express that he was asked by a government official in Amritsar to furnish details about the age of his father and whether he wants to take up the government job.

Sarwan Singh is married, something which is coming in the way of getting a job.

Advertising

A government functionary said that as per the policy under which jobs were being given by treating their cases as special, a married son or a married daughter in the family was counted as separate family and hence cannot be considered for the job. As per the policy, unmarried son or daughter or wife of the deceased were among those eligible for the job, the functionary said.

Sarwan Singh, however, said, ""What if someone is unmarried today gets the job and gets married a few days later? Will the government then take away the job?""

""My father and my mother had already given undertakings separately that I should be considered for the job,"" said Sarwan Singh.

He is not alone. 26-year-old Baljinder Singh, a resident of Sialka village in Amritsar district whose brother Jatinder Singh was among those who were killed in Iraq, is another job seeker caught in the quagmire. His case was sent by the Amritsar administration for job to Punjab government. The government now wants to know what is the age of his mother and whether she is willing to take up government job.

""I was working in Dubai and came here when the mortal remains of my brother were brought. I was hopeful to get government job after it was announced. I am yet to get it. Na idhar joga reha, na odhar joga (I am caught in a Catch-22 situation). A local Congress leader had assured me not to go back to Dubai as I will get the government job here,"" said Baljinder, adding that he had lost his father to cancer around three months ago.

Amritsar Deputy Commissioner K S Sangha said, ""There have been some technical issues. We are trying to resolve those.""

Everyone family, meanwhile, has a tale to tell as they wait for job. Gurpinder Kaur, sister of Bhoewal resident Manjinder Singh who was among the deceased in Iraq, said the private school where she is working for six years has set a deadline of December end to clear whether she would continue in the job or not. ""The school has to make an alternate arrangement in case I leave. But, there is no clarity on my job application so far,"" said Gurpinder whose case is also stuck because she is married. The Amritsar administration had sent her case to the government, underlining that she was married. Now, government wants to know age of her mother and whether she (her mother) is willing to take up the job. ""During all these years when there was no word about Manjinder, I had been taking care of my family. And I would continue to take care of family if I am given the job,"" said Gurpinder.

Kulibir Kaur, sister of another deceased, Ranjit Singh, who had applied for the job faces similar hurdle - of being married. She lost father about 15 years ago. Her mother Balwinder Kaur is a resident of Manawala village in Amritsar district and lives with the family of her elder sister, who Kaur said was not eligible for job as she ""did not meet educational qualification criteria"". ""If I get job, I will support my mother. Daughters can never leave mothers,"" said Kaur. The government wants similar details about her mother also - her age and whether she is interested in government job.

Another case in point is of Gurjeet Singh, married brother of Jalal Usma resident and Iraq victim Gurcharan Singh. The government has underlined that deceased Gurcharan was married and why his wife or children are not being considered for the government job. The government has also sought details of Gurcharan's father - his age and willingness for government job. Gurjeet, who spent several years in Bahrain before his return says he was caught in a bind. ""I could have gone back to Bahrain. And if I go, only women will be left behind in the family, my mother, my wife and wife of my brother,"" said Gurjeet, adding that his brother's wife ""did not meet the educational qualification and had asked me to apply for the job"".

""We have sought details from districts where such issues have come up. The government will analyse,"" said a functionary of the government.

It is not only that technical aspects alone have stuck the cases. In Gurdaspur district, a family has raised objections to its daughter-in-law applying for job, saying that she may remarry after getting the job. Harpreet Kaur, the wife of Roopowali resident Kanwaljeet Singh who was killed in Iraq, is a job seeker, but her in-laws have objected to it saying that she will remarry after getting the job and Gurcharan's parents Harabhajan Singh and Mohinder Kaur will become financially insecure. Deciding to move on in life, Harpreet Kaur had gone to her parental house after there was no word about men in Iraq. There was earlier a dispute over compensation money given monthly to such families and it was finally settled with Harpreet and Gurcharan's parents getting Rs 10000 each out of Rs 20000 per month. Sawinder Singh, son-in-law of Harbhajan Singh and Mohinder Kaur, said, ""The monthly compensation to elderly parents of Gurcharan will stop if Harpreet gets a job.""

Among those who have been given jobs are not satisfied either. Amandeep Singh, son of deceased Gobinder Singh of Murar village in Kapurthala district, joined as ""sewadar"" in Kapurthala district last month. Amandeep said he had done a three-year diploma in civil engineering after 10+2. ""But, I had no choice as government job as sewadar was given to me,"" said Amandeep.

Another Iraq victim Gurdeep Singh's wife Anita has been given the job. A resident of Jaitpur in Hoshiarpue district, Anita said she joined as ""class IV"" in Garhshankar Court Complex. She said she gets a salary of ""Rs 5300"" as per norms of three-year-probation. ""It is very less. Rs 1800 out of it is spent as travel expenses to go to job. And I have a son and daughter to take care of. It is very tough.""

There are 27 families in Punjab who lost a member each in Iraq. An official said cases of 14 had been so far cleared for jobs, out of which some have already joined while the final process for others was on. The cases of remaining 13, the official said, were stuck due to various reasons.

Among those who have been given jobs are not satisfied either. Amandeep Singh, son of deceased Gobinder Singh of Murar village in Kapurthala district, joined as ""sewadar"" in Kapurthala district last month. Amandeep said he had done a three-year diploma in civil engineering after 10+2. ""But, I had no choice as government job as sewadar was given to me,"" said Amandeep.

Another Iraq victim Gurdeep Singh's wife Anita has been given the job. A resident of Jaitpur in Hoshiarpue district, Anita said she joined as ""class IV"" in Garhshankar Court Complex. She said she gets a salary of ""Rs 5300"" as per norms of three-year-probation. ""It is very less. Rs 1800 out of it is spent as travel expenses to go to job. And I have a son and daughter to take care of. It is very tough.""

There are 27 families in Punjab who lost a member each in Iraq. An official said cases of 14 had been so far cleared for jobs, out of which some have already joined while the final process for others was on. The cases of remaining 13, official said, were stuck due to various reasons."

Hinting at the possibility for a bigger sex racket involving the school, the boy's father alleged that his son was not the only victim of the scandal and wanted the court to transfer the probe to CB-CID.

Appalled over the allegations, Justice N Anand Venkatesh has directed the police to file a status report of the case.On July 27, the police had arrested van attendant Baskaran and another person in connection with the crime.

However, parents of the boy claimed involvement of more persons with the connivance of the school management, as they were threatened to withdraw complaints against the school. ""My son informed us that he was sexually harassed by various people, including those of white skin,"" the petitioner said. ""Apart from this, a former panchayat union president of Kolappakkam, along with some rowdies, threatened us to withdraw the complaint"", he added.

Noting that the investigation officer had failed to follow the provisions of Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act while pursuing the case, advocate V Kannadasan submitted that the sexual assault was carried out not only by theaccused, but several others also. He told the court the he could not ascertain on what basis the Tiruvallur Mahila court had granted bail to the accused despite it being a matter of such heinous crime against children.

Taking serious note of the submission, Justice Venkatesh directed the trial court to report the exact stand taken by the prosecution when the bail applications were considered and posted the plea to January 3 for further hearing."

And that year there was no electricity. So, by the light of a roaring paraffin lamp, our entire family sat in the kitchen by fire and prepared to bake a Christmas cake, or two -- because people were bound to drop by and the least we could offer was a piece of homemade cake.

The ingredients had been bought and now we all got ready to mix the flour and the oil (no butter, it was just too expensive). I have no idea how many eggs went into the large bowl or how much flour and sugar were emptied into the utensil. I had seen many oranges lying around so I decided to put some orange juice into the mixture a well.

It took several hours to mix the ingredients by hand and we stopped only when our arms pained. Then we put the mixture into the pans and popped it into the oven. The oven was a wooden cupboard lined with aluminium and had a charcoal stove under the shelves. There was no way to control the temperature or the time. We just did everything by instinct.

As we waited for our orange cakes to bake, my husband remembered how his father had made cakes in a dekchi filled with sand and then another utensil was put inside with the cake mixture. Then it was covered and sealed with atta -- ""Like you do biryani,"" he explained.

Our cakes turned out fine and the guests especially appreciated the orange flavour.

But the real fun begins after Christmas when everyone gets ready for the Christmas games. Everyone participates, from little toddlers to their grannies. The competitions are according to age and our age group was the late 1950s.

We, the 50-year-old age group, came together on the basketball court of a local school; it was a competition between the men and women who stood facing each other. We had to run across and back -- and whichever team finished first was the winner. It was freezing and we were all given the usual big, golden lumps of gur or jaggery - most of our age group refused; perhaps, it was doctor's restrictions, but I took the one offered to me and enjoyed its sweet taste.

Across the basketball court, my husband looked on anxiously and so did our doctor friend Felix, who was in the men's team. Among the audience were my family members, worried that I would fall and make a fool of myself. A friend, who had been captain of the Tangkhul Naga women's football team, offered to run on my behalf. But I was feeling incredibly confident and determined to run.

And, when they shouted ""Ready, steady, go"", I ran, ran and ran; and I returned all in one piece, still holding half the lump of gur in my hand. Friends and family looked relieved it was over but I was elated. I had not run in a race since school and I think it was the gur.

I cannot remember who won; who cares? I had run! Among our age group was a senior police officer, a doctor and cultivators from the old village. Everyone, irrespective of age, status or influence took part in the games as equals.

The next time we went home for Christmas, around 2015, the celebrations were very different. This time there was electricity and that was definitely a good thing. But there were different kinds of competitions. Now, the competitions were for the rich; and it was the beginning of commercialisation. I had bought a Christmas tree for the children. It was a Chinese-made tree bought from Delhi's Sadar Bazar. My sister-in-law told me excitedly that we could enter into the competition for the best-decorated tree. I spent the day with her decorating the tree, hoping we would win.

I had bought games for the children and wrapped the presents. In the past, there was no tradition of giving presents; and Santa was unknown in Ukhrul. But now, rich families give their children expensive gifts. A favourite is toy guns. In fact, the toy gun market had grown so much that the, Diocesan Social Service Society (DSSS) Ukhrul ran an ""Anti-War Toy Gun"" campaign to dissuade parents from buying them for their children during the Christmas season.

There have been other changes, too. Many hundreds of Tangkhul Naga youth, who are working as waiters and waitresses in five-star hotels in India's metro cities will spend Christmas serving food and expensive alcohol to people who will not even bother to wish them a ""Merry Christmas"" when they offer toasts at midnight.

And there is the ugly division of the society between the majority Baptists and the Catholic minority. At a time like this, there is a recipe which can go a long way in bringing people together and reviving the Christmas spirit. You don't need to buy the ingredients, you don't need electricity or fuel to bake this but it does require a lot of effort. Try it, nonetheless. It works like magic!

After a 10-year-old boy was killed by his 15 year-old neighbour on Thursday night, the Sakinaka Police traced the dead body of the deceased from an Andheri-based nullah on Saturday afternoon. As part of the probe of the said murder case, the police have detained two teenagers. One of the teenagers, a 15 year-old, has been booked for allegedly sodomising the deceased and strangulating him to death while the other teen has been booked for making the extortion call to the father of the dead child.

According to the police, on Saturday afternoon, the locals residents of Sakinaka spotted a red coloured trolley bag which had came down flowing to Safed Pool area from 90 feel road based nullah. The cops after discovering the inflated body rushed it to KEM hospital for postmortem. While sharing the latest developments in the case, a police source said, the accomplice of the prime accused in the case after asking for ransom money of Rs 5 lakhs from the deceased father's had discarded the SIM card. The police picked up the accused duo on the basis of Call Record Details (CDR).

""The 10 year-old on Thursday evening had left his residence to go for his tuition and the accused who is his neighbour somehow convinced him to come at his place. The accused first tried to sexually abuse the kid and on being refused, the accused strangulated him and stuffed his body in a trolley bag which was at his home. He then managed to take the bag on his scooter where he drove to the nullah and later he dumped the body and left for home,"" said a police officer.

When the parents of the 10 year-old called the tuition teacher, they realized that the kid never made it there and the accused teen after dumping the body acted normal and also helped those tensed parents to trace their mysteriously missing kid. Preliminary investigation of the case have revealed that the accused had taken the school bag of the kid and after the murder, he had stuffed the boy's shirt inside the bag and had kept on the roof of a public toilet to portray that the boy went missing himself.

""The accused was addicted to some intoxicants and was also frequently accessesing porn websites and crime anthology series on television which might have helped him to plan the murder plot. In his confession, the accused have said that while trying to abuse the kid physically, the boy shouted and in a bid to silence him he strangled him for 20 minutes and ensured that the kid dies,"" added the officer.

As per the relatives of the kid, the neighbors were in good terms with the family of the kid and they never sensed something suspicious. ""The teen was a good friend of our child and used to bring gifts and eatables for him frequently. We believe that the teen's parents also might have helped him in the murder as it not possible for a single boy to take the bag and dump the body all by himself. We expect the police to investigate the case thoroughly as it it about the security of all such children who can similarly meet the same fate like out child,"" said a relative while speaking to DNA.

The two teens have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The accused teenage duo will be produced in court on Sunday.

The state government refused to regularise her job as there was a stay on approvals as per the 2012 state decision. But the court held that jobs given on compassionate grounds were not fresh jobs and hence, not in want of approval by the state.

A division bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dangre was hearing the petition filed by Samita Desai seeking directions to the state to regularise her post. The petition also sought directions to the state to pay her the dues accrued to her while working as a peon in the school.

According to the plea, Desai's husband, Sameer, worked as a peon in the school and his post was an approved one with his salary being paid by the government. However, he died on November 2, 2011 and Samita was left with two minor children. On March 26, 2012, the school management decided to appoint her in place of her husband on compassionate grounds.

The school sent an application on August 7, 2012 to the education department to regularise Samita's job, which was refused on grounds that there was a ban on approving new staff since May 2, 2012. Thereafter, Samitai and the school approached the court.

Public prosecutor, Shruti Vyas, argued that there was a ban on approvals and the post had not been sanctioned as per the 2013-14 staffing pattern for the school.

The court, however, rejected the contentions and stated that Samita's appointment was done as per a December 2, 2002 state order which superseded the 2012 ban."

With the conclusion of Jammu Municipal Elections after thirteen years came the hope for accountability, solutions for public grievances - hope for a change. Corporators arranged thanks giving lunch/dinner and subsequently visited their wards with respective MLAs, who still had the CDF (Constituency Development Funds) as the assembly was still active and public got much needed confidence booster, once again promises of clean Jammu were given and public started believing the Corporators of their wards. Each and every Corporator's Facebook wall is full of pictures, either of felicitations or of drain cleaning which earlier MLAs were flaunting on social media. Along with all these activities background canvassing for Mayor and Deputy Mayor were also going on.

Despite BJP having clear majority in JMC, election of Mayor seemed to be a tough but ultimately Jammu got its Mayor and Deputy Mayor on 15th November 2018 after many deliberations. With this also the process of photo sessions, felicitation ceremonies commenced and in between Governor dissolved J & K assembly on 21st November and suddenly all MLAs disappeared from scene in shock mode, Mayor and Deputy Mayor became the ultimate VIPs to be invited for inaugurations which they lapped up happily as if posts of Mayor and Deputy Mayor were carved out for this purpose only. After nearly one month of their elections first general body meeting of JMC was convened and whatever expectations or dreams public were having got shattered with a bang. If one goes through the agenda of the meeting, 'Seva Bhav' for public disappeared and top priority with unanimity is to increase honorarium of Corporators to at least forty to fifty thousand despite the example laid by PM Modi who had donated 21 lakhs rupee, his personal savings as Chief Minister's salary in 10 years, for educating daughters of drivers and peons working with Gujarat Government. In today's contest it is to think about your interests rest all is secondary.

Eleven items were listed in agenda and it included demand for opening of school for Children of Municipal employees as if there is no government school in entire Jammu , recruitment of Safai Karam Charis - what about the existing ones who work for few hours in the morning and then disappear for their private assignments, promotion orders of employees - for their outstanding efforts to make Jammu a City of garbage and chaos , beautification of JMC walls - as if it is the only place in whole Jammu, no parking zone in JMC premises- to further congest adjoining roads , plantation in and around JMC - to provide better air to corporators, outsourcing of autos for garbage collection, night sanitation and animal birth control programme- to claim no responsibility of theirs in future. Jammuites are shocked and amazed to see no agenda for Jammu public as if all these corporators have been elected for their own cause, for the building of JMC or employees there in. It's not long ago when State High Court had to intervene when a RTI revealed that Rs. 34,65,374 were spent to convert a cattle pond to Municipal Quarter No.10 at Gandhi Nagar which was later allotted to Joint Commissioner (A) who was nearing his superannuation, a gift was given to the former officer at the cost of the rights of the animals.

Similarly a PIL seeking high level probe into the illegal/backdoor allotments of Municipal Quarters/ Flats/ Shops in favour of ex-employees of JMC /private persons and sought investigation by State Vigilance Organization as JMC further extended lease of their accommodations for 40 years at a meager rent of Rs.600 to Rs.900 per month for prime municipal flats situated at Gandhi Nagar, Jammu and beneficiaries included former Commissioner/ Secretary to Government of J&K Housing and Urban Development Department who at one time was JMC Commissioner as well, former Joint Commissioner (Adm) JMC, ex-PA to Commissioner JMC, Driver of JMC, PSO to Commissioner/ Secretary to Govt. of J&K H&UDD to name a few and ultimately the Division Bench ordered for the entire record of more than 600 allotments of JMC assets made in the similar fashion without adopting any procedure/ criteria. Past and present actions are in sync depicting only self use of JMC resources with impunity.

Contrary to JMC, right now SMC (Srinagar Municipal Corporation) is working day and night with Mayor Junaid Azim Mattu leading from front as any feedback on his twitter handle is treated as complaint and corrective measures are taken immediately. Srinagar public is actively participating and enjoying the proactive approach of their Mayor. No day has gone since taking oath when Mayor and Deputy Mayor have not visited different problematic areas and on spot decisions have been taken. All reharis have been asked to register so that some alternative arrangements are made to accommodate them in a phased manner but in Jammu Mayor has ordered restoration of illegal Kiosks in front of GMC to be restored at unused matador stand despite traffic bottle neck in the area. Another worth mention decision by SMC is collection of waste from butcheries so that the it is properly dumped at the authorized site but no such initiative at Jammu. Sunday bazaar market of Lal Chowk has been regularized with nominal fee, all encroachments are getting removed in a phased manner including bunkers , traffic police kiosks on footpath, suggestions / plans are being made for beautification, requisition for funds for water bodies preservation are few other measures. Though identical is the situation at Jammu's Sunday market right from Bus stand, Shalamar, City Chowk, Super bazaar, Purani Mandi, Raj Tilak road to Parade but no such stream lining or revenue generation initiative. SMC Mayor is regularly arranging meetings of different departments for better co-ordination for quick and better results but it requires a herculean effort to get one's street light repaired at Jammu. All talks little action is the buzz word at Jammu.

Coming back to JMC, only way to lodge complaint is through their web site and believe it requires hell lot of effort to get registered your complaint and the mobile number of contact person you receive by return SMS is either non -existent or the concerned person is not responsible for the concerned ward. Countless Commissioners have been replaced in a span of last three years without any result so much so that Smart City project is standing at same place from where it started but who bothers. There is no Solid Waste Disposal site/policy in place despite number of reminders from High Court, no STP in place as such whole sewage waste is being dumped in river Tawi from where drinking water is supplied to whole old city, no fogging during monsoon to check dengue. Plastic carry bags are sold openly in the market, from where they are procured and how they reach market is not priority of JMC reasons better known to them only. No scheme in place for door to door household garbage collection and no campaign in media for public awareness. There is no transparency in dog sterilization program as these services are shuttling between NGOs and Municipality and both blaming each other for the failure to curtail dog menace in almost every ward. No biometric attendance of employees in place with the result even newly elected corporators are running pillar to post to get allocated nonexistent Safai workers of their respective wards. Leaking water pipes of drinking water in drains are there in every ward as there is no mechanism in place for coordination between JMC and PHE, civil wing of JMC unable to get repaired the damaged lanes as there is no accountability, illegal infrastructures coming up despite army of 17 exclusive employees in Enforcement wing of JMC to look after 75 wards. High Court has to intervene time and again to rap JMC for repeated deficiency of services but that too is of little use and all these glaring lapses are testimony to failure of parental department which was with BJP for last 3 years.

Earlier MLAs were performing the duties of Corporators, looking after lanes, drains of the area but their half hearted efforts were more intended for photo sessions as such it had yielded only shoddy work which disappeared with the first monsoon shower of the season as there is no check on quality of work as no supervising engineer is there on site to see whether drains have proper slope or lanes have been laid as per set parameters or the resultant malba lifted. There is urgent need of streamlining the system with latest techniques along with innovative ideas to get the things done in proper manner. Installing vending machines for plastic bottles at all public places, converting flowers collected from temples to incense sticks, rain water harvesting in new buildings are few innovations which all modern cities are adopting. Mayor or concerned staff of JMC should visit Indore, the cleanest city of India, for practical ideas how they achieved this as with the elections approaching fast and BJP running the JMC now it's their last chance to set things right which their ministers and MLAs had failed in the past and with their own Government at Centre and President's rule in state they don't have any excuse this time right now. One hopes JMC takes corrective measures to put a system in place instead of random knee jerk measures which are of no use. Planning and implementation are the most important aspects without which JMC is bound to fail once again this time as well as in the past. Right now the question of public is, will they deliver this time?

Human values should connect law and legal justice, and only then we can have a justice system that will be in equilibrium with the Constitution of India, said Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana State Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan.

Justice Radhakrishnan was delivering the DV Subba Rao memorial lecture, organised by the Centre for Policy Studies at the Visakhapatnam Public Library here on Saturday.

Speaking on 'Courts, benchmarks and consistency: Role of Bar and Bench', he delivered an eloquent address, giving an insight into the philosophy of both Bar and the Bench.

Drawing parallel with the 'Pancha Indriya' (five senses) and the 'Evidence Act', he said, ""Thinking process plays an important role in the legal process. It is our fundamental right to think and there is no bar on the process of thinking. And thinkers are not trained and the power of thinking emboldens a person.""

He said that both lawyers and judges should go beyond the five senses and training to think and deliver justice.

According to him, equality in justice will come only when the door of justice opens to all in the equal way, when knocked by all. The challenge in the justice delivery system is maintaining equilibrium. ""The conduct of the Bench reflects on the character of the Bar and the other way also,"" said Justice Radhakrishnan.

Truthfulness is important in the profession and he advised the legal fraternity to work in the interest of the client, but within the legal framework.

Earlier, speaking about D.V. Subba Rao, he said that he was a man of character and it was difficult to find a person doing well both in the legal profession and in public life. Apart from being a legal luminary of his time, DV Subba Rao was the Mayor of Visakhapatnam, former chairman of Bar Council of India, president of the Andhra Cricket Association, Chairman of VUDA and was also appointed as Administrative Manager of the Indian Cricket team, which toured West Indies in 1997. Earlier, Vice-Chancellor of National Law School of India University, Bengaluru, Prof. R. Venkat Rao, introduced justice Radhakrishnan. Director of Centre for Policy Studies Prof. A. Prasanna Kumar, gave the opening remarks and Judge of AP and Telangana State High Court and son of D.V. Subba Rao, Justice D.V.S.S. Somayajulu, spoke."

Excise officials cited the rather lenient provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) invoked in the case of smuggling of tobacco products being the core reason for the thriving illegal trade targeted mainly at the heavy migrant population in Ernakulam.

""No matter how big the haul is, the carrier can walk free on paying just ₹200 under COTPA draining out any incentive for strict enforcement,"" said Excise intelligence sources.

The police, however, have more teeth in comparison as they can invoke Section 118 (i) of the Kerala Police Act that covers the sale of intoxicating substances to those aged below 18 years or near school premises, which entails imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or fine not exceeding ₹10,000 or both.

However, hardly has anyone been sentenced to imprisonment, and punishment is, more often than not, restricted to fines. In cases where the police submit before the court that the whereabouts of the accused are not known, and that there are chances of them absconding, the court may be inclined to remand them.

Excise officials said banned tobacco products were mostly smuggled in from Tamil Nadu and Bengaluru on buses, lorries transporting vegetables, and even in private cars now with vehicle checking at checkposts relatively slack.

""Even criminals with past record in spirit smuggling have turned to the lucrative trade with an assured profit margin which may go up as high as 300% at relatively low risk.

Even if one or two consignments get caught it hardly dents the profit significantly,"" officials said.

Agents from outside the State even help set up tobacco manufacturing units which can be purchased at as little as ₹2 to ₹3 lakh. However, that has not succeeded to a great extent as the quality often takes a hit if producers fail to find the right mix, officials said.

Moreover, the disposal of piled-up stock of seized tobacco products poses a major headache to enforcement agencies. Excise officials said the stock is either set ablaze or buried along with the plastic packing at grave environmental risk."

At the Delhi Police's Crime Branch Office at R K Puram, two constables of the Anti-Extortion Cell, Om Prakash and Ajit Singh, exchanged amused smiles as seasoned television commentators dropped their jaws watching Hansie Cronje toss the new ball to off-spinner Derek Crookes. This was the India-South Africa one-day international game at Nagpur. It was March 19, 2000; IPL wasn't yet born. India wasn't used to watching spinners bowl to opening batsmen. It was also the winter when a bunch of Delhi policemen became more insightful about the game than most top cricket pundits. While getting wiser, they would also get disillusioned.

Within 18 days, Inspector Ishwar Singh had filed a complaint with charges of match-fixing against Cronje, London-based businessman Sanjeev Chawla and four of his associates. It had details of how Chawla and Cronje fixed team scores, and mentioned the role of four other South African players, including Herschelle Gibbs. A couple of years later, Cronje died in a plane crash. Now, 18 years after he left the country, last month, a UK court ordered Chawla's extradition.

Recalling the untimely death of the cricket fan inside him, Om Prakash, now 49 and a head constable, laments, ""I loved Ajay Jadeja, but it all changed. I haven't seen a game since 2000.""

-- --

Nothing had prepared the two constables for the role they were to play in cricket's coincidental unmasking -- which started with their boss, Inspector Ishwar Singh, asking them to be part of an extortion investigation in early 2000. It was a textbook case of those times -- a suspected Chhota Shakeel and

Advertising

D Company operative from Dubai, Shaheen Haitheley, had threatened an Old Delhi businessman to cough up Rs 5 crore.

A background check of those in touch with Haitheley threw up a Bollywood name -- Krishan Kumar, a failed actor and brother of late T-Series founder Gulshan Kumar. BSNL was roped in -- whenever Kumar's cellphone rang, a landline on the top floor of the Delhi Police's R K Puram office too came alive.

Ishwar is tickled as he recalls those early days of phone-tapping. ""It was all very primitive, nothing like the computers of today. We would strip the landline wires of their plastic cover and twist the metal wire inside tightly to a tape-recorder, that had those good old audio cassettes.""

Little did Ishwar or his men know then that this rudimentary contraption would connect them to cricket's seedy betting syndicate that dealt in hundreds of crores, and lead them to a catch that they would boast about for years to come.

Om Prakash and Ajit continued to work in shifts, hanging onto every word that Krishan Kumar spoke on the phone. With no headway, the surveillance was extended. After Kumar's Call Data Record analysis, it was decided to also closely observe his friends, Rajesh Kalra, Sunil Dara, and Man Mohan Khattar. The Crime Branch office was buzzing, the policemen were busy and the recorded cassettes were piling up.

On February 20, 2000, the Delhi Police got lucky. Kumar handed over his compromised phone to a London-based friend, Sanjeev Chawla, who had just landed in Mumbai and checked into Hotel Taj Mahal, that was also the base of the South African cricket team. Chawla was now being snooped on by proxy.

Meanwhile, the constables, programmed to look for extortion clues, were getting restless. One fine day, after another late-night vigil, Om Prakash bumped into DCP Pradeep Srivastava on the steps of the police headquarters. ""I casually asked Om Prakash about the case. He said there was no terror angle, all he got to hear was 'catch pakad liya', 'catch nahin pakda', 'out kiya'. I told him these could be code words, they might have been talking about money. He replied, 'Nahin janaab, aap hi sun lijeye (No sir, you hear yourself)',"" recalls Srivastav who, after retiring as DG, Chandigarh, lives in Delhi's Civil

When Srivastav heard the cassettes, he agreed with his junior. But what stuck in his mind was the unusual chatter. ""There was someone speaking in chiseled accented English to someone who spoke tooti-phooti angrezi (broken English). The man speaking broken English was complaining... 'You said you will do this but you didn't',"" says Srivastav.

A breakthrough came via yet another happenstance. A few days later, Srivastav was watching cricket at home when, during a game, South African skipper Hansie Cronje came to the commentary box. ""That's when it struck me, 'Aawaz jaani pehchaani lag rahi hai (The voice sounds familiar)'."" The mystery of the man who spoke that chiseled English had been solved.

Inspector Ishwar got in touch with Doordarshan for the game tapes to compare the voices. In the coming days, Om Prakash's ears would wait for the 'chiseled English' chatter to appear again. On March 14, 2000, it did. He would shout out to his senior in the next room. ""Sir kuchch English mein hai (There is something in English)!""

Ishwar still recalls Chawla's three words: ""Hello, Hi Hansie!"" And the reply: ""Hello,

Hi Sanjeev!""

In the rukka (short note of complaint) filed by Ishwar, as part of the chargesheet, ""Hello, Hi Hansie!"" would figure

-- -

Almost overnight, for Om Prakash and Ajit, watching cricket became work itself. On most days, thanks to the phone calls, they would have prior information on the playing eleven, the toss or, say, that Crookes would bowl the first over. It was watching sports without the thrill of suspense. Sometimes, when the game wouldn't go as per the pre-decided script, the landline in the R K Puram office would ring off the hook.

What was once whispered in hushed tones in the cricket circuit was now on page one of newspapers. As soon as the Delhi Police filed the FIR in the first week of March 2000, every cricket-playing nation had its eyes on India. The transcript of Cronje's conversations with bookies went viral.

Cricket's axis of evil -- the player-punter-bookie nexus -- was no longer a mere conspiracy theory. The rot, triggered by the proliferation of the game's shorter version, coinciding with the broadcasting boom and the multi-fold escalation in mobile phone users, and aided by India's weak anti-gambling law, ran deep. Anybody with a phone connection could have a syndicate of his own that was affiliated to big sharks abroad. Match-fixing had become the underworld's new ATM.

The controversy triggered probes around the world and forced the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form an anti-corruption unit. Kings Commission in South Africa and the CBI investigation in India found the game's leading lights, including Cronje, Gibbs, and Indian stars Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja, guilty. All were banned, for varying periods.

As for Chawla, he took a flight out of the country on March 15, 2000, four days before the final ODI. Police officials knew he was on way to the airport, but could only watch helplessly. ""The South Africans were still in India. Making an arrest would have meant naming the South African players he was in touch with and that might have meant a diplomatic issue. So we had to wait for the South Africans to leave,"" says an investigator.

The South Africans left on March 20.

Eighteen years later, Chawla happens to be the only accused in this case who hasn't been questioned by either the Delhi Police, CBI or Kings Commission; this despite figuring prominently in all the probe reports.

Arvind Kumar, then Operation Hansie's foot soldier, now ACP, Crime Branch, first calls Chawla the pivot, thinks for a while and changes it to ""sutradhar (main link)"". ""Woh Mahabharat dekha tha na TV pe aapne, Chawla 'Samay' hai (You saw serial Mahabharat on TV, didn't you? Chawla was the character 'Samay'),"" he says.

Anticipating his return, Ishwar smiles, ""Maybe he can even name a few Indian players.""

The CBI report did talk about Chawla's association with Indian players and his visits to the gym at Delhi's Hotel Park Royal, the watering hole where the key characters of this saga allegedly hung around. Everybody, from alleged punters Kalra, Dara, Krishan Kumar to players Ajay Jadeja, Manoj Prabhakar, Nikhil Chopra, reportedly regularly bumped into each other at this Nehru Place haunt. Kalra, the report also says, called the then India offie Chopra, on Chawla's insistence, before the Nagpur ODI (the Crookes game) to check if he was in the playing eleven. The CBI report, however, found nothing against Chopra.

In the almost two decades long lull, and the virtual closure of the case after Cronje's death in 2002, most of the tainted cricketers have got rid of the 'fixer' tag. They are now talking heads, coaches and selectors, and the return of the ghost from the past could be unsettling.

Chawla, 51, a UK passport holder, currently in London with his wife and two sons, tried his best to stonewall India's request. Westminster Magistrate's Court judgment shows how he raised issues of passage of time, prison conditions in India, human rights and right to family life. The hearing also discussed Chawla's wife's health issues, and mentioned the family's catering business and a restaurant let out on lease.

In his long career, Ishwar says, he has dealt with many suspects who run to court to avoid arrest. Back in 2000, Krishan Kumar too was a minor celebrity -- with hit songs like Sanam bewafa, Aacha sila diya tune mere pyaar ka, behind him, and those caterpillar-like eyebrows.

With policemen on his heels, Kumar first got himself admitted to Noida's Kailash Hospital and later moved the High Court to get anticipatory bail. The Delhi Police went to the Supreme Court for cancellation of bail.

Fifty-six-year-old Ishwar, now an ACP in the Capital's West District, remembers clearly the judge's caustically funny observation. ""R K Anand was Kumar's lawyer. The judge told him, 'Are you withdrawing the bail petition or should I pass an order? I was watching the match till 2 o'clock and wasting my time. If this isn't match-fixing, what is?' Ek minute mein bail plea uda di (He dismissed the bail plea in a minute), said go and surrender,"" says Ishwar, laughing heartily.

Srivastav too has one vivid memory from the episode. It was a line he heard in the Chawla-Cronje cassettes, after a game where apparently Gibbs was to score less than 20 runs but went on to make much more, thanks to several chances gifted by Indian fielders. ""I still remember Hansie's reply, 'If your b.....ds can't join their two hands, then what do I do?',"" Srivastav recalls, cracking up.

There was another, lesser-known character in this story: an Indian-origin restaurateur from Johannesburg who was ""the best friend"" of every Indian cricketer who stepped onto South African soil, a charismatic wheeler-dealer with that unforgettably dramatic name -- Hamid Banjo Cassim.

Touring Indian cricketers have a rather endearing nickname for men like Banjo. They are called ""Mamu"", the quintessential maternal uncles who spoil nephews during visits. These fans-turned-hangers-on-turned-groupies take a time-tested route to the heart of cricketers -- via the stomach.

On long tours, the easiest way to break the ice with India's cricketers is by arranging vegetarian food for home-sick players. If indulged, ""Mamus"" can be banked on for free SIMs and even all-paid shopping trips. In return, they ask for free match-day passes, selfies, signed memorabilia, and sometimes, a pound-and-a-half of flesh.

A giant of a man, Banjo was a school dropout and a failed entrepreneur. The father of three had a candy shop called Sweet Junction in Johannesburg's Fordsburg area, famous for a halal restaurant that served spicy curries.

Among the '90s South African players, he was the ""biltong"" man, someone who never tired of providing them the strictly carnivore nation's favourite snack, those dried and seasoned meat strips. He was more than a ""Mamu"" for the South Africans, especially Cronje. Records show he called the Porteas skipper 180 times in six months.

Indian cricketers from the 1996 tour remember Banjo for his extraordinary biryani delivery to the dressing room, lifted to the balcony from the grass banks by a rope. You could always trust Banjo to make things happen.

He told the Kings Commission that Kapil Dev was a good friend, close enough to introduce him to his wife. He wasn't lying, Kapil told the CBI about how he knew ""Hamid Mamu"" very well.

Banjo also flaunted how he arranged South African players for some friendly games that Kapil organised in India and how once, while driving the Indian star late one night in Johannesburg, he pranked his nephew. The young boy stood stunned at the counter of his truck shop seeing Kapil walk in and ask for a drink.

During the Kings Commission hearing, Banjo also said he had arranged SIM cards and phones for Bollywood stars when they visited South Africa. One pay-on-go SIM he provided to Amisha Patel -- that era's next big thing after her 2000 blockbuster Kaho Na Pyaar Hai -- was later used by Banjo to make calls to Chawla. Banjo also proudly told the Commission he had asked South African star Lance Klusener to arrange tickets for Patel for a Test at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.

So when Chawla wanted to get introduced to Cronje in South Africa in January 2000, a month before their India tour, Banjo was the obvious go-between. Details discussed during the Kings Commission hearing show Chawla was received by Banjo and taken to his shop for a meal.

A day before South Africa's tri-series ODI game against Zimbabwe on February 1, 2000, Banjo told the Commission, Chawla handed the South African skipper $15,000 at a Durban hotel in front of him. ""Mr Cronje took that envelope and I was surprised. He (Chawla) said, 'Keep this and I will talk to you at a later stage',"" Banjo said in his testimony.

During South Africa's subsequent series in India, Chawla kept talking to Cronje and, when he didn't take his calls, there was always Banjo who would mediate from Johannesburg. All through the hearing, the candy shop owner kept insisting that he was just a cricket enthusiast trying to be helpful. The advocates questioning him weren't always convinced. Chawla's return to India might add a new layer to this investigation.

This case has had a history of unexpected twists and turns. At every dead end, the Delhi Police have been lucky to find a new opening. DCP Srivastav has seen it first hand. The cold response of the government in the aftermath of the first FIR was disheartening for the team. ""My immediate superior, Joint CP, Crime, Dr K K Paul, was very supportive. But no one else was ready to believe us. The government asked why the FIR was filed prematurely, without proper evidence, and how it doesn't fall within the four walls of the law,"" he says.

The Delhi Police saw this as a case of cheating, both Chawla and Cronje were booked under IPC Sections 420 and 120B, but legal opinion was different. According to the law, cheating can only be established if somebody loses and somebody gains. Legal luminaries would ask: Whose loss is it if a match is fixed? That even if the outcome of a game was pre-decided, the spectators didn't know, they got their money's worth. Don't people pay to watch World Wrestling Entertainment, knowing those matches are fixed?

The Delhi Police tried to argue that the game wasn't ""fair"", which is what the fans pay for. ""We did register a case of cheating but there was always this grave doubt about it being tenable or not,"" says Srivastav.

And then came the turnaround. Another phone call, another accented voice. Srivastav was home for lunch when he was told by his helper that there was someone on line speaking ""angrezi"". ""I got on the line and heard English with a French accent. He was a reporter from a foreign agency. He said, 'Deputy Commissioner, you must be a very happy man. Each bit that you alleged against Hansie has been confessed by him last night',"" recalls Srivastav, adding how he will remain eternally grateful to the South African skipper for ""unburdening his conscience"".

Within minutes, the government's tone changed. Srivastav's voice has a crackle as he recalls, ""On television was then NSA himself, Brajesh Mishra. He came on screen to say: 'Satyamev jayate (Truth always prevails)... Whatever our officers were saying has been confirmed by Hansie himself'.""

Once again, the policemen gathered in front of the Crime Branch office television and exchanged amused smiles. It was a winter of crazy coincidences.

BJP can never win any election if it doesn't take into account social dynamics of the nation. The party is taking appropriate measures and will increase its strength in May next year.

He was in Hyderabad to address the alumni and students of Indian School of Business (ISB) on ""A nation's journey through to the next era of governance"" during Solstice 2018, the annual alumni meet of the school.

""BJP will retain power in 2019 elections as the party has populist support. And there is a very widespread desire in the country that the Ram temple be built and we will build it. I have submitted a proposal to the Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha. Amit Shah has also taken up the proposal and said he will check with his lawyers,"" he added.

Swamy mentioned that during the PV Narasimha Rao's government, Rao told the Supreme Court in 1994, in an affidavit as a part of the judgement, when asked what is the solution for the Ram temple, that if it ever it becomes known scientifically that there was a pre-existence temple, then the Government of India will give the land to Hindus to build the temple. The Supreme Court ordered Allahabad High Court to find out if there was any pre-existence of the temple. So the High Court has referred to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), and the ASI appointed two archaeologists who gave a unanimous report after using satellite imaging and lasers that there is a large Viashnav temple below that exists where Babri Masjid once stood.

""Rao's assurance is applicable to the current government too. We have taken the land and are building the temple now,"" he added.

On the opposition, he said, Rahul Gandhi cannot become a Prime Minister as he is the citizen of Britain. And Indian citizenship itself will be cancelled. He wouldn't even be a Member of Parliament.

Judiciary & gender equality

Uniform Civil Court though in the constitution has not been implemented. Law is a modern weapon for people, which is not used enough.

""I have my complaints on the lack of moral value among the lawyers. Also they take up so many cases that have led to delay in judgments. In the US, a court handles about 200 cases in a year while an Indian lawyer handles 200 cases individually in a year,"" he added. He said, women empowerment should happen in the country but reservation in the labour force is not necessary.

Pakistan

He said Pakistan which has been a failed nation should be divided into four parts and India should back it. The Baloch from Balochistan are keen to split out."

""There is no anti-incumbency against the BJP government,"" he said.

Explaining the reasons behind his prediction, he said the Opposition is a ""motley crowd"" and there is widespread desire even in Tamil Nadu that the Ram temple must be built.

Mr. Swamy answered a volley of questions in his inimitable style without mincing words on a variety of issues in conversation with political journalist Bhupendra Chaubey during the Solstice alumni event at the Indian School Of Business here on Saturday. Later, he interacted with mediapersons briefly.

""If the Ram temple becomes an election issue and if Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and P. Chidambaram, who are out on bail, are made to stand on trial, the public will be satisfied that the BJP has done enough to get another term,"" he said.

The Archaeological Survey of India, at the directive of Allahabad High Court, submitted a report after a scientific study that a large Vaishnav temple did exist earlier where Babri Masjid was constructed. This was after the P.V. Narasimsha Rao government gave an affidavit that if it was scientifically proven a temple pre-existed where the Babri Masjid stood, they would give the land to build the temple.

He said Narasimha Rao's commitment on part of government of India would apply to the BJP government too. The Supreme Court had also ruled a prior judgment that masjid is not an essential part of Islam as valid, Dr. Swamy said and added that the fundamental right to pray was a superior right.

Asked why the Ram temple issue was being made a central theme of next election when Narendra Modi won the 2014 election on development plank, Mr. Swamy said, ""We won the elections last time on three planks -- Mr. Modi's leadership, anti-corruption and Hindutva. The other two issues are left standing.""

To a question on why the BJP has not done well in the five States, including Telangana, in the recent Assembly elections, he said it is for the National Council meeting on January 11 or 12 to analyse the reasons, he said.

Dr. Swamy, however, admitted that the performance of the government was poor in economic field and job creation, but that would not impact the outcome of next elections if more focus was given to Hindutva and anti-corruption agenda.

He asserted that demonetisation was not a wrong move but there was no preparation to implement it properly. ""Its impact was felt in the recent Assembly elections as there was no other issue,"" he said.

On Shaktikanta Das' appointment as RBI governor, Mr. Swamy labelled it a wrong decision as he had been ""earlier removed from the Finance Ministry for trying to interfere in the corruption case against former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram""."

The bereaved family members have also sought compensation for the death of the sole bread earner in the family.

Lictsitha D Shira, the wife of a teacher Hillary Momin filed the WP on Friday and is being represented by advocate PT Sangma.

Momin was a teacher at St Joseph's School at Chidimit Nengsat was arrested by police of the Dagal AD camp under Songsak PS on Aug 3 this year. He was allegedly assaulted by policemen in custody. Momin, who was released the next day died from the injuries he suffered in the assault a few days later on Aug 11. The death had caused widespread furore in the area with a demand for the immediate arrest of those responsible for the death of the teacher.

An FIR was filed into the incident on the same day as the death of the teacher which later led to the transfer of the inspector in charge of the Dagal AD camp and an inquiry into the matter. However with literally no progress being made into the investigation of the case, the family decided to approach the HC leading to the WP.

The family had earlier approached the DC and SP of EGH on the matter but did not receive anything positive.

Amarinder Singh said while he had personally witnessed the developments and had the first-hand knowledge of the sequence of events, the Badals had conveniently disappeared from the scene during the turbulent times"".

The chief minister termed Sukhbir Badal's statements blaming the Gandhi family for the riots as ""completely baseless and senseless"" saying they were not even remotely connected with the violence.

While Rajiv Gandhi was out electioneering in West Bengal, Rahul was just a school-going child at the crucial time, and neither had any role to play in the riots, in which a few individual Congress leaders were named by the victims, said the chief minister in a statement.

He also accused the Akali Dal president of making a desperate bid to revive his electoral fortunes ahead of the 2019 general elections by seeking to drag the Gandhis' name in the 1984 riots.

He (Sukhbir Singh) was not even around at the time of the incidents and is dragging the Gandhi family into the case to get his virtually defunct Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) back into limelight, he said.

The chief minister also questioned Sukhbir Singh Badal's silence over the alleged complicity of many saffron leaders in the anti-Sikh riots.

There were, in fact, several RSS and BJP workers named in the FIRs, to whom Sukhbir had never eluded. It clearly suggests that his concern for the pain suffered by the Sikh community during the riots is a mere hogwash, aimed only at garnering votes in the Lok Sabha elections, Amarinder Singh said.

Amarinder Singh had attacked Sukhbir Singh Badal two days ago too over his attempts to ""drag"" the ""innocent"" Gandhi family into the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.

Earlier, Amarinder Singh had hailed the Delhi High Court verdict which sentenced former Congressleader Sajjan Kumar to life term, and expressed confidence that others guilty of the heinous crime too will be ""paid back in the same coin"".

The Vijay Mallya extradition saga rolled on throughout the year, while the cut-and-thrust of domestic politics was reflected in two high-profile visits: the April visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Commonwealth Summit, and the August visit of Congress president Rahul Gandhi to interact with policymakers, MPs, scholars as well as Indian journalists and students.

Strengths and challenges of Indian law, banking, prisons, politics and the media were closely examined during the Mallya extradition hearings, as the flamboyant businessman used the media contingent waiting outside the court to try and change the narrative that he stole money from India.

The Westminster magistrates court recommended Mallya's extradition, but many hoops remain before this can happen. He, however, remains enmeshed in several other legal cases, including those seeking to possess his houses and assets.

On the diplomatic front, there was a change of guard in India House, when Y K Sinha retired and Ruchi Ghanshyam took over as only the second woman high commissioner since 1947 (Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit was the first).

One Indian issue that has long endured in the UK is the row over 'Khalistan', which figured during Modi's visit when the Indian flag was torn by a Khalistan supporter; a rally in Trafalgar Square in August seeking a so-called 'referendum' for the independence of Punjab ; and a senior Indian official prevented from entering the Shepherd's Bush gurdwara in November.

In July, the Theresa May government brought the curtain down on the sensitive issue of enacting a law to bar caste-based discrimination. After years of debate, it decided not to legislate but to rely on emerging case-law courts.

The 1.5 million-strong Indian community has been deeply divided on the issue, with influential Hindu, Sikh and Jain lobbies denying that caste-based discrimination exists in Britain and contending that enacting such a law would entrench ideas of caste where none exist, while several individuals, Dalit and other groups insist it exists.

During most of 2018, there were four Indian-origin ministers in the May government: Alok Sharma, Shhailesh Vara, Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman (nee Fernandes), but Brexit-related concerns prompted Vara and Braverman to resign in November. Preet Kaur Gill was appointed shadow minister for international development.

Members of the Indian community continued to figure prominently in royal honours lists. Also for the first time, a Sikh soldier of the Coldstream Guards - Charanpreet Singh Lall - figured in the in traditional Trooping the Colour ceremony at Buckingham Palace for Queen Elizabeth's birthday in June.

Meanwhile, Neil Basu was appointed head of Scotland Yard's counter-terror operations, while Imtiyaz Shaikh, who hails from Vasco da Gama, became the first councillor of Goan origin to be elected to the council in Swindon.

On Independence Day, Scotland Yard returned to the Indian high commission a 12th century Buddha statue that was stolen from the Archaeological Survey of India's museum in Nalanda, Bihar, in August 1961, and recovered in the UK.

The year also saw a school in England launch a unique course on 'Hinglish', the popular portmanteau of English and Hindi used in Indian films, newspaper headlines, television and everyday discourse. Teachers in the school are surprised at the interest in the course.

The India-UK links also extended to the difficult world of stammering. A delighted Matthew Richardson, returning after conducting the first McGuire Programme in New Delhi in December for 30 people, said, ""They arrived as people unable to speak effectively and left as proud public speakers. Helping people in India to break the stigma of stammering is something I am very proud of"".

And finally, 'Bihar Diwas', on March 22, was celebrated in a unique location: Patna, in Scotland, a village in East Ayrshire founded in the early nineteenth century by a Briton, who was born in Patna, Bihar but returned to Scotland, to house mine workers. The chief guest was also appropriate: the Patna-born Y K Sinha, the former high commissioner."

As 2018 draws to a close, we reflect back on some of the landmark verdicts delivered by the Supreme Court this year. From Aadhaar to Section 377, the apex court pronounced several important verdicts with far-reaching implications for the country.

Supreme Court upholds Aadhaar law

In a landmark majority ruling, the Supreme Court upheld the Constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act but it struck down the requirement of linking Aadhaar to bank accounts and mobile phone numbers, and on its insistence for pension and school admissions.

The five-judge bench headed by then Chief Justice Dipak Misra declared as unconstitutional a part of Section 57 of the Act which permitted private body corporates and individuals to seek Aadhaar authentication, saying this ""would impinge upon the right to privacy of such individuals"".

The top court, however, upheld the linking of the permanent account number (PAN) to the unique Aadhaar number and the notifications allowing people to avail subsidies and benefits provided by the government.

While it upheld the Constitutional validity of the Act on the ground that it ""struck a fair balance between the right of privacy of the individual with right to life of the same individual as a beneficiary"", the Supreme Court ring-fenced the law from possible misuse by the State and private entities.

Section 377 struck down

Underlining the supremacy of ""constitutional morality"" over ""societal morality"", the Supreme Court had scrapped a 158-year-old British-era law that banned same-sex relations between consenting adults in private and punished them with jail terms for life or up to ten years.

Decriminalising a part of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a five-judge Constitution Bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra said the section violated the identity of an individual, the right to equality and the right to privacy. The provision, however, continues to apply to cases of bestiality, carnal intercourse with minors and in cases of no consent. Read more

'Adultery law arbitrary'

Describing as ""unconstitutional"" Indian Penal Code Section 497, which made adultery a punishable offence only for men, the Supreme Court had struck down the law criminalising adultery. The top court termed the law as arbitrary, which treats the wife as chattel and deprives women of her sexual autonomy and dignity. However, adultery continues to be a ground for any civil wrong, including a ground for divorce.

In four separate but concurring judgments, a five-judge Constitution Bench headed by then CJI Dipak Misra said the colonial-era provision violated Articles 14 (right to equality); 15(1) (prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth); and, 21 (protection of life and personal liberty).

Women of all ages can enter Sabarimala

In a 4-1 verdict, the Supreme Court had thrown open the doors of the Sabarimala temple in Kerala to women of all ages by ending the entry ban on women of menstruating age. While pronouncing its verdict, the apex court said the centuries-old custom at the shrine was not an essential religious practice and ""the attribute of devotion to divinity cannot be subjected to the rigidity and stereotypes of gender"".

Four of the five judges on the Constitution Bench -- the then CJI Dipak Misra, Justices R F Nariman, A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud -- ruled against the restriction on women while Justice Indu Malhotra gave a dissenting opinion, saying ""the religious practice of restricting the entry of women between the ages of 10 to 50 years is in pursuance of an 'essential religious practice'"" and ""notions of rationality cannot be invoked in matters of religion by courts"".

SC permits passive euthanasia

Making it legal for a terminally ill individual to decline use of life support measures, the Supreme Court had permitted passive euthanasia. The court allowed families of those in incurable coma to withdraw such measures to reduce the period of suffering. It also recognised the right to an ""advance directive"" (also called living will), spelling out views and wishes regarding medical treatment in terminally ill situations.

Hadiya case

Setting aside a 2017 order of the Kerala High Court which annulled the marriage of Kerala Muslim convert girl Hadiya and Shefin Jahan, the Supreme Court had underlined that ""the right to marry a person of one's choice is integral to Article 21 (right to life and liberty) of the Constitution"".

The court also allowed the NIA to continue its investigation in respect of any criminality with the rider that it should not encroach upon their marital status.

Hadiya embraced Islam in January 2016. Months later, she married Jahan, triggering allegations of forced conversion. Claiming that her daughter had been ""brainwashed"", Hadiya's father K M Ashokan moved the Kerala High Court which annulled the marriage and sent Hadiya to her parents' custody last May. On appeal by Jahan, the top court summoned Hadiya, interacted with her in open court and then sent her to continue her studies in a Salem college. Read more

National anthem cinema halls

Modifying its earlier order, the Supreme Court had said it is no longer mandatory for cinema halls to play the national anthem before screening a film.

Advertising

A bench headed by then CJI Dipak Misra modified the November 30, 2016 order which had made the playing of national anthem in cinema halls mandatory. Under the modified order, it will now be up to cinema hall owners whether or not to play the national anthem. The bench, however, made it clear that movie-goers will have to show respect to the anthem in case it is played, and they will have to stand."

An order was passed by the bench which dismissed the appeal by a teacher whose absence was treated by authorities as 'dies non.' The term 'dies non' implies a day which is not treated as a day on duty. The period while qualifying as service for increments or pension benefits, is not constituted as a break in service.

The bench, in its order, asked the director regarding any mechanism which was enforced by the department to ensure whether the teachers attended the schools regularly and did not proceed on leave without it being sanctioned. Furthermore, the bench enquired on the provision of informing the school in case of teacher's emergency leave"

Yes, that's what Sania and her Pakistani cricketer husband, Shoaib Malik have named their baby boy. Papa Shoaib Shares an Adorable Moment With Baby Izhaan Mirza Malik (See Pic).

""Living life in the fast lane can be fun !!! It's time to say hello to the world 😀 #Allhamdulillah,"" this is what proud mother writes on her Instagram handle.

Even while travelling, especially at airports, the protective mother ensured to cover precious son at all cost.

It is dawn in Kattukuppam, a fishing village by the Kosasthalaiyar river in Ennore, north Chennai. The sky lightens but the river remains the colour of night, streaked with an industrial palette of diesel, sewage and ash. Boats drift in with the day's catch on this modern-day Styx, as power plant chimneys spew smoke behind them.

As nets are emptied into straw baskets and the women gut fish in the streets, kabbadi coach R.L. Srinivasan heads out. Two streets away, a drowsy legion of boys pace in their Ennore Kabbadi jerseys in front of the municipal school's playground. ""This one has slept till 6 a.m.,"" says the coach, rolling his eyes and ruffling the six-year-old's hair. ""Go swim in the river and come!"" It's a threat enough to wake anyone up.

Kabbadi comes from kai pidi (catch my hand) and is believed to have its roots in Tamil Nadu. It is a high contact sport, where a lone raider from each team of seven must cross enemy lines, make contact and make a run for it, all the while chanting 'kabbadi' non-stop to show the referee you're holding your breath.

Enemy territory

Chennai's residents had better be holding their collective breath. Last Diwali, the city's air quality gave Delhi a run for it -- monitors recorded particulate matter levels reaching 916 g/m3 in North Chennai's Manali industrial area. Neighbouring Ennore, which supplies electricity to Chennai and parts of Tamil Nadu, does not have publicly available data on air pollution. But the heavy notes in the air are hard to escape: a potent amalgam of ammonia, coal, sewage and diesel, mingling with the salty sea breeze. The thermal ash spewed by power plants makes it unbreathable, even on its best days. Fly ash contains trace quantities of toxic heavy metals and silica that accumulate in respiratory tracts and lungs.

For the last four years, Srinivasan has been straying into enemy territory, battling for Chennai's right to breathe. He heads the fishing community's cooperative society that has been taking on big polluters and last year, based on a petition filed by a six-village committee that he brought together, the National Green Tribunal ordered for health studies to be conducted in the villages around Ennore.

North Chennai is a dystopian landscape of fishing villages wedged between industry and the sea. There are three thermal power plants, one which serves the Ennore SEZ, which is being built on a fly ash pond.

Ghost village

There's the Kamaraj port and the Kattupalli port. And inland, there is a coal terminal and a petroleum refinery. Natural gas pipelines run along rusted ash pipelines, leaking slurry at the slightest provocation into the river. A 1,000-acre coal ash pond is filled beyond capacity and has contaminated nearly 340 hectares of land. Seppakkam is a village that has turned ghostly white. Children run out of houses ankle-deep in grey slurry, playing hide-and-seek between laundry lines, their voices made breathless from inhaling the fine, oily excesses of Tamil Nadu's power generation. Visits to hospitals are routine, and costly. ""We spend ₹700-800 on scans and fees and medicines every visit. Sometimes, we pawn our jewellery for medical expenses,"" said a 28-year-old woman from Sepakkam.

Srinivasan filed a case in the National Green Tribunal, as a result of which the environment ministry has shut down a road being built over the Kosasthalaiyar's mouth for a coal conveyor belt. And following a PIL filed by the fisherfolk society this November, the Chennai High Court has temporarily stayed the dumping of flyash in the mangroves.

Srinivasan's group has also teamed up with singer T.M. Krishna to shine a spotlight on Ennore, which inspired Poromboke, his ode to the commons. This month, as a result of Health Energy Initiative's reports, the environment ministry has mandated that new coal plants must conduct community health assessments and periodic monitoring.

As the sun sets, grandmothers sit in a circle, shooting marbles and catching up with gossip. In another corner, boys gather for a round of kabaddi. As he fights for their right to breathe easy, coach Srinivisan offers them something else too: hope."

According to City Crime Records Bureau (CCRB), under section 5 and 6 (Aggravated penetrative sexual assault & punishment thereof) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the number of cases has increased. In 2017, 59 cases were reported and this year until November 30, 79 cases have been reported.

On November 26, two cases were registered at Subramaniya and Adugodi police stations under this section. A 14-year-old who was in a relationship with a 20-year-old painter, got pregnant following which the mother of the child filed a police complaint at Subramaniya Police Station.

The Adugodi police station also registered a case of a five-year-old child who was assaulted by an auto driver. Another case on November 15 at Vijaya Nagar saw a six-year-old girl allegedly raped by a construction worker while four other workers watched and clapped during the act. The case was found only when the girl complained of pain in her private area to her school teacher.

Her parents found out that she was assaulted by some construction labourers working opposite her house. All five have been arrested.According to DCP crime, Girish S, some of the cases also include teenagers above 15-year-olds entering into a relationship and having intercourse. ""The cases cannot be generalised. Each case, under this section, is different. Some are severe rape cases while others have parents filing a complaint about their child having a physical relationship,"" he said.

Vishalakshi P S, coordinator for childline at Association for Promoting Social Action (APSA), said that after such incidents, the child is suggested to be taken to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) for further counselling.

In a breathless 2018, they were just a handful of headlines on immigration, one of the year's most dominant issues.

Combined with a relentless stream of administrative memos and changes in regulation and enforcement, it represented a government bombardment on virtually every type of immigration -- a bold follow-up to the opening salvo of President Donald Trump's first year in office.

For those who champion Trump and believe that cracking down on immigration translates to better lives for Americans, it has been a year of fulfillment of campaign promises. For those who've watched in horror, it harkened back to other points in the country's history, when fear of new arrivals led the US to refuse entry to various groups and when open discrimination of certain ethnicities prevailed.

READ | US President Donald Trump's Mexico border wall going up in Texas

""This is our generation's sort of existential moment,"" said Frank Sharry, head of pro-immigration group America's Voice. ""Are we going to continue to be a nation that practices 'e pluribus unum' and welcomes people from around the world to make this country better? Or are we going to shut the door?""

Throughout 2018, the answer has largely been the latter.

Even as roundups and deportations persist in targeting those who enter the US illegally, the Trump administration has pushed beyond that to redefine what legal immigration looks like, too. It has slowed down or altogether halted many seeking to come to the country for a job offer or through their relationship to a citizen, and narrowed the chances of finding a home here as a refugee or asylum seeker. Jarring visuals of children in detention centers and other enforcement actions have dissuaded some from seeking to come here at all.

READ | Trump calls for immigration reform, terms current laws 'dumbest'

""There has been this constant chip, chip, chipping away at the legal immigration system using every tool of the executive branch,"" said Doug Rand, who worked in the Obama administration before helping found Boundless Immigration, which helps people navigate the immigration system.

The year neared its close with the administration saying those seeking asylum would be forced to wait in Mexico, a major shift that immediately spurred questions of legality from opponents. Meantime, the possibility of a government shutdown loomed as Trump and Democrats once again butted heads over funding to build a wall along the border with Mexico.

Even without it, though, the policies he's pursued have effectively put up a virtual wall.

""That is far more effective than a border wall ever would be,"" said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.

Even top-tier computer programmers, architects, engineers and other professionals with job offers in the US saw their applications for H1-B visas under much more scrutiny; a means of expediting processing of those visas was ended under Trump, and bids for work authorization have been met by what employers and immigration attorneys say seem like endless requests for evidence to prove seemingly straightforward facts.

Still, the odds of those professionals eventually gaining clearance to enter the US are better than for many others.

Trump's so-called ""travel ban,"" the first iteration of which was unveiled in the president's first week in office, was upheld in June by the US Supreme Court, stopping most visas for residents of mostly Muslim Libya, Iran, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, as well as North Korea and Venezuela. Though the policy allows for waivers, initial data showed few such applications were actually approved, effectively shutting the door to most from those nations.

It's had very real consequences for people like Soolmaz Dadgari, an Iranian who came to the US in 2017 so her 4-year-old daughter, Arina, could take part in an experimental study to treat a rare genetic disorder. Dadgari's husband has been unable to get a visa to join them, and sanctions make it hard for him to send money. She alone cares for a child who can't walk or talk and requires 24-hour help, as well as another 11-year-old daughter.

Dadgari has considered returning home but knows she needs to remain for her daughter's treatment. Still, the situation has affected the way she views the U.S., which she had always regarded as the best place in the world.

""I have no hope,"" she said.

Even as wars, persecution and famine have continued around the world, the US capped refugee admissions at 45,000 for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the lowest ceiling since the State Department began tracking the figure in 1980. Far fewer were actually admitted in that time frame: about 21,000 refugees. The number is likely to fall further, with the cap for the current fiscal year set at 30,000.

Meantime, tens of thousands fleeing violence in Central America sought asylum in the US this year. The Trump administration responded by narrowing who is eligible, declaring that neither those escaping gang violence or domestic abuse nor those who cross the border illegally qualify. Both changes have been blocked by federal courts.

Some seeking refuge in the US are stuck in untenable positions.

Ivis Muñoz, 26, decided to join a caravan leaving Honduras in mid-October. A gang member had shot him in the thigh and threatened to kill him. Muñoz planned to seek asylum in the US but learned along his journey that he was unlikely to be accepted.

His first night in Tijuana, Mexico, he slept on the beach until rocks rained down on him and other migrants and a man shouted in the darkness: ""Go back to your country!"" Now he's a few hours east in Mexicali, his aching leg full of bullet fragments, overwhelmed and scared by his reality.

""I don't know what to do,"" said Munoz, a coffee farmer from the Honduran town of Atima. ""I want to go to the United States, though I'm scared they'll send me back. I'm afraid to be in Honduras, but I don't feel safe here either.""

At every turn, there were policy changes. One proposed rule would restrict visas or legal permanent residence for those receiving certain government benefits for low-income people, such as food stamps. Hundreds of immigrant enlistees in the Army were discharged or had their contracts cancelled, though some were later reinstated. Even some US citizens were targeted by a ""denaturalization task force"" looking for naturalized Americans with past infractions.

More than any other shifts in policy, the Trump administration's move to separate apprehended migrant children from their parents shook people around the world. Though Trump eventually ended widespread use of the practice, the scars remain for those affected.

Evelin Roxana Meyer of La Union, Honduras, thought 2018 would be the year things turned around for her family. They've struggled to pay off a loan for the grocery store they run out of their home, so her husband, Douglas, and son, Eduardo, set off for the United States in hopes of finding work. Instead, the two were picked up by Border Patrol agents and separated.

The father was deported, but it took weeks before the parents knew where Eduardo was taken. He spent four months in detention, turning 12 alone at a facility in Brownsville, Texas. The once-affectionate boy returned home angry in September. He rarely goes out, spending most of his time in his room watching TV. He's refused to go to school and will have to repeat the sixth grade. He talks back to his parents and hits his little sister, whom he used to be close to. The family doesn't know what to do to help him.

""This was the toughest year of all,"" said 38-year-old Meyer.

Polling finds a big majority of Americans still view the country's openness to immigrants as essential to the nation's identity. But the profound shift in government policies on the subject threatens that idea of the US as a welcoming land of opportunity for all.

Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham University, sees Trump's immigration overhaul as the continuation of a tug-of-war that's played out since the nation's founding, between what many see as bedrock American ideals and a pattern of nevertheless being hostile to newcomers.

""The country, unfortunately, has had an incongruence with the myth of America versus the reality of America,"" said Greer, who authored ""Black Ethnics: Race, Immigration, and the Pursuit of the American Dream."" ''Trump's really fine with blowing up the myth.""

Sharry thinks the country's reputation suffers when its leaders close the doors to others: ""They've put a million people on the road to deportation. They've ripped thousands of kids from their parents. They've gutted refugee protection at our border. They're building and expanding detention centers. They're trying to scare low-income immigrants from using health and other services. They've taken aim at legal immigration. They've slashed refugee admissions. That's a pretty relentless assault on a core principal of the American experiment.""

Others see it far differently.

Neil Gouveia came to the US from Guyana as a 7-year-old. His family waited years to earn visas, then waited again to become citizens. His parents made the difficult choice to leave behind his 9-year-old sister, who had cerebral palsy and wasn't granted a visa.

Gouveia considered himself a typical ""liberal New Yorker"" until 2016, when he was drawn to Trump for what he believed was his strength on national security. Gouveia is gay and said the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, particularly shook him.

He wasn't offended when Trump referred to parts of the world as ""shithole countries,"" and doesn't see anything inherently wrong in separating immigrant children from the adults they arrive with. He thinks, ultimately, it will all lead to greater dialogue and better policies. And he still believes America stands as a beacon for much of the world.

""At the end of the day, people will say what they want to say about America, but there's hardly anyone who still wouldn't want to come here,"" said Gouveia, 39, a collegiate fundraiser. ""They still know it's like winning the lottery.""

Daniel Stein heads the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports restrictive immigration measures. He agrees the year's immigration imagery has had ""a huge political impact on the psyche of the nation,"" but argues it has moved more people to his side of the debate. And to those who see the year as an extended assault on a cornerstone American value, he's unmoved.

""They have a vivid imagination,"" Stein said. ""We have one of the world's most generous immigration programs.""

That's little comfort to Buena Ventura Martin Godinez, a 29-year-old mother of two who carried her 9-month-old son across the border in May, fleeing threats from violent gangsters in her hometown of San Juan Atitan, Guatemala. She was caught in Arizona and held for a week at a detention center with her baby. When her husband followed two weeks later with their 7-year-old daughter, they weren't so lucky.

The girl was sent to a facility in Michigan and kept there for six weeks; the father went to an Atlanta jail, where he still awaits deportation. Her family fractured, Godinez now regrets the day she ever headed to the U.S.

""I came looking for a better life ... and everything went wrong,"" she said from the five-room house in Homestead, Florida, that she and her two children share with nine others. ""I thought that it was true that it is a country that gives opportunities. But it is not.""

Godinez notices changes in her children. Her daughter, always so sweet and obedient, cries incessantly and struggles in school. Her son keeps falling ill, his temperament now trademarked by screaming, crying and sighing."

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) G Ram Gopal Naik confirmed the chargesheet has been filed against 10 persons on Thursday in a city court.

The 482-page chargesheet has cited 78 witnesses including the girl student, for whom her teacher leaked the paper and some students who had received the papers through WhatsApp, said another officer.

Recovered mobile phones, handwritten notes, question paper written by the girl student and other data retrieved from cell phones have been cited as evidence in the chargesheet.

""The teacher, Rakesh Kumar, wanted to favour a girl student and with the connivance of bank officials, he got the Economics paper and brought it to his residence. He called the girl home and she copied the paper and then he clicked pictures of the paper and circulated it. The girl is one of the witnesses in the case,"" said the officer.

Since he had access to the papers, he also leaked the Class 10 Mathematics paper in the same way to favour a woman relative in Ferozpur whose son was appearing for the Boards.

Along with Kumar, Sheru Ram, branch manager of Union Bank Of India, Om Prakash, head cashier of the same bank and a 40-year-old woman, who had circulated hand-written question papers of Class 12 economics and Class 10 mathematics via instant messaging platform WhatsApp from her mobile phone, were also arrested and have been named in the chargesheet as accused.

Two others, Amit Sharma and Ashok Kumar, who worked at the DAV school in Una along with Kumar, have also been named in the chargesheet, the officer said.

Apart from this, the police had also busted another module being operated by two teachers of Mother Khazani Convent School in Bawana.

In the Bawana module, three men, including two teachers of the private school, were involved.

The teachers - Rishabh and Rohit - had taken photographs of the economics paper and sent it to Tauqeer, who used to give private tuition. Tauqeer circulated the paper among his students about an hour before the examination commenced, police had said, adding, he had received the paper via WhatsApp from Rishabh and Rohit.

The principal of Mother Khazani School, Praveen Kumar Jha, was arrested in July and his name also figures in the chargesheet, the officer said.

The economics paper leak was exposed after an envelope containing four images of a hand-written copy of the question paper was delivered to the CBSE Headquarters in Delhi on the evening of March 26, the day of the exam.

On March 30, the Central Board of Secondary Education announced it would re-conduct the Class 12 economics exam throughout the country on April 25.

Besides the Class 12 economics paper, the mathematics paper of Class 10 had also surfaced online before the scheduled examination.

The Delhi Police had registered two cases in connection with the paper leak. The first case related to the leak of economics paper was registered on March 27, while the other pertaining to the leak of mathematics paper was filed on March 28.

The exams for Class 10 mathematics and Class 12 economics papers were held on March 28 and March 26 respectively.

After reports of the leak surfaced on March 28, the CBSE had announced it would re-conduct the economics exam on April 25.

The board had decided against holding a re-examination for mathematics, saying the examination was ""largely an internal segment"" of the school education system.

According to the newspaper, the SIA has been conducted by the Madras School of Social Work (MSSW) and its report has been displayed in public at the office of the Chennai district collector.

Days after the AIADMK supremo passed away after a 75-day hospitalisation at Apollo Hospital in Chennai, a Change.org petition sought to convert Veda Nilayam into a memorial for the late leader.

This was soon echoed by AIADMK leaders, while Jayalalithaa's nephew and niece, Deepak and Deepa, who have claimed ownership of her properties, have objected to it.

Sasikala Natarajan had been residing at the property following the death of Jayalalithaa. With her imprisonment at the Parappana Agrahara jail in Bengaluru in the Disproportionate Assets case, calls for converting the residence into a memorial grew louder.

In 2017, the Tamil Nadu government had proposed to convert the former CM's residence into a memorial and even allocated Rs 20 crore to acquire the property.

However, residents of the Poes Garden area have voiced strong opposition to the move. At the first public hearing conducted by the MSSW in Teynampet, the residents said that the move will risk their safety, especially of the children and women, with people from across the state coming to the neighbourhood to visit the memorial and vendors setting up shops. Social activist Traffic Ramaswamy too, had moved the court seeking that public funds not be used for the acquisition.

Number 81, Veda Nilayam, Poes Garden was bought by Jayalalithaa and her mother Sandhya in 1967. The property is spread over 24,000 square feet and is considered a prime real estate in the city.

Lalau, Agra: The last thing 15-year-old Sanjali Chanakya asked of her mother was that ""she continue to fight for justice"" for her.

""I couldn't fight in this life ma, but you don't give up,"" her mother remembers her saying, shortly before succumbing to full thickness burns that covered more than 50 per cent of her body.

Sanjali was set on fire by two unidentified men who arrived on a red motorcycle Tuesday afternoon, as the class 10 student walked home from Asharfi Devi Chidda Singh Inter-College in the Naumeel village of Agra district, which is located roughly five kilometres from her home in neighbouring Lalau. One of the attackers poured the petrol, while the other threw a lighter at her. The loose sand by the side of National Highway 39 still carries the mark of scorched earth.

After being rushed to S.N. Medical College and Hospital in Agra, Sanjali was transferred to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi the same evening. She died in the wee hours of Thursday.

At least three schools have been shut in Lalau and surrounding villages -- the girls say they are too scared to walk the streets.

DSP Namrita Srivastava, the circle officer of Agra, says ""the police are very close to arresting the culprits"". But it has now been four days since the crime, and Sanjali's family is beginning to lose hope that justice will be done.

""My daughter is gone, and she's never coming back. Now all I can wish for is that the men responsible for this are behind bars,"" Sanjali's mother, Anita, tells ThePrint.

Sanjali had big dreams. ""I want to grow up to be an IPS officer,"" she had told her father Harendra Singh, who smiles as he relives the memory.

""I told her that I'm not a man with enough means to fulfil that promise, but Sanjali didn't quit easily. She told me that 'one way or the other, we must figure it out',"" he says.

Sanjali's older sister Anjali adds: ""Do you know, she even won a bicycle once... I think it was an inter-college general knowledge competition in her school and she came first.""

Rajendra Singh, a fellow resident of the village, remembers Sanjali as a headstrong, independent and ambitious girl, ""who was an exceptional student"". She would even help her father and sister with sums.

Harendra recalls: ""Sometimes, it felt like she wasn't my daughter but my mother. She'd tell me to keep quiet when I wasn't making sense. She'd set the table and ask us all to come for dinner. She wanted to be so many things when she grew up,"" her father tells ThePrint.

Uttar Pradesh deputy CM Dinesh Sharma reached the grieving household early Friday afternoon, accompanied by an entourage of at least 20 police officers, as well as BJP MLA Hemlata Divakar, and former mayor of Agra Anjula Singh Mahor.

Sharma assured the family that the culprits would be brought to justice swiftly, and ""will not be spared"". Further he promised compensation of Rs 5 lakh, as opposed to the initial sum of Rs 2 lakh.

For Sanjali's father, however, the offer is meaningless. ""The deputy CM basically came to negotiate a payment... He was bargaining with us, saying 'Okay not 2, take 5',"" he says.

Asked if she has faith that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath will take action, mom Anita says: ""Absolutely none.""

Anjali adds: ""If it was his daughter, he'd run barefoot to get this solved.""

Sanjali hailed from a Dalit family, but the police and the family both believe there's no caste angle to her murder. The family, in fact, said Dalit residents of Lalau don't face discrimination.

Members of parties across the spectrum -- the BJP, Congress, BSP, and the women's wing of the CPI(M) -- have made appearances at Lalau to offer their condolences and promise swift justice.

On the other hand, in a tweet Thursday, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad put forth a challenge that ""if these miscreants aren't caught, then I'll shut the whole country down like what happened on April 2nd.""

A few hours later, he arrived with a group of at least 30 Bhim Army members at the family's doorstep.

""I have faith that they will be caught, but if they're not, then the entire Bhim Army is ready to take to the streets and protest. If someone is being protected, then we won't stand by that,"" Azad said as he addressed the locals and the press.

Another Bhim Army leader, Sikandar Boudh, says the Bhim Army demands swift justice, Rs 1 crore as compensation, a job for a family member, a CBI investigation, and death penalty for the perpetrators. He says these demands have been given in writing to the District Magistrate of Agra, Ravi Kumar.

Amid this political heat, one can hear the wails of Sanjali's aunt, 50-year-old Rajan Devi. A woman supports her as she walks, leading her to the congregation of mourners and bystanders outside the family's home Friday. One hour later, the white sheet-wrapped body of her own 25-year-old son, Yogesh Singh, is placed on the floor in front of her and her husband.

Less than a day after his cousin's death, Yogesh committed suicide in his room by ingesting poison. His mother does not know why, except that her son expressed considerable anxiety at having been summoned by the police as a suspect in the death of his paternal cousin.

""The police had taken him to the station for questioning, and when I went to meet him, he asked me if people in the village knew that he has been taken to the police station. I said they did,"" Rajan Devi says.

She adds that Yogesh was taken by the police to Delhi Wednesday, and even met his cousin while she was in critical care. He was released on return, and even made it home for dinner.

""Everything was normal. He woke up in the morning, had tea, and spoke to the family. I went to get ready to go to his uncle's (Sanjali's father) house, and he came out of his room after some time complaining of an unbearable stomach ache,"" she recalls. Yogesh was declared dead by doctors hours later.

He had completed his B.Ed. and hoped to be the principal of a school someday. In the meantime, he provided for his family by working at Torrent Power, the distributor of electricity in Agra city.

He is also not the first son Rajan Devi is mourning -- Pankaj, Yogesh's elder brother had lost his life under the wheels of a train three years ago.

Bhim Army's Boudh says: ""The police wants to frame the cousin brother because they don't have any leads. An effort to sully the nature of their relationship has been made in this regard.""

Rajan Devi adds: ""The things that people are saying aren't true, about Yogesh and Sanjali. He wasn't a boy like that at all. He was kind and good-natured.""

Yogesh's father, meanwhile, weeps in front of his son's body -- the solitary man on the floor amongst a sea of veiled women.

""We were happy,"" Anjali says, ""and now there is nothing."""

Archis Mohan reports.

Navjot Singh Sidhu was 'on the brink' of losing his voice. Incredulous as it sounded, the press statement from the Punjab government on December 6 was unambiguous.

The 55-year-old Punjab minister for local government, tourism and cultural affairs had been campaigning for the Congress for 17 days nonstop. He had addressed 70 public meetings, back to back, in poll-bound Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Rajasthan.

A natural showman with the gift of the gab, the turbanator had been quite a crowd puller.

Such was the intensity of his speeches that his vocal cords finally protested. Having injured them, he had now left for an undisclosed location for treatment to get his voice back.

Thankfully for his party, his voice had held till campaigning ended.

In these crucial assembly elections, which saw the Congress re-emerging as a force to reckon with, Sidhu turned out to be the party's star campaigner.

He took on stalwarts of the Bharatiya Janata Party in his trademark style -- mocking and mimicking them. Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi, whom he used to swear by until a few years ago, particularly had his attention.

Videos of his election speeches on YouTube where he mimics Modi or questions him on unfulfilled promises became a rage.

With practically every candidate wanting him to campaign in his constituency, Sidhu was a man on the go.

While he was in Chhattisgarh, addressing nearly a dozen public meetings over three days right before the second phase of polling, the clamour for him to be in Rajasthan grew.

And then, candidates from Madhya Pradesh wanted him -- he addressed six rallies in the state on the last day of campaigning there.

This done, he landed in Amritsar to prepare for the groundbreaking ceremony for the proposed Kartarpur corridor along with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.

The 4.7-km-long corridor would connect two important Sikh shrines -- one in India and the other in Pakistan -- and allow pilgrims to visit, without a visa, a gurdwara in Pakistan where Guru Nanak Dev, the first Sikh guru, spent his final years.

From winning over crowds at dusty rallies to hobnobbing with the prime minister of a neighbouring country, Sidhu did it all effortlessly. That he is equally comfortable in Hindi, English, Punjabi and Urdu helped.

Not everybody, however, approved of his visit to Pakistan.

While the BJP criticised him for it, the Congress leadership in Punjab also insinuated that he was making a mistake by trusting Pakistan.

As a battle of words broke out, Congress President Rahul Gandhi sent a message to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh asking him to rein in his ministers.

Campaigning in Rajasthan and Telangana wasn't over yet, and seeing what a phenomenon he had been in the other two states, Gandhi did not want Sidhu distracted.

Sidhu's popularity, Congress strategists point out, lies both in his reputation as a swashbuckling cricketer who would hit sixes at will and his subsequent television persona.

""He has been a cricketer, but also an entertainer,"" says a Congress leader, who is part of the party's communication department. ""His past as a cricketer makes it difficult for the BJP to question his nationalism. He gets away by ridiculing Modi while something similar from most Congress leaders does not resonate as much.""

For example, at one of his public meetings in Madhya Pradesh, Sidhu said Modi was the kathputli (puppet) of moneybags.

In Alwar in Rajasthan, Sidhu said the Congress gave four Gandhis to the country -- Indira, Rajiv, Sonia and Rahul -- while the BJP has given three Modis.

'Two of them, Nirav and Lalit, have decamped with the money, while the third sits in the lap of moneybags,' he said to loud cheers.

""He connects with people using sarcasm, humour and shayari (poetry), and people have respect for him as somebody who brought laurels to the country,"" says Pintu Sangwan, a 40-year-old Congress worker from Nagaur, Rajasthan.

In Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh, Sidhu had the audience in splits when he said economists around the prime minister were not arthashastris, but vyarthashastri (wasters).

It was a jibe at Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for whom Sidhu, who was earlier with the BJP, had to vacate his Amritsar Lok Sabha seat in 2014. Sidhu had won the seat thrice before that. But Jaitley couldn't.

Sidhu was incensed when months before the Punjab assembly elections, the BJP sent him to the Rajya Sabha in the nominated category. He quit the party, discovered that the resurgent Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab was too small a place for a man of his talents, and eventually joined the Congress in early 2017.

Sidhu won over the Congress leadership and its workers with his speech at the party's plenary session in March this year.

It is hard to imagine that this flamboyant Sikh, ever ready with repartee, could ever have been shy. But that was the case -- many moons ago. In the past, Sidhu has said that he was extremely shy as a child and once fainted when told to ask students at his school to disperse after the assembly.

Sidhu might no longer be shy, but he remains temperamental.

In an interview, he said he made it to the coveted St Stephen's College in Delhi, but quit after he beat a group of seniors with a curtain rod when they tried to rag him.

The next day he was back in Patiala to play cricket. In the initial years, while his father, Bhagwant Singh, dreamt of his son playing for India, Sidhu was not keen on taking up cricket as a career.

And when he did make his debut for India in 1983 against the West Indies, he was a disaster -- scoring 20 runs in 90 minutes before being practically booed off the field. Cricket writer Rajan Bala described him as a 'strokeless wonder'.

Sidhu once recalled seeing his tearful father trying to hide that newspaper from him. That was the turning point. He pasted that newspaper on his cupboard and got down to business.

Four years later, he made a spectacular comeback, scoring four successive half centuries in the 1987 World Cup -- a feat that now had people calling him 'sixer Sidhu'.

'One day, Ravi Shastri handed me the Khaleej Times, saying there was something in it about me. The headline read, 'From a strokeless wonder to a Palmgrove hitter'. It was by the same writer,' Sidhu said in an interview.

A year later, Sidhu and a friend of his were booked for culpable homicide (not amounting to murder) in a road rage case which had led to the death of a 65-year-old man. The case haunted him for nearly 30 years and even cost him his Lok Sabha seat after the Punjab and Haryana high court convicted him in 2006. The Supreme Court finally acquitted him earlier this year.

Then, during India's tour to England in 1996, a sulking Sidhu walked out of the team's hotel accusing his captain, Mohammad Azharuddin, of constantly abusing him. A committee later concluded that Sidhu's departure from England was an 'emotional reaction from a hypersensitive individual'.

IMAGE: Navjot Singh Sidhu takes the oath as a minister in the Amarinder Singh government, March 16, 2017. Photograph: PTI Photo

Temperamental in life, on the cricket field and in politics, Sidhu, once a reticent man, did reinvent himself after retirement. He credits this transformation to meditation and vegetarianism.

A devoted meat eater, he turned vegetarian after one hunting session with a friend. They had killed a doe; when they cut her open, they found a fully formed foetus inside. Sidhu said he could never eat meat again.

Sidhu's recent popularity has some speculating that he might be the next chief minister of Punjab. That could be so, given that Amarinder Singh will be 80 when elections are held in the state in 2022.

But then, as then British prime minister Harold Wilson said: 'A week is a long time in politics.'

The Himachal Pradesh high court has asked the state's Elementary and Higher Education Department to apprise it of the government's mechanism to check absenteeism among school teachers.

A division bench of justices Dharam Chand Chaudhary and Chander Bhusan Barowalia Thursday ordered the department's director to file an affidavit detailing the mechanism to check the malady in the state's school.

The bench passed the order while dismissing an appeal by a teacher whose absence from the school had been treated by authorities as ""dies non"".

""Dies non"" means a day which is not treated as a day on duty. While it does not constitute a break in the service, the period does qualify as service for pension benefits or increments.

In its order, the bench asked the director if any mechanism has been enforced by the department to ensure that the teachers attend their schools every day and do not proceed on leave without getting it sanctioned.

The bench also asked as to what was the provision for informing the school in case of a teacher proceeding on an emergency leave. Seeking the affidavit within two weeks, the bench adjourned the matter for next hearing on January 7."

""There are those who commit crime and there are those who witness it and remain silent. I feel the latter is a bigger wrong doer and therefore I felt it is time I put my experiences in serving the nation in writing,"" says Rear Admiral BR Menon (Retd) about his book Honesty Victimised CBI Politicised.

After serving in the Indian Navy for 31 years, Menon took over as CMD Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL), in 1995, tasked to bring the yard back on track from the grip of a vicious trade union mafia.

Two telling incidents of the rot he had to cleanse are about watching a group of agitating workers thrash the General Manager of GSL, and another of a ship propeller going missing overnight before its launch the next day. Not only did he physically intervene to save his GM but in one big move removed the incumbent security system and arranged for Central Industrial Security Forces (CISF) to takeover the yard.

""I was sent to GSL to clean up the shipyard of extreme militancy. I found that the yard had very little work.""

Menon managed to turnaround GSL from its negative image to one that began doing business worth ₹1400 crore and more.

The book talks about his tenure at the shipyard and several experiences with politicians, workers and union leaders.

""At one point I was the most hated man in Vasco and my wife could not buy fish there. The fishermen had been asked to boycott us,"" he says laughing at the recollection. Of the cleansing operations of GSL Menon addressed social problems like alcoholism among workers to more challenging ones like breaking the nexus between trade union leaders and local politicians.

But the journey was fraught with more serious ordeals. Setting a house in order meant crossing swords with many powerful bigwigs and his immediate political bosses. It soon had the CBI at his doorstep and he was implicated on false charges.

He fought a 13-year long battle to restore his reputation after retirement.

All through the ordeal his wife, Promila, stood rock solid with him attending 72 hearings in the Goa Sessions Court. Of a raid at his mother's home in Kochi, Menon recalls a CBI DSP telling him of his mother's courage. ""The police officer said she was the boldest woman he had come across for their officers had never been frisked by anyone ever before.""

Turning GSL around was a badge of honour and subsequently Menon was inducted by the government of Kerala to serve in different capacities. Here too he fought many political battles and stood his ground based on honesty and integrity.

He served as CMD TELK (Transformers and Electricals Limited) followed by Chairman of Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation Ltd, and Advisor to CM of Kerala, Advisor to Lakshwadeep Development Corporation Ltd and Advisor Emeritus Kunjali Marikkar School of Marine Engineering, CUSAT.

""My service with the Indian Navy was great but I feel that I have done more work of cleansing the nation after that.""

In 2014 Menon began writing his book, which besides being an interesting narrative has the correspondence between him, union leaders and political bosses.

""The urge to write was basically to spread the message that if you are wronged fight to the finish. The Navy disciplines you but honesty and integrity is in one's DNA,"" says the Admiral feted for his outstanding work for the nation.

Honesty Victimised CBI Politicised is published by Mansa Publications and will be released on December 22 at the Grand Hyatt in Kochi"

Homely and modest, those were the words that came to my mind as we walked through the gates of the SAI Gopichand National Badminton Academy in Hyderabad. I had always imagined the place to be a grand theatre, but it had a rather unremarkable facade for a place which had given Indian sports some of its biggest champions in the past decade.

As we entered the building and started to settle down, getting ready in turn for the busy schedule of interviews, I realised why this place had and continues to produce so many top quality athletes. This was more like a school, where India's finest badminton talents would submit themselves to the tutelage of 'Gopi Sir', who would then mould them into world beaters.

We were slowly putting our equipments in place as we were told that our big ticket interview was still a few hours away, until someone announced, ""please get your cameras ready, Sindhu is here."" I had last interviewed the shuttler on the eve of the opening season of India's first professional badminton league way back in 2013. Back then Sindhu was a shy teenager, still learning the ropes of handling her newfound success and most importantly the media.

READ: Sindhu scripts history, beats Okuhara to become first Indian to win world series title

The Sindhu who walked in a few moments later was a different person. Tall, lean and sinewy, her gait easy yet extremely confident. The Sindhu of now had travelled the world, won many titles, rubbed shoulders with celebrities from other walks of life and most importantly she was assured of her place among the legends of Indian sports, even if she were to retire the same day. It reflected in the calm and candour with which she handled my first question on tackling expectations and scrutiny at every step of her now fabled career.

""There is always scrutiny and pressure from the media. I am always told that I have to win. I do understand that I have a responsibility and it has only increased after the Olympic medal.

Every time I go on to the court people expect me to get a medal. It is tough and I can't win always but I still have to go out there and give my best. If you think about the expectations then there will be extra pressure. I believe in performing and the results follow and that keeps everyone happy,"" the 23-year old shuttler said.

At the time of the interview, Sindhu was preparing to launch one final campaign to end 2018 with a gold medal. The year so far had turned out to be one of near misses for her as she had lost in the summit clash of a few top bracket tournaments. But the young achiever said every medal that she wins motivates her to keep moving ahead.

""It has been really good that I have had lots of medals and that's what keeps pushing me and motivating me. This is only the start and there is a lot to come. Having all these medals behind me helps me believe that there is a long way to go,"" said Sindhu who would in a week's time from the interview go on to become the first Indian to win the year-ending BWF World Tour Finals title.

Talking about her equation with her mentor and national badminton coach Pullela Gopichand, Sindhu said that she had unwavering faith and belief in her coach. Sindhu has been seen looking at Gopichand for direction when things are not going her way in matches and the Rio Olympics silver medallist had an interesting explanation for that.

""Being Gopi sir's student for so long I know what he is trying to tell me when things aren't going my way on court. I know I have to change my plans when he points them out and I should be able to do it immediately. You need to believe in him to be able to make those changes and I believe in him.""

Sindhu has been involved in several see-saw battles in high profile matches and when asked about who her toughest opponent is, she had two names to give.

""I have had lot of tough and long matches. There are a couple of players with whom my matches have gone up and down. One is Okuhara and the other is the Olympic champion Carolina Marin. There are these players and I like facing the challenge against them.""

Talking about her life post the high of the Rio Olympics silver medal, Sindhu said that she is happy to be in the limelight and is enjoying every bit of it.

He returned to China.

Minnesota prosecutors said Friday that Chinese billionaire Richard Liu will not face charges after a woman accused him of rape while he was attending a University business program in August.

Liu, the founder of the Beijing-based e-commerce site JD.com, was arrested Aug. 31 on suspicion of felony rape and released within hours. He returned to China.

Prosecutors said that ""profound evidentiary problems"" would have made it ""highly unlikely"" that any charge could have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

In a statement, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that as prosecutors reviewed surveillance video, text messages, police body camera video and witness statements, ""it became clear that we could not meet our burden of proof and, therefore, we could not bring charges.""

Liu was in Minneapolis for a weeklong residency as part of the University of Minnesota's doctor of business administration China program. The four-year program in the university's management school is geared toward high-level executives in China and is a partnership with Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management.

Liu's attorneys have said he is innocent. JD.com has said Liu was falsely accused.

Liu, known in Chinese as Liu Qiangdong, is a prominent member of the Chinese tech elite, with a fortune of $7.5 billion. He is part of a generation of entrepreneurs who have created China's internet, e-commerce, mobile phone and other technology industries since the late 1990s. The son of peasants, Liu built a Beijing electronics shop into JD.com, China's biggest online direct retailer, selling everything from clothes to toys to fresh vegetables.

He has continued to lead the company since his arrest.

On the night of the alleged attack, Liu and other executives went to Origami, a Japanese restaurant in Minneapolis. The alleged victim, a Chinese citizen who is studying at the University of Minnesota on a student visa, went to the dinner as a volunteer and, her attorney Wil Florin said, felt coerced to drink as the powerful men toasted her.

Text messages reviewed by The Associated Press and portions of the woman's interviews with police show the woman claims Liu dragged her into a vehicle and made advances, despite her protests. The woman texted a friend: ""I begged him don't. But he didn't listen."" She said he raped her at her apartment.

The alleged victim has not been publicly identified. She is still enrolled at the university, Florin said.

Liu had recently tried to distance himself from sexual assault allegations against a guest at a 2015 party at his penthouse in Australia. Liu was not charged or accused of wrongdoing, but Australian media reported he tried unsuccessfully to get a court to prevent the release of his name in that case. The guest was convicted and sentenced to prison in October."

All the 10 people arrested have been booked for cheating (420), criminal conspiracy (120B), criminal breach of trust (406), criminal breach of trust by public servant or by banker (409) and for causing disappearance of evidence of offence (201), Ranjan said.

The Economics question paper for class 12 and Mathematics question paper for class 10 exams were leaked on March 26 and March 28 respectively, via WhatsApp, hours before the exam. The re-examination of the Class 12 examination was conducted on April 25. However, no retest was held for the Class 10 Maths paper.

More than 75 people, including students, teachers at coaching centres, parents and a few school teachers were questioned to unearth the chain of question paper leaks and over 50 mobile phones belonging to student, school teachers and tutors from coaching centres were seized and sent for forensic examination. Police had also zeroed in on six WhatsApp groups that figured in the trail of circulation of the question papers.

The Economics paper was leaked on March 26, when two teachers of Mother Khazani Convent School, in outer Delhi's Bawana, Rishabh and Rohit, allegedly clicked picture of the economics question paper of class 12, an hour prior to the exam, and sent it through WhatsApp, to one Tauqeer Hasan, a teacher at a coaching institute in Delhi.

DCP (crime), G Ram Gopal Naik, said after registering the FIR on March 28, Delhi Police's crime branch questioned Rohit, Rishabh and the principal of Mother Khazani Convent school on March 31. ""Suspected to be mere pawns to a bigger syndicate, the three were put under surveillance. On April 1, around 3 am, a crime branch team raided a few premises in outer Delhi's Bawana and rounded up the three men. Hasan was the first one who was picked up on the basis of technical surveillance,"" Naik said, adding Raishabh, Rohit and Hasan were arrested in an early morning raid on the same day.

Naik said they traced a man Rakesh Kumar in Una, Himachal Pradesh, and on the intervening night of April 6 and 7, he was nabbed. ""He disclosed he is a teacher at DAV Centenary Public School in Una and that on March 23, he was appointed as a centre superintendent at a school to collect the question paper from a local and bring them to the examination centre.

He said while collecting question papers, he also took one bundle of the economics paper, which was to be held on March 26,"" Naik said.

While Rakesh went to his examination centre, he left the economics question paper bundle with Amit and Ashok. Amit took out one economics paper and clicked a picture of it which he sent to Rakesh, the DCP said.

Police found that Rakesh called one of his students studying in class 12 and made him write down the question paper, which Rakesh sent to one of his relatives, Anju Bala, and the paper was further circulated on WhatsApp.

Later, on April 12, police arrested two employees of the bank, Sheru and Om Prakash, from whose custody the question papers were leaked. Naik said, following repeated questionings, the principal of Mother Khazani Convent School, Praveen Kumar Jha, was also arrested on July 4."

To the world, Manish Sarki was the perfect all-rounder.

A strapping boy of 18, Sarki worked hard in school during the day and sent fielders scurrying after his shots at the neighbourhood cricket ground in the evenings. He would never get home later than dinner time even when his friends were out chatting, his mother Chandra Maya remembers, and his closest friends joked about how he would blush talking to girls.

Everyone in the village of St Mary's Hill knew Sarki would grow up to be a policeman or join the army. Maybe because he was so well-behaved, no one noticed when he went quiet. They only noticed on the night of August 20 when he didn't come back home.

The village gathered around the Sarki house around 9pm. A chill was enveloping the small mountain village on the outskirts of Darjeeling in northern Bengal, but a small group of men and women trekked to the local police station a couple of kilometers away. Boys go missing all the time, they were told.

Undeterred, the villagers split into smaller search parties and fanned out into the jungles, determined to find Sarki. Their hopes were dashed around 1.30am when a search team stumbled on Sarki's body hanging from the ceiling of an empty pig warehouse on top of a hill.

Below, in spray paint, were the words ""half blood prince was here"" in what everyone recognised was Sarki's handwriting. On the wall behind was drawn a hangman with two victims, an older boy, and more chillingly, a younger one. Every wall of the building had been scribbled on - the words ""illuminati"", ""last king"", ""savage"", ""doped up"" and the number ""666"" appearing repeatedly.

In the light of day, some of the graffiti might have appeared benign - after all, some the walls displayed banalities like ""be the change you want to see"" or ""the thing you fear the most is fear itself"". But in the eerie quiet of a cold mountain night, the villagers were convinced Sarki's death was the doing of the satan. ""I was heartbroken for my son but also scared out of my wits. We were all scared about who the younger boy could be,"" said Chandra Maya.

By the time police arrived two hours later, a mist of rumours had cloaked the village. Wasn't Sarki always on his phone for the past few weeks? And, wouldn't he go out to the graveyard, barely a kilometer away, every night with his phone? ""I think he was going crazy. That's when I heard about the game,"" added Chandra Maya.

By sunrise, everyone had heard of the game: a shadowy application called the Momo Challenge that had apparently killed Sarki. Several explanations were offered. ""For the past few days, he was very sad and distracted. He would be lost in his phone. He never said anything to me, later I found out that he was playing the Momo game,"" said Sarki's friend Deekchen.

But how did he find out? Villagers say the local police first told them of the game, but the police deny ever saying anything. ""In fact, we have not been able to confirm any role of any Momo Challenge game. We never told the locals about the game. Maybe the graffiti made them think that,"" said Hare Krishna Pai, additional superintendent of police.

'HI, I AM MOMO. LET US PLAY A GAME'

The next day, a second death, that of 26-year-old Aditi Goyal in Kurseong town, was also attributed to the Momo Challenge, turning the creeping fear into full-blown panic. By then, local politicians had put out statements about the supposedly lethal game, and everyone in the hills was talking about it.

""The whole area was in trauma and everyone was scared of their phones. We found young boys from Class 7 had started playing it. We started spreading awareness and seized phones from those who seemed vulnerable. Someone even sent a message to my daughter,"" said Raju Gurung, a local from Kurseong.

Hindustan Times spoke to at least 20 people in the area and everyone claimed to know a relative, friend or neighbour who had had a close shave with the game. But everyone had a different notion.

Some described the game, which supposedly sets self-harm challenges that finally end in suicide, as an app, some as a Whatsapp message. Some said they received texts, some described a phone number. Indeed, beyond the ubiquitous image of the oblong faced, bulbous eyed doll that has come to signify the game, every detail was foggy. ""Sometimes people are faking names and photos and sending messages 'Hi, I am momo. Let us play a game.' The fear of the game has hypnotised us,"" said Junita Rana, a schoolteacher in Kurseong.

AN EPIDEMIC OF FEAR

It began with the braids. In June last year, a girl in Rajasthan claimed someone chopped off her braid while she was asleep. Dozens of women across Rajasthan followed up with similar claims. Over the following months, the pattern spread across north India like an epidemic: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi. By November, over 200 cases of braid chopping had been reported in Kashmir where the trend took its most vicious turn. Many women claimed to have seen Godmen, witches or cats before losing their consciousness. After finding their braids gone, many complained of aches and pains for days after. The police couldn't really find any culprits, so the people took the matter in their hands. In August, a poor woman was killed by a mob in Agra on the suspicion of chopping braids. In October, an old man in Anantnag was killed for the same reason.

Then there was the Blue Whale. In July, a schoolboy's suicide stoked the hysteria around the web-based game created by a Russian tech geek targeting teengers. The 50 challenges begin differently-- from shutting yourself in or watching a horror film-- proceed incrementally, and end the same way: suicide. Through 2017, more than 150 cases of young suicides across India -- West Bengal, Delhi, Indore, Solapur, Dehradun-- were blamed on the Blue Whale, often with no more proof that the young person was obsessed with smartphone and videogames. Every case was rife was contradictions and yet, websites were blocked, advisories issued, and in some cases, smartphones banned in schools.

FACE-RIPPERS AND VAMPIRES

Experts say that underneath the web-fuelled hysteria, something more sinister is going on with the mental health of young people. Samir Parikh, director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, insisted that we cannot dismiss these phenomena, but the focus should be on greater media literacy, on making children understand what is right and wrong content, and on teaching people to seek help if they are feeling vulnerable.

""Is there a component of hysteria in all this? Of course, there are lots of stories in the media and they have an impact. But we cannot deny the fact that there are pressures and problems that young people go through silently. If help and access is not given, they can be misused,"" he added.

Parikh is clear that any approach that aims at shutting down access to the internet is wrong, mainly because it is impossible. ""We need to understand that be it Blue Whale or Momo, if you are vulnerable, you might be pulled towards it. So you give people skills and teach people to not bottle it up, tell parents, block or involve authorities.""

India has had a long history of public panic. From a half-man half-monkey roaming the streets in Delhi, sometimes wearing a helmet, to the Munhnochwa (face ripper) of Mirzapur, claimed to be a flying object emitting beams of green or red light, sending shock waves through anyone who came in its contact, and leaving them with bites and scratches on their faces, to the Rathakaatteri (vampire) of Gundalpatti who allegedly sucked the blood of the village cattle, a new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. Many of these have been analysed as incidents of mass hysteria. The patterns have been revealing. Women are more likely to end up as victims than men, children turn to be more vulnerable than adults. The trends pick up in regions or communities marked by oppression of women, economic uncertainty or social anxiety.

Yet, questions remain about why a particular fear grips a set of people at a given time. Did every woman who complained of braid chopping do it herself? Was every alleged case of Blue Whale suicide made up by the parents or the police to evade responsibility? What do the women whose braids were chopped say now? And, did a year of fear and panic leave us any wiser?

LOSING BRAIDS, EARNING REST

In Kanganhedi, a village of 700 houses on the Delhi-Haryana border, Munesh Devi's hair has grown back just enough to tie it in a ponytail. A lot more has changed in her life since last year besides her hairstyle. ""I can no longer work in our field. I hardly leave the house, except being taken to the doctor by my son every two weeks. Any exertion leaves me tired. Even going to funerals gets up my blood pressure. I lie in bed almost all day. Daughters-in-law press my feet.They also bring me rotis to eat in bed,"" said Devi, sitting on a double bed in the living room. Its doors remain shut and its light dimmed to prevent Devi's recurring headache.

They began in July 2017, immediately after she found her braid chopped at the neck. It was there when she finished feeding the cows in the family's farm, she said, but gone when she got back home and slipped back her pallu. ""Must have gone missing while I was travelling home on the back of my son's motorcycle,"" she added. She remembers fainting after the realisation struck. She continues to feel giddy. ""My head spins. My whole body aches. My feet go numb. My teeth hurt."" She doesn't know what ails her; neither does her doctor. He prescribes her pills for each of her symptoms. She shows off the stash to people asking her how she has been doing since ""the incident.""

Munesh Devi's was one of three braids found missing in the area in the course of one eventful day. The other two women don't know, either, who chopped their braids or why they continue to suffer. Sri Devi said she lost her braid while sitting on a couch in the courtyard of her house. One moment it was hanging down her waist, the next moment it was lying on the floor. She had heard of the braid-chopping phenomenon only hours before. ""My uncle, who was visiting us from Pataudi, had told me about a video he had seen on Facebook. I said, 'Mama, please don't say such things.'"" Her son had called 100 after she fainted at the sight of her severed braid. ""The police are yet to tell us if they found anything,"" she said.

Devi also visited a psychiatrist in Dwarka along with her son, at the urging of the police. ""He asked my son some questions. Gave us no answers,"" she said. Her braid was taken away by a forensics team sent in by the police for further investigations. ""We haven't heard from them."" Perturbed by three incidents in a week, people in the village even consulted a tantrik (mystic). ""He spoke about the presence of a mysterious cat in the village. But no such cat or dog has been found,"" she said.

For many women, the disappearance of braids has been transformative. It has allowed them rightful rest after a lifetime's slog at home and farm, won them the nurturing attention of their families, and given them the chance to talk about themselves for the first time. The third ""victim"" in Kangnahedi, Ombati, a daily-wage labourer who found her braid gone while working around the house, is still waiting for her life to change, however. ""No government compensation, no one has even come to offer me a glass of juice,"" she said, lying on a cot and complaining of a headache.

""We sent a team to that village for a couple of hours after a request from the concerned division of the Delhi police, but we haven't received any formal communication from the top brass,"" explained Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, which had investigated the phenomenon of Delhi's Monkey-man in 2001. ""From the preliminary impressions of our team, in all probability, the incidents in Kanganhedi fit into the pattern of mass hysteria, which tends to subside on its own.""

MASKED MEN OR MAIDS?

In Kashmir, the last region to be swept up in the storm, over 100 FIRs were registered over six months. Many women alleged masked men entered their homes when they were alone, sprinkled sedatives in the air, and chopped their braids while they lay unconscious. Separatist leaders accused the Indian government, and armed militants suspected the evil hand of intelligence agencies. As locals flooded the streets in protest, shutting down shops and schools, the police resorted to extreme measures, from announcing an award of Rs 6 lakh for information to unleashing riot-control tactics to disperse the crowds. Several vigilante groups armed with lathis and axes emerged to patrol the streets at night. A 70-year-old man in Anantnag died after being hit by a brick by a group of people who suspected him to be a braid chopper.

But now, police say the paranoia and panic was fuelled by nothing substantive.

""Almost all the cases turned out to be without any substance. There were a few cases where the women had cut their hair themselves. In one case, a maid had cut the hair of a girl,"" said additional director general of police (law and order), Muneer Khan. In Kulgam, where 21 cases had been registered, the state government had formed a special investigation team(SIT). Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Kulgam, Aijaz Ahmad, who was part of the SIT, said that most of the cases have been closed because the allegations had no factual basis.

""In some of the cases, the culprits remain untraced, while maximum cases turned out to be of hysteria,"" Ahmad said. He said the lack of a single eyewitness in all of the cases was particularly baffling.

Across the valley, the police arrested between 70 and 80 people, including members of vigilante groups, for ""raising false alarm about braid chopping and creating disturbances"".

""We felt that this [braid chopping] was being done by agencies. It was a matter of honour of our women. Everybody wanted this should end. Stone pelting was the only option with us. Surprisingly it did end abruptly after that,"" said a villager from north Kashmir who requested anonymity. Some of them are still visiting the courts for hearings.

BLUE WHALES AND PHONE BANS

It was around 5pm on July 29 last year when Manpreet Singh Sahani climbed on the ledge of his fifth-floor apartment. As he teetered on the edge, neighbours and witnesses on the street below called out to him but could only watch helplessly as he jumped. Initial investigations by local police and testimonies of his friends exposed talk of the Blue Whale Challenge. Several of them took to social media to blame the game and link it to Sahani's death.

In 24 hours, reports of the supposedly lethal game had inundated media, and reports of copycat cases were streaming in from all parts of India, ratcheting up paranoia about mobile phone and internet use among teenagers and their parents. Over the next two months, more than 150 deaths or injuries across the country were alleged to be linked to the game.

But while police initially suspected the boy was an avid gamer and could have been influenced by the Blue Whale Challenge, detailed investigation indicated more offline triggers.

""The boy was in love with a girl who had left him for some other boy. We had gone through his email accounts and mobile phone and found a draft on the phone which clarified his intention to commit suicide,"" said Navin Reddy, deputy commissioner of police Zone 10.

This might not be an isolated phenomenon. Earlier this year, Union minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir told Lok Sabha that a committee formed under the chairmanship of the director general of the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) couldn't establish the involvement of the Blue Whale Challenge in any case.

""The committee analysed the internet activities, device activities, call records and other social media activity, other forensic evidences and also interacted with rescued victims associated with these incidents,"" the minister told the lower house.

Of course, by then several other central ministries, a number of state governments, the Central Board of Secondary Education and even the Supreme Court had got involved, with the apex court calling the game a ""national problem"".

But experts say official agencies may have jumped the gun. ""It was definitely a hoax. We need to shift focus from these voyeuristic things and to suicides, which is a big problem that kills a quarter of a million people. Some of these hoaxes have a life of their own because media makes them into a big story. We need long-term institutional solutions,"" said Soumitra Pathare, director of the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy.

THE BIGGEST TRAGEDY

Back in St Mary's hill, Chandra Maya Sarki has gone back to her old routine -- wake up at the crack of dawn to draw water, fix food for her husband before he leaves for his daily wage work, and then clean their small wooden house. She likes to keep the television on and stray dialogues from the afternoon soaps animate the living room. She stares not at the screen, however, but at the the small framed photo of Sarki hanging on the blue wall, wondering why the mysterious admins of the Momo Challenge chose her child as their prey.

She doesn't know yet that the cyber cell of the West Bengal police has completed its forensic probe of his phone and found no trace of any Momo Challenge. ""If any application is downloaded, the forensic machine would find a trace, even if it is an unknown application. But we have found no such application, or any message on WhatsApp motivating people to play the game. We have found nothing so far,"" said a senior official of the cyber cell on the condition of anonymity.

She doesn't know that police has ruled out any links between the game and the death of Aditi Goyal and that at least two other cases in the state have been found to be hoaxes traced back to mischief makers sending scary messages through WhatsApp. She doesn't know that Sarki's teacher Sarita Sharma has a simple explanation for why he and his friends would go to the graveyard at night -- the mobile network was the best at that spot.

All she knows is that her beloved younger son will no longer come back home at 8pm every day. That she will never make him his favourite meal of dal-aloo and dum-eggs. The money she had been saving with her husband to send him to Bengaluru for higher studies now seems meaningless. Sometimes she talks to Sarki's sister, now in college, about him and the day that took him away from her. She will probably never know what really happened to Sarki or what troubled him enough to withdraw from his friends. Momo Challenge or not, that is the biggest tragedy of all.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had two cancerous nodules removed from her left lung on Friday in a surgical procedure in New York, the latest health issue experienced by the 85-year-old liberal jurist, a court spokeswoman said.

Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Ginsburg, one of the court's nine justices, underwent a procedure known as a pulmonary lobectomy on Friday at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Arberg said that according to the thoracic surgeon, Dr. Valerie Rusch, ""both nodules removed during surgery were found to be malignant.""

After the surgery, there was ""no evidence of any remaining disease,"" Arberg added.

""Currently, no further treatment is planned. Justice Ginsburg is resting comfortably and is expected to remain in the hospital for a few days,"" Arberg said.

Ginsburg broke three ribs in a fall last month. The nodules were found as part of the tests the justice underwent after the earlier fall, Arberg said.

Ginsburg, appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1993, is the senior liberal member of the court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority.

The Supreme Court's conservative majority was restored in October when the Senate confirmed Republican President Donald Trump's nominee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, after a contentious nomination process in which Kavanaugh denied a sexual assault allegation dating to the 1980s when he was a high school student.

As the oldest justice, Ginsburg is closely watched for any signs of deteriorating health.

If she were unable to continue serving, Trump could replace her with a conservative, further shifting the court to the right. A potentially dominant 6-3 conservative majority would have major consequences for issues including abortion, the death penalty, voting rights, gay rights and religious liberty.

Ginsburg has recovered from previous medical issues. She was treated in 1999 for colon cancer and again in 2009 for pancreatic cancer, but did not miss any argument sessions either time. In 2014, doctors placed a stent in her right coronary artery to improve blood flow after she reported discomfort following routine exercise. She was released from a hospital the next day.

The court is not in session until early January.

Ginsburg is considered a hero by many liberals. She has helped buttress equality rights during her time on the high court, including in sex discrimination cases.

In recent years she has become something of a cult figure, particularly on the left, known by the nickname ""Notorious RBG,"" after the late rapper Notorious BIG.

A documentary film, ""RBG,"" was released earlier this year. A feature film about her life, ""On the Basis of Sex,"" is being released in theatres next week.

Ginsburg was the second woman to become a member of the Supreme Court, following Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who retired in 2006. O'Connor, 88, said in October she is suffering from dementia.

Ginsburg called Trump an egotistical ""faker"" when he was running for president in 2016. Trump responded by saying her ""mind is shot"" and she should quit the court. Ginsburg later expressed regret for her comments, saying ""judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office.""

A Sex Scandal of the Gilded Age and the 'Powerless' Woman Who Took On Washington

Author: Patricia Miller

Publisher: Sarah Crichton Books/Farrar, Straus & Giroux

What better time for a story about a prominent man taken totally aback when he discovers that the rules about what he can get away with have changed? During Breckinridge's trial for breach of promise -- a legal concept until the early 20th century enabling a woman to sue a man for breaking his engagement to marry her -- one of his lawyers warned the jury that giving Pollard a victory would ""encourage every strumpet to push her little mass of filth into court"". Flash-forward to President Trump announcing, during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, that all this talk about sexual assault was making it a ""very scary time for young men in America"".

When Breckinridge and Pollard first met, he was a middle-aged married man. She was younger. How much younger would be one of the many subjects of dispute in a trial that riveted Gilded Age America. Was she an ""experienced woman"" of nearly 21 or a confused girl of 17?

Whatever her age, Pollard was not a hapless innocent. Her education, at one of the best women's colleges in the nation, was being paid for by another much older man, who definitely expected her graduation to be followed by their wedding. After meeting Breckinridge on the train, she wrote to him asking for advice on how to get out of the arrangement. Soon came Breckinridge's visit to her school in Cincinnati and the carriage ride that launched a thousand headlines. She became his mistress, gave up their children to foundling asylums at his demand and was pregnant again shortly after Breckinridge's wife died. Pollard assumed their legal union would come next, allowing for a decent period of mourning. When the congressman instead married a socially prominent widow, Pollard was enraged and went to court.

The trial over Pollard's lawsuit provided a near-perfect presentation of 19th-century sexual mores. Breckinridge's team, in a preview of his defence in Kentucky newspapers, claimed Pollard was fair game and ""utterly depraved where morality is concerned"". Pollard, countering with her own version of events in The New York World, claimed she was a naïve girl betrayed: ""With this man alone have I ever been guilty of a single impure thought or act.""

But what drove many observers crazy was the way Breckinridge confidently assumed he had the right to seduce any woman who was not ""a maiden"" and bore no responsibility for the relationship that ensued.

It took the jury less than 90 minutes to award Pollard her moral victory -- plus the hefty sum of $15,000. Breckinridge became the emblem of everything that women hated about men's sexual behaviour. When he ran for what should have been an easy re-election the nation watched in fascination as opposition mounted. Female students at a Kentucky college vowed not to accept Breckinridge supporters as suitors. Women in Lexington held a monster picnic for his opponent, with a parade, banners and 30,000 attendees, who devoured refreshments made from 80 sheep, 11 cows and 40 hogs.

Breckinridge gave a weepy speech apologising for his weakness and citing his talents as a legislator. But, Miller notes, the real combatants in the election ""were two worldviews about women and sex"". The reformers won. ""The Silver Tongue Is Silenced,"" announced one of the many, many headlines."

The chairman has also been told to give hearing to allottees and resolve their issues as soon as possible.

The allottees claimed that they had given their entire savings to LIT, but even then they did not get the possession of plots. They hoped that at least now officials will act and take back the land from the encroachers.

However, the LIT officials claimed they had removed the encroachment twice, but the encroachers returned again. They rued they had demanded police force to remove the encroachment but that did not happen.

Davinder Singh, a retired school principal said, ""I have paid Rs 22 lakh to LIT for this plot which was my lifetime saving and if LIT will not give possession then it will become difficult for us to survive.""

An 85-year-old allottee Gian Kaur said, ""I cannot even visit the LIT office to check the status whether possession has been given or not and LIT officials are not even considering my age."" She said she hoped that LIT would give possession of the plot to her before she shut her eyes.

Another allottee Ranjit Singh, a retired SDO from electricity board said, ""Usually the allotment is done after developing all civic amenities in the area, but here LIT officials did allotment even without giving any civic amenity."" He said they had no enmity with the encroachers on the land, instead their fight was with LIT, which had failed to give them their rights.

Notably, LIT has allotted plots to more than 51 allottees in 2015 and also received huge amount from them, which is somewhere around Rs 22 lakhs per plot.

Brief history of encroachment

The LIT had acquired 475 acres of land in 1984 in the name of Vikas Scheme and is popularly known as Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar and 5.5 acres of land belonging to Gajjan Singh was also part of that acquisition. The officials had deposited Rs 2.22 lakh with land acquisition director in 1997 and Rs 11.11 lakh in the name of Gajjan Singh. The LIT officials, first of all, attempted to get possession in 2002 when Gajjan Singh and his son Kehar Singh had allegedly open fire and a junior engineer Nirmal Singh Bhullar was killed, while other two had received injuries in the incident.

The officials again attempted in 2012 and at that time they had reached an agreement that he would get a plot in this land, but approval to this agreement made Gajjan singh file a case against LIT in court, which came in favour of LIT and it was decided to give possession to around 114 plot holders."

Before he was suspended by the Home Ministry on Thursday, Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rajnish Kumar Rai sent a three-page letter to the Ministry stating rules that justified his request for a voluntary retirement as he had crossed the age of 50 and had completed 30 years of service.

Mr. Rai had probed the 2005 high-profile alleged fake encounter of Sohrabuddin Sheikh and in 2007, arrested three IPS officers -- D.G. Vanzara and Rajkumar Pandian of the Gujarat cadre and Dinesh M.N. of the Rajasthan cadre -- as the key accused in the case. Mr. Rai's lawyer, Rahul Sharma, told The Hindu that he was being victimised by the government for his role in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter.

Mr. Sharma, an ex-IPS officer from Gujarat who investigated the 2002 Gujarat riots and is now a practising advocate, said, ""It can be safely concluded that his actions in Sohrabuddin case resulted in the suspension. Government cannot suspend an officer who has already retired. We have already moved the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) that the order refusing retirement is bad in law.""

Mr. Rai intimated the Ministry that since his notice for retirement under Rule 16 (2) of the All India Services (Death-cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958 has not been accepted by the competent authority, he would not attend office from December 1, 2018 and is ""deemed to have retired"" from the IPS on November 30, 2018.

The MHA had rejected Mr. Rai's retirement on the ground that he was not clear from vigilance angle as a chargesheet was issued against him in 2017 under the All India Service (AIS) Rules, 1969, and three preliminary inquiries were pending against him with the Gujarat government.

Mr. Sharma said, ""Rule 16 (2) of the AIS Death-cum-retirement benefits, doesn't require permission of State government once you have attained 50 years of age and completed 30 years of service. After giving three-months notice, you can proceed on retirement. The only case where permission from the Government is required is when an officer is under suspension. He was not under suspension,"" Mr Sharma said. He said there were quite a few precedents. ""J.S Rana, a former IAS officer Gujarat cadre of 1975 batch who had sought retirement was also denied permission. The Central Administrative Tribunal gave an order in his favour. This has also been upheld by the Supreme Court in case of a Tamil Nadu cadre IPS officer. We have already moved CAT,"" Mr. Sharma said.

Mr. Rai, a 1992-batch IPS officer, is posted at the Counter Insurgency and Anti-Terrorism (CIAT) School of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) at Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh.

In its December 18 order, the MHA stated that disciplinary proceeding is contemplated against Mr. Rai in ""connection with his unauthorised handing over the charge of IG & Principal, CIAT School, CRPF, Chittoor and abdication of office on 30.11.2018.""

The order also said that till the time he was under suspension, Mr. Rai would not leave Chittoor without the permission of Director General of CRPF."

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has a plan to protect the surface of the Taj Mahal, the monument of love which is among the Seven Wonders of the World, from pollutants.

The ASI has formulated a scientific cleaning and conservation plan to protect the surface of the iconic Taj Mahal from deposited pollutants, the Centre told the Lok Sabha on Friday (December 21), according to a PTI report.

THE CLEANING

Minister of State for Environment Mahesh Sharma, in a written reply, said that according to the Archaeological Survey of India, the pollutants from various sources have been superficially getting deposited on the marble surface of Taj Mahal as particulate matters, and due to scattering of light by these deposited particles, the marble surface appears to have changed in colour.

""The ASI has formulated scientific cleaning and conservation plan to protect the surface of the Taj Mahal from deposited pollutants,"" PTI quoted him as saying.

""Accordingly, all four minarets, eight facades, four pedestal marble walls, interior portion of the periphery up to human height and four 'chhatries' at the rooftop of the main mausoleum, have already been cleaned and treated. However, the cleaning of the main dome requires some technical studies,"" he said.

PTI reported that Sharma said the ASI has informed that the water level of Yamuna was away from the northern wall of Taj Mahal.

""Therefore, specific study on the link between Yamuna water and the strength of the foundation of Taj Mahal has not been conducted,"" he said.

VISION DOCUMENT FOR THE PROTECTION OF TAJ MAHAL

The Uttar Pradesh government had recently told the Supreme Court that it had paid 80 per cent money which is Rs 51.89 lakh to Delhi-based School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) which is entrusted with the task of preparing a vision document for the protection of Taj Mahal.

The eight men thrashed Mazloom and Imtiyaz and hung their bodies from a tree. Imtiyaz was just 12 years old. The incident took place at Balumath, about 45 kilometres from Latehar.

Earlier this week, judicial magistrate Rishikesh Kumar convicted the eight accused - Arun Sau, Awadhesh Sahu, Manoj Sau, Manoj Kumar Sahu, Mitihlesh Prasad Sahu, Pramod Sahu, Vishal Tiwari and Sahdev Soni - and sent them to jail. Most of the eight are said to involved in cow protection activities, or in short, are Gau Rakshaks.

This is the second lynching case in which Gau Rakshaks have been convicted. In March this year, a fast-track court in Jharkhand convicted 11 out of 12 accused, including one BJP leader, for killing Alimuddin Ansari in Ramgarh in June 2017.

The relative success of lynching trials in Jharkhand is said to be mainly due to the steadfast pursuit of the cases by lawyers and activists and a certain degree of proactiveness on the part of the judiciary. Some also say that the police probes were more prompt compared to the cow vigilantism-related crimes in other parts of the country.

The case is important at several levels. First, the killings were so gruesome that the sight of Mazloom and Imtiyaz's hanging bodies became an iconic image depicting the violence by cow vigilantes. Second, the background of the convicts, particularly Arun Sau, shows how cow vigilantism is a combination of communal hatred and criminality.

Let's look at these two aspects in more detail through the accounts of eyewitnesses as well as the confessions of the convicts.

Eyewitnesses Recall The Horror

The conviction has largely been based on the eyewitness accounts of Mazloom's younger brother Munawar Ansari, Imtiyaz's father Azad Khan and one Mohammad Nizamuddin. Mazloom, Azad and Nizamuddin were all business partners. Their testimonies were published in a fact-finding report prepared by independent journalist Ajit Sahi in association with several human rights organisations. Here are some excerpts from the report.

Narrating the events that took place on the morning of the murders, Azad Khan said, ""At about 2:30 am on 18 March, Mazloom and Imtiyaz were going towards the cattle fair with eight oxen. I too left on my motorcycle a little while later"".

After travelling a certain distance, Azad saw that the eight oxen were grazing on the side and that Mazloom and Imtiyaz were missing. Soon he heard his son screaming for help. He saw a group of people armed with pistols abusing and assaulting Mazloom and Imtiyaz.

""I immediately hid in the bushes. I saw Arun Sau had climbed a tree and was fixing a rope. The others were on the ground trying to push Mazloom and Imtiyaz up to hang them from the tree,"" Azad said in his deposition.

Munawar Ansari named and recognised five of the eight accused - Arun Sau, Mithilesh Sahu, Manoj Sau, Avdhesh Sahu and Vishal Tiwari. He recognised the other three accused but didn't know them by name. Munawar said that Manoj Sahu had taught him in school and that Mazloom had once purchased building material from Mitihlesh's store.

Nizamuddin corroborated the events narrated by Azad and Munawar.

According to the fact-finding report, Nizamuddin also identified a man called Vinod Prajapati, who is associated with the BJP, near the oxen. Nizamuddin claims that upon seeing him, Prajapati shouted, ""Catch him, he's the real cattle trader.""

""Upon hearing that, I quickly started my motorcycle and fled. After that, I called up Munawar,""he said.

Prajapati, who was named in one of the FIRs, is still at large.

Confessions Of Gau Rakshaks

In April 2016, Catch News had published excerpts from the confessions of the Gau Rakshaks, which provided chilling details of how they killed Mazloom and Imtiyaz. These confessions were later made part of the charge sheet filed by the police in the court.

Manoj Sau said in his confession, ""On the morning of 18 March 2016, Avdhesh Sau called me at 3:30 am. He told me that he saw cattle being transported from Jhabar village towards Balumath. I told him to continue tracking the traders. Immediately, I called up Arun Sau. We summoned all other team members.""

""Then Arun Sau hanged the body from the tree. We wanted it to appear that the cattle trader had hung himself.""Pramod Sau

In his confession, Pramod Sau narrated in detail how the murder took place:

""We went to the kaccha road leading to Pakdi and stopped at Khaprail Bar. Then I, Arun Sau, Sahdev and Manoj Sau thrashed the two traders with sticks. Then Arun Sau got rope from a nearby village. He said that 'these are the people who sell cattle to the Qureshis of Balumath. We will not leave them alive. I will take revenge on them"".""Arun Sau used the rope to strangle the 30-32-year old trader (Mazloom Ansari) to death. He tied the rope around his neck and hung him from the tree. He ordered us to climb on the motorcycle and push the body upwards. I, Sahdev Soni and Manoj Sau began pushing the body upwards.""""Then Arun Sau hanged the body from the tree. We wanted it to appear that the cattle trader had hung himself"".

Another of the convicts, Mithilesh, confessed that he is a functionary of the local Gau Raksha Samiti and he was ""only carrying out the responsibilities given to him"".

""Around five months back, in October 2015, at Jhabar village, a meeting of some men of the village was called. At the meeting, I was given the responsibility of the area's Gau Raksha Samiti. I was given the task of countering people involved in cattle trade. On the basis of that mandate, I did what I did,"" he said.

How A Dacoit Became A Gau Rakshak

By most accounts, it seemed that Arun Sau, who hails from Balumath, was the leader of the group. His transformation into a vigilante Gau Rakshak is an important aspect of the entire story.

In his confession, that was part of the police's charge sheet, Arun said that he dropped out of school in Class 7 in 1997 and began working first as a truck-helper and then as a driver of one Munna Gupta, who initiated him into dacoity. According to his confession, he was caught in 2005 along with Gupta for carrying out dacoities. He was caught again a few months later, along with one Siraj Miyan of Palamau, for illegally transporting coal and was jailed for nearly a year.

After a few years of staying out of trouble, he was charged in two cases in Balumath in 2012. But the nature of his activities had changed. This time he was charged for rioting, unlawful assembly and intentional insult with the intent of trying to breach peace. From dacoity, he had moved to communal violence.

This revival in his criminal activities coincided with his increasing involvement in the Gau Raksha campaign. Around the same time, Balumath became a major hub for the cow protection campaign of an Uttarakhand-based preacher Gopal ji Maharaj. Arun Sau is said to have attended his discourses.

""In 2012, a campaign to prevent slaughter and trade of cows and oxen was started in Balumath. I became part of it. Because of this, I had altercations with Muslims of Balumath and I had to go to jail twice,"" he said in his confession.

In 2015, he had a confrontation with a few locals belonging to the Qureshi community, who thrashed him.

Even though a Muslim named Jasim Miyan gave him refuge after the attack, Arun Sau decided to ""take revenge"" on Muslim cattle traders. For this purpose, he created a ""team"" which included Manoj Sau, Mithilesh Sahu, Sahdev Soni, Vishal Tiwari, Avdhesh Sahu, Pramod Sahu and Majoj Kumar Sahu.

According to locals, Arun Sau is linked to the Bajrang Dal and had put up a board claiming to be the organisation's block in-charge. However, Bajrang Dal has denied that Sau was part of it.

Arun Sau's case shows how history-sheeters reinvent themselves as Gau Rakshaks. It not only provides them a legitimate pretext for their crimes, it also helps them gain social acceptability and influence. Conversely, some cow-protection organisers also seem to be using criminals like Arun Sau as their storm-troopers.

Following the Supreme Court's decision in Murphy v. NCAA, which overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Regulation Act and cleared the way for more widespread legalized gambling, the regulation of how wearables may be used has gained attention. Analysis of these developments is complicated by the evolving legal landscape surrounding wearable tech, the privacy implications and the various types of biometric data it may collect.

Wearable technology is a blanket term for a type of electronic monitor that can be worn on the body, typically either sewn into clothing or otherwise incorporated in an accessory and often wirelessly connected to the internet to transmit data collected through sensors in the device. Wearables can track a wide variety of information about the wearer, such as heart rate, glucose levels, pulse oximetry, sleep patterns, gait, and other physical and physiological metrics that can facilitate the assessment of performance and recovery in sports. These physical and physiological data points may be considered ""biometric information"" under the definitions of that term that appear in certain laws. Within the broader category of biometric information is a subset of data referred to as ""biometric identifiers,"" which are unique biological characteristics that can be used to identify a person. Examples of biometric information are more general data points such as height and weight, whereas a fingerprint is considered a biometric identifier because it is unique to an individual. For athletes and coaches, wearables can provide meaningful insights about athletic performance, stress, rest and recovery, and their use has grown exponentially in recent years.

Currently, Major League Baseball (MLB) is the only American professional sports league that permits wearables to be used in games, thereby allowing for analysis of the causes of various ailments common among baseball players, such as specific stresses on pitchers. For example, a common injury suffered by pitchers, an ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) tear, can sideline a player for well over a year. In 2016, MLB and the MLB Players Association approved the in-game use of a sensor-laden sleeve designed to specifically measure the stress on a pitcher's arm throughout a game. In addition to measuring pitch count, the sleeve measures arm speed, rotation and force on the elbow with every throw, possibly allowing pitchers to avoid injury through rest and pitch correction. While the sleeve is pitcher-specific, MLB players in any position may utilize other types of wearables; for example, players may use wrist sensors that measure heart rate and body strain over a day, heart rate and breathing monitors, or GPS trackers. Although use of these devices is allowed during games and practice, a player's use is strictly voluntary and can be terminated by the player at any time. In fact, the most recent MLB Collective Bargaining Agreement (the MLB CBA) states that a team must destroy the information collected by wearables if requested by a player.

Similar to the MLB CBA, the National Basketball Association's 2017 Collective Bargaining Agreement (the NBA CBA) sets certain standards to combat the potential manipulation of wearables, codified in Article XXII Section 13. Use is prohibited during games, and use in practice is strictly voluntary. The NBA CBA specifies that ""data collected from a Wearable worn at the request of a team may be used for player health and performance purposes and Team on-court tactical and strategic purposes only."" To honor this stipulation, any team requesting a player use wearable technology must explain in writing precisely what's being tracked, how the team will be using this data and the benefits to the player of obtaining and analyzing the data. In addition to the player, this written explanation goes to the Wearables Committee, a six-person panel composed of three representatives from the players' union and three from the NBA itself. Per the NBA CBA, the Wearables Committee is also charged with reviewing and approving wearable devices as well as setting the proper cybersecurity standards for the retention of biometrics. The MLB CBA implemented a similar panel, the Joint Committee on Wearable Technology, composed of members from the MLB Players Association and MLB.

The NBA CBA outlines the specific consequences for misuse of players' biometric data. If the player agrees to use the wearable, the NBA CBA explicitly prohibits the use of this collected biometric data in contract and salary negotiations. Any team found in violation of the prohibition faces a $250,000 fine. Despite this potential threat, NBA players may still find themselves wary of the misuse of biometric information. By the terms of both the NBA CBA and the MLB CBA, players are allowed to cease use of wearables at any time for any reason. With technology still developing rapidly, these agreements set important standards concerning the ownership of this potentially sensitive data and attempts to balance both teams' and players' desires for excellence with appropriate privacy protection.

While the NBA, NHL and NFL all prohibit in-game use of wearables, the NFL Players Association offered its athletes the opportunity to monetize their own athletic performance data. In 2017, the NFL Players Association announced a five-year partnership with a wearables company with the hope of accurately tracking recovery in between games and workouts. The deal explicitly lays out that the players themselves control the data and have rights to sell it to third parties if they so choose. In this scenario, ethical considerations relevant to monetizing private data are in the hands of each player rather than those of the teams or leagues.

In the college context, without a players' union to advocate for specific standards concerning wearable use, ad hoc wearable use is regulated by school and NCAA rules. The NCAA does allow the use of wearables in games; however, it prohibits real-time data analysis during games to the extent such analysis is used to make performance-enhancing adjustments. As wearables become more sophisticated and their use is increasingly ubiquitous, it is likely that guidelines of this nature will evolve.

Currently in the United States, three states - Illinois, Texas and Washington - have implemented laws that regulate the collection and retention of biometric identifiers. Given technological developments that have occurred since the Illinois and Texas laws were passed (in 2008 and 2009, respectively), it is perhaps understandable that the definition of biometric identifiers in those laws is limited to retina or iris scans, fingerprints, voiceprints, and hand or face geometry. As a result, in their current form, those laws do not apply to many types of data captured by a wearable tracker. However, the newer Washington law includes ""other unique biological patterns or characteristics"" in its definition of biometric identifier, which could be interpreted to cover the type of data collected by many wearables. Additionally, the newly passed California Consumer Privacy Act includes exercise or health data in its definition of biometric information, which means data collected by wearables is likely to be subject to a host of new regulations beginning in June 2020.

Beyond laws governing the collection and retention of biometric data, several state data security breach laws, including the Colorado, Maryland, North Carolina and Wisconsin statutes, have added ""biometric data"" to their definitions of personal information that, if compromised, may trigger an obligation to provide notification to regulators and affected individuals. As the use of biometric identifiers in everyday life becomes more and more common and value of data collected by wearable technology continues to increase, it is likely that wearable technology companies and their rich stores of personal information will be appealing targets for hackers.

Given the exponential growth of wearable technology, as well as skyrocketing reliance on biometric identifiers, it seems inevitable that additional legislation will be proposed, perhaps including laws that would govern the manufacture and use of objects and clothing that harvest biometric data as well as the ways in which that data may be used and shared.

Players should educate themselves on their rights and the potential privacy implications if they choose to collect, share and/or allow third parties to have access to their data derived from wearables. Despite not being specifically covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), best practices would demand similar confidential treatment for all who have access to such data. Leagues, teams, players, developers and other interested parties should closely follow legal developments and be vigilant in their data protection efforts to ensure they remain in compliance with the various agencies and governments regulating the various aspects of wearable technology."

A former Supreme Court judge, who was trying to find a house with a basement (for chambers) in the upscale Defence Colony area of south Delhi, couldn't find anything to match his wish-list. While he saw several where the ground or upper-ground floor was available for rent, he couldn't find anything with a basement. Finally, exasperated after showing him several houses, the 'expert' helping him in the search told him that because of a Supreme Court order, basements weren't available as most of them had been sealed.

Congress' rebel headache in Rajasthan

The Congress was expected to shine in the recent assembly polls in Rajasthan and reduce the BJP to embarrassing figures, but it ended up falling one short of the halfway mark. Senior leaders in the Rajasthan unit are attributing the Congress' below-expectation performance to the 'rebel' factor and the inability of the party leadership to deal with this effectively. They also blame the Congress culture of re-inducting rebels.

In fact, three-time MLA, former minister in the state and ex-Rajya Sabha MP Aimaduddin Ahmad Khan (Durru) has even brought this to the notice of the high command, requesting the issue be taken up by the Congress Working Committee. Khan has cited his own example to bring home the point. He says he has consistently faced the rebel issue in his constituency Tijara, and this time, the Congress leader who was denied ticket fought against him on a Samajwadi Party ticket, thus, becoming a big factor in the Congress losing this seat. Incidentally, the rebel candidate has a history and has been re-inducted into the Congress twice after leaving the party.

'Let govt take-up health study'

Sterlite said it would welcome it if the government were to take up a comprehensive health study. NGT, in its judgement on August 8, 2013, had issued two directives to government to conduct source apportionment study in and around the SIPCOT industrial area and it constituted a six-member special committee, with MDMK chief Vaiko as a member, with a mandate to study and place on record causes for health hazards in and around the industries.

""So far, the committee has not taken-up any study.

CHENNAI: Ten students hailing from Thoothukudi were detained near Chennai Press Club at Chepauk here on Thursday for allegedly causing public nuisance by trying to organise a protest against the reopening of Sterlite unit in the wake of the National Green Tribunal's order. The protesters, belonging to a students' organisation based at Thoothukudi, carried charts and banners which bore messages against Sterlite.

Triplicane police immediately put them in a vehicle and took them to the station. A police official said the students started shouting slogans. Of the ten, three were school students and others were studying in arts and engineering colleges.

""We came to know that students from Thoothukudi will arrive at Chepauk around 10.30 am on Thursday to protest against Sterlite's reopening. We have detained them as a preventive measure and will release them by evening,"" a police official said.

On December 15, the tribunal dismissed the State government's pleas against reopening of Sterlite. Following this, various organisations have resorted to protests.

CHENNAI: CPM has urged the State law minister C.Ve. Shanmugam to enact a special ordinance to close down Sterlite copper smelting unit at Thoothukudi permanently. A delegation of party led by K Balakrishnan, State secretary, met the minister and handed over a petition to him.

The party said a majority of people of Thoothukudi were protesting against the Sterlite plant stating that the environmental hazards caused by the unit were more than the economic benefits from the company. The petition said the order of NGT paving the way for reopening of the unit has created a flutter among locals of Thoothukudi. There is a chance of law and order issue in the district.

Hence, the State government should enact a special ordinance to permanently close down the unit, the party said.

People's desire is govt decision, says Collector

THOOTHUKUDI: Reiterating that the closure order issued by the State was an outcome of a policy decision, collector Sandeep Nanduri told the anti-Sterlite movement leaders and representatives of political parties, during a meeting on Thursday, that the people's desire is the government's decision in the Sterlite issue.

The meeting was convened to discuss the upheaval formed against Sterlite Copper after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) allowed it to restart operations. Representatives of Anti-Sterlite People's Movement, DMK, Congress, Amma Makkal Munetra Kazhagam (AMMK) and other parties took part."

This time, in Kothamangalam.

On Thursday, more than a hundred believers belonging to the Jacobite faction, including women, blocked the attempts by the Orthodox faction's vicar Fr Thomas Paul Ramban to enter the St Thomas Church, Kothamangalam (Cheriyapally) in the morning, following the Kerala High Court decision to open the church for prayers for the Orthodox faction.

Sensing trouble, a huge contingent of police was deployed on the church premises from early morning.

""We had to intervene when the members of the Jacobite faction tried to attack the vicar. We took the protesters into custody and removed them from the spot. The vicar was given protection and moved to the Santwanam Public School at Kothamangalam,"" said Basil Thomas, Kothamangalam SI. We have arrested 29 protesters in connection with the incident, he said.

During the protest, three women and the church office staff of the Jacobite faction fainted and were admitted to the Baselios Hospital in town. ""We have been directed to stop the action to avoid casualties,"" said Basil.The protests of the Jacobite faction intensified when the Ramban returned in the afternoon to enter the church. The protesters blocked him when he reached the church, triggering a scuffle between him and the protesters.

""We are not leaving without getting control of our church back. The church belongs to us and even the High Court verdict was in our favour, said Philippose A, an Orthodox believer. Baselious Thomas I, Catholicos of the Jacobite Syrian Church, said he believes the government will intervene to resolve the issue.

""We are not going to leave our church and therefore, the government and police must take a decision. We are always open to discussion. The protesters are simply creating issues,"" he told media persons at St Thomas Church. He also said the attempt of the Orthodox faction to take control of the church was not justifiable.

""They are not obeying the order of the court, which has given us time till March. In Malabar (north Kerala), both the factions have resolved the issues of the Church with gains and losses. We have accepted it. Why can't such a method be applicable here?"" he asked.

The incidents at Kothamangalam are a repeat of the drama that unfolded at St Mary's Jacobite Syrian Cathedral (Valiyapally) in Piravom last week, though the roles in Kothamangalam were reversed.

In Piravom, the Jacobite faction members protested on the church premises when the police entered the disputed cathedral to implement last year's (July 3) landmark Supreme Court judgment giving the control of the church to the Orthodox faction."

Countering this, counsel for petitioner Girija Gopal contended children should not be forced to participate in the women's wall and school property and buses should not be used other than for educational purposes. Deploying children for such events amounts to the violation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Children, the petitioner submitted.

n Allegations of fund diversion from other government projects are baseless. There is absolutely no wastage of resources or manpower. It was part of the campaign envisaged in the government's policy decision, details of which were spelt out in the Governor's Address and budget speech.

Stocks Crumble To 14-Month Lows","investing.com",FALSE,"(Thursday Market Close) Whether it's the Fed hinting at more rate hikes or Congress talking about a possible shutdown in Washington, it seems like the market just can't catch a break this week.

One day after getting rattled by the Fed raising rates and sounding less dovish about 2019 than some investors might have hoped, the market fell another 2% Thursday as a budget agreement appeared to unravel in Washington. Weak guidance from Conagra (NYSE:CAG) might have been another factor driving stocks down to new lows for the year and to their lowest levels in 14 months, while another bleak day in the crude market continued to drive fears of possible declining economic activity around the world.

There weren't too many other headlines today to account for the big plunge, and shutdowns haven't really hurt the market much in the past. Still, it was another sign of political uncertainty that some bearish investors could potentially hang their hats on, along with the ongoing China tariff battle and the unresolved Brexit situation.

Looking at it from a sector perspective, only utilities saw any gains Thursday. Consumer discretionary was the worst performer, dropping more than 2%, but consumer staples wasn't far behind due in part to pressure from a double-digit drop in CAG shares. The food packaging company reported mixed results for the quarter, but it appears to be its guidance that might have really hit shares.

Who Will Buy?

With the S&P 500 (SPX) down about 14% from the all-time high posted last fall as it entered Thursday's session, there just hasn't seemed to be much buying interest lately. That appeared to be the case again Thursday, with few people apparently willing to step up and catch what lately has been a falling knife. That could help explain why markets keep plunging every day. Even in normal times, there are always people selling, but in normal times, more people are ready to buy. That's apparently not happening so much these days.

One school of thought claims that the Fed is partially responsible for this because it continues to see two rate hikes last year and many in the market had come into yesterday hoping for one or none. On the other hand, the Fed also said a lot of good things about the economy, and the market didn't seem to listen.

Wherever people might stand on that issue, it does seem to be the case, more often than not, that when Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks, the market goes down. It hasn't happened every time since he took over the top position early this year, but perhaps often enough that investors might want to consider being extra careful on days when Powell is on the calendar. The fact is, Powell is going to be holding press conferences at every Fed meeting from now on, so that might suggest more volatility ahead, at least based on past experience.

Speaking of volatility, there's no break from that, either. The VIX ""fear gauge"" jumped double-digits to above 28 today, the highest it's been since October.

First Signs of Panic, But That's Not Necessarily All Bad

Ever since the market started getting soft in October, it's been a pretty orderly process on the way down. Selling has mostly been slow and methodical as the S&P 500 Index (SPX) dropped hundreds of points from highs above 2940 less than three months ago to where it is now hovering below 2500.

That changed on Thursday in a big way. We saw panic today, and when things get panicked, it can sometimes indicate chances of a sell-off losing steam. That's not to say there's been a bottom, only that the market did come back pretty strongly late in the session in a kind of whip-saw move before getting slammed again in the very last minutes.

People sometimes ask how one defines panic. Well, it's like Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once said about another subject: It's hard to describe it, but know it when you see it. When the SPX fell quickly on Thursday from being down 30 points to suddenly being down 60, panic seemed evident.

Some might be surprised to hear this, because maybe it feels like the market has been panicking for weeks. That's understandable. However, the methodical, orderly pattern held up until Thursday.

That raises the question of what's next? Looking ahead to next week, we have a holiday-shortened trading schedule and probably some thin volume. While there aren't any guarantees, thin volume can sometimes be a precursor for upward activity. When investors return from the next two holiday weeks to a new calendar year, they'll get some data almost immediately on December payrolls and wages.

After that, we'll start to see earnings. The bulls are likely hoping that CEOs could come on the earnings calls and say things aren't as bad as they look. Of course, it could go the other way. Either way, it's arguably important to get to earnings, because even though data is nice to have, it's backward looking. At this point, with stocks getting buried almost every day, some forward-looking perspective from the corporate world might be useful. Companies have been saying lately that they've seen strong business in the U.S. but slowing activity overseas, so investors might want to consider staying tuned to see if there's any change to that and whether CEOs see opportunity once earnings season gets underway in mid-January.

Getting back to Thursday and looking for positives, it might be constructive that the dollar index fell moderately to below 97. Recently, a strong dollar has arguably been one weight on the stock market. The Fed backtracking from a three-hike outlook down to two for next year might have helped provide some of the greenback pressure.

At the same time, 10-year Treasury note yields clawed back to 2.8% after falling under that level for the first time since May. There's been some talk lately that the 45-basis point fall in yields over the last three months or so might be a boost for the home builder market, and sure enough, those stocks have flattened out a bit lately after getting slammed for weeks. Also, emerging market stocks seem to be seeing signs of a possible rebound, but any chance for that probably depends on some sign of major progress in the China tariff situation.

As it awkwardly morphs into a city of the future, Ilahabadis recall its varied, graceful past

""Allahabad means 'City of God'. I get this from the books. From a printed curiosity -- a letter written by one of those brave and confident Hindoo strugglers with the English tongue, called a 'babu' -- I got the more compressed translation: 'Godville'. It is perfectly correct, but that is the most that can be said for it.""

It was 1897 and author Mark Twain was pinning every hope on his fifth and last work of travel -- Following the Equator -- to bail him out of bankruptcy. From South Africa to Australia, he had many stories from a worldwide lecture tour, but the ones from India seemed to be the most gripping.

A city of confluences and congregations, Allahabad overwhelmed Twain with ""a mighty swarm"" of pilgrims and the display of ""unwavering faith and belief"". In the din and dirt along the banks of some of India's holiest rivers, the writer didn't miss the presence of multiple faiths; ""a monolith which was placed... more than 2000 years ago to preach (Buddhism)""; a fort, built by a ""Mohammedan emperor"", which then belonged to the English and contained ""a Christian church"", he wrote in Following the Equator: A Journey Around the World. It did seem the obvious abode for the gods -- gods who had found and retained their little nooks and crannies in the city.

Cut to 2018, more than 120 years since Twain visited it, and the city is still as dusty and noisy. The display of faith albeit has assumed a new dimension -- that of billboards and posters that urge Hindu pilgrims to visit the Kumbh Mela at Triveni Sangam, the meeting point of Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers, between January and March 2019. Images of sadhus in saffron robes, complete with tridents and kamandals (water pots), watch over the city from various traffic intersections. The only detail missing from this picture of one of Uttar Pradesh's largest districts is Allahabad. The entry of Prayagraj explains its ouster.

On October 15 , Yogi Adityanath, chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, announced his government's decision to rechristen Allahabad. The formal order came three days later. The ghar wapsi (homecoming) of Prayagraj, in keeping with the ""wishes of people"", was touted as a bid to revive the name that the Mughal emperor Akbar is said to have discarded in the 16th century, when he built the riverside fort that Twain referred to. It may be a sheer coincidence that the announcement was made on a day regarded as Akbar's birth anniversary.

The hue and cry that followed the order didn't drown the voices that welcomed the decision. Some argued that what Akbar named Ilahabas or Ilahabad was a separate entity. Others stuck to the view that Prayag had lost its name and identity to the dynasty of Muslim rulers.

While Akbar's fort, now an army base, continues to guard the holy Sangam, government websites and offices promptly dropped Allahabad for Prayagraj. Some right-wing Hindu groups were seen throwing banners with the new name over signboards at the city's busy railway station. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit served to fix the country's gaze on Prayagraj. He addressed a rally, performed puja at the Sangam and visited the sacred Akshayvat tree in Allahabad fort. This show of strength made many in Allahabad nervous about an identity they were once fiercely possessive of -- a vibrancy of intellect and politics. The city of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Mahadevi Varma, Rudyard Kipling and Dhyan Chand was being painted with a brush that seemed in danger of smudging the fine lines of syncretism.

With an eye on the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the NDA government at the Centre is unlikely to undermine the dividends that its Hindutva agenda might reap. The Allahabad name-change -- which comes after the renaming of Mughalsarai and Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh -- is in keeping with this school of thought.

Former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju's tweet -- he was among the first to lash out at the renaming -- was a jibe at the Adityanath government for trying to change history by eliminating traces of the Mughals: ""Dear @myogiadityanath, Congratulations for renaming Allahabad as Prayag. But surely that is not enough. I recommend the following further name changes of UP cities be made to eliminate names of these Babur ki Aulads altogether.""

Justice Katju listed 18 potential changes , including Agra to Agastyanagar, Aligarh to Ashwatthamanagar and Lucknow to Laxmanpur.

Daughter of a retired judge of Allahabad High Court, 22-year-old Mekhala Saran's mind was caught between her city's old and new names: One that she had grown up with and the other she was being asked to embrace. Her restlessness found expression in poetry she posted on The Quint, a news website, on October 18. In Dear Yogi Ji, Prayagraj Ain't My Home, Leave My Allahabad Alone, Mekhala argued that:

Prayagraj is not the town/ In which I saw my first dreams/ The dreams I still see sometimes.

Prayagraj is not the town with narrow roads/ And a lot of potholes/ That I circled on my dainty cycle/ Painting pictures in my head, imagining/ That I'm in a Disney movie/ Escaping a filmy catastrophe/ On my long Lady Bird cycle...

You can mess with the country's memory all you like/ But leave my town's history aside.

""The poem [also available in Hindi] was well received but she also got trolled for it. It made us a little nervous about her security,"" says her father, Justice Amar Saran. The trepidation, however, didn't stop the former judge from brainstorming with a group of lawyers and social activists on ways to reinstate the name Allahabad. The obvious choice was a public interest litigation (PIL), which was filed before the Allahabad HC in October. ""The deliberate destruction of culture or upholding the culture of any one community at the cost of another is antithetical to the secular nature of the country,"" says Justice Saran. Name changes are not a new phenomenon; countries all over the world have done it, he adds. ""But a government can't impose a name on its people; it must consider sentiments and history. In the case of Allahabad becoming Prayagraj, the matter was closed in just three days,"" he says.

Advocate Syed Farman Naqvi, who has been practising at the Allahabad HC for the last 38 years, is no stranger to PILs. But the one that challenges the renaming of his city is close to his heart. He now spends most of his time in strengthening the case against the government. This means meetings and more meetings. And keeping the morale high, he says. Representing Allahabad Heritage Society and 12 others in the PIL, Naqvi says the unifying thought among the petitioners was to keep Allahabad's Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb alive. The Hindustani (a mix of Hindi and Urdu) usage is a pointer to the composite Hindu-Muslim culture of the plains of northern India -- one that is said to have flourished in cities such as Lucknow, Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and even Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Ram. While the HC has reserved judgement on the PIL, Naqvi has been advised by friends and family to arrange a security cover for himself. The man, however, refuses to entertain such suggestions. He, in fact, is counting the number of temples and mazaars that have been razed in the name of preparing the city for the Kumbh. ""I would say at least 300 religious structures have been done away with. Some of these were encroachments but a few had been around for decades. Let's see what else they are planning,"" he says, adding that the city is experiencing serious air pollution due to the beautification work underway.

***

Naqvi's affection for Allahabad -- more than just the geographical entity -- is something that Neelum Saran Gour, author and professor of English literature at the Central University of Allahabad, would easily relate with. ""Allahabad now provokes extreme reactions -- great affection in those addicted to it, and violent criticism from many who despise it, even while living in it,"" she says.

With titles such as Three Rivers and a Tree: The Story of Allahabad University and Sikander Chowk Park to her credit, Gour has been wearing the tag of a raconteur of Allahabad's history for years. It's not a mantle that she acquired consciously; it ""descended"" on her after Marg Publications invited her to guest-edit a pictorial volume on the city's history and culture. The book -- Allahabad: Where The Rivers Meet (2009) -- touched a chord with Allahabadis (also known as Ilahabadis) scattered across the world.

The nostalgia of its ""so-called Oxford of the East days and high-profile judicial ambience"" stands out against a new ""cosmopolitanism of consumerism"", she says. And the old Allahabad -- ""the city of interlocking cultures: Indic, Islamic and European"" -- may seem like a notional thing.

""It's there, I am sure, quietly present, waiting. Although much of its former European ambience has gone with the departure of its extensive Anglo-Indian population and the migration of its senior citizens to cities where their children have relocated, social media has generated a space where Allahabad residents from far-flung parts mingle and keep the city's layers of culture alive,"" adds Gour.

***

Poet, translator and anthologist Arvind Krishna Mehrotra goes back to the city mostly for the books he has there; they occupy two rooms of a second-floor flat he still keeps. ""Some of these books are from the 1930s -- from the time my uncle was teaching at the university. When I was an undergraduate [in the '60s] at the same university, I started adding to the collection. The library was nothing to speak of and seldom had what I needed. Before I knew it, the shelves were almost touching the ceiling,"" he says.

In 1968, after two years in Bombay, Mehrotra returned to the city as a lecturer. He stayed in the same job till 2012, but Allahabad, he says, had little to do with his decision. It was more the permanent job. ""Till the early '80s Allahabad was a liveable place, with its tree-lined roads and colonial-era bungalows. But its 'uglification' happened rather fast,"" he adds, referring to official beautification drives. He moved to Dehradun after retirement, where he lives in a house he inherited. ""In my mind, I had left Allahabad decades ago. Those who continue to live there do so not because they love the city but because they, like me, have inherited an old house with high ceilings and skylights. These houses are impossible to leave. In some ways, we are all prisoners of our inheritances.""

***

Resident of one such bungalow in the Civil Lines area, author, editor and translator Sara Rai considers herself lucky to have grown up in a house with gardens and orchards. Also the granddaughter of Dhanpat Rai Srivastava -- better known as the legendary Munshi Premchand -- Rai's earliest memories of the city involved a ""raucous crow"" in her garden, one that refused to shut up. ""Some of the roads were lined with tamarind trees; you went to school on a rickshaw, stopping on the way to hurl stones at the juicy fruit in an attempt to bring it down,"" she says.

The Rais lived close to the Ganga. During the long and hot summer, a procession of camels carrying watermelons walked past their gate, with the bells around their neck making soothing music. ""The winters were sudden, with a rapid elision into the melancholy of spring,"" recalls Rai.

She concedes that the depredation of this Allahabad has been rapid and of many kinds. ""The bungalows have disappeared. High-rise buildings have taken hold of the town like a disease. Hundreds of flats have sprung up overnight,"" she says.

The civic amenities have not kept pace though. ""Despite widening, the roads seem narrower than before, for the number of cars has increased; not so, the parking spaces. Everyone is in a hurry, though there is nowhere much to go to. The gentle grace of the town is all but lost,"" she says when asked to list the changes in the last 30 years. The city now seems to have no ""time to read, to think, to spend hours watching things unfold in nature, to have people drop by for visits, or to go unannounced to friends' homes, confident of finding them in...""

What Rai seems to rue the most is the exodus of the city's middle-class population. She puts this on the coming of another Prayag Raj -- a daily superfast service between Delhi and Allahabad -- and a host of other trains. ""The middle class used to form the town's backbone,"" she says. ""The state of the university, once prestigious and home to poets, writers and educationists, is now abysmal. The local population now sends its children to study in Delhi, Pune or elsewhere.""

Yet Rai's internal compass, like that of many other Ilahabadis, seems to send her back to the city that has seeped into her consciousness.

Cricketer and commentator Mohammad Kaif, who grew up in the neighbourhood of Kydganj, still misses his early-morning swimming classes at Saraswati Ghat. The dahi-jalebi breakfast, almost a daily affair on his way back home, was as much fun as waking up in the wee hours to watch live telecasts of cricket matches from Australia in the company of siblings Asif, Saif and Uzma. He remembers sitting on his father's shoulder for a glimpse of Amitabh Bachchan, also from Allahabad, in 1986. ""For us, hiring a VCR [videocassette recorder] meant watching Bachchan's films. He enjoys a god-like stature in Allahabad. Meeting him in 2003 was one of the finest moments of my life,"" says Kaif. He was only 12 when he left Allahabad -- in the early '90s -- for the Kanpur Sports Hostel. Kaif, who also contested Lok Sabha elections from UP's Phulpur constituency on a Congress ticket in 2014, still visits his family in Allahabad.

While recent debates over its name change have dented the city's legendary inclusiveness of cultures and communities, many of its ordinary citizens -- the ones who seek respite from traffic tangles and the dust and pollution -- are watching what they are being offered in terms of infrastructure and development.

The old Allahabad may have slipped from between their fingers. It remains to be seen if Prayagraj will do them any good."

But where to find them? Deal, no deal or even another referendum?

While #Brexit has dominated much of public debate and Government time, #Metoo and #gigeconomy have also featured prominently in public debate though they are assigned to the Government's growing list of ""future legislative reform needed if we just had time"" pile - shame JK Rowling couldn't make Hermione's time turner a reality.

The Government has repeatedly stated that it intends to maintain current UK employment laws so that existing workers' rights are unchanged following exit day, this could of course change, as political fortunes change ('Fantastic [Brexit] Beasts: the [G]rimes of Grindel[gov]'). The reality is that it is unlikely the Government will change its mind and repeal all EU-derived employment law or make large-scale changes to employment law in the aftermath of Brexit. There may be scope to tweak some provisions within the current legislation, but political considerations make it relatively unlikely that core employee rights would be reduced significantly following Brexit.

John Whiting, now CBE, is the writer's personal favourite taxman for this simple and honest statement, which continues to be true. Like last year, determining worker status in modern workplaces has once again been a hot topic in 2018.

Back in February we finally saw the delayed Government Response to the recommendations of the Taylor review of modern working practices; and the answer to the tricky employment status issue is...more consultation and thinking!

The Government has rejected Matthew Taylor's recommendation for introducing a 'worker status by default' presumption and is instead revisiting the possibility of a new statutory test to determine employment status. As acknowledged in the latest consultation which closed on 1 June, codification of the test for employment status would involve trade-offs. On the one hand, a simple and clear formula will give more certainty. On the other hand, the current case law based framework provides the nuance and flexibility often needed when applying the test to different circumstances which are inevitable in the labour market.

Ultimately, employment status is a complicated subject because employment relationships are just that - complicated. A status test set down in legislation rather than case law doesn't change that fact. Trying to encapsulate the nuanced factors developed over years of case law into legislation will be no easy feat. But have the courts been any more helpful this year?

Since the 2016 landmark tribunal decision (and 2017 Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) judgment) that Uber drivers are workers (despite Uber's best efforts at drafting bamboozling contractual clauses) there has been a seemingly endless supply of successful new claims predominantly concerning couriers [Insert your choice of courier company name and you will most likely find a case].

In June, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Pimlico Plumbers Limited & Anr v Smith on whether a plumber who was self-employed for tax purposes was nonetheless a worker for employment law purposes. In relation to the personal service requirement for establishing 'worker' status, the Supreme Court confirmed that a limited or occasional power of delegation could still be consistent with personal performance. The 'dominant purpose' of the contract remained one of personal service.

The Supreme Court's judgment significantly decreases the importance of the right of substitution as a determining factor. A substitution clause in and of itself does not magically prevent worker status. On the other hand, integration in the business appears to be a factor of increasing importance in the current wave of worker status cases.

The Supreme Court has tweaked the judicial test by succinctly articulating the 'dominant purpose' factor. But this is more judicial test evolution rather than revolution. Unfortunately, for hopes of world peace, arguments over the required elements of worker status are far from over. Whether and to what extent 'mutuality of obligation' between assignments is relevant to a person's status during assignments is still up for grabs. 'Mutuality of obligation' is a crucial factor to establish 'employee' status, but is it required and if so, to what extent, for establishing 'worker' status? As the Supreme Court said there is no easy answer to this question and it will have to await appraisal on another occasion.

The further appeal in the Uber case was heard by the Court of Appeal on 30 and 31 October. Will the judgment, when handed down, provide an answer? No doubt whichever way the judgment goes, the losing party will further appeal.

Unfortunately, we are not much closer to tackling world peace!

Last year in Jones v Birds Eye, the employment tribunal reminded us that following the 2013 EAT decision in Moran v Ideal Cleaning, the number of agency workers potentially falling within the provisions of the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 was significantly lower than originally anticipated. Following Moran, not all agency workers are protected; it is only those supplied to work temporarily. Those placed indefinitely (meaning open-ended in duration) are not placed 'temporarily' and are therefore outside the scope of the Agency Workers Regulations (AWR).

In both Moran and Jones the agency workers were found not to be temporary and so not covered by the AWR. Conversely this year in Brooknight Guarding Ltd v Matei we have an example of an agency worker placed temporarily. The EAT agreed with the tribunal, that while a relief security guard mainly worked at one site, it was as a 'cover security guard'. Each 'as required' assignment was on a temporary rather than on a permanent or indefinite basis.

In Kocur v Angard Staffing Solutions Ltd, an employer breached the AWR in providing an agency worker with fewer enhanced contractual days' holiday and shorter paid rest breaks than comparable permanent employees, despite the agency worker receiving a higher hourly wage. The EAT rejected the defence that the agency worker's higher rate of pay offset his inferior holiday entitlement and rest breaks - the AWR require a term-by-term comparison not a package approach.

For a part-time worker to establish less favourable treatment under the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (PTW) they need to identify an actual full-time worker comparator who is: employed by the same employer under the same type of contract and engaged in the same or broadly similar work having regard to level of qualification, skills and experience.

In Roddis v Sheffield Hallam University, the EAT considered what constitutes the 'same type of contract' for PTW purposes in the context of a claim by an employee working under a zero hours contract. The University argued that a lecturer's zero-hours contract was not the 'same type of contract' so he could not compare himself with a full-time lecturer on a permanent contract of employment.

A good academic try? Well no. The EAT had no trouble in rejecting this argument. It cannot be that a zero-hours contract of itself constitutes a different type of contract for the purposes of the PTW, since the consequence would be that an employee on a zero-hours contract would never be able to compare themselves to a full-time worker. As the EAT points out, if a contract of employment containing a zero-hours clause was a distinct type of contract under the PTW, the PTW would be self-defeating.

Back in June 2013, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 was revamped. Significant new provisions were introduced. The changes included introducing co-workers' liability for victimisation with corresponding employer statutory vicarious liability.

In November, the Court of Appeal in Timis and Sage v Osipov confirmed that an individual's personal liability for detriment which they cause to a whistleblower colleague can extend to liability for that colleague's dismissal. Where a distinct prior detrimental act done by a co-worker results in the whistleblower's dismissal, the whistleblower can still recover compensation for losses flowing from the dismissal - a so-called 'dismissal consequent on detriment' claim. In this case, it leaves two wrongdoer directors on the hook for just over £2 million of losses, the employer company being insolvent.

For there to be a qualifying disclosure under the whistleblowing legislation, there must be a disclosure of information, not a matter of opinion or an allegation. In practice, information and allegations are often intertwined. In June, the Court of Appeal clarified that the question is whether the disclosure has ""sufficient factual content and specificity"" (Kilraine v London Borough of Wandsworth).

This year we have also learnt on the whistleblowing front:

Common law vicarious liability is a principle of strict, no-fault liability for wrongs committed by another person. In an employment relationship, an employer may be liable for the wrongs committed by an employee where there is a sufficient connection between those wrongs and the employee's employment. This is a very long-standing legal principle with the foundation of the 'modern' principle going back to 1912 (Lloyd and Grace, Smith and Co). But have 21st century developments expanded its scope?

Following a number of appellate level 21st century judgments, when considering whether an incident has sufficient connection with the employer, it is not merely a question of whether the employee was 'at work' in a strict sense. Instead it is whether the employee was otherwise 'clothed in the employer's authority' or ''acting within the field of activities assigned to them'.

For example, an employer was liable for a Managing Director's violent assault of a colleague at an impromptu post-Christmas work party after-party as the MD 'chose to wear his metaphorical managing director's hat' at the time of the incident. Another employer was vicariously liable for a data breach by a rogue employee as access to the data was within the field of activities assigned to him. The fact that the rogue employee's actions were designed to harm the employer was irrelevant.

July saw the Court of Appeal hand down one of the most significant judgments of the year - a combined judgment in Royal Mencap Society v Tomlinson-Blake and Shannon v Rampersad t/a Clifton House Residential Home. In a single judgment, the Court of Appeal has effectively overturned the precedent value of numerous EAT judgments concerning the treatment of 'sleep-in' shifts for national minimum wage (NMW) purposes.

Where a worker is required to work a number of 'sleep-in' night shifts at the employer's premises (to be available in case of an occasional emergency but otherwise expected to sleep all or most of the shift), does the full night shift constitute 'working' for the purposes of the NMW? The Court of Appeal has now answered this question ruling: ""the only time that counts for NMW purposes [during sleep-in-shifts] is the time when the worker is required to be awake for the purpose of working"".

Quite simply the only time that counts for NMW purposes is the time when the worker is required to be awake and actually carrying out work. Time spent sleeping/relaxing does not count. Factors previously found to point towards NMW being payable for the entire sleep-in shift are now irrelevant. The sleep-in exception in the NMW Regulations applies to cases where ""the essence of the arrangement is that the worker is expected to sleep"".

Turning to on-call time for Working Time Directive purposes, until this year Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case-law has tended to focus on the worker's location during stand-by periods and whether it is at a place determined by the employer. Early this year, in Ville de Nivelles v Matzak, the CJEU considered whether on-call time is 'working time' for fire-fighters on-call at home but with a duty to respond within eight minutes. The CJEU has held that such time is 'working time'.

Perhaps a bit counterintuitively, this judgment still reaffirms the importance of proximity to the workplace. In this case, the obligation for the firefighters to remain physically present at the place determined by the employer (their homes) and the 'geographical and temporal constraints' resulting from the requirement to reach their place of work within eight minutes, limited the opportunities which the firefighters had to devote themselves to their personal and social interests. The situation of the firefighters in this case could therefore be distinguished from that of a worker who, during his stand-by duty, must simply be at his employer's disposal inasmuch as it must be possible to contact him. While being on employer premises during on-call time is not required, the proximity of the worker to the workplace at a place determined by the employer (even if it is the worker's home) is still a key factor.

In what is now a perennial favourite, holiday leave accrual, carry-over and pay calculations have once again featured heavily over the year.

Working out holiday entitlement for term time only workers, casual and zero hour workers can often prove to be an administrative headache. The Working Time Regulations (WTR) require holiday pay to be calculated on the basis of the average hours worked in the preceding 12 weeks immediately before payment is made. However, many employers have instead worked out holiday pay by using a 12.07% of annualised hours shortcut as set out in ACAS guidance (5.6 weeks is equivalent to 12.07% of hours worked over a year for a full time worker).

While the 12.07% method is accurate in many cases, it isn't always. In March, the EAT in Brazel v The Harpur Trust confirmed that calculating holiday pay for variable hour, term-time workers based on 12.07% of annualised hours is incorrect. The express provisions contained in the WTR cannot be overridden for ease of calculation. As shown in Mrs Brazel's case, the shortcut did not work accurately for part-time term time workers. Employers using a 12.07% of annualised hours calculation as a shortcut need to review their holiday pay calculation practices or face potential claims.

In Gomes v Higher Level Care Ltd, the Court of Appeal was asked whether compensation for failing to provide rest breaks can include an injury to feelings award. If yes, this would significantly increase the value of rest break breach claims.

The Court of Appeal has confirmed that compensation for claims for failing to provide rest breaks does not extend to injury to feelings, being akin to a breach of contract claim.

While compensation for failure to provide rest breaks and annual leave does not extend to awards for injury to feelings, not all WTR claims are excluded. In contrast, compensation for injury to feelings may be awarded in working time detriment claims since they are more akin to a statutory tort (South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service v Mansell & ors).

We have also had yet another EAT judgment on overtime and holiday pay calculations. The EAT in Flowers and others v East of England Ambulance Trust, once again confirmed that for a WTR claim ""normal pay"" is that which is ""normally received"". Focusing on whether overtime is or isn't ""voluntary"" is irrelevant. The key is regular receipt. But also check the contractual provisions. If there is a contractual right to have overtime included, there may not be a need to establish a regular pattern. In Flowers, regardless of the WTR claim, the claimants were entitled under a contractual clause to have any overtime pay received in the preceding three months included in their annual leave calculation whether or not the overtime worked was part of a regular and settled pattern.

In two German references, Kreuziger v Land Berlin and Max-Planck v Shimizu, the CJEU held that a worker who does not apply for paid annual leave during employment does not automatically lose the right to an allowance in lieu of untaken leave on termination. The worker must have been given an opportunity to take that leave. While employers are not required to force workers to actually exercise their right to take paid annual leave, a bit of nagging may be needed. It is for the employer to show that it encouraged the worker to do so, while informing them, accurately and in good time, of the risk of losing that leave at the end of the applicable reference period.

The CJEU has confirmed that the Working Time Directive (WTD) does not require holiday leave accrual during the taking of parental leave (Tribunalul Botoşani v Dicu). Parental leave (in the UK 18 weeks' unpaid leave to care for a child) is distinguishable from sickness absence and maternity leave. If national law suspends the employment contract during parental leave, then annual leave entitlement does not accrue during the taking of that parental leave. Parental leave is not equivalent to a period of actual work for determining the duration of paid annual leave.

In the UK, legislative provisions which apply to maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental leave expressly state that during the leave period the employee is entitled to the benefit of all the terms and conditions of employment except remuneration - so holiday leave accrual continues during these leave periods. However, there is no corresponding legislative provision in relation to EU law derived parental leave.

If an employer unilaterally imposes a contractual change, it is possible for employees' agreement to be implied if they continue to work without protesting after the change has been imposed. But this is risky. Careful analysis of all communication from employees (both verbal and written) is necessary to ensure nothing has been communicated that suggests or evidences objection to the changes. Where the change imposed does not have immediate effect, silence would not be considered to be agreement simply as a result of the passage of time.

In April, the Court of Appeal in Abrahall and ors v Nottingham City Council reminded employers just what risky business it is to assume agreement. In this case, the Court held that a group of employees who continued to work following their employer's imposition of a pay freeze did not agree to a variation of contract. Although the employees did not bring tribunal claims until two years later and did not individually communicate protest, they had protested through their trade unions at the time. The employees continuing to work could not be taken as unequivocal acceptance of a change that was wholly to their disadvantage. A decision by the union not to take industrial action over the imposed change did not equate to accepting the variation.

Also in April, we received Supreme Court clarification on when contractual notice of termination served by post takes effect (Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust v Haywood). In the absence of any specific contractual provision, contractual notice takes effect only when the employee personally takes delivery of the letter containing the notice (so not date recorded delivery signed for by a family member). In this case, the date of termination was crucial because it determined whether the notice period expired on or before the employee's 50th birthday, which affected her pension entitlement by some £200,000.

This judgment now aligns the contractual law position with the statutory position in respect of the effective date of termination (EDT) under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

Lesson: when dismissing an employee, it is usually best to inform the employee in person (written confirmation being simply that, confirmation, and not the mode of first communication of the actual decision). This will remove any ambiguity about the date of dismissal.

From this year's crop of unfair dismissal judgments we have learned:

A head teacher's failure to disclose to school governors a close personal relationship she had with a registered sex offender was misconduct justifying dismissal (Reilly v Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council - Supreme Court). This judgment is of particular note as Lord Wilson questions how useful is the long-standing Burchell v BHS reasonableness test, but without reaching a conclusion. The Supreme Court has, in effect, invited argument in a future case.

Misconduct does need to necessarily amount to gross misconduct for a fair dismissal. There is no magic in labelling something as gross misconduct rather than as serious misconduct for unfair dismissal purposes. As ever, each case will be fact specific to determine whether the employer acted reasonably in treating that reason for dismissal as sufficient to justify dismissal (Quintiles Commercial UK Ltd v Barongo - EAT).

The deemed extension of the effective date of termination by statutory minimum notice does not apply where the employer is entitled to immediately dismiss (summary dismissal) by reason of the employee's conduct (Lancaster and Duke Ltd v Wileman - EAT)

An employee's letter giving 'notice' was not an unambiguous resignation. The context for the letter was that the employee was expecting to take up a different role in another department (although that role was subsequently withdrawn) and the tribunal was entitled to read it as giving notice of intention to leave a particular role rather than to terminate employment (East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust v Levy - EAT).

Where an employee is contractually entitled to receipt of Permanent Health Insurance (PHI) payments, absent any over-riding express terms, the courts will imply a term preventing an employee being dismissed where this would deprive them of the benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled under the PHI scheme. While an employee may use the implied term in a breach of contract wrongful dismissal claim, tribunals must not allow that breach to automatically dictate its conclusions on unfair dismissal. Having said that, breach of the implied term will still be a very important relevant factor when assessing fairness (Awan v ICTS UK Ltd - EAT).

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee for taking part in the activities of an independent trade union. Union officials who are also employees will lose this protection where they are found to have acted wholly unreasonably or maliciously in carrying out their functions. But where is the line drawn?

The Court of Appeal confirmed a trade union official was automatically unfairly dismissed despite misuse of confidential information. In the Court's view, it is not uncommon for a union representative to be given, without soliciting it, information that he or she realises has been obtained without the owner's consent. Although it might be said that the only correct course in such circumstances would be to decline the information or destroy it, the court was 'not here concerned with an ethics seminar'. Instead the key question was whether the very limited way in which Mr Morris made use of the obviously illegally obtained information (forwarding it to HR and insisting on a meeting to discuss the contents) was a 'sufficient departure from good industrial relations practice to take his conduct outside the scope of 'trade union activities' .

The Court held the line had not been crossed. At most, some sort of warning for storing and not deleting the information might have been appropriate. The official's conduct was not outside the scope of 'trade union activities' and he was therefore entitled to the statutory automatic unfair dismissal protection (Morris v Metrolink RATP Dev Ltd).

On the tax front, since 6 April the way that termination payments are taxed has changed. All payments in lieu of notice are now treated as earnings subject to tax and class 1 NICs. Effectively, employers are required to subject to tax an amount equivalent to the employee's basic pay (as defined in the new rules) if notice is not worked. However, planned changes making termination payments above £30,000 subject to class 1A NICs (employer liability only) have been postponed even further to April 2020, which is good news for employers.

While case law on transfers of undertakings has been relatively quiet this year we have had some interesting cases and some rare examples:

A renewed warning that if a parent company takes over the day-to-day running of the business of a subsidiary, this may result in a TUPE transfer of the subsidiary's employees to the parent. Significant care should be taken when a parent company decides to show more of an interest in the business of its subsidiary (whether following a share acquisition or otherwise). If the parent starts making decisions and issuing directions in a manner which suggests that it has assumed control of the subsidiary, it could inadvertently become the employer. In Guvera Ltd v Butler a parent company learned that lesson at some considerable cost, with awards for failing to inform and consult on the intra-group transfer amounting to £3.5 million having been made to the numerous claimants in this case.

European case-law in line with existing UK case-law that a temporary cessation of activities prior a transfer does not necessarily prevent the existence of a transfer of undertaking (Colino Sigüenza - CJEU).

A reminder that in assessing whether there has been a service provision change (SPC) to multiple new providers, the effect of fragmentation must be considered when identifying the relevant activity. In some cases, the way a service is carried out post-transfer will be a relevant consideration in determining whether the activities are fundamentally the same as those carried out by the outgoing contractor. It is important to assess the issue of fragmentation early on in the analysis, because in some cases the fragmentation will be so acute that it will no longer be possible to say that there has been a service provision change (London Care Ltd v Henry and others - EAT).

EAT guidance on the meaning of 'undertaking', 'economic entity' and 'administrative function', which is rarely seen in domestic cases. A useful round-up of case law (both domestic and European) in relation to services or entities performing functions within the public sector (Nicholls and others v London Borough of Croydon).

A rare example of a permitted change to terms and conditions following a TUPE transfer. A transferor was not prevented from withdrawing a travel time allowance. The genuine reason for its withdrawal was that it was outdated and unjustified, not for a reason related to the transfer (Tabberer v Mears Ltd - EAT).

It was hard to miss that on 25 May, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) together with the new Data Protection Act 2018 came into force introducing a raft of important changes to the data protection regime. Key changes include:

In July we received Court of Appeal guidance on the balancing test needed when dealing with a ""mixed data"" Subject Access Request and when a third party objects to their data being disclosed (B v General Medical Council):

Although the decision concerns the DPA 1998, it will continue to have relevance under the DPA 2018 and GDPR regime.

This year employers are reminded that checking references given by applicants is an important part of any recruitment process. Especially where experience equates to safety, doing so is critical.

In Francis-McGann v West Atlantic UK Ltd, a pilot applied for a captain position with a freight airline. He falsely claimed to have previously worked as a captain and gave as a referee Mr Desilijic Tiure - in hope that the reference would never be checked. The pilot was appointed as a captain before his references were checked and provided with training based on him already being an experienced captain.

The person who initially decided to hire Mr Francis-McGann was clearly not an obsessive Star Wars fan. When his references were checked, it became obvious that Mr Desilijic Tiure was fictitious, being Jabba Desilijic Tiure, better known as Jabba the Hutt of Star Wars fame! However that was merely the first Episode.

After being summarily dismissed, Mr Francis-McGann brought a tribunal claim for three months' unpaid notice pay! The tribunal had no qualms in dismissing his claim and allowing the employer's cross claim for recovery of training costs in accordance with a contractual clause in the sum of £4,725. The force was clearly not with Mr Francis-McGann.

In July, the EAT gave a warning to prospective employers considering withdrawing a job offer following the receipt of an unsatisfactory reference criticising an applicant's levels of absence in their previous job without first considering whether there was an underlying disability.

In South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust v Lee a prospective employer was liable for discrimination arising from disability when it withdrew a job offer after receiving and relying upon two unsatisfactory references. One of the references was unduly negative and inaccurate because it heavily relied on disability-related absences. The tribunal found the discriminatory reference had more than a minor influence on the new hirer's decision-maker. As such, it did not matter that the non-discriminatory reference may in and of itself have been sufficient cause to withdraw the job offer (although this may be relevant when awarding compensation). Lesson - consider references critically to assess whether any adverse comments in references may relate to disability necessitating follow-up enquiry.

Do employers need to match enhanced maternity pay for fathers taking Shared Parental Leave (ShPL)?

Early in April, the EAT in Ali v Capita Customer Management confirmed that it is not direct sex discrimination for employers to offer 14 weeks' enhanced maternity pay but only statutory ShPL pay.

While this case is in line with Government guidance and the traditional view, it is notable that Mr Ali's case concerned an enhanced maternity pay period of only 14 weeks which happens to be the minimum maternity leave period required under the EU Pregnant Workers Directive. As such, a question mark remains where enhanced contractual maternity pay period exceeds 14 weeks.

While we received at least a limited answer on the question of direct sex discrimination (subject to a pending appeal), the question of indirect sex discrimination is still very much up for grabs. Three weeks after the EAT handed down the Ali judgment, the EAT handed down its related judgment in Hextall v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police.

In Hextall, the same question was considered through the prism of an indirect discrimination claim. In this case the EAT held the original tribunal incorrectly analysed the question of comparators and also failed to correctly identify the particular disadvantage. The case was therefore sent back to the tribunal. The question of indirect discrimination continues to be unresolved and we wait a further tribunal decision (determined on the correct legal basis). Like Ali, Hextall too is subject to a pending appeal.

While large private sector equal pay claims against several large supermarkets are making their way through the tribunal system and the usual endless preliminary issues, this year we have learned:

'Discrimination arising from a disability' is still a relatively new concept first introduced by section 15 of the Equality Act 2010. Over recent years we are gathering a body of case-law on the intricacies of this concept which involves the employer treating the employee ""unfavourably because of something arising in consequence"" of the employee's disability. Section 15 entails two distinct causative issues: The first involves examining the employer's state of mind: did the unfavourable treatment occur because of the employer's attitude to the relevant 'something'? The second is objective: is there a causal link between the disability and the 'something'?

This year we have learned:

In Donelien v Liberata UK, the Court of Appeal reassures employers that they can rely on the advice of occupational health advisers in determining whether an employee is disabled, so long as appropriate questions are raised and further clarification is sought where necessary.

An employer does not necessarily need to take every step possible to establish whether an employee is disabled in order to avoid having constructive knowledge of disability. The test is what an employer could reasonably be expected to know. In this case, the employer had not relied solely on an occupational health report stating that the employee was not disabled. It had also taken into account 'return to work' meetings and letters from the employee's GP. An employer's efforts need not be perfect and, in the circumstances, the employer had taken reasonable steps to ascertain the nature of the employee's illness and could not reasonably have been expected to do more particularly when dealing with an uncooperative employee.

To establish an indirect discrimination claim, the employee will need to show that the employer applied a ""provision, criterion or practice"" (PCP) that puts, or would put, those of the employee's protected group at a particular disadvantage compared to other groups. In Carreras v United First Partners Research, the Court of Appeal held that an expectation that an employee would work late does not have to be presented as an instruction to cause a disadvantage. If the disabled employee can establish the existence of a long-hours culture, this may be enough to amount to a 'practice' under the Equality Act 2010.

In Colt Technology Services Ltd v Brown, the EAT decided an important point regarding the effect of PHI on discrimination compensation, where the employee has had the opportunity to choose different levels of PHI cover through a workplace flexible benefits scheme.

The EAT considered the 'insurance exception' to the general rule that claimants should only be compensated for actual loss. The policy behind the exception is that an employer should not be able to benefit from an employee's prudence in taking out insurance, and so insurance pay outs are not set off against the employee's financial losses in those circumstances. In the context of a flexible benefits package - where an employee can choose the level of their insurance benefits in exchange for foregoing extra salary - this principle must be apportioned. The portion paid for by the employer without the employee foregoing extra salary will be offset (in this case 50%) and the portion for which the employee had foregone extra salary will not (in this case an additional 25%).

In relation to a claim for unlawful victimisation under the Equality Act 2010, ""giving false evidence or information, or making a false allegation, is not a protected act if the evidence or information is given, or the allegation is made in bad faith."" But does an ulterior motive for making a victimisation claim show bad faith?

In Saad v Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust, the EAT confirmed that honesty not motivation is key. The primary question for victimisation purposes is whether the employee has acted honestly in giving the evidence or information, or in making the allegation, that is relied on as a protected act. The existence of a predominant ulterior motive, while potentially relevant, is not the focus of the enquiry. In this case, just because the allegation was raised as a means to deflect criticism during a performance process did not automatically mean it was done in bad faith.

In Unite the Union v Nailard, the Court of Appeal reminds employers that harassment can be committed by inaction was well as action. Failure to act in relation to third party harassment which is brought to the employer's attention, may itself amount to harassment. If the reason for the failure to act was influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the relevant protected characteristic, then that failure to act may itself amount to harassment. Employers should ensure that they train staff on dealing with harassment issues, make it clear that harassment from suppliers, clients and customers is not tolerated and keep clear records of issues arising.

In Bakkali v Greater Manchester Buses, the EAT point out that in harassment claims, context is a crucial element. Conduct ""related to"" a protected characteristic (in the test for harassment) is wider in scope than conduct ""because of"" a protected characteristic (in the test for direct discrimination). It requires a broader enquiry, involving ""a more intense focus"" on the context of the offending words or behaviour.

The Holy Grail: financially sustainable access to justice.

Following last year's abolition of tribunal fees by the Supreme Court, the number of claims has been steadily increasing. While the number of individual tribunal claims overall has not yet returned to the pre- 2013 introduction of the fees regime level, we have reached an important statistical milestone. September's quarterly statistics revealed that single-claim receipts are, for the first time, at a higher level than when fees were first introduced.

While the number of claims is set to rise over the near future, the Ministry of Justice in November announced that a new fee regime ""balancing tribunal funding and access to justice"" was ""in development"".

Four years after the introduction of mandatory ACAS early conciliation (EC) we finally have appellate level confirmation on how to apply the 'stop the clock' provisions. In April, the EAT confirmed the widely accepted view that the time limit to present a claim should always be extended by the number of days it takes to complete the EC procedure (Luton Borough Council v Haque).

The cloak that reaches below the knees is usually made of either of wool or jamewar which is a mixture of wool and cotton.

The order was originally meant for the state secretariat. In September, the General Administration Department of the Civil Secretariat in Srinagar asked government officials to ""be attired in proper formal dress while appearing before any court of law and while attending offices in the State of Jammu and Kashmir and strictly avoid casual or party attire"".

The decision was a security directive. However, the zonal education officer (ZEO) in Langate, following the civil secretariat directive, issued an order last week banning the pheran in educational institutions.

A stream of protest erupted on Twitter criticising the ban, forcing the school department to retract the order. However, the security protocol at the secretariat remains.

Former chief minister, Omar Abdullah, tweeted: ""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned! This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn.""

He added: ""My father and I have worn pherans to official functions many times over the years and will continue to do so, silly government orders notwithstanding. #dontbanourpheran #revokepheranban.""

Mohammad Shafi War, the chief education officer of Kupwara said that the order was withdrawn on Tuesday. He said: ""There is an official dress code but we cannot ignore the significance of pheran. That is why we have withdrawn the order issued by ZEO Langate.""

Kashmiris love their 'pherans'. These loose, warm outer garments are typically worn during winters.

'Pheran' has a long history in Kashmir, and is believed to have a tradition of at least 660 years. Worn over centuries by the inhabitants to brave the harsh winter chill, the garment has worked as a great leveller of the Kashmiri society. It has traditionally dissolved the class difference, being the preferred dress for both the rich and the poor during the cold season. Even when modernity permeated the lives of Kashmiris over the years, the pheran continued to remain a badge of its culture.

Though the etymology is a little unclear, some believe the name pheran is derived from the Greek word 'apron'. Many contend that the tunic owes its origin to the Persian word for shirt,'perahan'. The Tajik word 'peraband' is also closely associated with the Kashmiri pheran. Since Kashmir has a distinct central Asian cultural link, that may well be the case"

Claims for indirect expropriation may arise through environmental regulatory regimes. Where legislative schemes operate to interfere with existing property rights, such interference may constitute de facto, or indirect, expropriation. One example of a legislative regime that has been the subject of indirect expropriation claims is the federal Species at Risk Act (the ""SARA""). Under the SARA, the Governor in Council is empowered to make emergency orders to provide for the protection of certain wildlife species. The emergency protection order may extend not only to Crown land, but also private property. The SARA provides for a limited compensation scheme. The Minister may provide for reasonable compensation for losses suffered ""as a result of any extraordinary impact of the application of"" the emergency protection order. The Governor in Council may make regulations with respect to the procedures to be followed and the methods to be used to determine the compensation.

The sage grouse order exemplifies how a SARA emergency protection order may give rise to an expropriation claim. The sage grouse order was the first emergency protection order to be issued under section 80 of the SARA. It was issued to protect the greater sage grouse population in Alberta and Saskatchewan, and came into force on February 18, 2014. The sage grouse is an endangered species under the SARA and Alberta's Wildlife Act. Under the Wildlife Act it is an offence to ""willfully molest, disturb, ore destroy a house, nest or den"" of sage grouse. The sage grouse order restricted activities on 1,672 km2 of provincial and federal Crown lands in southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan.

In The City of Medicine Hat et al v Canada (AG) et al, LGX Oil and Gas and the City of Medicine Hat, which had interests in the Manyberries oil production site that was affected by the sage grouse order, brought a judicial review and constitutional challenge of the sage grouse order at the Federal Court of Canada. The applicants successfully resisted a summary dismissal motion brought by the Crown and subsequently commenced an action at the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench for $123.6 million in compensation (including accelerated reclamation costs) for de facto expropriation of existing oil and gas mineral rights, leases and rights-of-way. This case is ongoing. At this point, the Governor in Council has not made regulations with respect to compensation. The Crown pleads that the emergency protection order is regulatory and, in the alternative, that compensation under the SARA is discretionary. In the further alternative, the Governor in Council had chosen not to make regulations, and the emergency order did not have an ""extraordinary impact"" on the plaintiffs.

Another case was Groupe Maison Candiac Inc v Canada (AG). This case concerns the second emergency protection order made under the SARA, which protects the western chorus frog. The western chorus frog is listed on the SARA's list of endangered species as a threatened species in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The emergency protection order prohibits excavation, deforestation and construction within a two km2 area in the municipalities of La Prairie, Candiac and St-Philippe, Quebec to protect the frog and its habitat. This order was the first time a SARA emergency protection order restricted development on private land.

As a result of the western frog order, Groupe Maison Candiac Inc. (""Groupe Maison"") was forced to reduce its residential development by 171 units after construction was already underway and Groupe Maison had obtained the requisite municipal and provincial approvals. Groupe Maison brought a judicial review of the emergency protection order by way of a constitutional challenge and an expropriation claim. The Federal Court dismissed the application, finding that: (1) section 4(c)(ii) of the SARA is within the federal government's jurisdiction over criminal law; and protected by the doctrine of ancillary powers, including jurisdiction over peace, order and good governance; (2) the western chorus frog order did not amount to expropriation that required compensation; and (3) the Parliament had already provided a mechanism for compensation under the SARA that applies in ""extraordinary circumstances.""

In 2017, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change received three petitions to recommend to the Governor in Council for an emergency order to protect the southern mountain woodland caribou population. The Minister conducted an Imminent Threat Assessment and, on May 4, 2018, determined that the southern mountain caribou faced imminent threats requiring intervention for recovery. An emergency protection order may be forthcoming for Alberta and British Columbia. The SARA public registry and the Canada Gazette will provide updates on this matter.

Alberta's Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (the ""EPEA"") is another environmental protection legislation that affects expropriation claims. As one of its purposes, the EPEA adopts the ""polluter pays"" principle to address contamination. The EPEA includes three regulatory mechanisms with respect to contamination: (1) Part 5 Division 1 concerns the release of substances generally; (2) Part 5 Division 2 concerns contaminated sites designation; and (3) Part 6 deals with conservation and reclamation. Further, the EPEA expressly acknowledges an affected person's recourse to court through private civil claims. Some of the key concepts related to the three regulatory mechanisms are considered below.

Part 5 Division 1 of the EPEA deals with the release of substances into the environment. Under section 112, the person responsible for the substance has the duty to take remedial measures with respect to any release of same. Environmental protection orders may also be issued to the person responsible for the substance where the release is causing, has caused or may cause an adverse effect.

The statutory definition of ""person responsible"" includes: (1) owner and previous owner of substance; (2) every person who has or has had charge, management or control of the substance; (3) successor, assignee, executor, administrator, receiver, receiver‑manager or trustee of (1) to (2); and (4) principal or agent of (1) to (3). The ""person responsible' excludes, unless they release new or additional substances: (1) a municipality in respect of land shown on its tax arrears list, or land acquired by it by dedication or gift of an environmental reserve, municipal reserve, school reserve, road, utility lot or right of way; (2) a person who investigates or tests the land for the purpose of determining the environmental condition of that parcel; and (3) the Minister responsible for the Unclaimed Personal Property and Vested Property Act, with respect to a parcel of land to which that Act applies. Thus, it appears that the notion of ""person responsible"" is based on one's relationship to the substance/release only, and not based on the cause of the release.

Part 5 Division 2 of the EPEA provides for the designation of contaminated sites. Under section 129 of the EPEA, the Director may designate a site as a contaminated site and issue an environmental protection order to a person responsible for the contaminated site. The Director must consider several factors before issuing an environmental protection order for a contaminated site, including: (1) due diligence of the owner or previous owner; (2) whether the presence of the substance at the site was caused solely by the act or omission of another person, other than an employee, agent or person with whom the owner or previous owner has or had a contractual relationship; and (3) the price the owner paid for the site and the relationship between that price and the fair market value of the site had the substance not been present.

The ""person responsible for the contaminated site"" means: (1) a person responsible for the substance that is in, on or under the contaminated site; (2) any other person who the Director considers caused or contributed to the release of the substance into the environment; (3) the owner of the contaminated site; (4) any previous owner of the contaminated site who was the owner at any time when the substance was in, on or under the contaminated site; (5) a successor, assignee, executor, administrator, receiver, receiver‑manager or trustee of a person referred to in any of subclauses (2) to (4); and (6) a person who acts as the principal or agent of a person referred to in any of subclauses (2) to (5). As was the case with Division 1, the definition of ""person responsible for the contaminated site"" again excludes municipalities and investigators. In this case, the test is based on the relationship to the substance/release and the property.

In practice, Division 2 is rarely used. Designation will only occur as a last resort when there are no other appropriate tools. There have only been five instances of designation of a contaminated site since 1993 and no environmental protection order appears to have been issued under Division 2. Division 2 offers options otherwise unavailable, including the allocation of responsibility to present and past site owners who may have contractually assumed liability for the pollution, remedial actions plans and agreements with the Director, and the apportionment of costs of remedial work among responsible parties. The Minister may also pay compensation to any person who suffers loss or damage as a direct result of the application of Part 5 Division 2.

Environmental contamination may affect the valuation of expropriated property. Under the Expropriation Act, compensation for expropriation is based on the market value of the expropriated land, which is in turn ""the amount realized if sold in the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer"", and provable damages. The determination of market value accounts for everything that is present in the site, except for the legislated exclusions found in section 45 of the Expropriation Act.

Contamination introduces issues in valuing expropriated property, given the uncertainty in liability exposure, scope, duration, risk and stigma. Below are some case law on the interaction between the expropriation of contaminated lands and the ""polluter pays"" principle.

In Toronto (City) v Bernardo, the respondent Bernardo was the registered owner of a property and permitted the corporate respondent's scrap metal business on property rent-free by oral licence to occupy. The City of Toronto served and published notice to expropriate property. The City conducted environmental testing on property which showed contamination, and was advised that clean-up costs for property could be in range of $250,000 to $750,000. The appraised value of the property was $242,500 before taking into consideration site remediation or clean-up costs. Given the estimated cost of remediation which exceeded value of land, the City's offer of compensation to the respondents was $1. The respondents did not request compensation hearing but refused to surrender possession. The City brought motion for order to take possession. The Ontario Supreme Court granted the City's motion as the respondents had the opportunity to contest the City's offer of compensation in proceedings before the Ontario Municipal Board and chose not to take any action to assert claims for compensation.

In Thompson v Alberta (Minister of Environment), the claimant had purchased land for the sum of $1 million. At the time of purchase, the land was not part of any property acquired by the Crown for a proposed transportation corridor. The Crown reviewed roadway plan within months of claimant's purchase and determined that land was a necessary part of the corridor. The Crown expropriated land for $1,025,000. The claimant brought action for increased compensation. The action was allowed in part. The claimant was granted $1,120,000. The Crown's valuation discounted the value of the property because of the unknown cost of filling or remediating a wetland (which is 50% of the property) for future residential development, which posed an economic challenge for a prospective purchaser. The Court found that the cost of remediation calculated by the Crown was based on premature assumption that land was to be developed in isolation with no possible cost sharing by adjacent developers. The Court, however, recognized that a discount must be applied for market value because of this possibility of remediation.

In Ville de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu c Cour du Québec, the subject property included a grocery store, snack-bar and a retail marina fuel distribution outlet for vessels navigating on Chambly canal, and a gas station for road vehicles. The issue before the Court was whether the costs of decontamination should be deducted from the compensation awarded for expropriation, based on the duty to remediate. It was argued that evidence demonstrated that there was a spill onto the neighbouring property, therefore the question as to cessation of activities no longer applied, and the mandatory provisions of the EQA regarding decontamination was triggered. The Tribunal Administratif du Québec (the ""TAQ"") ruled that the total remediation cost of $450,000 be paid by the owner of the property, 9092-9340 Québec Inc. (""9092"") and should be deducted from its expropriation indemnity award. The value of the expropriated property, after deduction of the decontamination costs, was established as being $31,000.

The Court of Quebec allowed the appeal, holding that the finding of the TAQ was unreasonable and profoundly unfair. Were it not for the expropriation, 9092 could have ceased its activity at its own time, negotiated with a willing purchaser and, based upon the projects of the purchaser, negotiated the decontamination works remaining according to the circumstances. The City deprived 9092 of its right to complete the decontamination work at the time that it deemed the most suitable to its interests and subject to conditions that would have been more favourable. By forcing 9092 to assume the costs of decontamination estimated by the City engineer, the TAQ deprived the owner of the quasi-totality of the value of the expropriated property. The City brought a judicial review application which was subsequently dismissed. The Court found that the systemic analysis undertaken by the Court of Quebec highlights the significant defects and the fragility of the TAQ ruling to assign full liability to 9092 for the estimated costs of decontamination of the property.

Case law suggests that the law is not blind to the causation of the contamination when evaluating the market value of an expropriated property that has been contaminated. Liability for the remediation of contaminated land in Alberta clearly rests with ""person responsible for the substance"" and, in the rare case of designated contaminated sites, ""person responsible for the contaminated site."" Liability for contamination does not run with the land in Alberta.

This leads to the question of what is the intent of the law in respect of a faultless landowner for the environmental depreciation of land in the expropriation context. The principles of statutory interpretation apply to deem the legislature as knowing all the law and the necessary statutory language to give effect to its intention. The EPEA and the Expropriation Act are meant to be interpreted harmoniously as a scheme in cases of expropriation involving contamination. The Expropriation Act is a remedial statute. Accordingly, it must be given a broad and liberal interpretation consistent with its purpose.

Currently, the right of a faultless landowner to recover from a ""person responsible"" remediation costs in civil claims (whether under the common law or the EPEA) is a chose in action. This chose in action does not appear to be considered in the calculation of market value in expropriation. In the new era of third-party litigation funding, a chose in action for remediation costs is a valuable element that may offset some or all of the discounts associated with contaminated land, even in an open market.

The incident, which took place in the city's Tolichowki area around three weeks ago, came to light after the woman lodged a complaint with the police and approached the media.

The accused, identified as Shareef, is said to be working as a principal in a school in Tolichowki area. Speaking to reporters, the woman said that the marriage took place on 6 January 2017 and everything was smooth for the first month.

""They didn't ask for any dowry before marriage, but still we gave whatever we could afford. A month into the marriage, he started torturing me asking what my family has given them. They used to beat me even when I was pregnant. My mother-in-law also used to thrash me. After the girl child was born around three months ago, the torture increased. Mentally they harassed me, till I started suffering from depression. Then they called my parents who brought me back home. I even had to get admitted to the hospital.""Victim

She also claimed that she had a strong suspicion that the accused was having an affair.

""Once I returned to my parent's house, he called me and pronounced triple talaq over the phone. Then a divorce declaration came home even though I pleaded with them not to do so. I want justice. I don't want him to ruin another woman's life in this manner,"" the woman added.

She also alleged that she was being intimidated and threatened ever since she approached the police and filed a complaint.

Speaking to the media, Inspector Manjula from the Central Crime Station (CCS) said, ""The woman approached us on 23 November. We offered to counsel the couple but the woman was determined that a case must be registered because she said she had undergone a lot of harassment. We registered a case and conducted an investigation.""

""We had served a notice to the husband, mother-in-law and father-in-law of the woman and they completed all the legal formalities. Last week, we learnt that the accused gave triple talaq to the woman over the phone. We are taking up investigation again and we will follow the law.""Manjula, Inspector

Instant triple talaq is interpreted as the Islamic practice of divorcing a woman by uttering the word 'talaq' thrice.

In August last year, in a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court had by a 3-2 decision struck down the centuries-old practice of instant triple talaq among Indian Muslims as unconstitutional, manifestly arbitrary and void in law. Two judges said that it should be up to the Parliament to pass a legislation bill to officially ban the practice.

However, the minority judgment concluded that ""talaq-e-biddat"" was a matter of personal law of Muslims that does not breach the Constitution's Article 25 (right to practice one's religion).

In September this year, an ordinance to make triple talaq a criminal offence had been passed. Earlier this week, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018, commonly known as the Triple Talaq Bill, was introduced in the Lok Sabha.

This bill makes giving triple talaq void and illegal, and is punishable by up to three years imprisonment for the man. The bill, if passed, makes it a penal offence.

""The bill was brought in as per the direction of the Supreme Court to protect the rights of Muslim women. Several Muslim women suffered due to instant talaq. This bill is in the nation's interest and constitutional,"" Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said before introducing the bill.

The government could not pass the bill in the Rajya Sabha during the previous monsoon session.

Sterlite Chief Executive Officer P Ramnath said after getting the TNPCB permission, it would take about two months for making the plant operational.

""We have already approached the TNPCB. As per the NGT order, they (TNPCB) have been given three weeks to renew the consent. We have also made our request to the TNPCB,"" he told reporters here.

The state government had, on May 28, ordered the TNPCB to seal and ""permanently"" close the mining group's copper plant following violent protests over pollution concerns.

On an appeal by the company, the NGT on December 15 quashed the order, holding that it was ""non-sustainable"" and ""unjustified"".

The state government had said it would file an appeal in the Supreme Court even as opposition parties faulted it for the development.

Ramnath claimed that the company had been receiving ""massive support"" from locals for reopening the plant.

""...we have been receiving massive support from (people of) around 15 villages,"" he said.

The CEO said around Rs 100 crore would be spent in Tuticorin towards funding infrastructure schemes, an offer the company's counsel made before the NGT during the hearing.

Saying that the plant was inaccessible for the past six months, Ramnath said, ""We have to be given permission to enter the premises. For the last 6 months, there has been no steps taken towards 'care and maintenance'...We will take some time...around two months(to reopen the plant).""

On December 15, the National Green Tribunal set aside the Tamil Nadu government order for closure of mining company Vedanta Ltd's sterlite copper plant at Tuticorin, which was at the centre of massive protests over alleged pollution, saying it was ""non sustainable"" and ""unjustified"".

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson A K Goel asked the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to pass a fresh order of renewal of consent and authorisation to handle hazardous substances, subject to appropriate conditions for protection of environment in accordance with law within three weeks from December 15.

The company said it had committed to undertake plantation of one million trees across the city (Tuticorin) and initiate a youth development scheme that includes employment, sports and entrepreneurship. Smart school, a world class hospital, desalination plant are among the slew of initiatives announced by Sterlite.

The green panel has said the company should spend within three years Rs 100 crore on welfare of inhabitants of the area.

The bench also suggested that the company take steps for safeguarding environment, like creating a dedicated website where the stakeholders can lodge their environment related grievances.

Earlier in April, TNPCB had rejected Sterlite's plea to renew the 'Consent To Operate' certification, saying the company had not complied with the stipulated conditions.Thirteen people were killed in police firing on May 22-23 and several injured after the protests against Sterlite turned violent in Tuticorin."

A special CBI court in Mumbai is likely to pronounce the verdict in the sensational Sohrabuddin Sheikh-Tulsiram Prajapati alleged fake encounter case of 2005 in which 22 persons, most of them policemen, are on trial.

The case has attracted much attention as BJP chief Amit Shah, who was Minister of State for Home in Gujarat at the time of the incidents, was one of the accused before being discharged in 2014. During the trial, as many as 92 prosecution witnesses turned hostile.

Most of the accused are junior-level police officials from Gujarat and Rajasthan. The court earlier discharged, for want of evidence, 16 of the 38 persons charge-sheeted by the CBI. These included Amit Shah, the then Rajasthan Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria, former Gujarat Police chief PC Pande and former senior Gujarat police officer D G Vanzara.

2. IPS Officer Rajnish Rai Suspended as CIAT Chittoor Principal

Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rajnish Rai has been suspended by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs for allegedly 'abdicating' his office as the IG and Principal of CRPF training school at Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh.

Rai, who had arrested DG Vanzara and two other IPS officers in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh alleged fake encounter case in 2007, was serving as inspector general and principal of the Counter Insurgency and Anti-Terrorism (CIAT) School of the Central Reserve Police Force.

Rai had been placed under suspension for 'unauthorised handing over the charge of IG and Principal, CIAT School, CRPF, Chittoor and abdication of office on November 30.'

Rai had earlier this year sought voluntary retirement with effect from November 30 after completing 50 years of age under the provisions of the All India Services (Death-Cum-Retirement Benefit) Rules, 1958, but the Centre rejected his request in October.

The Gujarat High Court issued notices to the state government and Director General of Police (DGP) over a petition filed by a woman, after she sought the court's direction to police to file a FIR against a woman police constable for duping her.

According to the petitioner, Nirmalakumari Rao, she had paid Rs 3 lakh to Anandiben Barot who is a constable at Dehgam police station, as the latter had promised the former success in Lok Rakshak Dal Exam last year.

However Rao failed the exam and when she demanded money from Barot, she became non responsive. Rao tried to file an FIR with Dehgam police but they refused. After running pillar to post with her complaint, Rao finally filed a petition in Gujarat High Court. Next hearing is scheduled for 29 December.

Pic/Sayyed Sameer Abedi

As part of the third leg of the Jiyo Parsi campaign, which aims to arrest the dwindling Parsi population, the Parzor Foundation on Thursday announced several financial incentives for members of the community. Termed as Jiyo Parsi Care, the initiatives would encourage senior citizens to take care of the children of Parsi couples and establish a symbiotic relationship within the community.

Speaking about the initiative, Sam Balsara, chairman of Madison World said they came up with the schemes based on the feedback they received from the community after the implementation of the second phase of the Jiyo Parsi campaign. ""As part of the feedback, people said, 'It's all very well for you to say have children, but who is going to look after them? Who will go to work to earn money? Who is going to pay their medical and school bills?' These schemes will be helpful. We will also try to address other issues that the community brings up in future,"" he said.

The first of the three schemes focuses on couples with a joint income of less than '15 lakh/year. They will be given an amount of '4,000 every month till the child turns eight, in case they need to put their wards in crèche. Senior members of the community were also being urged to take on the responsibility of looking after kids, for which they would be given an honorarium of '3,000 per child until he/she turns 10. Senior citizens, who live with their children and at least one grandchild, would get an assistance of '4,000 every month.

Actor Nauheed Cyrusi and Anton Zykov, a scholar of Zoroastrianism, among others, attended the event. The initiative has been set up in collaboration with an advertising agency, Madison BMB, the Bombay Parsi Punchayat and the Federation of Zoroastrian Anjumans of India.

Vedanta's Sterlite Copper on Thursday said that it is hopeful of beginning the production at its smelter plant in Tuticorin district of Tamil Nadu in the next two months.

It said that it has already approached the TNPCB (Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board) for its consent to reopen the plant based on the recent NGT order, which directed the Board to issue its consent in three weeks' time.

As part of NGT order as well to allay fears in the minds of common public at local level, Sterlite Copper also announced '100-crore investment in social infrastructure projects, including setting up of a new hospital, water desalination plant and youth skill development schemes, said P Ramnath, CEO, Sterlite Copper. ""We require at least 500 people to reassess and set the things right inside the plant to enable us to start production,"" he added.

Speaking to the reporters here, P Ramnath said: ""We will abide by the court order and we will fight our case through legal route only. We are even open to dialogue with the state government and others concerned in this matter. We are hopeful that the truth will prevail at the end and we are confident of reopening the plant in the next two months.""

""As compared to six months ago, now local public have understood the reality and have started supporting us to reopen the plant at the earliest. We have been continuously holding 'people connect' programme for the last six months and allayed the fears in their minds. We even took feedback and suggestions and their requests to proceed further in and around the plant site. Accordingly, we have embarked upon 5 initiatives, including setting up of a hospital, holding skill development programmes, planting millions of trees, desal plant to supply water to villages in and around the plant site and smart school to provide quality education,"" Ramnath said.

According to him, as ordered by NGT, the company has already set up a committee to monitor each and every project independently to ensure all developments take place at a faster place. ""We are waiting for the positive response from the state government,"" he said. Even if the state government moves SC against NGT order, we will fight it legally only, he said further.

Responding to volley of questions, Ramnath said, on an average the production loss per month is estimated to be around 30,000 tonne. ""The copper demand is growing at 9% per annum. Since our plant closed six months ago, the sulphuric acid cost has gone up three times from '3,000 a tonne to '12,000 a tonne.

Similarly, phosphoric acid price has gone up from '45,000 a tonne to '55,000 a tonne and imports of copper premium has increased from 12,000 tonne a month to 30,000 tonne a month. Over the years, the company has invested around '600 crore on the environmental aspects and the plant is boast of one of the best production technologies, he pointed out.

He further said that due to closure of our factory, nearly 4,000 direct and contract jobs are at lost and around 25,000 indirect jobs are at stake. Nearly 1,000 trucks plying in Tuticorin for transporting goods from our factory to various places, including Tuticorin port have been left in the lurch for want of job. Many downstream industries involved in power cables, motors, electrical fittings (which require copper as raw material) are all facing difficult times over the last few months.

Days after the National Green Tribunal ruled in favour of the company restarting operations, Vedanta Limited's Sterlite Copper has applied for a fresh 'Consent to Operate' from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for its Thoothukudi plant.

""We have already approached the TNPCB. The application has been submitted,"" Sterlite Copper CEO P. Ramnath told a press conference to list out the company's Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives and plans in Thoothukudi.

Mr. Ramnath said it would take about two months to get the plant up and running with adequate safety measures. ""We have to be given permission to enter the plant, so that we can take up care and maintenance [of equipment],"" he said.

As the company was preparing to set up a second plant in Thoothukudi, locals began protests and on the 100th day of protests 13 persons were killed in a police firing in May. The State sealed the plant, passed an order and claimed that it was shut permanently. Meanwhile, the NGT directed the TNPCB to issue renewal of the CTO within three weeks.

When asked about the State government's plans to approach the Supreme Court against the NGT judgment, he said ""the company will cross the bridge when it gets to it"".

On the rationale behind the NGT's judgment, Mr. Ramnath said the pollution control board had neither given clearance nor rejected the application for managing the hazardous waste at the plant.

""For five years, we have been applying for the hazardous waste authorisation. They kept getting back to us with just queries. They neither rejected it nor gave the authorisation,"" he said.

It is recognised that the power of the police to fulfil their functions and duties depends on public approval of their existence, actions and behaviour and on their ability to secure public respect. Key phrase above is the 'Public approval'. As society progressed, world waked up to the idea of modern policing. The very existence of Police as a separate entity having civilian functions can be traced back to 19th century. Unlike 'Metropolitan bobby' policing model prevailing in London that time, India( British blue-eyed colony) however could only manage to get Royal Irish constabulary policing system in place from its British masters.

The Indian model was designed to infuse fear and awe in the public. Whereas London model revolved around civilian policing which propounded "" Police is public and Public is police"". Former emphasised on Police being a Force, the regime force. Revolt of 1857 against British shook the very foundation of it's empire whose tremors reached up to Britain itself. Result was ""Indian police act 1861'' was introduced in India which stood prophetic even after 157 years. After attaining independence in 1947, minor changes were made to Police law in the forms of Bombay Police Act, Delhi Police Act etc, mostly they were replica of Indian police act 1861.

British Legacies prevalent

Institutionally, it is bizarre to govern the 21st century land and people by the 19th century laws. It brings a yawning gap between the reality and idealism. To cite few examples, laws like Indian Police Act 1861, Indian Penal Code 1860, Indian Evidence Act 1872 etc are still there on the hot seat of police and law governance. The criminal and civil laws have been amended now and then which in turn often breeds ad hocism as the amendment in the law caters to a particular case or situation setting aside the wider application. Being an ally of convenience and not conviction, the humongous growth of piecemeal amendments erode the stability of legal jurisprudence as laws are interrelated ,one change requires changes in other laws too. Section 25 of Indian Police Act 1861 defines responsibility for a police officer to obey lawful orders of his superior. The much bigger audience to whom he is responsible to and accountable to is common public. The narrow narrative of legal responsibility sometime defeats the much wider directive principle of Article 38 of the constitution( welfare state). Thomas Jefferson sounds right when he says"" when a man assumes public trust, he should consider himself a public property"".

Police Ailments

"" It is not that they can't see the solution. It is that they can't see the problem"". G.k Chesterton words seems apt. The best way to assuage popular disaffection is to first admit, yes the problem lies here. Then work on them. From culture of immunity and unaccountability, abuse of power to culture of impunity, problems are too many. Lack of autonomy is an initiator to the vicious cycle of despair, stress, low work efficiency, self estrangement, poor interpersonal relations, alienation and in extreme cases even suicide. Political interference in personnel administration of police make things worse through politicisation of police.

Nithari kaand, Jessica Lal cases highlight the rampant corruption practices in the system which aggravates the already growing trust deficit between citizenry and police. Poor service conditions on the other hand is a nightmare.

Overburdened police, more than 5 lakh vacancies, diversion of major chunk of troops for BandoBast ( VVIPs and politicians security)and Adm duties deprive police of their regular policing duties. Mostly they have no festivals, poor living conditions, family being away which all pile up to result into Bad policing.

Training has seldom dared to make pace with the changing times and modern crimes. Police constabulary has faced the worst burnt of inadequate training. More emphasis on physical aspect( Drill, PT etc) neglects the cognitive development which is of dire need in the streets of India. Cyber crimes, new ways of human trafficking, cruelty by intimate partner, persecution for dowry, insult to modesty etc need much more than a 400 meter sprint by a cop. Human rights education, e- education, making them tech savvy would be few steps to train them according to current demand of situations. Even to maintain status quo these days one has to move continuously with the background. Because ""If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change"".

Committees and commissions

Plethora of recommendations from Superabundance of committees has helped nobody except the members of the committees. In 1902 Frazer commission gave negative, oppressive, inefficient and terrifying picture of British police. Thanks to financial paucity, no committee was set up in stating years of post independent India. National Police Commission (NPC) was appointed in 1978 under chairmanship of Mr. Dharam Vira. NPC came up with 8 reports, main recommendations being- replace Indian Police Act 1861 by new one, set up 'State Security Commission' to act as one stop centre of policy making and entertaining complaints of common public against erring police officers, tenurial security of DGP ( 4 years), gradual separation in police wings dealing with law & order duties and crime investigation. Fall of government at the centre ensured putting of old recommendations in cold storage.

In 1995 Public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Prakash Singh and N.K Singh asked for the enforcement of NPC's recommendations. In reply to the Supreme Court, new government labelled NPC's recommendations as old and rather pressed for a new committee. Then started the game of committee committee.

The extended family of committees on police reforms- 1998 Julio Ribeiro committee, K. Padmanabhaiah committee, Kamal Nath committee set up to study 627 old recommendations, soli Sorabjee committee. Fate was same for all of them, one bogged down by another. People needed more on ground and less on paper. But no one found the ground. Someone has to tell that how much is too much. Implementing the suggestions can be life saving as, a wrong decision is not forever, it can be reversed. The losses from a delayed decision are forever; they can never be retrieved.

Reforms on the street

Civic action programmes, Police public meets, cricket matches etc all aim to have proximity of public with khakhi. But few men do it everyday, every moment singlehandedly without any budgetary support as a daily routine.The turmoil ridden state of J&K which has been on a boil for past three decades, has often witnessed the utmost cynicism in public eye for state officials. Man with a rank of Inspector General of Police ( IGP), and name Basant Rath(IPS) while discharging his duties as IG traffic J&K, implemented many committees recommendations of improving public trust, make public as active participants rather than passive recipients of services in administration. Such was a trust and hope story scripted by him and exhibited by his team that people used to surround him and click burst of selfies with him. Euphoria for a policeman was unprecedented. His approach having two ends, on one end it was,'Leadership by moving around'(His office being the macadamised floor and footpaths) and on other end it was Broken window approach (violation of traffic rules dealt strenuously and strictly. From women to school children, from an octogenarian to a toddler everyone started connecting to this public official. Result: challans increased tenfold, helmet sales soared, matadors overloading reduced, students allowed to travel on half fare, women to get priority seats in public transport. And seat belts got a hug from the car drivers at last.

Question arises why this 'Servant first approach' ( best ruler is, which is best ruled )could not be emulated by others at mass scale. Why did not he gave excuse of police reforms for his failures. Why he did not accuse the state for his lacunae. Presumably he had faith on himself and constitution of India. Much faith on the powers given by All India services, and extreme faith in people whom he served.

The way forward is every time state and government cannot be blamed for our inactions. Ultimately what matters is what you have done with the things at yours disposal. Esther Dyson puts it rightly,"" I think of who I am as what I have done"". There is no dearth of opportunity to do justice to one's job towards general public. Or other lane to dooms day is to wait for the gospel reforms which would turn the world upside down. Latter is an utopia. Because those gospel reforms again would need implementation. Time is ripe for action. Selfless Acton. Action for people of India. By the people of India.

On Police commemoration day this year, Prime Minister of India emotionally said"" words can never describe the valour and dedication of our Policemen, their bravery. Their sacrifice will always inspire us.""

Vedanta Group company Sterlite Copper says it expects to re-start its copper plant at Thoothukudi in southern Tamil Nadu (600 km from here) in the next two months, subject to various clearances and procedures.

The unit has been shut since March 27, first for maintenance and then due to orders from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB). Last Thursday, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) set aside the state government's later order to permanently close the unit, as not legally justified. Instead, it directed the Board to issue an order of renewal, subject to findings in three weeks, and asked the state government to restore electricity for the unit's operation.

Earlier, the state had said it would challenge the NGT order at the Supreme Court. The firm said it had been requesting the state to allocate another 300 acres for overall development of a green belt around the factory, and also for a second unit. The latter would, it said, attract Rs 25-30 billion in investment. ""We expect it would take two months, once we get entry into the plant. We will have to start every machine and assess the works required, and get the plant back into shape,"" said P Ramnath, chief executive office of Sterlite.

Around Rs 30 billion was spent on establishing the plant, which catered to 35-40 per cent of copper demand in India. Prices of copper in the country had risen by around 20 per cent following the closure, the company had told NGT.

The estimated production loss from closure has been around 30,000 tonnes of refined copper. Around 25,000 families were allegedly affected, as were downstream industries, he said. The company says its estimated daily loss has been around Rs 50 million. It has also pointed to a surge in prices of the products from there -- sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid and copper -- in the period. Import of copper had jumped, it says, from around 12,000 tonnes to 30,000 tonnes a month.

On Thursday, the company announced it would set up a hospital and a school in the district, and supply water to 15 villages, as part of Rs 1 billion to be spent for welfare of inhabitants in the region, as mentioned in the NGT order. The Tribunal has directed Vedanta to spend the amount over three years -- it had been suggested by the latter during the hearing.

The background is a series of protests by locals at pollution from the unit and the death of 13 persons in police firing during related violence (on May 22).

The company has also announced the planting of a million trees and a youth development scheme that includes employment, sports and entrepreneurship.

It has also implemented measures the judiciary suggested in a 2013 order, including a system to register emission levels, air quality systems and interlocks which would stop the entire manufacturing if sulphur dioxide emissions exceed permissible limits. The company has spent Rs 5-6 billion on implementing safety measures in the recent past, said the CEO.

The state government had said the unit should be closed for breaching environmental rules. It had alleged Sterlite did not present groundwater analysis reports or removed copper slag stored around the Uppar river or analysed parameters of heavy metals in the ambient air quality around the unit. The NGT rejected all these grounds."

""We have already approached the TNPCB. As per the NGT order, they (TNPCB) have been given three weeks to renew the consent. We have also made our request to the TNPCB,"" he told reporters here.

The state government had, on May 28, ordered the TNPCB to seal and ""permanently"" close the mining group's copper plant following violent protests over pollution concerns.

On an appeal by the company, the NGT on December 15 quashed the order, holding that it was ""non-sustainable"" and ""unjustified"".

The state government had said it would file an appeal in the Supreme Court even as opposition parties faulted it for the development.

Ramnath claimed that the company had been receiving ""massive support"" from locals for reopening the plant.

""...we have been receiving massive support from (people of) around 15 villages,"" he said.

The CEO said around Rs 100 crore would be spent in Tuticorin towards funding infrastructure schemes, an offer the company's counsel made before the NGT during the hearing.

Following the recent National Green Tribunal (NGT) directive to reopen the Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi, the company has reapplied with the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) for consent to operate (CTO).

If given permission, the company will be able to restart operations in two months after some basic maintenance work, said P Ramnath, CEO, Sterlite Copper. It's a a big 'if', as the State government has announced it will appeal against the NGT order in the Supreme Court.

In February, the TNPCB rejected the company's CTO application for 2018-2023 due to its alleged failure to comply with the conditions imposed at the time of the previous renewal of consent order. This was the start of a series of events that led eventually to the closure of the plant.

On May 23, the TNPCB ordered the closure of the Sterlite plant with immediate effect, and directed Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) to disconnect power supply to the unit. This came two days after 15 people were killed in police firing on anti-Sterlite protesters.

Speaking to newspersons here on Thursday, Ramnath said the first thing the company needs is permission to enter the premises to examine the plant and take up various maintenance works. ""Once done, we will be able to start the plant in two months,"" he said.

Asked if the TN government's stiff opposition would come in the way of reopening, he said: ""We will abide by the court decision. We heard that the State government plans to approach the Supreme Court against the NGT order. We will face that.""

The six-month shutdown of the plant has impacted various stakeholders, including the VOC Port, which saw a significant decline in cargo throughput, he said. The closure also hit over 1,000 truck operators, he said.

Ramnath also announced plans to invest ₹100 crore to set up a 'smart' school and a hospital in the port town of Thoothukudi. He further said the company proposes to turn Thoothukudi into a 'clean and green' city by planting one million trees.

It plans to set up a desalination plant that was originally planned five years ago at a cost of ₹150 crore but stalled due to non-availability of land."

A day before a special CBI court in Mumbai is scheduled to pronounce its verdict in the high profile case of fake encounters of Sohrabuddin Sheikh, wife Kauser Bi and his aide Tulsiram Prajapati, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has suspended Gujarat cadre IPS officer Rajnish Rai, who was the first investigator in the case, and had arrested three IPS officers as key accused.

Mr. Rai is a 1992 batch IPS officer of Gujarat cadre, and currently serving central deputation heading the Counter Insurgency and Anti-Terrorism (CIAT) School of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) at Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh.

His suspension comes after he sought voluntary retirement in August, and had reportedly written to the MHA that he may be considered deemed to have resigned from the service. The centre, however, had rejected his plea seeking VRS.

However, he had stopped attending office after applying for VRS. On the ground of his absence from the place of posting, his suspension order has been issued. He even challenged the MHA's order rejecting his plea for VRS before a Central Administrative Tribunal in Ahmedabad.

In its order, the MHA stated that disciplinary proceeding is contemplated against Mr. Rai in ""connection with his unauthorized handing over the charge of IG & Principal, CIAT School, CRPF, Chittoor and abdication of office on 30.11.2018."" The order also said that till the time he was under suspension, Mr. Rai would not leave Chittoor without the permission of the Director-General of CRPF.

The suspension order was delivered to Mr. Rai's residence in Vadodara. While receiving the suspension order, Mr. Rai marked his ""protest."" Mr. Rai wrote, ""The order of suspension by MHA, GOI is absolutely illegal and unconstitutional as I have retired from service as for operations of law and rules after office hours on on 30.11.2018.""

Way back in 2007, as DIG in the CID (crime) in Gujarat, Mr. Rai arrested three IPS officers -- D.G. Vanjara and Rajkumar Pandian of Gujarat cadre and Dinesh M.N. of Rajasthan cadre as key accused in the fake encounter case.

The case was subsequently transferred to the CBI by the Supreme Court, which also shifted its trial from Gujarat to Maharashtra considering high profile accused top police officials and also politicians.

However, all IPS officers and politicians who were charged in the case have been discharged by the trial court at various stages and now only lower level policemen are standing trial for which the court's verdict is scheduled to be pronounced on December 21 in Mumbai."

Harvard is fighting a claim that it illegally limits the number of Asian-Americans it accepts. The lawsuit, grinding on since 2014, seeks to stop the oldest and richest college in the US from considering race altogether. It may reach the newly composed Supreme Court, whose conservative justices could tip the balance against affirmative action in college admissions for decades to come.

The suit was filed by Students For Fair Admissions, or SFFA, led by affirmative action opponent Edward Blum, and accuses Harvard of ""racial balancing.""

Each side submitted its ""findings of fact and conclusions of law"" Wednesday--essentially, their view of the facts and the legal conclusions they believe the judge should reach. Here are highlights.

SFFA's side

Harvard's admission system ""imposes an Asian-American penalty,"" a statistical analysis by expert witness Peter Arcidiacono shows. The resulting ""stark racial disparity"" is at odds with the expert's statistical analysis, which shows that Asian-Americans are the strongest in Harvard's applicant pool both academically and by an extracurricular rating.

""White applicants are admitted at a higher rate than Asian-Americans in every academic decile,"" suggesting that ""Asian-Americans are being penalized vis-a-vis whites with similar qualifications."" Harvard gives preference to athletes and to the children of alumni, donors and faculty, disproportionately benefiting ""white and wealthy applicants.""

Harvard's side

SFFA failed to show that even a single Asian-American ""had been rejected on the basis of his or her race or ethnicity,"" and conceded that in some categories Asian-Americans are admitted at higher rates than white applicants with similar attributes.

Lacking evidence of ""racial animus,"" SFFA has relied almost wholly on its own statistical analysis, ""entirely rebutted by the analysis of Harvard's expert, which showed no statistically significant effect of Asian-American ethnicity on admissions.""

In 1,591 pages of admissions files, SFFA identified only two handwritten notes describing Asian-American applicants as ""quiet,"" a term the plaintiff argued revealed bias and stereotypical thinking. SFFA ""brought this suit against Harvard, the very institution whose race-conscious admissions practices the Supreme Court has repeatedly identified as a model of legality,"" because ""its ultimate grievance is with those precedents.""

The development comes less than a week after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) set aside the Tamil Nadu government's order, clearing the way for the reopening of the copper unit.

""Our plant has not been under maintenance for over five months. We are still awaiting permission to enter the plant. Once that is granted, it will take about one to two months for the company to begin its operations,"" Ramnath said.

In the wake of the police firing on 22 and 23 May that killed 13 people protesting against the plant's shutdown, the state government ordered a permanent closure of the copper smelting unit.

On Saturday, while passing its order, the NGT directed the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to pass fresh order of renewal of consent and authorisation to handle hazardous substances, ""subject to appropriate conditions for protection of environment in accordance with law within three weeks from today."" ""The appellant will also be entitled to restoration of electricity for its operations,"" the tribunal said.

Terming the closure ""unjustifiable"", the tribunal also directed Vedanta to spend Rs 100 crore over the next three years for Thoothukudi's ""welfare activities.""

Sterlite Industries also announced Rs 100-crore investment on ""infrastructure plans for Thoothukudi district,"" including planting of 1 million trees, construction of school, hospital, desalination plant and other youth development schemes.

Replying to a question on allegations against the Vedanta group's public relations agency that it had accessed a draft of the NGT verdict before it was pronounced by the tribunal on 15 December, Ramanth claimed that the company was not aware of the same.

Fatima Babu, a Thoothukudi based environmental activist lodged a complaint on Monday, with the Delhi Police, alleging that ""a document titled 'Final Order of VEDANTA DRAFT ORDER - 15.12.2018.docx' was in circulation in the media from around 1 pm on 15.12.2018, whereas the official order was only uploaded after 1.30 pm.""

Meanwhile, Opposition parties, including Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), will stage protests in Thoothukudi on Friday demanding the permanent closure of Sterlite Industries. The Opposition has also been pressurising the state government to convene the assembly and take a policy decision on the shutdown of the copper unit.

On its part, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government in Tamil Nadu has decided to move the Supreme Court challenging the NGT order."

He underscored that it was Gandhi's leadership under which the Congress recently won Assembly elections in three states.

Amarinder Singh also targeted the Akalis for allegedly exploiting religious sensitivities to garner electoral support, as he asked Badal to ""stop politicising"" such a sensitive issue.

""Misusing religion for political gains will not yield any dividends for the SAD and would backfire on the party in the Lok Sabha elections, as it had done in the 2017 Assembly polls,"" Amarinder said in a statement in Chandigarh.

The chief minister said that while those who had any role in spreading mayhem against the Sikh community deserved to be punished and should pay for their crimes, it was ""irrational"" to try and drag the Congress party as a whole, or the innocent Gandhi family, into the case.

""Rahul was a school-going child and Rajiv Gandhi was away in West Bengal at the time of the violence,"" Amarinder Singh said.

""Criminals have no religion and are not affiliated to any political party,"" he said, adding that all those responsible for perpetrating the violence in the wake of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's assassination will ""pay"" for their crimes.

Amarinder Singh hailed the court for sentencing former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar to life term, and expressed confidence that others guilty of the heinous crime will also be ""paid back in the same coin"".

Reacting to the court verdict convicting Kumar, SAD chief Badal had said Congress's hand in the ""massacre"" of innocent Sikhs in the 1984 ""genocide"" had been proven beyond doubt with the Delhi High Court convicting (former) senior Congress leader and Gandhi family's ""right hand man"" in the anti-Sikh riots case.

Amarinder Singh hit back at the Akali leader, saying: ""If Sukhbir was really concerned about punishing the guilty, why had he never raised the issue of the 22 RSS/BJP workers named in the FIR registered in the case at Tughlaq Road police station.""

The Congress, including Rahul Gandhi, had never raised this issue as they believed that criminals had no political ideologies or affiliations, the chief minister said.

It will augment the existing training mechanism with online module-based training coupled with certification. This will make training inputs available to government servant on site and on flexitime basis. The initiative aims at ""Competent Civil Services for Good Governance"". He also launched Hybrid Course on Administrative Laws developed by DoPT in collaboration with the premier law school, National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru.

On the occasion, RTI Portal on Judgments/Orders of Supreme Court, High Courts and CIC, was also launched that will provide a learning environment for all stakeholders under which a repository on the landmark cases on the RTI will be available at one place.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that Ministry of Personnel has undertaken various initiatives in the last four and a half years. He said that the launch of these initiatives on the eve of Good Governance Day shows Government's commitment to 'maximum governance, minimum government'. He also spoke about the initiatives taken by DARPG. He added that the number of grievances has increased due to prompt response of the Department. But awareness needs to be generated in society about grievance disposal mechanism, he added. He said that during the last four years, the participation of districts has increased in the Civil Services Day awards, which has transformed the whole process. Commenting on the RTI Portal on Judgments/Orders of Supreme Court, High Courts and CIC, he said that this is an extension of online RTI mechanism that is available to the users. Speaking on the improvements made by DoPT in the training programmes, the Minister said that the training programmes of India are now being acknowledged worldwide. He further said that 'Anubhav' initiative of the Ministry is a good base for research activities and now the department is in the process of preparing a manual based on these write-ups. The Minister also urged the state Governments to adopt these initiatives towards good governance and improved training techniques.

The DoPT Secretary Dr C. Chandramouli said that the launch of the initiatives today is yet another milestone which aims at capacity building of Government officers. He said that appropriate training is of vital importance for public service delivery. This online programme is a part of overall 'Digital India' flagship programme of the Government. The DoPT will encourage and keep adding more programmes to this platform, he added.

Secretary, DARPG & Pensions, Shri K.V. Eapen said that Department of Pensions has taken several initiatives for the benefit of pensioners such as organising First Pension Adalat, root cause analysis of the grievances and issuing Digital Life Certificates etc. He said that recently many changes have been incorporated in National Pension System (NPS) based on the recommendations of a committee of Government.

iGOT (Integrated Government Online Training Programme)

The National Training Policy-2012 mandates that all civil servants will be provided with training to equip them with the competencies for their current or future jobs. The current structure of training for Government servants including domestic and foreign training is mostly available to very small section of the government servants. However, consequent upon some recent initiatives undertaken by Department of Personnel and Training, Government of India aimed at providing training to cutting edge level functionaries in the Central/State Governments, significant changes have taken place. The outreach of the existing training setup is very limited in view of the large workforce employed in various States/UT Governments. The Integrated Government Online Training Programme (iGOT) launched by Minister will augment the existing training mechanism with online module-based training coupled with certification. This will make training inputs available to government servant on site and on flexitime basis. Furthermore, the training will be focussed and targeted to the requirement of the officials.

The e-Learning mode provides unparalleled opportunities for training to a large number of civil servants scattered all over the country. The latest technologies make available vast resources of learning material and online courses, providing the individuals enormous choices and flexibility in learning. The online training programme through Massive Online Open Courses mechanism would be a platform to bring together the numerous Government and other training institutions for providing a single point of access to the repository of training resources. This will provide a broad training eco-system creating synergies across various premier training institutes of the country and will cater to the training needs which can encompass all the officials in the entire hierarchy of Central and State Governments. This platform will ultimately build a large training eco-system. The training courses under this programme will be accessible through DoPT's web portal. Among the bouquet of Training Courses on offer through this initiative are those offered by MIT, USA too. DoPT has collaborated with JPAL, South Asia and MIT, USA to launch MITx Micro Master Programmes for the government servants.

Hybrid Course on Administrative Laws

The DoPT, realising the need for training inputs in Administrative Laws, has collaborated with the premier law school, National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru to develop and offer Long Term Diploma programme and Short Term Courses in these areas. The courses to be delivered by NLSIU have been launched by Minister today.

RTI Portal on Judgments/Orders of Supreme Court, High Courts and CIC

The Right to Information (RTI) Portal on Judgments/Orders of Supreme Court, High Courts and CIC has been developed by Institute of Secretariat Training and Management (ISTM), New Delhi. This Portal will provide a learning environment for all stakeholders under which a repository on the landmark cases on the RTI will be available at one place. The Portal also makes available the gist of the replies given by Central Public Information Officers (CPIOs), First Appellate Authorities as well as the Supreme Court. It will be helpful in learning the latest trends of implementation of RTI Act as the judgments/orders given by Central Information Commission, High Courts and Supreme Court are always a crucial source to track the developments on this subject.

For over a century, they have been seeking adequate space to bury their dead but their struggle shows no signs of coming to an end.

P Ramalingam, a 70-year-old resident of Kazhuperumpakkam Colony in Vanur taluk, says that the fight for a new cemetery began during his grandfather's time and has continued to this day, with his grandsons now taking it up. ""Many years ago, our forefathers settled here as farmhands. During that period, the landlords had given us 12 cents of land on the western side of the village to be used as a burial ground. Today, there are 300 families residing here and there is not much space left,"" says Ramalingam.

As this small piece of land has run out of space, the Dalits have been petitioning officials and politicians one after the other to allocate a new burial ground for them. Of course, they can't even imagine asking for the right to bury their dead in the common burial ground of the village - it is a well-settled norm in most villages in Tamil Nadu that Dalits needs to be segregated even in their deaths, with separate burial grounds for them and for caste Hindus.

Recently, officials have started the process to lay a new road to the old cemetery, despite the Dalits telling them that there is no space left there. The Dalits have instead been seeking the allocation of a small portion of the poramboke land in the village as a burial ground for them. This seems to have put them in conflict with the caste Hindus of the village, some of whom have built buildings on the land.

""We are demanding a new cemetery in the poramboke land, which measures more than three acres. We just need some space in that. We have been demanding this for more than a hundred years but a few years ago, some caste Hindu people built a few houses and a shop, and are now opposing the cemetery in that poramboke land,"" said M Ramani, a resident of Kazhuperumpakkam Colony.

She said that government officials had promised a peace meeting last week to settle the issue between them and the caste Hindus. But until Monday, there was no communication from them.

When Express contacted a revenue official in charge of the region, he said, ""We found that one person of the same village, who is a caste Hindu, has constructed his house near the poramboke land, where the villagers are demanding a cemetery. He has got a stay order from the Madras High Court against allocating the land for the cemetery. Due to this, we couldn't allocate the land for this purpose. As an alternative solution, measures are being taken to acquire land to lay a proper path to the old cemetery.""

He promised that work to pave a path for the old cemetery will be started within a week, as the paperwork was already underway. However, villagers said that laying a road to the old cemetery will be of no use as there is not much space left there and demanded that the district administration take action to solve the issue in court, and get the poramboke land for their cemetery.

The Dalits say with 300 families now in the Kazhuperumpakkam Colony, the old cemetery is hardly adequate and it had always been an ordeal whenever one of them dies. The areas surrounding the old cemetery have, over time, been cultivated with casuarina, making it difficult for villagers to carry out the funeral procession. ""Most of the time, farmland owners, who are caste Hindus, water the land deliberately when a Dalit villager dies, forcing us to walk in the mud,"" said Muthukannu, another villager. It becomes even worse during rainy days.

Muthukannu says there is a government school nearby. The teachers in the school have to send their students home when there is a body to be cremated because the fumes engulf the premises.

When a body is cremated (some Dalit families perform cremation as per their beliefs), around five people usually circle the body, ready with bucketfuls of water in case the fire spills over to the casuarina trees of the nearby farm. With the lack of adequate lighting, it is also imperative that the body is buried or cremated before dark.

Villagers added that they had submitted a petition to the collector three weeks ago after which revenue department officials and Vanur constituency MLA M Chakrabani visited the spot. Villagers had blockaded them and demanded a new cemetery."

She also alleged verbal abuse and harassment by policewomen of Dindigul AWPS during inquiry.

However, when asked about the administration of the oral pill, GRH Dean (in-charge) Dr S Shanmugasundaram denied the possibility of the girl being administered oral abortion pills.

On Tuesday, a division bench, comprising justices R Subbiah and B Pugalendhi, pointed out that according to medical experts, the gestation period had crossed 30 weeks and, therefore, it was unsafe for the girl to terminate the pregnancy.

Further, after the birth of the child, if the minor girl's family was not inclined to nurture the child, the court directed the baby be given for adoption under the Cradle Baby Scheme or any such scheme.

State Home Secretary was directed to pay Rs 5 lakh compensation to the minor girl within four weeks, and the State was ordered to bear all hospitalisation expenses of the victim till delivery of the child.

However, in the report submitted by medical experts, it was stated that the risk to the girl's life was equally high in case of abortion as well as continuation of the pregnancy. When time was of essence, with every passing day being crucial for the life of the girl as well as the foetus, there was an unexplained delay in the manner the case was conducted.

A day after the order was passed, the girl's mother said that though they were given constant hope that the foetus could be terminated successfully, they were utterly failed by the judicial system through the delay.

""She was less than 24-weeks pregnant when admitted to the GRH on October 31 for pregnancy termination,"" said the mother.

At GRH, she was prescribed two doses of an abortion pill used to medically terminate foetus about seven weeks (50 days) old.

""On November 2 evening, the girl was given the first dose of the pill and was asked to take the next dose on Sunday morning. In the meantime, the GRH police were informed about the incident and subsequently, a case of sexual assault under POCSO Act was registered against the 70-year-old man, who committed the crime. However, the second dose was not given since the Dindigul Taluk police arrived at the hospital for inquiry on Saturday night,"" narrated the mother.

However, the fact that the girl was given one dose of the abortion pill at GRH was suppressed in the court, which otherwise could have fast-tracked the legal proceedings at Madurai Bench that went on from November 23 to December 18, she alleged. She claimed that had there been no delay, safe termination of the foetus could have been done.

The mother of the minor girl also alleged verbal abuse and harassment by the police at Dindigul All Women Police Station (AWPS).

""When I was at the police station for an inquiry last month, the personnel spoke ill of my daughter's character, subjecting her to character assassination, thus adding to my mental agony,"" she complained.

Also, the mother alleged that she was asked by the school authorities to obtain a Transfer Certificate (TC) from the private school in Dindigul where her daughter studies on grounds of ill repute to the school."

Carrying charts and banners which bore anti-Sterlite messages, 10 members belonging to a student organization based in Thoothukudi arrived near the Press Club around 11 am on Thursday.

A police team rounded them up and took them to the station. A police official said that the students loudly started shouting slogans when they were being taken. While three of the 10 members were school students, rest were arts and engineering graduates.

Police officials who had received information about the students' plan were stationed at the spot in advance to detain them.

Forced as a ""Money Bill"", which can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha (Rajya Sabha cannot make amendments to such bills), Aadhaar Bill, 2016 passed the Parliament amidst heated debates. Opposition members had raised concerns on the privacy of individuals following enactment of the law.

What is all this fuss about Aadhaar, anyway? It's just a twelve digit number, you may say. But with that same number, the government (and probably, some foreign entities) can know about your personal details such as mobile number, date of birth, residential address, the amount of money in your savings accounts, the loans you have availed, PAN, the income tax you pay, stocks you own, provident fund details, the land you own, the vehicle you drive, your life insurance policies, and on and on and on.

Based on this data, the government (or a foreign organisation) can get a pretty detailed picture of who you are. It can profile you by the places you travel, the food you eat, the movies you watch, your political views, and through many other instances. Based on this, the state can practically map out your thoughts. Add Artificial Intelligence into it, and voila, the government can, with reasonable accuracy, ""predict"" what you do next! Sounds like Big Brother on steroids? In a few years, we may well find ourselves in such a scenario.

Are there any analogues of this kind anywhere in the world? Not by a long shot. In the US, all citizens and immigrants on a work visa have a Social Security Number (SSN), a nine-digit unique identity linked to your name, without biometric data. And SSN is not mandatory for availing many services, the way it is being done in India right now.

Though the recent Supreme Court judgment on Aadhaar in September has made it ""not mandatory"" for linking Aadhaar with services such as mobile numbers, bank accounts, school admissions and entrance exams, many operators and authorities are still insisting on Aadhaar.

A writ petition has been filed in the Supreme Court by renowned rights activist Dr Kalyani Menon Sen on the grave privacy implications of Aadhaar. She shares, ""One of UIDAI's certified contractors is US-based L-1 Identity Solutions, whose officers have served in the Intelligence agencies of US. An Indian citizen's data can be transmitted to a foreign government, compromising India's sovereignty, national security and severely undermining the privacy and autonomy of individuals.""

Recently, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Chairman RS Sharma threw a challenge and tweeted his Aadhaar number, asking if it had made him vulnerable. A French security expert who goes by the Twitter handle @fs0c131y was able to get his address, date of birth and alternate phone number, before tweeting back to Sharma and cautioning him.

A paper 'Biometrics and its impact in India' released by Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), an arm of RBI, points out, ""Thanks to Aadhaar, for the first time in the history of India, there is now a readily available single target for cyber criminals as well as India's external enemies. In a few years, attacking UIDAI data can potentially cripple Indian businesses and administration in ways that were inconceivable a few years ago. The loss to the economy and citizens in case of such an attack is bound to be incalculable.""

The project was initially conceived for Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, and then slowly morphed itself to become 'mandatory' in every aspect of our lives. Is Aadhaar doing a good job in DBT? As per reports across various publications, on the contrary, it has been the cause of various starvation-related deaths due to lack of ration provided to the poor (ostensibly due to lack of Aadhaar, failure in biometric authentication, and a host of other reasons).

As per news reports, bank officials are given targets to link 15 to 20 accounts with Aadhaar every day. Their incentives and promotions are linked to such targets.And after more than 90 percent Indians have enrolled for Aadhaar and have given it away to numerous service providers, UIDAI has launched its Aadhaar virtual ID scheme, which many experts say is just hogwash. The virtual ID enables you to generate a random 16-digit number mapped to your Aadhaar number which can be used with service providers.

Jean Dreze, a former member of UPA's National Advisory Council, quoted, ""The first lie was that Aadhaar is a voluntary facility. Today, we know that this was just doublespeak. Soon it will be virtually impossible to live in India without Aadhaar."" And Shyam Divan, a senior advocate practising in the Supreme Court, quoted Aadhaar project as an ""electronic leash"" to keep people under control.

The time may soon come when Aadhaar is asked for booking domestic and international flight tickets, rail tickets, booking movies online, at apparel stores, hypermarkets, etc., all in the name of providing ""speedy services"" and for improving ""customer experience and convenience"".

Once upon a time, a few frogs were put in a pot of water hung over a flame. As the water got warmer by the minute, the frogs kept adjusting to the environment, until they were boiled alive. We are those frogs."

The NSS has been vocal against the State government for trying to implement the Supreme Court verdict allowing the entry of women of all ages into the Sabarimala temple."

Dear Barkha

Thank you for your 'support', but alas much like the gifts of the gods in Greek tragedies, your support comes with double-digit compound interest, which you make clear through your piece -- that your positions are based on reciprocity. I, therefore, reject your support, which I never sought in the first place.

The only person this exposes as a hypocrite is you. Additionally, this demonstrates that you are utterly clueless about policy issues, legal principles, systems and context across the world. How can someone who pens such an infantile piece and could legitimately star in the sequel to 'Clueless' ever become a 'top journalist'?

Let's start with human rights. See Barkha, after the Niira Radia episode, and your article in ThePrint on me, I do understand that you consider positions taken by a journalist as being based on quid pro quo - 'you support me, I support you'. I, on the other hand, regard it to be unethical. Unlike you, who arrives at a position based on kitty party gossip, I actually research and read about anthropological trends and back my positions up with solid statistics.

Also read: What if Barkha Dutt had joked about Konark Temple's erotica instead of Abhijit Iyer Mitra?

Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are despicable organisations, who have wreaked havoc on millions of lives through their calling for and support of regime change operations. I've written about it here. But since reading is not your forte, let me make another attempt.

Let's start with the quarter of a million (some say up to 700,000) civilians who died as result of the US invasion of Iraq, based on exaggerated literature on atrocities provided by these groups.

Not content with the havoc they wreaked there, they've continued to provide similar justifications in Libya and Syria, and essentially acted as an enabler of interventions by the US.

You may schmooze with these high society enablers of horrific mass strife over glasses of Dom Perignon, but sadly their support for my freedom doesn't absolve them. Do you know how NGO funding works? Why every problem has to be overstated, so that funders will cough up money? Why a regime change operation boost NGO funding as it is seen as 'concrete policy influence'? No? Clueless about that as well?

Tell me Barkha, in your unwatchable, giggly, school girl interview of Hillary Clinton, why didn't you haul her over the coals for Libya? Thousands killed and a stable society completely destroyed as a result of her command responsibility I guess is not as important to you as her fight for gender rights?

Second, while you were spewing uninformed, semi-literate hot air, my Right-wing friends were busy working quietly behind the scenes to have me released. That they sought no acknowledgement or public recognition shows they actually cared about what happened to me, as opposed to your worthless, narcissistic, public posturing. Guess what? It was those covert interventions and not your 'support' that ensured I was treated well and initiated the process of the Odisha government dropping charges against me. But I guess after covering the political beat for over two decades you still haven't figured out how this country works, says more about your undeserved 'celebrity' status than it does about my hypocrisy.

Yes Barkha, I'm not a victim, and, I never will adopt the professional victimhood you seek refuge in so often. Let's take your quote of my tweet about Gauri Lankesh. The first in that series was about how she had been convicted by a court of law for printing fake news, and yet she got a state funeral, involving expensive sandalwood, a gun salute, and was draped in the flag. This was while people like you were going hammer and tongs at Jayant Sinha for garlanding undertrials, not convicts, in a cow lynching case. One of your ilk challenged me and I replied that lynch mobs were spurred on by fake news of the kind Gauri spread. Clueless? Barkha, do try reading up on the mentality of pogroms and how they're spread by rumour mongering in pre-industrial societies. Incidentally, the court did hold that Gauri Lankesh did not take 'due care' before publishing articles, enough to merit a conviction. Just so you know 'intent' is a critical element of conviction in Indian and Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence.

I do remember the name of Lois Sofia, but do you remember the names of Vinod Mehta, Yogesh Kumar Sheetal and Chaitanya Kunte? See Barkha, with Sophia, what you fail to mention is, I posted the sections of the DGCA rules that clearly mark her actions in an aviation zone as prosecutable in no uncertain terms, punishable for upto a year, and I supported her right to call Narendra Modi a fascist, just not create a ruckus and intimidate a passenger in a high-security area. Curiously, it seems you tried to get Yogesh hounded out of IIMC for precisely the same reason. The difference was that Yogesh was sloganeering against you in a place where he had every right to, while Sophia was doing so in a high security, restricted space where the laws against disorderly behaviour are clear, and ruthlessly enforced for good reason since 9/11. But then again, your inability to absorb the nuances of any kind of law, leave alone security, shines through.

Your alleged 'insights' are simply phantasmagoria generated by those 'reciprocity' deals you, by your own admission, love so much. If you had, indeed gone through my timeline, you'd have seen me oppose my Right-wing friends and support the Congress' right to abuse the Prime Minister, and on many occasions support outrageously provocative tweets against Hindu gods, simply because they had not called for violence in any way. You also, in your usual Goebbelsian way, left out that I called for machine-gunning Ram Rahim's supporters when they rioted post his conviction, and asked for the same for ""Lefty scum"" who were engaging in violence. You see Barkha, try reading Steve Pinker, or Yuval Harari, or Ian Morris for real knowledge on how the states' monopoly on violence and its use in the long run produces stable, free societies when paired with disruptive industrialisation.

Now, try googling the word 'segue'. It's what I used in the Karnataka assembly case of sentencing editors to jail to draw attention to Kashmiri newspaper editors inciting and, in some cases, giving meeting points and times in code to stone pelters. But I don't expect you to get it. But what rankles me is that in addition to your research skills being so poor, you also seem to think journalists must be above the law, no matter how fatal their actions and how transparent their collusion.

You see Barkha, unlike you, I have only tweeted for prosecution against violence or genocide denial, but never coupled my tweets with legal action. Far more advanced democracies like France and Germany actually have laws against such genocide denial, and in the US the Anti Defamation League uses civil suits in the absence of genocide denial laws. Your verbal protests, on the other hand, were accompanied by actions - not against actions but against speech. Mine weren't. Who's the free speech supporter and who the hypocrite now, eh?

Also read The most undeserving man is on his way to becoming a free speech martyr in India

As for your deliberate attempt to solicit pity and make everything about yourself by asking ""what would happen if I did this?"", well sorry to disappoint you, but 'absolutely nothing'. Given that you weren't even summarily investigated for your telephone conversations during Radiagate that supposedly tried to help those seeking to influence government formation, or when you allegedly outed positions during army operations, we know that whatever else would have happened to you, it wouldn't be jail. In all likelihood, some no-name Twitter bots would have made less than credible threats, which, given your modus operandi, you would have taken to town and won some kind of international victimhood award as you tried to do with my arrest.

But I realise now that you're not evil, you're simply an utter mediocrity, desperately trying anything to stay relevant. I truly misjudged you, and for that, I apologise profusely. You don't deserve my or anybody else's malice. You deserve our pity, you're not a bad person, just a failing, flailing megalomaniac.

'This needs a greater amount of investigation, research and mapping in the country.'

Mohammed Dilawar, the ornithologist known as India's sparrow man, is happy that Rajinikanth's latest movie 2.0 highlights the issue of birds and how cell phone tower radiation affects their existence.

""The movie has highlighted the importance of birds's lives and I am sure people across the country will take this issue seriously in future because Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar have highlighted the importance of birds to our lives,"" Dilawar tells Rediff.com's Syed Firdaus Ashraf.

2.0 shows that birds are dying because of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from cell phone towers. How far is it true?

There has been research done abroad which says there is some kind of impact on birds due to cell phone towers. I was part of a committee that looked into this issue 10 years ago.

The committee was constituted by the ministry of environment and forests to find out the impact of cell phones on birds, bees and wildlife in India.

A lot of literature review was done then and it was found that the decline of sparrows in cities is not only because of cell phone towers. There are other reasons also, like lack of food and pesticides which led to a decline in the number of sparrows.

as a scientist I would not comment on it until detailed research is done, in which mapping of cell phone towers and bird population is done across the country.

So your report was not conclusive in stating that cell phone tower radiation was the only reason for the decline in the bird population.

There is no long-term study being done in India on this issue. Also, in India, there are various variables which differ from one region to other region.

For example, the bird density, the kind of landscape that we have and the kind of technology which we use (differs from region to region), but certainly electromagnetic radiation or EMR is a kind of pollution which is invisible.

You cannot see it the way you see smog in Mumbai or Delhi or, for that matter, water pollution where water changes colour.

Is there anywhere in the world where research has found that birds are dying because of cell phone tower radiation?

It is not exactly about death, but about impact.

For example, research by Ruiz-Martinez in Spain concluded that as the radiation of cell phone towers increase, the bird population decreases.

As the human population decreases, bird population increases.

So the number of cell phone towers with 4G technology might certainly impact the lives of birds, and of humans. This needs a greater amount of investigation, research and mapping in the country.

Is it true that bird eggs get deformed because of cell phone tower radiation?

Electromagnetic radiation might affect egg formation at times, but again, they are the same set of radiation which is there in a microwave oven.

With 4G technology coming in, we need to have a greater study and understanding about this issue.

Is no one interested in studying this even after 10 years of your research?

Unfortunately, the issue of electromagnetic radiation has not got due justice.

As a scientist, whether it impacts birds, humans or not is a totally different story, but at least we have to carry out a study and find out whether the electromagnetic radiation is within permissible limits or not.

The cell phone tower association says it is always within permissible limits.

As a scientist, I say that we need to have a complete mapping of electromagnetic radiation in the country. If it is in permissible limit that is wonderful, but there always has to be measurement.

How we have various measurements in metros to measure air quality and the moment particulate matters of pollution rises the alarm bill rings in a city. People try to solve problems of pollution by, say, starting an odd and even day car system in Delhi.

This kind of monitoring must also be done for electromagnetic radiation as it is an emerging pollutant which is invisible.

Lots of times the common man is not aware that electromagnetic radiation is also under the pollution category.

Is there any study in India which says the bird population is decreasing because of cell phone tower radiation?

The population of birds has been steadily decreasing across the landscape of the world. But this is for various reasons, like habitat destruction, increasing number of bird catchings, etc.

In fact, if you google you will find out that we have lost 80 percent of wildlife and birds in the last 60 years.

Electromagnetic radiation is also one of the reasons just like micro plastic found in water. At this point in time habitat destruction is also due to poor water quality.

Why is serious thought not given to this issue?

It is because EMR is invisible pollution.

It is like out of sight, out of mind, even if there are various citizens groups in India like by actress Juhi Chawla who is running a campaign against cell phone towers. Humans too are getting affected because of cell phone towers.

The courts have given judgment in favour of cell phone towers. The matter has now gone before the Supreme Court.

I will not comment on the case since it is sub judice. But I'd like to thank Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar for raising the birds issue in 2.0,.

It is a wonderful sign. This has brought a once forgotten pollutant back in the limelight.

If you see, on every cell phone tower they install warning signals that harmful radiation is emitting. It is by law.

You have been conducting research on sparrows extensively. Did you find that cell phone tower radiation is the cause of the decline in ther sparrow population?

Unfortunately, in the case of sparrows, all emerging threats came at one time, whether it was electromagnetic radiation or architectural changes in our building construction style or change in the lifestyle of Indian women.

Earlier, older buildings used to have a cavity in their structures which was used by sparrows to nest, but now the buildings are matchbox shaped and don't leave space for sparrows to make a home.

As far as women are concerned, they used to clean grains on balconies or in verandahs where they would discard poor quality grains. These grains were a major food source for these birds. Now they don't get such food as lifestyles have changed.

Can the sparrow become extinct?

No. Fortunately, we have good numbers of sparrows in the rural landscape and certain urban patches.

Birds become extinct when only a few hundred individuals are left. That is not the case for sparrows at the moment."

From the historic thawing of the Korean standoff, Donald Trump's political ups and downs, killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi, to the royal wedding, here is a recap of all that was 2018:

'Feel Like a Free Bird'- Saudi Allows Women to Drive

Saudi women took the wheel with gusto this year, steering their way through the busy city streets minutes after the decades-old ban on women drivers was lifted in the country on 24 June.

This came as a culmination of years of campaigning by activists and feminists against the driving ban. While the ban itself has been lifted, the Kingdom is nevertheless prosecuting those who campaigned for its end.

Samar Almogren, a talkshow host and writer, had said: ""I always knew this day would come. But it came fast. Sudden. I feel free like a bird.""

Justice, the 'American Way' - US Missile Attack in Syria

Facing his biggest foreign policy crisis since taking office, US President Trump took the toughest direct US action yet in Syria's six-year civil war, with the military launching cruise missile strikes against a Syrian airbase controlled by President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

The attack, that left nine people dead, including four children, saw 59 Tomahawk missiles launched from US Navy warships in the Mediterranean Sea.

""America stands for justice. Years of previous attempts at changing Assad's behaviour have failed. It is in the vital national security interest of the US to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons,"" Trump said in a satatement after the attack.

A Terrifying Double Disaster - Indonesia Quakes

Earlier this year, a series of powerful quakes hit Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people on the holiday island and neighbouring Sumbawa.

The death toll in Indonesia's quake-tsunami disaster nearly doubled to the initial hit, leaving more than 800 dead. Ill-equipped rescuers struggled to reach scores of trapped victims, as health officials resorted to mass burials and desperate residents looted shops for food and water.

Indonesia is one of the world's most disaster-prone nations. It lies on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide and many of the world's volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.

'No Remorse' - Bill Cosby Arrested

His Hollywood career and good-guy image in ruins, an 81-year-old Bill Cosby was sentenced on Tuesday, 25 September, to three to 10 years behind bars for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman, becoming the first celebrity of the #MeToo era to be sent to prison.

The punishment all but completed the dizzying, late-in-life fall for the comedian, former TV star and breaker of racial barriers.

Prosecutors had asked a US court to sentence Cosby to 5-10 years for sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, saying he had shown ""no remorse"" for his actions.

'Mine (Nuclear Button) is Much Bigger Than His' - Trump Meets Kim

After months of speculation and U-turns, US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had a 'successful' one-on-one talk at Singapore's Sentosa island on 12 June.

Trump summed up the summit saying that the two countries have an ""excellent relationship"", as Kim committed to 'complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula' in a joint 'comprehensive document' signed between the two countries.

Earlier in the year, Trump had boasted that his nuclear button was ""much bigger"" and ""more powerful"" than the North Korean leader's.

Wedding Royale - Harry Marries Meghan

Britain's Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle were pronounced husband and wife on 19 May by the Archbishop of Canterbury in a glittering union that brought a measure of modern Hollywood glamour into the 1,000-year-old monarchy.

The newlyweds are now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, putting them in the senior ranks of British royalty.

The world's media was gripped by the occasion, and television channels beamed the ceremony across the world.

To some Britons, the wedding of a senior member of the royal family to a divorcee whose mother is African-American and father is white embodied a modern Britain where race or background are no bar to even the most elite and traditional of institutions.

California Wildfires

A massive wildfire that killed dozens of people and destroyed thousands of homes wreaked havoc in Northern California this year. The fire was fully contained after burning for more than two weeks on 25 November.

The nation's deadliest wildfire in a century killed at least 85 people, and 249 are on a list of those unaccounted for.

The fire began on 8 November, in the parched Sierra Nevada foothills and quickly spread across 240 square miles (620 square kilometers), destroying most of Paradise in a day.

'Queen of Soul' No More - Aretha Franklin Passes Away

Aretha Franklin, the former gospel singer who went on to reign over the music industry as the Queen of Soul with hit songs such as ""Respect,"" ""Chain of Fools"" and ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,"" died in August this year. She was 76.

Franklin died of pancreatic cancer at her home in Detroit. In March, Franklin had canceled a scheduled tour for medical reasons. Her last known performance was at Elton John's annual AIDS Foundation gala.

'Stand With Saudi' - Khashoggi Killing

On 2 October, Jamal Khashoggi, a well-known journalist and critic of the Saudi government, walked into the country's consulate in Istanbul, where he was murdered.

Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor has since said that Khashoggi was killed inside the building on the orders of a rogue intelligence officer.

But what was even more bizarre was US President Donald Trump's take on the killing.

""[I]t could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't!"" Trump wrote in a statement. ""We may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.""

Trump refused to see his killing, an event that brought international condemnation of Saudis, as a reason to sever or weaken ties with Riyadh.

""The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region,"" he said.

No Judge-ment - Kavanaugh Hearing

Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in on 6 October as the 114th justice of the US Supreme Court, after a wrenching debate over sexual misconduct and judicial temperament that shattered the Senate, captivated the nation and ushered in an acrimonious new level of polarization - now encroaching on the court that the 53-year-old judge may well swing rightward for decades to come.

The climactic 50-48 roll call capped a fight that seized the national conversation after claims emerged that he had sexually assaulted women three decades ago - allegations he emphatically denied.

Those accusations transformed the clash from a routine struggle over judicial ideology into an angry jumble of questions about victims' rights, the presumption of innocence and personal attacks on nominees.

'Don't Panic!' - SpaceX Falcon Heavy Launch

Elon Musk's SpaceX pulled off a seemingly impossible feat in February this year when it launched the world's most powerful rocket in 45 years, then flew two of its spent boosters back to the Florida coast for a spectacular, simultaneous recovery on land.

Musk then pulled off something perhaps even more surprising - he delivered a cherry red Tesla Roadster with a space-suit wearing mannequin at the wheel toward an Earth-Mars elliptical orbit around the sun.

On the car's center screen, Musk's team had written, ""DON'T PANIC!"", seemingly a message for the 'spaceman'.

""It seems surreal to me,"" Musk, 46, had said during a post-launch press conference. ""Crazy things can come true.""

'Mind Over Matter' - Stephen Hawking Passes Away

Veteran physicist, cosmologist and professor Stephen Hawking breathed his last on Wednesday, 14 March, leaving behind a black hole in the mortal world.

Hawking, who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at the age of 21, was told by his doctors that he would only live for two more years. Like every other standardised theory he had a problem with, Hawking decided to challenge and make a breakthrough in this one as well, and went on to create scientific history till the ripe old age of 76.

While Hawking has been the poster-man for and inspiration behind every science club formed in school, with his personal journey of struggling through his disability to making way towards greatness marking every inspirational textbook, Hawking's identity goes far beyond that of a kind of 'Science Lord' awarded to him by his fans.

Zero Tolerance, Zero Humanity - US Cages Immigrant Children

Nearly 2,000 children were taken from their parents after former US Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a policy which directed homeland security officials to refer all cases of illegal entry into the US for prosecution.

Church groups and human rights advocates had sharply criticized Donald Trump's policy, calling it inhumane.

Stories had also spread of children being torn from their parents' arms, and parents not being able to find where their kids have gone.

Bowing to pressure from anxious allies, Trump had signed an executive order on 20 June, ending the process of separating children from families after they are detained crossing the US border illegally.

Canada's Cannabis Experiment

Canada approved a revised bill to legalise recreational marijuana in June this year, setting the stage for the country to become the first Group of Seven nation to legalise cannabis.

The Senate voted 52-29 in favor of the revised bill, paving the way for a fully legal cannabis market within eight to 12 weeks.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals had made legalising recreational use of marijuana part of their successful 2015 election campaign, arguing the new law would keep pot out of the hands of underage users and reduce related crime.

""It's been too easy for our kids to get marijuana - and for criminals to reap the profits. Today, we change that. Our plan to legalise & regulate marijuana just passed the Senate,"" Trudeau said in a tweet.

Sacre Bleu! - France Lift WC

Taking turns sliding across the rain-soaked turf holding the World Cup trophy tight, teenager Kylian Mbappe and the rest of France's players acted like the youthful bunch they are.

The celebrations carried on long after a thrilling 4-2 win over Croatia in the final, which saw Mbappe score.

Paul Pogba and Griezmann, France's two other key creative players, also scored.

'This Has Got to End' - Yemen Starves

At an apparent turning point in one of its hardest foreign policy challenges, the Trump administration is demanding a cease-fire and the launch of UN-led political talks to end the Saudi-Iran proxy war in Yemen. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for a halt to hostilities within 30 days.

""This has got to end. We've got to replace combat with compromise,"" Mattis said.

The conflict in Yemen began with the 2014 takeover of the capital, Sanaa, and the toppling of the government by the Houthis, a Shiite Muslim minority in the country. The Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015.

An estimated 10,000 people have been killed. The war has also left around two-thirds of Yemen's population of 27 million relying on aid, and more than 8 million at risk of starvation.

Brexit, May I? - Theresa May Struggles to Execute Deal

Facing almost certain defeat, British Prime Minister Theresa May recently postponed a vote in Parliament on her Brexit deal, saying she would go back to European Union leaders to seek changes to the divorce agreement.

May's move threw Britain's Brexit plans into disarray, intensified a domestic political crisis and battered the pound. With EU officials adamant the withdrawal deal was not up for renegotiation, the country does not know on what terms it will leave -- and whether May will still be Britain's leader when it does.

In an emergency statement to the House of Commons, May accepted that the divorce deal she struck last month with EU leaders was likely to be rejected ""by a significant margin"" if the vote were held as planned.

Historic Korea Summit

South Korean President Moon Jae-in arrived in North Korea in September for his third and possibly most challenging summit yet with leader Kim Jong-un in which he hopes to break an impasse in talks with the United States over the North's denuclearisation and breathe energy into his own efforts to expand and improve relations between the Koreas.

In what are by now familiar images of the two Korean leaders hugging and exchanging warm smiles, Kim greeted Moon at Pyongyang's airport. They have met twice this year at the border village of Panmunjom, but Moon's visit is the first by a South Korean leader to the North Korean capital in 11 years.

George Bush Senior Passes Away

George HW Bush, a patrician New Englander whose presidency soared with the coalition victory over Iraq in Kuwait, but then plummeted in the throes of a weak economy that led voters to turn him out of office after a single term, has died. He was 94.

The World War II hero, who also presided during the collapse of the Soviet Union and the final months of the Cold War, died late Friday night, 30 November, at his Houston home, said family spokesperson Jim McGrath.

'Won't Happen in a Men's Match' - Serena Williams' Press Conference

Serena Williams accused an umpire of sexism and treating her more harshly than men as she used a press conference to double down on her earlier on-court tirade at the official during her US Open final defeat to Japan's Naomi Osaka.

Williams was cited by official Carlos Ramos for three code violations during her 6-2, 6-4 loss to the 20-year-old Osaka.

But despite the match penalties, she renewed her attack at a media conference later.

""For me, it blows my mind. But I'm going to continue to fight for women.""

Setback for Trump - US Mid-term Elections

Democrats won the US House by riding a surge of voter anger and discontent with Donald Trump in suburban enclaves, even as the president's loyal supporters reaffirmed Republican control of the Senate.

The outcome of the US midterm election highlighted the urban-rural divide that has come to define US politics. It will dramatically alter Trump's next two years in office and make a deeply divided nation even more difficult to govern as he seeks re-election in 2020.

'I Want it All' - Anthony Bourdain No More

Many people thought Anthony Bourdain had the most enviable career in existence. He didn't deny it.

""I have the best job in the world,"" the globe-trotting food-taster and culinary storyteller once told the New Yorker magazine, stating the rather obvious. ""If I'm unhappy, it's a failure of imagination.""

Bourdain's stunned fans were left mourning the loss of that singular imagination in June this year following his death from an apparent suicide, recalling everything from his fearless consumption of a beating cobra's heart or a sheep testicle - ""like any other testicle,"" he had remarked - to his outspoken support of the #MeToo movement, to his blissful paean to syrup-soaked pecan waffles at Waffle House.

'Everyone is Safe' - Thai Cave Rescue

""Everyone is safe."" With those three words posted on Facebook the daring rescue mission to extricate 12 boys and their soccer coach from the treacherous confines of a flooded cave in Thailand was complete - a grueling 18-day ordeal that claimed the life of an experienced diver and riveted people worldwide.

Thailand's Navy SEALs, who were central to the rescue effort, celebrated the feat with a post that read: ""All the thirteen Wild Boars are now out of the cave,"" - a reference to the boys' soccer team. ""We are not sure if this is a miracle, a science, or what.""

When Facebook 'Zucked' US Congress

Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg navigated through US congressional hearings in April without making any further promises to support new legislation or change how the social network makes money.

During nearly five hours of questioning by 44 US senators, Zuckerberg repeated apologies he previously made for a range of problems that have beset Facebook, from a lack of data protection to Russian agents using Facebook to influence US elections.

But the 33-year-old internet mogul managed to deflect any specific promises to support any congressional regulation of the world's largest social media network and other US internet companies.

While the bypoll in Jasdan was necessitated as the sitting MLA, Kunvarji Bavaliya, parted ways with the Congress party to join the BJP, the Kolebira seat was vacated after Enos Ekka, a Jharkhand Party MLA, lost his membership following his conviction in a murder case.

Counting of votes on both seats will be conducted on December 23.

Kolibera assembly bypoll

In total five candidates are in the fray for the Kolibera assembly bypoll in Jharkhand on Thursday, officials said.

BJP's Basant Soreng, Menan Ekka of the Jharkhand Party, Congress's Naman Vixcel Kongadi, Anil Kandulna of Sengel Party and an Independent candidate, Basant Dungdung, are in the fray, they said.

Enos Ekka lost his membership after he was convicted by a trial court in a 2014 case of kidnapping and murder. The case pertained to the kidnapping of a teacher, Manoj Kumar, on November 26, 2014. Kumar's body was recovered from a spot near a school the next day.

Ekka was a minister in three governments, led by Arjun Munda, Madhu Koda and Shibu Soren respectively between 2005 and 2008.

Now his wife Menan Ekka is contesting from the seat on Jharkhand Party party ticket. She also has the backing of the JMM.

Jasdan assembly bypoll

The seat was vacated by Kunvarji Bavaliya, who won the 2017 assembly polls on a Congress ticket, but switched to the BJP in July this year. Both the Congress and the BJP sounding confident of winning the seat held by Bavaliya.

Bavaliya had quit the Congress, resigned from the assembly, and joined the ruling BJP, which immediately made him a Cabinet minister.

Bavaliya's resignation necessitated the bypoll in Jasdan, located in Rajkot district, around 200km from Ahmedabad, and he is now in the fray as the BJP candidate.

The Congress has fielded Avsar Nakiya, a district panchayat member, from the seat where result will be announced on December 23.

A total of 19 candidates are in the fray in Jasdan, but the main contest is likely to be between Bavaliya and Nakiya.

The BJP organised a 36km-long motorbike rally, led by its state president Jitu Vaghani, on the last day of canvassing. Bavaliya is a prominent Koli leader and is banking on support from his community, which has a large presence in the constituency, to get re-elected. The ruling party organised rallies and door-to-door campaigns in support of Bavaliya with Vaghani leading from the front in canvassing.

While Chief Minister Vijay Rupani was conspicuous by his absence on the campaign trail, his wife Anjali Rupani sought votes for Bavaliya.

Senior state Congress leaders and party's Gujarat in- charge Rajeev Satav besides a host of MLAs campaigned for Nakiya. The opposition party also brought in Punjab Cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu as its star campaigner to address a gathering moments before the campaign ended at 5 pm on Tuesday.

From what appeared as a sop ahead of the bypoll, the state government on Tuesday announced a complete waiver of Rs 625 crore in unpaid electricity bills under its one-time settlement scheme for over 6 lakh people living in Gujarat's rural areas. Jasdan is largely a rural constituency.

The Congress, however, continued to demand a loan waiver for distressed farmers in the state.

A report was sought from the state government on its announcement to waive rural electricity bills as it came two days before an Assembly by-election, the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Gujarat said Wednesday."

The film, directed by Balaji Tharaneetharan, is based on the life of Syed Abdul Kadhir alias Seethakaathi, a philanthropist with a passion for Tamil literature.

The petitioner, AMD Mohamed Salih Hussain, approached the court on Wednesday seeking to restrain the makers of the movie from releasing it, as the present title would affect the sentiments of Tamil Muslims.

""Movies have great impact on school children and college students. The makers of the movie have depicted Seethakaathi as a drama artist who appears in romantic and violent scenes, giving a completely different perspective to children who watch the movie. My intention is not to stall the movie but only to change the title,"" Hussain said.

Hussain said he too was from Keelakarai, Seethakaathi's home town, and belongs to the same Tamil Muslim community. He submitted that the Tamil classic 'Seeraapuranam' written by poet Umarupulavar would not have been possible without the help of 'Vallal' Seethakaathi.

Seethakaathi had generously distributed food grains, utility products for farming, boats, and houses throughout his life. His generosity had been scripted on rock and tablets unearthed by the state archaeological department, the petitioner added.

Pointing out that Seethakaathi's life story had been added to the Tamil school syllabus, the petitioner contended that such a person should not be depicted in bad light."

In that session, I looked at the changing legal and media landscape for Local Councils, and examined strategies for managing unwelcome media attention. In this bulletin, I look more closely at some of the external management options available to Local Councils.

We are increasingly contacted by councils who are at the centre of unwelcome media attention, often involving social media and sometimes involving serious allegations. Although sometimes the result of unfounded complaints by concerned residents, local media and ""shock jocks"", the seriousness of the allegations, and their potential effect on council, staff and councillors, make it necessary for all involved to know their rights and what processes to follow to contain and manage the situation.

In October 2018 the former mayor of Narrabri Shire Council, Conrad Bolton, was awarded more than $100,000 in damages after Facebook posts were made by a local resident accusing him of corruption and intimidation.

The disgruntled resident had set up a website called ""Narri Leaks"", which became known to other residents in the area. Mr Bolton's children were approached at school about the allegations on the website, and Mr Bolton and his wife noticed a significant drop in the number of invitations they received to functions and events. The Court was told that the Narri Leaks page had been ""devastating"" and ""soul-destroying"".

The proceedings were commenced in 2015, but only came to a conclusion three years later in 2018. Mr Bolton was awarded his legal costs and interest. The disgruntled resident was permanently restrained from publishing or broadcasting any further defamatory content.

Defamation occurs when a person's reputation is damaged as a result of a publication about them. It applies to online and social media statements, as well as statements made by traditional forms of communication. The law of defamation is governed by the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) and the common law.

To prove defamation, a person needs to establish that:

The defamed person also needs to bring the claim within one year of publication.

Generally, whoever is identified by the relevant statements has the right to bring a defamation claim. Defamation is a personal right of action owned by the person aggrieved. As a public body, a local council does not have a right of action in defamation. However, an employee or councillor who is adequately identified by a defamatory publication, by name or otherwise, may have the right to bring a claim.

Because defamation is a personal right, councils need to ensure that funding court proceedings for defamation won't lead to allegations of misuse of funds. For this reason, councils often have a rule in their codes of conduct prohibiting the funding of legal services for advice on defamation claims or associated litigation.

To pursue a defamation claim, you must provide proof of publication of the defamatory statement. This means you need to show that the person you are accusing participated in the chain of communication of the offending material to third parties. The person making the defamatory statement must have either intended to convey the material, or been reckless as to whether their conduct would lead to that outcome.

That may not always be easy. For example, if a defamatory publication is disseminated online by an anonymous source, it can be difficult (not to say expensive) to identify the author. While you may be able to prove that a Facebook page has defamatory statements on it, you might not be able to prove that a particular person posted them.

""Publication"" of a defamatory statement takes place where the offending material is downloaded onto a device and accessed, regardless of where the offending material was uploaded. For that reason, it is common for actions in defamation in New South Wales courts (for example) to be pursued against people outside that jurisdiction - even overseas.

Although forensic data analysts can find out much about the timing and location of online publications, their work can lead to dead ends if a person has been careful to cover their tracks.

All these factors add up, and pursuing someone for defamation can be protracted, difficult and expensive, particularly when they do not admit publication.

Councils must be ready to manage serious allegations - even if they at first seem bizarre or unfounded. Councils must also follow policies and procedures, including those in the 2018 Procedures for the Administration of the Model Code of Conduct published by the NSW Government. Finally, councils should be aware of their obligations under legislation, including the GIPA Act and the Public Interest Disclosures Act 1984. Outside of these obligations, councils can also take steps to contain fallout from unwelcome public attention.

In today's hostile media environment and the 24-hour news cycle, it is imperative that councils curate a media response to any unwelcome media attention. The time has passed when the best approach is to simply ignore a story or ""wait for the storm to pass"".

When serious allegations are made (whether they are founded or not), councils should inform the public of prompt action they are taking and keep any investigation transparent. Where appropriate, councils should also consider releasing a public statement of support for employees. It is becoming more common for councils to hire public relations ""crisis managers"", who can help them get in contact with media outlets and curate public messages, including positive stories to change prevailing sentiment.

If allegations against council are serious, internal or external investigations may be needed. Often, councils select a senior person to conduct them, or engage specialist investigation companies or lawyers.

A decision should be made early whether any subsequent report is for internal use only or for external publication. This will frame the approach to the investigation, including privilege and confidentiality over relevant documents, and the content of the report itself.

During the investigation, councils should be conscious of:

Councils are obliged under work health and safety legislation to safeguard the physical and psychological wellbeing of their officers and staff. Anyone named or readily identifiable in media stories will understandably feel anxious and stressed. Investigations, which often involve interviews by external persons, can be confronting and burdensome. Councils should consider procedures to make the process as transparent as possible and to remove uncertainty. This should include access to an employee assistance program, nominating managers or personnel to routinely check on affected employees, and keeping employees well informed of any review and investigation process."

The stock of the world's largest social media company fell 7.25 per cent, its biggest intraday drop since July, taking losses for the year to about 24 per cent. Investors are concerned about snowballing legal and regulatory efforts over data use polices that have upset many customers and could carry significant penalties and costs.

In particular, the Silicon Valley firm has drawn global scrutiny since disclosing earlier this year that a third-party personality quiz distributed on Facebook gathered profile information on 87 million users worldwide and sold the data to British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.

Washington, DC, Attorney General Karl Racine said the US capital city was suing Facebook, accusing it of misleading users because it had known about the incident for two years before disclosing it.

It further alleges Facebook misled users by allowing several app makers it called partners ""to override Facebook consumers' privacy settings and access their information without their knowledge or consent.""

Facebook said in a statement, ""We're reviewing the complaint and look forward to continuing our discussions with attorneys general in D.C. and elsewhere.""

The New York Times reported new details on Tuesday about the user data that remained available to such partners years after they had shut down features that required them. Facebook acknowledged the lapse in a blog post but said it had not found evidence of wrongdoing by those partners.

In response, both Democrat and Republican lawmakers criticized the company and queried whether Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg had lied to Congress in hearings earlier this year.

The incoming chair of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, Representative David Cicilline, tweeted: ""Zuckerberg told Congress that Facebook users had 'complete control' over their data. Sure looks like he lied.""

Incoming Republican senator Josh Hawley made similar comments about Zuckerberg's testimony.

The stock slide was the worst since the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram warned in July that profit margins would erode in coming years because of consumer and government pressure to better guard data and suppress objectionable content.

""Facebook could have prevented third parties from misusing its consumers' data had it implemented and maintained reasonable oversight of third-party applications,"" according to the lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.

The court could award unspecified damages and impose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per violation of the District's consumer protection law, or potentially close to $1.7 billion if penalized for each consumer affected. The lawsuit alleges the quiz software had data on 340,000 D.C. residents, though just 852 users had directly engaged with it.

'CONFUSING SETTINGS'

Facebook offered separate privacy settings around 2013 to control what friends on the network could see and what data could be accessed by apps, enabling the quiz and other services to collect details about users' Facebook friends without many of them realizing it, according to the lawsuit.

Racine told reporters that Facebook had tried to settle the case before he filed suit, as is common during investigations of large companies, but that a lawsuit was necessary ""to expedite change"" at the Silicon Valley company.

Britain's data protection authority in July fined Facebook 500,000 pounds ($631,000) for breaches of data in the Cambridge Analytica incident.

Since then, Facebook has disclosed a pair of security breaches involving profile data and posts of up to 29 million users and 6.8 million users, respectively.

At least six U.S. states have ongoing investigations into Facebook, according to state officials.

In March, a bipartisan coalition of 37 state attorneys wrote to the company, demanding to know more about the Cambridge Analytica data and its possible links to US President Donald Trump's election campaign.

At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing an investigation into whether Facebook had violated a 2011 consent decree, exposing the company to a multi-billion dollar fine.

State attorneys general have found some success taking on technology companies over data privacy. Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in September agreed to pay $148 million as part of a data breach settlement with 50 U.S. states and Washington, DC.

Agnieszka McPeak, a professor at Duquesne University School of Law, said states will likely make claims similar to those of DC, pressuring Facebook into a settlement that involves both a monetary fine and modified business practices.

""If a company faces 51 separate actions around the country for deceptive practices, that can have a real impact,"" McPeak said."

The attorney general for Washington, D.C., said on Wednesday the U.S. capital city had sued Facebook Inc

The case joins several legal and regulatory proceedings that threaten to hit Facebook with significant penalties and increase its operating costs.

Authorities and consumer advocates have questioned whether Facebook's efforts on security, content moderation and cultural diversity have kept pace with the social responsibility it should have for its services, including WhatsApp and Instagram, which are essential communication tools for more than 2 billion people each month.

The world's largest social media company has drawn global scrutiny since disclosing earlier this year that a third-party personality quiz distributed on Facebook gathered profile information on 87 million users worldwide and sold the data to British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.

Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine said Facebook misled users because it had known about the incident for two years before disclosing it. The company had told users it vetted third-party apps, yet made few checks, Racine said.

""This continues a year of bad publicity and significant issues for [Facebook], making it more likely that the U.S. government will take action to penalize and/or regulate"" it, said financial analyst Scott Kessler of CFRA Research. ""Yet, we still see its fundamentals as healthy and valuation as attractive.""

Facebook shares suffered their biggest drop since July 26, closing down more than 7 percent at $133.24 on Wednesday, extending a roughly five-month stretch since the company warned that profit margins would erode in coming years because of consumer and government pressure to better guard data and suppress objectionable content.

The victim, Manoj alias Arvind Laxman Jadhav (36), was electrocuted while washing a customer's car at the centre located near Lonkar school in Mundhwa around 1.30pm on Monday. Originally from Solapur, Jadhav was living with his family on rent at Sarvodaya colony in Mundhwa.

The employers, Ahmed Shaikh (38) and his son Arbaz (20), from Ganganagar in Phursungi, were produced before the Pune cantonment court and remanded in magisterial custody. They were later released on bail. The police also booked the owner of the washing centre, Govind Lonkar.

Sub-inspector Amit Walke of the Mundhwa police station told TOI that Jadhav received a severe electric shock while washing the car with a water pipe. ""He collapsed and was rushed to a nearby hospital where doctors declared him brought dead. In its advance post-mortem report, Sassoon hospital has certified the cause of Jadhav's death as 'evidence of electric injury' and has preserved his viscera for a chemical analysis,"" he said.

Walke said the police could not ascertain whether Jadhav received a shock from the water pipe or its nozzle.

""We will send a letter to the state electricity board to examine both the pipe and the nozzle and identify the fault which led to Jadhav's death. We will seek a detailed report from the electricity board, which will be submitted as evidence in the chargesheet against the Shaikhs,"" he said.

Walke said that while they had initially registered a complaint of accidental death, investigations revealed negligence on the part of the Shaikhs. ""We also booked Lonkar as he too did not ensure the safety of the employees. The Shaikhs, in their defence, claimed they were not in the shop when Jadhav was electrocuted,"" he added.

Jadhav's cousin, Nitin, who also works at the washing centre, told TOI over the phone from Solapur, ""Four of us had complained to the Shaikhs that Jadhav had received minor electric shocks five days before he was electrocuted. We told them about electric sparks flying out of the switchboard. Jadhav had also suffered an electric shock from the nozzle. However, the Shaikhs did not take serious note of the incident. They called a private electrician who checked the switchboard and left without replacing the faulty wires.""

Nitin said, ""Jadhav died because of our employers' negligence. He had been working at the centre since the last two-and-a-half years and was being paid Rs 10,000 a month. He was the sole earning member of his family. His parents, wife, son and daughter were dependent on him. The Shaikhs have assured to pay a compensation to his family."""

A delegation of Sikh residents met the Governor on Tuesday and submitted a six-page memorandum apprising him of several issues confronting the community, according to a press release issued by the Harijan Panchayat Committee (HPC).

The HPC said the delegation told the Governor that the school belonged to the committee and that they had patta for the land.

They also pointed out that the school has received grants under various schemes.

HPC secretary and City Gurdwara Management Committee president Sardar Gurjit Singh, who led the delegation to the Governor, said the Government of Punjab has granted funds for the school.

The delegation's meeting with the Governor comes in the wake of Chief Minister Conrad Sangma categorically saying funds to be given by the Punjab government couldn't be used in the disputed area. Deputy Chief Minister, Prestone Tynsong, and Urban Affairs Minister, Hamletson Dohling, had also taken exception to the Punjab Government announcing Rs 60 lakh as compensation for the city's Sikh community.

Tynsong asserted that the Punjab government announced compensation without verifying facts and on the basis of hearsay while Dohling said that it would mislead the entire country by giving the impression that there was massive destruction in the incident at Sweeper's Colony.

The HPC said that the Deputy Chief Minister and Urban Affairs Minister were unnecessarily raising the issue to cause confusion and malign the Sikhs.

Alleging that a truck, a showroom and a shop were burnt during the riot in Shillong in June, Singh said the Punjab government had granted compensation to the respective owners.

He rued that so far no compensation of any kind has been given by the Meghalaya government and clarified that no compensation has been announced for any injured person by the Punjab government.

In 2016, the then Punjab Chief Minister, Parkash Singh Badal, visited Shillong giving Rs 10 lakhs to the Guru Nanak School and Rs 5 lakhs for the general development of Thandnongiaw village, Ri-Bhoi district, but nobody then had protested.

Disband High Level Committee

Demanding that the HLC be disbanded, the HPC said it has been issuing illegal orders for survey of properties of the poor Sikhs to the Shillong Municipal Board with the intention to dislocate them.

The HPC said that the so-called High Level Committee is bad in law and its proceedings in so far as relocation of Sikhs are concerned have been stayed by the High Court, the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).

""It has been acting in a biased and malafide manner,"" he said.

Singh said the NCM has ordered a stay on the state government's move to relocate the Sikh residents.

The delegation urged the Governor to ""remove the climate of fear being built against them.

It told the Governor that the Sikhs have been ""victims of veiled threats by student bodies, tribal NGOs, underground organisation namely the HNLC and other political leadership of the state. There have been intermittent overt and covert attempts to create a climate of fear in the minds of the Sikhs.""

The delegation also requested the Governor to enable the poor and suffering 218 Sikh families to get pattas and to change the official name of Punjabi Colony, which is referred to as ""Sweepers Colony"" citing the NHRC's instruction to the state government in this regard."

The stock slide was the worst since the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram warned in July that profit margins would erode in coming years because of consumer and government pressure to better guard data and suppress objectionable content.

""Facebook could have prevented third parties from misusing its consumers' data had it implemented and maintained reasonable oversight of third-party applications,"" according to the lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.

The court could award unspecified damages and impose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per violation of the district's consumer protection law, or potentially close to $1.7 billion, if penalized for each consumer affected. The lawsuit alleges the quiz software had data on 340,000 D.C. residents, though just 852 users had directly engaged with it.

Facebook offered separate privacy settings around 2013 to control what friends on the network could see and what data could be accessed by apps, enabling the quiz and other services to collect details about users' Facebook friends without many of them realizing it, according to the lawsuit.

Racine told reporters that Facebook had tried to settle the case before he filed suit, as is common during investigations of large companies, but that a lawsuit was necessary ""to expedite change"" at the Silicon Valley company.

Britain's data protection authority in July fined Facebook 500,000 pounds ($631,000) for breaches of data in the Cambridge Analytica incident.

Since then, Facebook has disclosed a pair of security breaches involving profile data and posts of up to 29 million users and 6.8 million users, respectively.

At least six U.S. states have ongoing investigations into Facebook, according to state officials.

In March, a bipartisan coalition of 37 state attorneys wrote to the company, demanding to know more about the Cambridge Analytica data and its possible links to U.S. President Donald Trump's election campaign.

At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing an investigation into whether Facebook had violated a 2011 consent decree, exposing the company to a multi-billion dollar fine.

State attorneys general have found some success taking on technology companies over data privacy. Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in September agreed to pay $148 million as part of a data breach settlement with 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C..

Agnieszka McPeak, a professor at Duquesne University School of Law, said states will likely make claims similar to those of D.C., pressuring Facebook into a settlement that involves both a monetary fine and modified business practices.

""If a company faces 51 separate actions around the country for deceptive practices, that can have a real impact,"" McPeak said.

A division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi clarified that the PILs would be heard only after they deposited the amount. The bench, however, didn't set any deadline for them to complete the formalities. The judges also refused to issue notices to respondents in the six PILs before the petitioners prove their bona fides.

Among them, four were filed by the same petitioner -- Yogeshkumar Prakash Nandeshwar -- through counsel Shankar Malpe. The others were by social workers Datta Rathod through counsel SS Dhengale, and Chandrabhan Kolte through Ashwin Ingole.

One of Nandeshwar's plea was against the state home department, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli collectors, and superintendent of police (SP) of Bhandara and Gadchiroli, and G-Life India Developers and Colonisers.

According to him, the company having its head office at Sewanagar in Gwalior opened its branches in 2012 in Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gadchiroli, and Yavatmal. It collected huge amounts from gullible investors through agents and issued them debenture certificates. The company also issued renewal subscription receipts in order to renew payments in 2014.

The company, however, failed to return the amount even after the maturity mentioned in the debenture certificates, thus cheating the investors. The investors went to various branches and found them closed. The local agents expressed inability to pay as they were out of reach.

Feeling aggrieved by the company's actions, investors approached Nandeshwar. After collecting information through his trust, the petitioner moved the complaint before the collector and SP, and also organized a demonstration with other social workers.

Rathod's plea was for protecting the forests, where he accused deputy conservator in Pusad circle, Arvind Mundhe, of misusing his rights and administrative powers by permitting excavation work by Reliance Jio Infocomm for laying optical fibre lines on forest land.

He also filed an online complaint and moved applications to the chief conservator of forest, who directed Munde to reply within a week. He also moved a representation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A criminal case was filed against Munde later.

Kolte's plea was against state school education and sports department which failed to take any action regarding alleged illegality committed by erring schools. According to him, the schools running Standard VIII and IX for last two academic sessions had no permission from the authority, thus causing loss to students. He even lodged an FIR in this regard against the schools alleging that precious taxpayers' money was being wasted.

Authorities and consumer advocates have questioned whether Facebook's efforts on security, content moderation and cultural diversity have kept pace with the social responsibility it should have for its services, including WhatsApp and Instagram, which are essential communication tools for more than 2 billion people each month.

The world's largest social media company has drawn global scrutiny since disclosing earlier this year that a third-party personality quiz distributed on Facebook gathered profile information on 87 million users worldwide and sold the data to British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.

Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine said Facebook misled users because it had known about the incident for two years before disclosing it. The company had told users it vetted third-party apps, yet made few checks, Racine said.

""This continues a year of bad publicity and significant issues for [Facebook], making it more likely that the U.S. government will take action to penalize and/or regulate"" it, said financial analyst Scott Kessler of CFRA Research. ""Yet, we still see its fundamentals as healthy and valuation as attractive.""

Facebook shares suffered their biggest drop since July 26, closing down more than 7 percent at $133.24 on Wednesday, extending a roughly five-month stretch since the company warned that profit margins would erode in coming years because of consumer and government pressure to better guard data and suppress objectionable content.

""Facebook could have prevented third parties from misusing its consumers' data had it implemented and maintained reasonable oversight of third-party applications,"" according to the lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.

Facebook said in a statement, ""We're reviewing the complaint and look forward to continuing our discussions with attorneys general in D.C. and elsewhere.""

The court could award unspecified damages and impose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per violation of the district's consumer protection law, or potentially close to $1.7 billion, if penalized for each consumer affected as is typical. The lawsuit alleges the quiz software had data on 340,000 D.C. residents, though just 852 users had directly engaged with it.

Facebook offered separate privacy settings around 2013 to control what friends on the network could see and what data could be accessed by apps, enabling the quiz and other services to collect details about their users' Facebook friends without many of them realizing it, according to the lawsuit.

It further alleges Facebook misled users by allowing several partners, including mobile software maker BlackBerry, ""to override Facebook consumers' privacy settings and access their information without their knowledge or consent.""

The New York Times reported new details on Tuesday about the user data that remained available to such partners years after they had shut down the features that required them. Facebook acknowledged the lapse, but said that it has not found evidence of wrongdoing by those partners.

Racine criticized Facebook's ""lax oversight and confusing privacy settings,"" telling reporters that Facebook had tried to settle the case before he filed suit, as is common during investigations of large companies.

He said that a lawsuit was necessary ""to expedite change"" at the Silicon Valley company.

Britain's data protection authority in July fined Facebook 500,000 pounds for the breaches of data in the Cambridge Analytica incident.

The BJP cadres, led by State unit president Ranjeet Kumar Dass, had planned a 'Rajiv Bhawan gherao' programme.

They shouted slogans against the Congress during the march.

However, the protesters were prevented from marching beyond the Post Office point at GS Road by the police and the administration.

A large number of Congress workers had gathered outside the Rajiv Bhawan and there were apprehension of clashes if the protesters had been allowed to lay siege to the opposition party's headquarters.

However, no untoward incidents were reported and the BJP cadres dispersed peacefully.

But, for the common people of the city, the protest proved to be a major distress as it led to massive traffic jams on GS Road for about three hours. Traffic congestion stretched for many kilometres and localities as far as Supermarket and Paltan Bazar were affected as the movement of traffic was severely hit.

Motorists and commuters had a tough time trying to navigate through the GS Road and many were stranded for a prolonged period. The after-effects continued till evening.

""This is not the way to conduct an agitation. After all, the BJP is the ruling party. If the ruling party behaves in this way and causes inconvenience to the public, what can we expect from other parties and organisations?"" said Pankaj Sarma, a city resident.

His views were also echoed by Pranab Bayan, a small trader, who got stuck in the jam for over an hour.

""This kind of events only causes hardship to the common citizens. What kind of political point are they trying to make by harassing the masses like this? And they claim to fight for the rights of the masses,"" he said.

The BJP, meanwhile, sent a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind via Deputy Commissioner of Kamrup Metro.

""Now, after the decision of the Supreme Court, it is very much clear that the Congress party and its president Rahul Gandhi has been using this issue (Rafale) only for the sake of their own narrow political benefits. This is a very serious matter that an elected representative of the country, who is also a president of a national party, is misleading the people of the country on the basis of inaccurate facts,"" said the memorandum.

It added that Gandhi's behaviour has been ""insensitive to the security and safety of the country and they appear anti-national (sic)"".

""We demand that in the interest of national security and the international image of the country Rahul Gandhi should be removed from his position of public servant ..."" stated the memorandum.

It is noteworthy that the ruling party has accused Congress president Rahul Gandhi of spreading falsehoods regarding the Rafale deal and added that the Supreme Court's recent verdict proves that the deal was transparent.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, during a press conference in Guwahati on Monday, had demanded a public apology from Gandhi for ""knowingly misleading the people"" and ""playing with an issue related to national security"" on the Rafale issue."

Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Wednesday sought response from State government and National Sports Federations with respect to augmentation of sports infrastructure across the state.

Amicus Curie Advocate Syed Faisal Qadri informed the Court that two National sports academies, Pullele Badminton Academy, Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy have submitted their response with respect to provide their assistance in developing facilities and training in J&K in their respective sports disciplines.

After hearing Amicus, the division bench of Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Sanjeev Kumar directed Amicus Curie to reach out to other National sports academies and get suggestions from them.

Court also directed Advocate Ateeb Kanth, representing Badminton and Basketball Federations, to file response with regard to encourage these two sports disciplines in the state.

JKSSC was also directed to file response and furnish a list of the available equipments besides training and sports facilities for various sports disciplines in the state within two days.

Previously, Court had directed Amicus Curiae, Syed Faisal Qadri to reach out to National sports academies of three sports disciplines comprising Pullele Badminton Academy, Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy, Mary Com Boxing Academy and Tejpal Dhaliwal Basketball Academy to seek suggestions and ways to propagate these games in J&K.

The authorities of these academies were also requested by the court to provide their assistance in developing facilities and training in J&K in their respective sports disciplines.

Earlier, the court had taken suo-moto cognizance on the basis of media reports highlighting the lack of necessary infrastructure, facilities and opportunities for the children to participate in sports and compete at National School Games.

Court remarked that sports activities were essential, holistic and a complete way of education. The judges said that sports help in building personal appearances and team work attitude in children. Sports are healthy for both mind and body, the judges said.

It also remarked that the State government was responsible for providing sports facilities to children. ""Adequate budget for sports has to be ensured by government to provide different sporting platforms to our growing youth,"" Court said.

Court further said that the Government of India and the National Sports Federations/ Associations can help J&K state in having all sports facilities in place.

While observing the court said that the state needs facilities for badminton, baseball, Kabbadi, Ludo, Billiards, Carom, Chess, Judo, Boxing, Cricket, Football and many other sports. Court remarked that J&K children should be given the opportunity to play at national and international events.

Meanwhile for small children, Court had directed recreational and amusement parks be established. It was also directed that changing rooms be also created."

A video shot at the hospital on Tuesday has gone viral on social media in which Imran is shouting at a group of doctors, who according to him were sitting in their room, not in causality. He has used words like ""bloody and b..ls..t"" at the scene in anger.

""I am paying you and you are sitting in the room. Try to tell the people who are from villages. I will... bloody fire you and then go to the court,"" he is seen asking the doctors in the video. ""I am not ready to listen to the ""bloody b...ls..t. I want care for patients as per your duty,"" the angry Deputy Mayor is seen asking the doctors in the video.

The video has triggered outrage from doctors from across the valley. However, Imran Wednesday in a press conference said he will mend his mistake.

""If b..ls..t and bloody word is unparliamentary, I apologize and I am extremely sorry for that. I was emotional when I saw a dead patient there,"" he said.

In the presser, the Deputy Mayor took a dig at CD Hospital authorities stating that the hospital was worst hit and ""it has taken a toll on patient care.""

""The hospital faces lift problem, it has an improper heating arrangement, dog menace is rampant and it is without any fence. There was no ABG analyzer when I went to the hospital,"" he said.

As a mark of protest, the doctors at CD hospital Wednesday observed a pen-down strike for one hour.

""The uploaded video is edited one. Whatever happened behind scenes is not in the video. He has not shown all things. A patient expired at that time when the Deputy Mayor forced a doctor to walk from ward-to-ward. The patient was to be referred to the emergency,"" said a doctor at the hospital.

The video has triggered outrage from doctors and netizens, who condemned Imran's remarks, called it unfortunate and sought action against him.

Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) called Deputy Mayor's remarks as ""unruly behaviour"" and expressed a strong resentment.

""It has now become a routine as ward members, Panchs, Sarpanchs and now Deputy Mayor is interfering in hospital affairs to get political mileage, because hospitals remain flooded with patients,"" said DAK president, Dr Suhail Naik.

He said the on-duty doctor was busy and was filling a referral form of a 60-year-old female patient at the hospital.

""It was better for him to focus on hospital sanitation and electricity. We warn them to mind their own work and not interfere in technical issues of the medical profession,"" Naik said.

""From his physical and verbal gestures, it seems he has received education from a western country. It was better for him to get moral education from some primary school here,"" he said.

DAK urged secretary Health and Medical Educations, Atal Dulloo to take strong note and act against the erring and unruly behaviour of Deputy Mayor.

Society of Dental Surgeons J&K (SDSJK) has also condemned the Deputy Mayor's behaviour stating that he surpassed service domain and was blatantly indecent in his approach.

""His primary job is to look beautification of the city and not to gain political mileage. His approach was totally uncalled for. He humiliated doctors by his unparliamentary behaviour,"" said president SDSJK, Dr Imtiyaz Banday.

""The inhuman behaviour shown by him clearly depicts that State's machinery does not run as per the rules and anybody can ride it for its vested interests,"" he said.

Banday appealed the Medical Superintendent CD Hospital to formally lodge FIR against Deputy Mayor so that he is booked for his 'unethical, illegal and rogue' behaviour.

Doctors Association Kashmir headed by Dr Nisar Ul Hassan has also criticized the behaviour of the Deputy Mayor and demanded an independent inquiry into the matter.

""He should have contacted the hospital administrator if he had a problem or there was an issue. There is a way to talk to a doctor,"" said its spokesperson Dr Riyaz Ahmad Daga.

Condemning the incident, he said the doctors are leaving Kashmir because of these reasons, mental torture and harassment faced by them in the hospitals.

A year later, in July 2017, the government banned e-cigarettes hoping to bring down the consumption of tobacco products in the state. The statement issued by Directorate of Health Services Kashmir said ""A complete ban has been imposed on the sale (including online sale), manufacture, distribution, trade, import and advertisement of Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS)/ e-cigarettes in the state with immediate effect."" Even before that the High Court directed the government to take necessary steps to ban use and sale of Gutka in Jammu and Kashmir. The directions were passed while hearing public interest litigation (PIL) seeking ban on manufacture, storage, sale and distribution of Gutka and other smokeless forms of tobacco products containing nicotine as an ingredient. Another method used to discourage use of tobacco products and cigarettes was when the tax on cigarettes and tobacco products was increased significantly. Despite the hard efforts the government has been unable to make any major headway in enforcing the bans effectively. Consumption of tobacco products including cigarettes has shown an increase over the years. Tobacco use leads most commonly to diseases affecting the heart and lungs, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer). Health reports have shown an increase in the number of persons, mostly men, suffering from lung cancers in the state with smoking being one of the main causes. From politicians to school kids, every one speaks and writes on the issue. For the rest of the year, however, we only get to hear about occasional raids by the anti-tobacco and drugs squads and realization of fine from the defaulters found smoking in public places. Even if some campaigns are started, they soon run out of steam. The significance of public awareness functions or campaigns cannot be undermined. Even the debates organized at the school or college level are commendable as the youth remain most susceptible to cigarette smoking. However, mere awareness does not serve purpose. Implementation of related law become imperative if the menace is to be eradicated."

""If you thought they (the Congress) only had a problem with EC and EVMs, now wait. They have humiliated the Army, CAG and every institution important to our democracy,"" he said during an interaction with polling booth level BJP workers of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry through a video conference from New Delhi.

He was apparently referring to the Congress questioning the veracity of the surgical strikes targeting terrorist launch pads in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir and for contesting the Comptroller and Auditor General's finding of Rs 1.86 lakh crore loss to the exchequer in the coal scam.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi had on Sunday lashed out at the Modi government, saying he will not allow ""destruction"" of institutions like the Supreme Court and the Reserve Bank of India.

The BJP government believes ""only one idea should run India"", Gandhi had told a public rally organised by his party's southern ally the DMK in Chennai.

Referring to the Supreme Court's judgement on the contentious Rafale fighter jet deal, the prime minister said the Congress was opposing it just because it did not like the verdict.

""They (the Congress) questioned an SC verdict just because they did not like the decision. Earlier, just because they could not threaten the court into doing what they wanted, just beacuse the court was being fair, they tried to even impeach the Chief Justice of India,"" he said.

The Congress had earlier this year moved a notice in Parliament for impeaching the then Chief Justice Dipak Misra, seeking his removal on five grounds of ""misbehaviour"". It was, however, rejected by Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on April 23.

Responding to a question of a party worker on taking on the Congress over its ""false"" propaganda, Modi said the perfect answer to ""undemocratic behaviour"" lay in strengthening democracy.

""Like the sunlight, which is the best disinfectant, information and awareness are important for democracy. Hence, people need to be apprised of the behaviour, attitude and dangerous games of the Opposition, including the Congress.

""They will do their best to spread lies but it is in our hands to spread truth. They will do their best to mislead people but it is in our hands to expose them,"" he said.

He asked the BJP cadre to tell people that before every election the Congress party started making noise about EVMs to create an atmosphere of doubt. But when results were in their favour, they accepted it.

Likening the Congress and opposition parties to a student blaming the school, teacher and examiner if his results were not favourable, Modi said, ""The same thing is happening in the case of our opposition, too. This has to be explained to the people.""

Hailing people as the greatest force protecting democracy, the prime minister said the last time Congress tried to threaten it, people threw them out of power. He was apparently hinting at imposition of Emergency by Indira Gandhi in 1975.

""Reach out to people and tell them the Congress' DNA is still the same. Just because Emergency saw a big fightback from the people now they have become more cunning in their tactics. But yet again India will not excuse the Congress for playing with democracy.""

""From housing to health care, from sanitation to skills, there are schemes for every section of society,"" he said, and asked booth level workers to reach out to people about those measures.

He said, if people were confused or misinformed, BJP workers could seek help of the Narendra Modi app to arm themselves with data and information.

Emphasising the need for strengthening the party at the polling booth level, Modi said,""Mera booth sabse majboot (strong). After all, the party that wins at the booth level wins the elections....meet (people) them regularly, share their joy, their sorrow and serve them.""

He also interacted with beneficiaries of the Centre's Mudra loan scheme and lauded a woman, expressing happiness that she had now become a job giver.

Modi asked BJP workers to inform people about how the education sector had undergone a transformation under his government.

In the last four years, he said, the focus was broadened from only the outlays to include outcomes.

""Similarly, the earlier approach was only about teaching. Going a step ahead, the government looked at learning. We are improving quality of education and increasing quantity of opportunities,"" he said.

Modi said the government came up with the National Institutional Ranking Framework for rating institutions based on objective and verifiable criteria. It was made available seperately for streams such as engineering, management, pharmacy, architecture, humanities and law.

He also talked about the steps taken for setting up branches of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in different states, including Tamil Nadu.

Modi said over 13,000 skill development centres were imparting livelihood training to lakhs of youth in 375 different skills.

He was last transferred as Inspector General of the CRPF's Counter Insurgency and Anti-Terrorism (CIAT) School at Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh.

He had earlier this year sought voluntary retirement with effect from November 30 after completing 50 years of age under provisions of the All India Services (Death-Cum- Retirement Benefit) Rules, 1958, but the Centre rejected his plea in October.

In April 2017, while working with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) at Shillong in Meghalaya, he had submitted a report on ""a suspected fake encounter during a joint counter-insurgency operation of security forces, resulting in the killing of two persons of the NDFB(S),"" he said in his application.

After his retirement was ""not agreed to by the competent authority since he was not clear from the vigilance angle,"" Rai approached the CAT's Ahmedabad bench on December 5.

Rai, a 1992-batch IPS officer from Gujarat, in his application sought to ""set aside the letter rejecting his retirement and allow his retirement.""

The CAT's Ahmedabad bench recently issued notices to the central and Gujarat governments returnable on January 1, 2019.

On November 3, 2018, when he informed the Ministry of Home Affairs' secretary that he had relinquished charge as IG, the ministry wrote asking him to join back ""in view of the fact that his application for retirement had not been accepted by the competent authority of MHA,"" the application stated.

Rai was in August 2014 transferred out of Gujarat as the Chief Vigilance Officer of the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) at Jaduguda in Jharkhand.

In April 2015 he was transferred to the CRPF at Shillong.

After his report on the ""suspected fake encounter"" (in the North East) he was transferred to the CIAT at Chittoor and a ""departmental misconduct"" charge sheet was served upon him, Rai said.

He had approached the CAT at Hyderabad against the charge sheet which stayed the proceedings against him.

When Rai was with the Gujarat CID in 2007, he had arrested senior IPS officers D G Vanzara, Rajkumar Pandian and Dinesh MN in connection with the alleged fake encounter of Sohrabuddin Sheikh.

Sheikh was killed in an alleged fake encounter near Gandhinagar in November 2005. His wife was also believed to have been done to death.

Prajapati, an aide of the gangster who was believed to be the witness to the encounter, was allegedly killed by police at Chapri village in Gujarat's Banaskantha district in December 2006.

The Sohrabuddin killing case was transferred to Mumbai in September 2012 on the request of the CBI for a fair trial.

In 2013, the Supreme Court had clubbed the alleged fake encounter case of Prajapati with that of Sheikh.

The helping hands and hearts of thousands of local H&R Block volunteers served nearly 300 cities, from New York City to Los Angeles and everywhere in between.

In Kansas City, Missouri where H&R Block is headquartered, associates from 16 area offices took a group of over two dozen children from Banneker Elementary School, which serves a large concentration of low-income students, shopping for school supplies and holiday gifts. Each child shopped for several needed and wanted items. They also went out for lunch at Chick-fil-A.

""At Banneker Elementary and Kansas City Public Schools, we are focused on meeting the needs of every student, every day. We are extremely grateful to the entire team at H&R Block for having given us this amazing opportunity to provide these students with a great holiday experience that they might not have enjoyed otherwise,"" said Harrison Neal, principal of Banneker Elementary School. ""This is an excellent example of the kind of community and business partnerships we are developing as a school and school system in order to offer wrap-around support services for our students and their families.""

At the same time, another group of associates from nearby H&R Block offices in Kansas City, Missouri were helping Cameron Veterans Home Assistance League, NourishKC and Newhouse Shelter by signing and delivering holiday cards to veterans, preparing and serving meals to the homeless and wrapping Christmas presents for children.

In Janesville, Wisconsin, located approximately 40 miles from Madison, H&R Block associates had learned the Salvation Army of Dane County and the Salvation Army of Rockford & Winnebago County had a shortfall of bell ringers for their Christmas Kettle Program and stepped in to help. Associates from 15 area offices volunteered at 12 different locations around town greeting potential donors with a warm smile.

""The value of volunteers is more than a number. We truly appreciate each volunteer for the time and expertise they provided when it comes to volunteering and we are humbled that H&R Block chose us to help,"" said Major Mark Martsolf, volunteer coordinator at the Salvation Army of Rockford & Winnebago County.

In Manhattan, New York, associates from 22 area H&R Block offices volunteered to staff seven thrift stores benefiting Housing Works, a nonprofit organization whose mission is tackling the dual crisis of AIDS and homelessness. H&R Block volunteers donned their best Housing Works aprons and greeted shoppers, organized racks and tidied up the store.

""Housing Works volunteers play a vital role in our thrift shops, bookstore cafe, health centers and fundraising events. Each volunteer brings their own unique set of skills which helps us keep our stores stocked, our customers happy, and our shops looking beautiful. Together with our community of volunteers we're able to fuel our mission to end the dual crises AIDS and homelessness,"" said Willa Tsokanis, volunteer program coordinator, Housing Works.

In Worcester, Massachusetts, located about 40 miles from Boston, H&R Block associates from 23 area offices held a toy drive benefiting the Boys & Girls Club of Worcester. Just last month, those same associates pitched in to host one of three Child Safety Fairs in and around the greater Boston area at several Boys & Girls Clubs to educate children and families about fire safety, bike safety, water safety, poison control and much more.

""Our professional staff and our club kids benefited by having volunteers in our community help. Without their involvement, we would serve less kids,"" said Ellin Terrill, director of marketing and special events at the Boys & Girls Club of Worcester. ""Volunteerism sends a message to our kids that they are valuable and that people in the community care about them and want them to be successful."".

Meanwhile, in Sarasota, Florida, H&R Block associates from 15 area offices partnered to help the Suncoast Blood Bank (SCBB) by volunteering at 10 different blood drives around town. Not only did they donate blood themselves, but they also helped check in patients, served drinks and snacks and waved street signs to draw attention to the blood drives and recruit potential donors. This is not the first time H&R Block associates from Sarasota have helped the Suncoast Blood Bank. For the past two years, they have provided the Suncoast Blood Bank with a total of $9,640 in contributions as part of their Nonprofit Referral Program.

""As the community's only local nonprofit blood provider, we strive to keep the cost of maintaining a safe and reliable source of blood products as low as possible and we can only do that with the support of volunteers,"" said Jayne Giroux, director of community development at Suncoast Blood Bank. ""Our partnership with H&R Block has brought a totally new demographic to our blood bank. We have been able to meet and educate individuals about the importance of blood donation that we have never been able to reach."".

Not to be outdone, in New Bern, North Carolina, which recently experienced devastating effects from Hurricane Florence this past September, associates from three area H&R Block offices volunteered at the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina to help pack, sort and organize the donation warehouse. Prior to that, over two dozen H&R Block offices throughout North Carolina participated in a Thanksgiving food drive benefiting victims of Hurricane Florence by donating 450 pounds of nonperishable goods and raising over $3,500 toward the same organization.

""Hurricane Florence had a devastating effect on central and eastern North Carolina. The Food Bank will be there for the long rebuilding process thanks to the impact made by organizations like H&R Block,"" said Elizabeth Moss, food and fund drive coordinator for the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina. ""Community support through virtual food drives, physical food drives, and volunteering enables us to ensure our mission that no one goes hungry in central and eastern North Carolina, and we are so grateful.""

In Thomasville, Georgia, located approximately 30 miles from Tallahassee, Florida, associates from a local H&R Block office volunteered to clean, paint and do lawn work at Hands and Hearts for Horses, an organization that provides animal therapy to special needs children and adults.

""H&R Block's contribution was extremely important to Hands and Hearts for Horses. We are a small staffed non-profit and rely heavily on volunteers to assist with day to day activities as well as maintaining the property,"" said Susie Shin, director at Hands and Hearts for Horses. ""We serve almost 90 riders with special needs and disabilities per week and oftentimes property clean-up and minor repairs get put on the back burner. H&R Block's contribution helped us make minor property improvements and ensure that our facility is operating at the optimal safety and cleanliness level."".

Meanwhile, in Southaven, Mississippi, located about 14 miles from Memphis, Tennessee, H&R Block associates from eight area offices helped St. Jude Children's Research Hospital by assembling Craft Packages for the organization's Happy Carts program, which goes to inpatient rooms several nights a week to offer patients and families a welcome distraction. Just a few months ago, this same group of H&R Block associates walked and ran a 5K race with other associates from around the country, to raise more than $55,000 to help St. Jude Children's Research Hospital end childhood cancer.

""While tremendous strides have been made in research and treatments thanks in large part to St. Jude, we must act with urgency to help end pediatric cancer, which affects nearly 300,000 children worldwide each year and remains the leading cause of death by disease in U.S. kids today,"" said Richard Shadyac Jr., President and CEO of ALSAC, the fundraising and awareness organization for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. ""We are thankful for all of our partners and the multitude of supporters who are making a difference by raising awareness and support for our lifesaving mission: Finding cures. Saving children.""

Additionally, in Agoura Hills, California, located approximately 35 miles from Los Angeles, they recently experienced disaster due to the Woolsey Fire that scorched 96,949 acres of land. H&R Block associates from 54 area offices helped Las Virgenes Fire Relief by volunteering to sort, pack and organize supplies and food donations while others rolled up their sleeves to help with the cleanup and rebuilding process.

""We've had to assemble and move quickly after the Woolsey Fire tore through our community. There were so many people to help and they needed help now. There is power in numbers and the more people who volunteer, the quicker and better we can help our neighbors in need,"" said Kim Prince, director of communications at the Las Virgenes Fire Relief. ""Because of H&R's commitment to service, we knew we could rely on those volunteers to take a task and run with it.""

Even more heartwarming was the effort by local H&R Block associates at two area offices in Albany, Oregon, located about 70 miles from Portland, held a pajama drive to help CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates for Children) of Linn County which supports and advocates for children in foster care.

""As a small non-profit, we rely on traditional community volunteers who give their time and talents to one of our many community projects or fundraisers,"" said Julie Gilman, executive director of CASA. ""Without help from businesses like H&R Block, and the wonderful people working there, we simply couldn't provide as many abused and neglected children in our foster care system with a crucial one-on-one advocate.""

Last but least, in Leander, Texas, located approximately 26 miles from Austin, H&R Block associates from two area offices got into the holiday spirit and partnered with the Leander Police Department Blue Santa Program to help deliver bikes and other holiday gifts to underprivileged children in the community.

""The Leander Blue Santa really depends upon the support we receive from community businesses and organizations such as H&R Block to be able to provide a great Christmas for needy families in the community. Without their support, we would not be able to meet the need for gifts and bikes that we hand out each year,"" said Sgt. Helen Garrett, community services sergeant at the Leander Police Department.

H&R Block has always strived to provide help and hope for its clients, associates and the community. It's a mission that has rung true to the brand since the very beginning when brothers Henry and Richard Bloch founded the company in 1955. Whether it's helping victims of natural disasters rebuild or hosting child safety fairs or providing meals to the homeless, H&R Block associates have always had a passion for giving back and helping the communities where they live and work.

The idea for H&R Block's One Team Day of Giving came from two separate days of giving. This past September in Phoenix, Arizona during H&R Block's annual retail meeting, nearly 500 H&R Block associates worked in 108-degree weather for hours nailing, digging, cleaning and painting; all to improve the learning experience for kids at a local inner-city school. Then, this past October in Nashville, Tennessee during H&R Block's annual franchise convention, more than 2,000 franchisees volunteered to give back to the community by packing meals, gathering gloves and hand warmers for veterans and made a tremendous impact in a very short period of time to a number of organizations.

""That got us excited, so we asked ourselves what could we do that's even bigger than that? And that's when we decided on One Team Day of Giving,"" said Karen Orosco, senior vice president of U.S. retail at H&R Block. ""This day is just one more example of how our franchisees and corporate associates care about the people and communities where we all live and work."""

Pronouncing its verdict, the court held that absence of a Delhi address proof is not a valid ground to deny admission to children into the city's schools.

Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, a government school in Anand Vihar in Delhi had reportedly denied admission to kids who could not produce their permanent residence proof of the national capital.

However, Justice C Hari Sankar on Tuesday (18 December) has directed the school to grant admission to the three children who live in Ghaziabad.

The father of the three children had approached the High Court pleading that the school denied admission to his kids on the ground that they did not have a residence proof of Delhi.

The petition further stated that refusal of admissions is ""arbitrary, discriminatory, illegal, unconstitutional, and violative of fundamental rights"".

""The Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya is at a distance of 2-3 km from their residence and there is no justification not to grant admission to wards of my client merely on the ground that they are not residents of Delhi In case they were not allowed to attend classes in any other government school nearby in the academic year 2018-19, their studies would suffer badly,"" the petition said."

As more idols are pulled out of the musty strong room, measured for height and weight and passed on to the team of archeologists to check for their age and antiquity, fresh concerns emerge.

Some of the idols with a green patina, corroded in places, sport gaping holes in pedestals, their beauty blunted forever. An Archaeological Survey of India official, in a white coat, cleans the idols with sodium citrate using a tooth brush, hoping to work a miracle and bring back the shine of the corroded antique, encrusted with sand particles. A photographer places them on a makeshift table with a blue backdrop to record them for posterity.

But, many of the idols have lost their sheen, the graceful curves that set apart their pedigree. ""We noticed the affliction in a few idols that we checked. We call it bronze disease or cancer,"" former deputy director of Tamil Nadu archaeology department M Chandramoorthy told TOI. He is a member of the Madras high court-appointed team comprising ASI officials and archaeology experts. Over nearly five decades, the icons have piled up in icon centres inside temple premises or pulled out of the earth where they were buried for two to three centuries, fearing Muslim invasion and destruction, said Chandramoorthy.

Presence of chlorides and salts are common if the artefacts are recovered from underground. This is likely with some of the icons retrieved from hoards that were buried, said Bengaluru-based Sharada Srinivasan, a member of the advisory board of the Institute of Archaeometallurgical Studies, London. The progress of bronze disease can be halted, but cannot be totally reversed, said professor Srinivasan.

What has shocked and evoked concerns, however, is the manner in which the idols have been conserved in the icon centres across Tamil Nadu. The idols from temples in the region were locked up for safe-keeping after temple festivals. But many remained in the strong rooms, were afflicted with disease and wasted away. ""Corrosion is primarily because of the hostile environment and the reaction of the metal chemically and electrochemically with the environment,"" said B Venkatraman, director of Health Safety & Environmental Group-Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research. His team has been screening the ancient temple idols for chemical composition.

The archaeological experts have been more focused on determining the antiquity of the idols and ensuring there have been no thefts and replacements in connivance with temple officials and idol smugglers.

While a heated debate is on about fanning public support for vigilantism to protect the scores of temple treasures, the spotlight for now is on the utter disregard for conservation of artefacts lying in the 19 'high security' icon centres in renowned shrines in Tamil Nadu.

""These are idols to be worshipped in temples and not kept in vaults. They have been utterly neglected,"" said former historian, archaeologist and epigraphist R Nagaswamy.

With the debate veering back to the upkeep of the icon centres, experts say vaults and temples, which are not waterproof and which do not have controlled atmospheres as in the museums, pose inherent problems in the conservation of metal artefacts.

""Perhaps we have to think of ways whereby conservation facilities can be made available to such vaults as well as in temples with regular monitoring,"" said Srinivasan, dean of the School of Humanities, National Institute of Advanced Studies, suggesting the provision of museum-like storage spaces or display cabinets with controlled environments, whereby the relative humidity and atmosphere can be monitored."

Now CM Kumaraswamy wants the people to help resolve the matter.

Bengaluru: The Karnataka government has been at loggerheads with NGO Akshaya Patra over the question of serving onion and garlic in mid-day meals, and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy is now ready to take the vexed issue to the people's court.

Speaking to ThePrint, Kumaraswamy said he was ready to open the issue for public debate, and let the people decide whether or not they want the ISKCON-run NGO's onion-and-garlic-free food served to their children.

The Akshaya Patra Foundation, a non-profit organisation, is a midday meal partner of the Karnataka government in five districts -- Bengaluru, Mysuru, Ballari, Hubli and Mangaluru.

The Karnataka State Food Commission conducted a survey of government schools, and found that onion and garlic were absent from the meals served at schools where Akshaya Patra was the providing agency. The panel urged for them to be included to make meals tastier and more nutritious.

Akshaya Patra refused, owing to its belief in the Ayurvedic principle of providing 'sattvic' food -- cooked with organic, vegetarian ingredients. Onion and garlic are considered 'tamasic', that is, items that can trigger lethargy and negative emotions.

Naveena Neerada Dasa, ISKCON's head of strategic communication and projects, told ThePrint that it is Akshaya Patra's ""endeavour to promote good health and nutrition"", and that it ""will continue to follow the prescribed norms set by both the state and central government"".

The state government, meanwhile, began facing pressure from civil rights organisations like the Delhi-based Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and the Right to Food Campaign to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra. They insist that Akshaya Patra has no right to decide what food has to be served, and cannot impose ""religious diktats"" on a scheme that embodies one's right to food.

The organisations have also spoken about the question of nutrition, though dieticians say onion and garlic only enhance taste -- their nutritional value can easily be replaced by nuts or fibres of different kinds.

Also read: Karnataka civil society groups want govt to dump ISKCON NGO over onion-garlic row

The Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, which oversees the midday meal scheme, does not specify what items are to be provided to children, be it eggs or onion or garlic.

The ministry's guidelines merely state that a primary school child be served food which has a nutritional value of 450 calories -- 12 grams of protein, 100 grams of food grains, 20 grams of pulses, 50 grams of vegetables, 5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

For upper primary schoolchildren, the intake is supposed to be 700 calories -- 20 grams of protein, 150 grams of food grains, 30 grams of pulses, 75 grams of vegetables , 7.5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

The Karnataka government has been reluctant to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra, since the midday meal scheme has helped increase the number of admissions in government schools.

It seems to have decided that the only way this matter can be resolved is if it is opened to public debate, rather than be coerced to take a decision based on the observations of civil rights organisations.

Kumaraswamy has now decided to seek the opinion of various stakeholders, including school teachers, headmasters, food scientists and dieticians, on whether there is an absolute need to add onion and garlic in the food that is being served.

""The question we are raising is whether it would cause any major deficiencies to children if (onion and garlic) are not added to their midday meals. We will be able to take an informed stand only after we receive adequate information on it,"" said Kumaraswamy.

""We will ask food experts, doctors and nutritionists on these aspects, and then take a decision. Let's not rush into any decision.""

While this controversy rages, officials at the Department of Primary and Secondary Education have come up with a new idea to bypass the onion-garlic question and yet enhance children's diet.

Preliminary discussions are on to add fruits to the menu, so that children can have a well-rounded meal.

Sources in the department also said the Mysuru-based Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) has been asked to analyse the nutritional value of onion and garlic, and find if there are alternative fruits or vegetables that can provide the same nutrition."

History, they say, is always written from the perspective of the powerful, the strong, or the rich. The year 2018, however, showed us something different. In fact, this year will go down as a landmark year - one in which women showed they could speak up, take on patriarchy, demand justice, and seek redressal.

We look back to see what were some of the big milestones, movements, and issues that rallied women to come together and demand change. Here are some ways in which 2018 became a landmark year for the Indian woman:

Talking about periods continues to be taboo in India. A social experiment revealed how a woman carrying a pack of sanitary napkins in a transparent bag at a bus stop had everyone in a tizzy even as, 20 metres away from her, multiple men stopping to take a leak and being caught on camera did not shock.

Imagine women's consternation when the Goods and Services Tax - rolled out in 2017 - was slapped on feminine hygiene products. It had everyone, from women to NGO's and social entrepreneurs working in this sector up in arms. The year 2018 saw multiple campaigns across the country; the demand was one: make feminine hygiene products tax-free. In January 2018, school girls from Gwalior started a campaign, and wrote and sent messages on sanitary napkins to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In July 2018, after the 28th GST Council meeting, the tax was removed on sanitary napkins.

This movement had every abuser ducking under the desk, checking Google every few hours for his name. That was the power of the #MeToo Movement. It showed the country that if you thought women were fair game, then maybe it was time to think twice.

Actress Tanushree Dutta showed courage and took that one step that liberated thousands of women and led them to speak up in public, in communities, at workplaces, and even their homes against sexual abuse and harassment. Women in media, arts, sports, advertising, entertainment, and corporates spoke up.

The movement was well received by everyone who had suffered some form of abuse, irrespective of gender. The patriarchy fought back with people blaming the victims and gaslighting them (click here to find out what that means) and asking why they woke up years later (here's why). But MeToo started a process of healing; stories of abuse, molestation, and rape that had not been spoken about were shared. The burden, pain, trauma and fear of being shamed that many women were carrying around for decades were washed away - somewhat.

MeToo, which put the spotlight on some very well-known names, also woke up organisations and led them to re-examine workplace safety of employees. And though it is a long-drawn and an uphill battle, in the face of resistance, lack of empathy for survivors, and rigid patriarchy, women are just getting started.

And men who think they have gotten away should think again. If you haven't been outed, remember it will be #TimesUp for you soon.

With the thick veil of patriarchy also encroaching on women's right to worship, a Supreme Court verdict took on tradition to allow menstruating women between the age of 10 and 50 to worship at Sabarimala temple in Kerala. Unfortunately, things took an ugly turn when many women devotees were forced to turn back and protests against the decision erupted across Kerala and the entire country. Women journalists were heckled, and not allowed to report, while self-styled ""protectors' vowed to shed blood so that the temple could be closed. Till the time of this story going to press, no woman has been allowed to enter though attempts have been made. Just goes to show that religion is mightier than a Supreme Court decision.

In October came the landmark judgment by an all-women Supreme Court bench that no means no; that no woman - even those labelled of ""easy virtue"" - could be violated and raped. (Read more about the judgment here). This also shows why we need more women to look at rape and molestation cases, especially given the rampant abuse, patriarchy, and bias that India is steeped in.

Continuing its landmark judgment spree this year, the Supreme Court also ruled that adultery is no longer a crime and is unconstitutional and discriminatory against women. The court pointed out that having a sexual relationship with a woman without her husband's consent deprived women of agency. While adultery was no longer a crime, it could be the basis of divorce; in case there was a case of suicide based on an affair that would be seen as a crime.

The other landmark judgment this year was when a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court struck down Section 377 of the Indian penal code. This - the judgment that gay sex is no longer a crime in India and is legal - means that the LGBTQIA community in India can finally come out of the closet.

The reply came while hearing a plea filed by the Delhi Government School Teachers Association, through advocate Kamlesh Kumar Mishra, challenging the move by the government, seeking the voter ID details of the parents and relatives of students.

On Tuesday, the court was informed that on November 27, a circular was issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE) where it is specifically mentioned that, ""except DoE, no outside agency' has been hired or engaged for data collection or verification"".

""Once it is uploaded on the DoE website, no one can see or use (the data) without permission of competent authority,"" the reply read.

The court was also told that it is absolutely impossible to plan and allocate budget for suitable infrastructure and facilities for children in the absence of comprehensive data.

Earlier, the Delhi government had removed Aadhaar card from the list of the documents sought from children after the Supreme Court had delivered its verdict.

The court dismissed an appeal filed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and directed it to obtain information sought under the Right to Information Act, 2005 from Vodafone, a private body, and furnish such information to the applicant.

This was on a specific query in which a person asked the TRAI to disclose if his phone was being tapped or placed under surveillance.

The applicant, Kabir Shankar Bose, had specifically sought information under the RTI Act on whether his mobile phone number had been placed under surveillance or tapping by any agency. Simultaneously, the respondent sent a letter requesting the above information to Vodafone, his service provider.

TRAI Accountable Under RTI: Delhi HC

However, Vodafone denied such information on the grounds that it is not a 'public authority' under the RTI Act and hence, is not obliged to furnish it. Now, much turned on the definition of ""public authorities"" under Section 2(h).

The respondent, exhausting the chain of appeals, approached the Chief Information Commission, which, vide an order dated 12 September 2018, directed TRAI to obtain the information from the service provider and furnish it to the respondent. TRAI, in its appeal, challenged the said CIC order on the grounds that it is not in possession of such information and is under no obligation to collect such information from Vodafone and furnish it to the respondent.

Relying on precedent, it further argued that indiscriminate and impractical demands for disclosure of such information would hinder the effective functioning of the regulator and the RTI Act must not be abused or misused to prevent public authorities from carrying out their regular duties.

These arguments were rejected by the High Court, which upheld the CIC order and stated that since TRAI is a 'public authority' under the RTI Act, it is obliged to furnish all information that can be legally accessed by it from any private body such as Vodafone.

Strengthening India's Right to Privacy

The Delhi HC referred to the decision in Poorna Prajna Public School v. Central Information Commission & Ors. where the court had observed the following:

""The RTI Act includes in its ambit, the information relating to any private body which can be accessed by public authority under any law for the time being in force. Therefore, if a public authority has a right and is entitled to access information from a private body, under any other law, it is ""information"" as defined in Section 2(f) of the RTI Act. The term ""held by the or under the control of the public authority"" used in Section 2(j) of the RTI Act will include information which the public authority is entitled to access under any other law from a private body.""The Delhi HC in Poorna Prajna Public School v. Central Information Commission & Ors.

The ruling is yet another positive move towards protecting the right to privacy, which was reaffirmed as a fundamental right earlier last year in the case of K Puttaswamy v Union of India.

While the right to privacy is actionable against state parties, the K Puttaswamy case does clearly extend the horizontal applicability of the right of privacy for private companies (though it may be extended by way of subsequent decisions). Having said that, with the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 in the pipeline, non-state parties will be required to overhaul their existing data protection regimes to align it with the new law.

Checking Abuse of Mass- Surveillance

However, even the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 does not contain any safeguards from surveillance. Further, given the limited parliamentary time, it is also unlikely that this Draft Bill may pass through as law before next year's elections, and even if it does, it may not take complete effect owing to several transitory provisions, which permit the government to notify it in a phased manner over a term of 3 years.

Given this background and the limitations of the existing statutory approach, the decision by the High Court is a clear victory for privacy of individuals.

It is broadly in line with the recommendations of the Justice AP Shah Committee of Experts, which held that a person should be informed if their phone was tapped or put under surveillance after the surveillance ceases.

This is one of the most credible ways to prevent abuse and systems of mass surveillance. This judgment hence does two important things - it protects the privacy of the user and also paves the path for holding private companies accountable with respect to the data or information they possess of ordinary citizens.

As per the inquiry, the school head, education department officials and the doctors who examined the girl did not report the matter to the police. Copies of the letters are with TOI.

In November, TOI had reported that the commission has refrained itself from recommending action against the persons in question for delay in reporting the case as suggested in the Juvenile Justice Act and had left it to the concerned authorities to decide the punishment. Notably, this is the first time that the child rights commission has shown leniency in a serious case and not recommended FIR against every person from doctors to school heads and education department officials who did not report the matter to the police as per the Act suggests.

As per the information, this was done because the school authorities were found to be unaware about the law that applied in such a case.

In 2015, CCPCR had acted the other way and recommended FIR against the school management of a private Chandigarh school for delaying to report the molestation case of a pre-primary student. The conductor of the school bus had molested a kindergarten student in the bus. Recently, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed a lower court to proceed against a the school principal who had failed to act even after knowing about the molestation.

The JJ Act states under Section 19 (1) that any person who has the apprehension that an offence is likely to be committed or has the knowledge that an offence has been committed, should bring the incident to the notice of the special juvenile police unit or the local police. The failure to report such an offence is punishable with imprisonment or fine or both.

Failing to report the commission of an offence under Section 19 (1) or failing to record such offence under section 19 (2) is punishable under Section 21

(2) which states that any person, being in-charge of any company or an institution (by whatever name called) who fails to report the commission of an offence in respect of a subordinate under his control, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year and with fine.

This panel can be seen without any password.

Applicants appearing in this panel are being sent state-level SMS for them to be present in the school till December 20 to send application. Applicants registered in gfms portal must submit their application portal generated by the score card.

Instructions for approval of the panel of applications received on December 27 at the school level have been given to the District Education Officers. Applications of the applicants, who are not registered in the gfms portal, can be received by the school till December 25. The entry of selected guest teachers has been asked to be completed by December 30 in the gfms portal.

Due to less number of applicants in the English panel in secondary and high school, permission has been given to keep applicants with higher qualifications in the English panel.

They will receive the honorarium of guest teachers. Apart from the Sanskrit panel, guest teachers will be placed in the schools with Urdu students, after the approval of the Urdu post apart in addition to Sanskrit as per nomination.

Similarly, due to the less number of postgraduate applicants in the agriculture faculty, graduates will be invited for the post of guest teachers. Candidates should have a Bachelor's degree with Mathematics or Physics or Engineering subjects for Mathematics subject. Hence the graduates from engineering will be eligible for qualifying in Mathematics subject."

Although she is singing loudly and powerfully, her words fall on my ears slowly, deliberately -- perhaps because I am shaken by what she is doing -- and like a sponge, I want to absorb every single thing she is saying.

Maltirao Baudh during her performance. All images courtesy of the author.

We are at the 20th-anniversary celebrations of NCDHR (National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights) and since morning, a lot has happened -- panel discussions, speeches, declarations. Everyone has spoken about revolution, politics and Ambedkar. But as Asha Zech, General Secretary of AIDMAM (All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch) observed -- no revolution is as powerful as Maltirao Baudh's voice.

She stands tall onstage. Her pink dupatta never slipping off her shoulder, even if she's moving, dancing, gesturing -- which she does very often. I like to think that this is not just the job of safety pins. Something else is at work here.

Behind her, sit three men with a harmonium, a dholak, and a banjo. Maltirao looks at them often -- responding to each of their beats with a ferocious nod, and sometimes with an invitation to leave the instruments and come join her celebration.

When she sings about Ambedkar, she sings with the pride of a mother praising her son and the abandon of a devotee waiting for many more Ambedkars to be born again and again.

""Karshako toh apni wadi main woh honhar paida karo -- aur rukh hawaaon ka badal do -- woh ashar paida karo -- agar jeena hai iss duniya main, arre insaan ki zindagi -- toh har ek ghar main, ek ek Ambedkar ko paida karo""

(Bring a promise into the world that can change the direction of wind -- let there be one-one Ambedkar in each house if you want to live like a human being)

In another part of the same world, I imagine many men in Saffron frothing at the mouth and rolling on the floor, weeping -- as Maltirao says this:

""Kyunki hamare bhim ne aisa samvidhan diya hain, dharti kabhi jhukti nahi asmaan ke aage aur koyi dusra rasta nahi, samshaan ke aage. Arre aakhir ram mandir ka bhi faisla court main aagaya kyunki ram ko bhi jhukna pada samvidhaan ke aage""

(Because our Bhim has given us such a constitution -- where the earth will never bow down before the sky and there will be no other road beyond a graveyard. After all, even the Ayodhya verdict has been decided in court because even your Lord Ram had to bow down before our constitution)

""Bhim aise ek asra hai, zaha uzhala hi uzhala kar dala -- hamein jo andhere main rakhte the, unka toh mooh kala hi kala kar dala""

(Bhim is a weapon who has brought light everywhere and he has blackened the faces of those who kept us in darkness before)

You never know what you are going to get when you listen to her. The first couple of stanzas in her songs are popular Bollywood numbers - with their lyrics intact. But the next couple of stanzas offer shock, pause, and reflection - all in one line. So you'll never know that after singing the first few lines of 'Hume toh loot liya milke husna waalon ne' - the next lines are going to be 'Hume toh loot liya dekho chai wale ne'.

***

When she begins singing about Savitri Mai, her sweat becomes her tears and her tears become her sweat. All around me, men and women are removing their shawls and sweaters and clapping loudly. During Maltirao's performance, there is no room for Dilli ki sardi (Delhi's winter).

When Savitri Mai walked to work every morning -- upper caste men and women stood with cow dung in their hands and threw it at her. She taught at a school that both she and Jotiba Phule had established for young girls despite upper-caste opposition and threats.

And with the voice of something that's soft, like honey, and harsh like jaggery -- Maltirao says that Savitrimai never bothered throwing the cow dung back at them. She didn't even run.

She walked calmly, receiving all the cow dung. She carried an extra sari in her bag and when she reached school, she'd change and wear the other one.

After school, she changed back into the cow dung sari knowing that like every day, they would be standing, there waiting with cow dung in their hands again -- almost as if they didn't move all day, almost as if the only point to their entire lives was holding cow dung in their hands, and waiting for Savitri Mai to return from work.

There is no word in the English language to explain how my body responded to this story. This story was like a slap, a punch, a seizure. It was an answer, a solution that Maltirao dropped heavily on my lap, like a sack of onions, and I caught it. I caught it and I am never letting it go.

Indeed how much time do I, and those like me, spend every day in defending our work against attacks? Sometimes it feels like all we ever actually do is defend our work. And if you are a DBA man or woman in academia today -- it's all you end up doing. Defending your writing, defending your classes, defending reservation, defending your course, defending your department and defending yourself. Against whom? Not important. Wait while I change my sari.

It never occurred to me that walking quietly and carrying an extra sari is the solution. The answer need not be taking the cow dung and throwing it back and getting late to work. The answer could simply be walking away. The answer could be loving oneself just a little more than hating others.

Watching Maltirao perform on stage is an experience in love. If Hannah Gadsby makes comedy confront anger, Maltirao makes anger confront love.

***

Next morning, at a writing workshop that I am conducting for the Dalit women activists of AIDMAM, Maltirao Baudh tells us that she works as a midwife in Ambedkar colony, Ghaziabad. She has been suspended at least 12 times and right-wing goons have tried to kill her at least four times. The last time this happened, the bullet passed by her ear and wounded her husband who was hospitalised for months.

We have to prod her to tell us about the first three times she was shot at, even though Maltirao dismisses it as 'kuch nahi hua' (nothing happened).

Apparently, the first two times happened in the middle of her performance and she had to be rushed backstage. The third time, the goons arrived at her house and waited for her to get out of the car. But they were in a hurry to kill her and began firing at the car. They emptied all their bullets which, much like the historical cow dung -- fell about lifelessly, and Maltirao survived.

Maltirao Baudh

Someone asks her about why she was suspended and she tells us about the Panditjis in Ghaziabad who hate her and her guts. They keep preventing her from working. The last time this happened, she chased a Panditji down the road, held him by the collar and slapped him.

""Patak patak ke maara,"" she says showing us pictures of this spectacle on her phone. All of us clapped and howled madly.

***

Aapko dar nahi lagta? (Aren't you afraid?)

""Arre dar kis baat ka? Marenge toh manch pe marenge -- gaana gaate gaate (Why fear? If I die, I'll die on stage -- singing"".

I am curious about her response to the Savarna audience who watch her perform. The ones who make faces and sulk, the ones who think they know better and don't use either guns or cow dung to attack.

She says ""Mujhe yeh doubt hain dil main, ki aise log humse bohat darte hain (Somewhere in my heart, I have a doubt that these people are very afraid of us)"".

So what do we do? How to deal with them?

""Apne shabdon se maaron unko (Kill them with your words)"".

So many answers.

They want your democracy. They're hovering just beyond the horizon in those black helicopters. They control the media and Wall Street. They've burrowed into a deep state that stretches like a vast tectonic plate beneath America's fragile government institutions. They want to replace the United States with the United Nations, erase national borders, and create one huge, malevolent international order.

The only thing that stands in their way is -- take your pick -- the Second Amendment, Twitter, or Donald Trump.

Conspiracy theorists have, in fact, been warning about just such a New World Order for decades, going all the way back to the isolationist critics of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and to fears about the United Nations in the post-World War II moment. During the Cold War, the John Birch Society and fringe elements of the Republican Party nurtured just such anti-globalist sentiments, but they never made much headway in the mainstream world. As the Cold War ended, however, the anti-globalist virus began to spread again, this time more rapidly, and it's threatening to become a pandemic.

The Agenda 21 Dystopia

On September 11, 1990, just after Saddam Hussein ordered the invasion of Kuwait and just before the reunification of Germany, George H.W. Bush spoke of a ""new world order"" that would unite all countries in defense of the rule of law and thwart the Iraqi autocrat's regional ambitions. The phrase was meant as a rallying cry, not an actual plan, but that didn't stop the president's America First critics from reading all manner of mayhem into his speech.

The elder Bush, who had long toiled in the shadow of Ronald Reagan, was in some ways a curious target for those who feared the end of U.S. sovereignty. As recent posthumous assessments revealed, he was an early champion of states' rights (against civil rights), supported prayer in school and the NRA, made a U-turn as a presidential candidate to oppose abortion, launched wars in Panama and the Persian Gulf, and presided over the collapse of the Soviet Union. Anti-globalists, however, focused on a different part of Bush's résumé: he'd gone to Yale, later belonged to a wealthy elite of Texas oil barons, served as ambassador to the United Nations, and was a card-carrying member of both the Council on Foreign Relations and that most elite of global agenda-setting outfits, the Trilateral Commission.

Such characteristics made him particularly vulnerable to attacks from the far right. Preacher Pat Robertson, for instance, disliked Bush's staid Episcopalianism and resented losing to the future president in the 1988 Republican primaries. In his 1991 bestseller, The New World Order, Robertson refocused all his ire on the president's presumed global ambitions. ""Is George Bush merely an idealist or are there now plans underway to merge the interests of the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the United Nations?"" he asked rhetorically and then, of course, provided the answer:

""A single thread runs from the White House to the State Department to the Council on Foreign Relations to the Trilateral Commission to secret societies to extreme New Agers. There must be a new world order... There must be world government, a world police force, world courts, world banking and currency, and a world elite in charge of it all.""

Though that 1991 book is largely forgotten, the televangelist's attacks on Bush's ""globalism"" resurfaced again and again in different forms. Beginning in 1994, for instance, Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins' Left Behind series spun Robertson's dire predictions of a one-world government into 16 novels and several dreadful movies. Just to ensure that readers wouldn't miss their point, they even installed the anti-Christ as the head of the United Nations. More recently, Donald Trump's attacks on Hillary Clinton's elitism echoed some of the very themes Robertson had sounded almost three decades earlier.

Oddly, though, Bush and Robertson agreed on one thing, on which they even found common ground with former Vice President Al Gore: the importance of addressing climate change.

As president, Bush pushed a number of environmental initiatives related to air quality, ozone depletion, and climate change more generally. In 1992, his administration even endorsed a tepid ""action plan,"" Agenda 21, that came out of that year's global environmental meeting in Rio de Janeiro. In reality, it was just another of an endless stream of documents produced by such environmental conferences. For some Americans, however, those two words came to evoke the most terrifying aspect of the Bush era, proof positive that he was covertly constructing the very New World Order that he had invoked.

Perhaps the leading proponent of Agenda 21 conspiracy theories has been TV and radio personality Glenn Beck. In 2012, he even published a dystopian novel called (you won't be surprised to learn) Agenda 21. In it, he and co-author Harriet Parke fingered environmentalists as the true agents of the coming apocalypse and issued dire warnings about climate change becoming the lever a future global authority would use to eradicate national sovereignty and enslave Americans to a collective vision. ""Just a generation ago, this place was called America,"" Beck and Parke wrote. ""Now, after the worldwide implementation of a UN-led program called Agenda 21, it's simply known as 'the Republic.' There is no president. No Congress. No Supreme Court. No freedom.""

Once you start looking for Agenda 21, it pops up in all sorts of strange places. Newt Gingrich ran for president in 2012 with a pledge to rescind the ""plan."" Ted Cruz linked it to -- you guessed it -- George Soros and warned that its implementation would deprive Americans of their right to play golf (no joke). Most recently, YouTube and Twitter have lit up with contrived reports that Agenda 21, not climate change, was somehow responsible for the latest California wildfires.

And here's the truly bizarre part: while Glenn Beck, Newt Gingrich, Ted Cruz, and the rest of them were nattering on about an obscure, non-binding U.N. document, they were missing the real story. A nightmarish New World Order was indeed being constructed around them. It's global, malevolent, aimed at destroying ever more American lives, and -- according to a recent Trump administration report -- getting worse by the minute."

One news report suggests Anuskha Sharma and Sonam Kapoor's bridal lehenga's were the market callings last year. In Delhi's Gaffar Market and Linking Road, Mumbai these designs varied the range of Rs,12,000 to 1 lakh. Delhi are not two exceptions but a stroll in Brigade Road, Bangalore and Vardaman Market in Kolkata presents us the same picture. The most coveted brands such as 'Moncler', 'Gucci' , 'Armani' 'Louis Vuitton', 'Versace', 'Hermes' 'Heron Preston', 'Kenzo' and many more might be a big deal for some but the street markets across the country are thriving on first and second copies of these names. The penetration of internet has made accessible the ""duplicate goods"" to consumers from every section of the society. These practices certainly questions the Indian IP enforcement mechanisms but also casts doubt over the competency of present IP laws in fashion industry as a whole. The practices of design piracy and knock off is not merely middle class chase for luxury lifestyle but the practice is prevalent among the designers themselves and thus discourages the fashion industry for 'original works'.

@dietsabya, an Instagram handle inspired by New York based @diet_prada, social media fashion watchdog has been incessantly working to make the public aware about the blatant plagiarism by the designers themselves, sometime from young college students and sometimes foreign designers. As per Diet investigations renowned fashion designer Anita Dhongre copied designs from the students of JD institute.

Indian IP laws, specifically The Copyright Act,1957 and The Designs Act, 2000 gives two kinds of protection in the designer clothes . First is the protection for the drawings on any garment that may not necessarily include the shape/design of the garment itself . @dietsabya highlights this kind of copying by famous designer Nashish Soni onto Alexader Wangny's slogan. The second category includes the design/shape of the garment itself, attributing to its unique fabric and tailoring. Designers are aggressively pushing to protect their design rights of this category. Rohit Bal in 2017 became the first designer in India to get copyright over his entire collection and the spree was followed by number of other designers thereafter.

Kal Raustiala and Christopher Jon Springman in her paper ""The Piracy Paradox : Innovation and Intellectual Property in Fashion Design "" describes this problem as ""Copying enables designs and styles to move quickly from early adopters to the masses. And since no one cool wants to keep wearing something after everybody else is wearing it, the copying of designs helps fuel the incessant demand for something new.""

It contributes approximately 2 percent to the country's GDP and 14 per cent to overall Index of Industrial Production (IIP). The industry has also attracted FDI worth US$ 2.55 billion during April 2000 to June 2017. Just like Indian democracy the fashion industry in India is too diverse. Some have classified the sector as per their purchasing power and social reach namely- ""Premier fashion""; ""luxury segment""; ""Affordable luxury"" and ""Mains stream brands"".

It is thus more relevant today that such a huge sector is not trapped in complex web of laws functioning across domains . Currently it is majorly regulated by Intellectual Property laws - Copyright Act 1957, The Trademarks Act, 1999, Designs Act 2000, and Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999, however none of the them is sufficient to deal with the sector in entirety.

Before the next collection for designers is launched, one question that disturbs the designers the most is how to prevent others from copying their original work which has been produced after rigorous intellectual labour. Whether to seek copyright protection of their original work or get the design registered to ensure its full scale commercial exploitation. This designer's dilemma came to the courtroom in Ritika Private Limited v. Biba Apparels Private Limited. In this case, the plaintiff, a boutique apparel designer brand, brought a suit against the defendants who have been a leading name in ethnic wear, for an injunction to prevent reproduction,printing, publishing, selling or offering the prints or garments for which the plaintiff claimed to be the first owner. The legal issue raised in this case was that once the copyrighted works of the plaintiff are applied for the making of any dress, and production of that dress exceeds 50 in number, whether the plaintiff losses ownership of her copyright works . The court made a distinction between designs eligible for copyright protection under the Copyright Act, 1957 and the Designs Act,2000. It held that copyright protects the original expression of the ""artistic work"" and offers limited protection to the commercial exploitation of the same, whereas the Designs Act is the chief tool to protect industrial application of the design, however the design need not to be always original. The court decided the dispute in favour of the defendants and the suit thus dismissed,relying on the bar under Section 15(2) of the Copyright Act, 1957. It was also held that had the facts been different from the 'application of the designs' to 'direct lifting of the design' the answer would have also differed. Here the 'direct lifting' would mean copy pasting the copyright work from its original form. Ultimately the web of IP laws proved to be counterproductive for Ritika Private Limited.

The need is being recognised globally to sync the laws relating to fashion industry and develop exclusive programs to make fashion lawyers more aware about their duties and responsibilities and bring consumer sensitization about their choices . The infamous Rana Plaza incident which killed over 1,100 garment workers in Bangladesh highlights the poor labour enforcement by the global fashion leaders such as ZARA and H&M. Thus there is a need for everyone to be aware about legal issues facing the fashion industry ranging from merchandising, distribution and franchising agreements to intellectual property and labour laws.

Multiple law schools have designed their curriculum focusing to cater the needs of fashion industry these include Fordham Law School, world's first Fashion Law Institute working with the support of the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Diane von Furstenberg offering JDand LL.M programs to the students. The course includes specialty in Fashion Law and Finance and Fashion Ethics, Sustainability and Development. In India such focused opportunities are quite limited. No full time graduation program is available but IIFD, Chandigarh offers limited opportunities on Fashion Retail Law in India and Diploma in Fashion & Law. Some short term courses are also available to students by leaders in global fashion industry these include coveted program by Milano Fashion institute offering exposure to brand protection ; fashion negotiations and specific agreements for the industry ;supply chain issues ; issues related to counterfeiting & fashion forgery.

One thing is clear the ad-hoc approach would serve no purpose and comprehensive and focused approach needs to be followed that cater all the interest of fashion industry in the country.

We at Khurana and Khurana are standing closely with the Fashion Industry, we have a dedicated team looking after Fashion Law issues.

Social media was abuzz on Tuesday, the day after Rising Kashmir reported that the Jammu and Kashmir school education department had banned people wearing the traditional pheran in its zonal offices. The paper added: ""The development comes in the backdrop of a similar ban on the pheran in the civil secretariat (Srinagar) where the commoners visiting the administrative departments have to relinquish it at the main gate.

The report drew sharp criticism from several quarters. ""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned!"" tweeted National Conference leader and former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah. ""This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn.""

He also posted a photo of his father Farooq Abdullah and him wearing the traditional attire.

Before long, the #saynotopharanban hashtag gained prominence on Twitter, with Kashmiris posting photos of them wearing the double gown.

In September, the General Administration Department of the Civil Secretariat in Srinagar asked government officials to ""be attired in proper formal dress while appearing before any court of law and while attending offices in the State of Jammu and Kashmir and strictly avoid casual or party attire"".

The order was passed a month after the state High Court asked the government to announce an official dress code for officials attending court. The court issued the directive after it found a government officer in court not ""in proper dress"".

The order does not mention any particular form of attire. But, since the pheran is considered to be a casual dress, it is considered by some to be inappropriate in government offices.

According to the Rising Kashmir, the zonal education officer in Langate tehsil, following the civil secretariat directive, issued an order last week banning the pheran. However, the chief education officer of Kupwara told Scroll.in that the order was withdrawn on Tuesday. ""There is an official dress code but we cannot ignore the significance of pheran,"" said Mohammad Shafi War. ""That is why we have withdrawn the order issued by ZEO Langate.""

However, as Rising Kashmir reported, people visiting the secretariat in Srinagar are asked to take off their pherans and put them atop iron poles outside the gates. Officials explained that this is part of security protocol, since the pheran is a voluminous garment that could be used to conceal banned items."

A photograph of Marx overlooks stacks of plastic chairs, crammed bookshelves and an old desktop computer in an office on the ground floor of a building in central Mumbai. On the evening of January 12, a group of electricity workers affiliated with the Mumbai Electric Employees Union met here. They worked for Reliance Energy, which supplied electricity to homes in the city's suburbs. Despite working for the company for around two decades, laying cables and excavating new lines, they were not permanent employees - they were hired by contractors, who supplied labour to the company.

The previous few weeks had been tumultuous. The company was in the middle of a major transition: its ownership was changing hands, with the Adani Group in the process of taking over.

During this period, a worker died on December 19. He was returning home from work when he fainted and hit his head, resulting in a brain haemorrhage. All the workers in the area - permanent and contract - went on a one-day strike to force the company to pay full-duty compensation to his family.

It seemed like a victory - except, on January 1, the contract workers found they had been marked absent for the day of the strike, while the permanent workers had not. When the union raised this, four workers were suspended on January 9.

Three days later, the union met in their Dadar office to discuss this suspension. Hours later, close to midnight, four of its members found men in plain clothes at their doorstep.

""At around 11.45 pm, around 15 to 20 people came to our door,"" said Rajitha, wife of Satyanarayana Karrela, 40, one of the union members. ""We did not know who they were as they were in civil dress. When we asked they just told us they had work with us.""

The men made the couple sit with their backs to each other and asked them to stay silent as they went about ransacking the house. At the end of the search, they said that they had to take Karrela with them. Panicking that he was about to be kidnapped, Rajitha seized her husband's arm and refused to let go. At this point, she said, the men announced they were the police. They said Karrela would be released in the morning. When she still refused to let go, they wrote an address and phone number on a piece of paper and told her to come there the next morning.

Similar stories played out at the houses of other union members that night - Babushankar Vanguri, 30, Shankar Gunde, 40, and Ravi Marampelli, 40. Large groups of police in plain clothes appeared close to midnight, searched their houses and took them away.

This was no ordinary police detail - it was the Anti-Terrorism Squad of the Maharashtra Police. As the families of the union members found out later, the arrests had been made under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which punishes those proved guilty of working with banned organisations. In this case, the ATS claims the workers had been funding the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), which has been fighting a protracted guerilla war in central and eastern India for decades with the aim of overthrowing the government.

How exactly had low-paid workers in Mumbai, who barely earned enough to support their families in India's most expensive city, saved money to send to an underground organisation?

The police claims they did so by raising money from contractors.

At the heart of the police claims, as outlined in its 5,000-page chargesheet submitted in May, are two bank cheques of Rs 1.5 lakh each. Issued in May 2017, the cheques was signed by three office bearers of a contractors association that supplied labour to Reliance Energy. The police claim the workers encashed the cheques and passed on the money to a Maoist operative, who further transferred the money to underground Maoists in Telangana.

But other union members have a simpler explanation for the cheques: they say they were written in support of the union's annual May Day function.

""The workers organised May Day functions every year and get donations from the contractors association for this,"" said N Vasudevan of the New Trade Union Initiative that backs the contract workers' union.

On the same day that they arrested the four union members, the police also arrested Narsaiah Jumpala, one of the three signatories of the cheques and a member of the contractors association. Anjaiah Anthati, president of the association, said there was no coercion at the contractor association meeting at which they decided to sign the cheques. The association, he claimed, makes donations to all workers unions every few years and that too in ""white"" money, by cheque, not cash.

""We can conduct our business only if we have good relations with them,"" said Anthati. ""If we tell them, 'No, go, we won't give you anything', then at some point, the union people will cause trouble for us. That is why we tell them we will take care of them. For this, we have to give them chai paani (money).""

But the police has cited witness statements from at least unnamed 12 contractors in support of its claims. These feature as part of the chargesheet, among the 100-odd statements which have been cited after redacting witness names.

Strikingly, all 12 statements contain identical paragraphs about how the workers introduced a man named ""Mahesh"", who they claimed worked for ""the Party"". ""As I am a resident of Andhra Pradesh, I know that in our native place, Naxalites are recognised as being of the 'party,'"" reads every single statement as translated into Marathi, purportedly made independently in Hindi by each contractor. ""Since then, we became afraid of the topic of Mahesh and whenever Ravi Marampelli, Satyanarayana Karrela and Shankar Gunde asked us for money, we always gave them money out of fear.""

Said Atul Chandra Kulkarni, additional director general of police in charge of the Anti-Terrorism Squad, ""If they have made identical statements to us, that is why we have recorded it that way.""

On January 12, along with four workers and the contractor, the police also arrested a man named Ajay Dasari, who they allege is the Maoist operative who workers introduced as ""Mahesh"". The seventh arrest, also made the same day, was of Ramesh Gondiala, 37, a pro-Telangana poet and activist who worked as a milk delivery man near Kalyan, on the outskirts of Mumbai. In February, another worker, Saidulu Singapanga, 36, was taken into custody, taking the total number of arrests in the case to eight.

This isn't the only Maoist case brought by the Maharashtra police against urban residents. Over June and August, Pune police arrested ten lawyers and activists, accusing them of working with the banned CPI (Maoist) and labelling them ""Urban Naxals"". These arrests too were made under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. Often described as draconian with vague definitions, it allows the police to hold the accused in prison for long periods by prohibiting the courts to grant bail as long as the accusation made by the police appears ""prima facie true"".

""As far as Maharashtra is concerned, there are very few UAPA cases,"" said Nihalsingh Rathod, a Nagpur lawyer with the Indian Association of People's Lawyers. ""Most cases are invoked against Islamic terrorism. The rest are concentrated in Gadchiroli district [in eastern Maharashtra, where there is a Maoist presence].""

Of the few in western Maharashtra, one is the union workers' case. Another is the 2011 case against alleged Maoist Angela Sontakke and the Kabir Kala Manch, a cultural organisation based in Pune, members of which have since been released on bail. In 2015, the Anti-Terrorism Squad arrested Konnath Muralidharan, a Maoist leader from Kerala while he was being treated at a hospital near Pune.

Given the prominence of the ten activists arrested between June and August, and a legal challenge to their arrests in the Supreme Court, discussions on the misuse of this 1960 law were briefly revived, before receding again.

According to Indiaspend, as many as 2,700 cases were filed under UAPA in three years between 2014 and 2016. Of the 33 trials under the law completed in 2016, it reported, 67% ended in acquittals. Evidence in several of these cases tends to be vague.

""I think a lot of leeway is given to the prosecuting agency at the pre-charge stage because it's their word against what the accused have to say,"" said senior advocate Rebecca John, who has argued several cases under the act. ""I don't think enough judicial scrutiny takes place at this stage. And very few of these cases end in conviction. For the prosecution, the period of incarceration is itself the punishment.""

A common thread that connects all of the men arrested on January 12 is the place where they came from: Telangana. Or more specifically, the two districts of Nalgonda and Karimnagar. Also common is their caste background: the workers are all Dalits.

The Mumbai Electric Employees Union was established in 2005, after a worker died while on duty. As contract workers, they were entitled to a compensation of only Rs 25,000 but as union members claim, they successfully forced the company to increase it Rs 6.5 lakh. Since then, the union grew in strength, attracting a large membership of around 1,000 of the company's 4,000 contract workers, many of whom are Telugu-speaking migrants. The Shiv Sena-affiliated Mumbai Electric Workers' Union, which is the only union which is recognised by the company and the Labour Commissioner, claims to represent all contract workers, apart from the 3,500-odd permanent workers, many of whom are Marathi-speaking.

All the arrested workers were office-bearers of the Mumbai Electric Employees Union and played a crucial role in every negotiation with the company and contractors. They all lived in and around Ghatkopar in central Mumbai with their wives and young children and had each been with the electricity company for around at least 15-20 years.

Work conditions were severe at first, say members of the union who worked with their arrested counterparts. Each day, they would go to the company's electricity office and contractors would tell them how many of them would get work for that day. Often, workers would return home empty-handed. With the formation of their union, however, working conditions changed. One of their first struggles was to ensure that all contract workers would get work daily. The arrested workers were active in ensuring this.

In their spare time, they organised reading groups and kept their fellow workers updated with political pamphlets and books related to Marxist, Ambedkarite and pro-Telangana ideology, said Vasudevan. Despite their long stint in the metropolis, the union members had strong connections to their homelands and were active in supporting the movement for a new Telangana state. When Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the new Telangana Rashtra Samiti government promised three acres of land each to landless Dalit farmers. The workers, said Vasudevan, made several trips back home in the hope of getting land.

A Telangana-based researcher specialising in human rights and law, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that many migrants did indeed come back in droves in the first year of the new government, thinking they had to be physically present to avail of the scheme. However, the scheme has not materialised. The workers had grown disenchanted with the new government, said Vasudevan.

According to their co-workers, all the arrested shared an interest in Ambedkarite and Marxist ideas. At all their homes, the police found books, magazines and pamphlets related to this ideology. At Singapanga's home, the police found copies of Veekshanam, a magazine edited by N Venugopal, a Telugu poet, literary critic and journalist.

""We have even published their letters in Veekshanam,"" said Venugopal, who knew six of the eight accused. ""That way they are socially active. But the charge the police is making now is preposterous and unbelievable.""

The police chargesheet contains a screenshot of an email sent by one of the arrested workers, Vanguri, to another arrested worker, Singapanga, inviting him to an event at Ramabai Nagar to protest the arrest of Manda Krishna Madiga, a Telugu Dalit rights activist living in Telangana. Krishna, who was subsequently released, has spoken against the Maoist party for betraying the cause of workers.

But an official of the Anti-Terrorism Squad, who did not want to be identified, claimed the workers' union itself was as an overground organisation of the Maoists. Such organisations are part of the Golden Corridor Committee plan, he said, through which Maoists seek to infiltrate industrial areas in western India.

By all accounts, the workers, however, showed greater interest in Ambedkarite ideas. On December 31, they travelled to Pune in a group of 40 to take part in the anti-caste commemoration at Bhima Koregaon near Pune, where Dalit soldiers with the East India Company had trounced the casteist Peshwa-led army of the Maratha empire in 1818. ""I had gone there for the first time because it was the 200th anniversary of the battle,"" said Saidulu Gondrigalla, one of the suspended workers who was part of the group. ""We saw the [memorial] pillar in the morning, while the garlands were still being put up, then returned to Pune for the Elgaar Parishad,"" a conference being held to mark the anniversay.

While they returned to Mumbai on January 1, back in Bhima Koregaon, Dalits came under attack that day, sparking a strike and caste clashes, which spread across western Maharashtra. By the second week of January, police had conducted sweeping arrests of Dalits they believed to have participated in the violence.

When news of the workers' arrests first came, their colleagues thought this might be related to this action. However, given that the arrested workers were all union members, they also wondered whether this had anything to do with their last protest against the management in December.

The chargesheet is silent on both.

Spokespersons of both Reliance Infrastructure and Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited declined to comment on the case or the suspension of the employees.

""We are not pursuing any such past matters,"" said a spokesperson for Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited in response to a detailed questionnaire. ""It's a brand new company and a brand new way to do things. We took over on August 29 and this is a matter of last year December and January.""

A representative of Reliance Infrastructure, the holding company for Reliance Energy, also declined to comment. ""As discussed, as this business is now with Adani Electricity, you may write to Adani Electricity,"" a Reliance Infrastructure spokesperson wrote in reply to Scroll.in's questions.

Other than the workers, those arrested in the case include Jumpala, the contractor, Dasari, the alleged Maoist operative, and Gondiala, a poet and activist whose connection to the workers is tenuous.

As general secretary of the contractors association, Narsaiah Jumpala was one of the authorised signatories for cheques issued by the organisation. He had a reputation within the association for being sympathetic to the cause of workers, according to both his wife, other workers in the union, and even the head of the contractors' association.

When the worker who later died was admitted to a hospital in December, the contractor who was his employer called Jumpala for advice, according to his wife. Jumpala told the contractor to go to the hospital. ""[The contractor] said he was afraid to go there alone as the workers would be agitated,"" she told Scroll.in. ""He then asked my husband to accompany him in the morning, as my husband has good relations with workers of other contractors as well.""

Anthati, president of the contractors' association told Scroll.in that Jumpala did indeed have good relations with the workers. ""Vo worker ke piche hi rehta tha,"" he said. ""Jumpala was always with the workers, particularly that union...He used to favour them.""

The donation to the union came out of Jumpala's initiative, but the decision was taken collectively by 12 committee members, said Anthati. ""This fellow [Jumpala] only arranged the meeting for the workers,"" Anthati said. ""He asked me three times and I did not give him a time. The fourth time he asked me, I said all right and the entire committee sat and decided to give them money.""

There is not much information available about Ajay Dasari, the man the police claims the money was diverted to. The police chargesheet says he lived in Kalyan and even lists an address. But the address, a squat building adjacent to a larger bungalow, is occupied by families of Bihari and Jharkhand migrant workers, living there on rent. The wife of one of the workers confirmed the Anti-Terrorism Squad had visited this address on a Saturday in January, asking for Dasari.

The woman, who did not want to be identified, said Dasari was her husband's friend. They had met about five years ago while working at a cola factory in Kalyan and Dasari used to visit their home once or twice a month.

""Even now none of us can believe that he could be a terrorist like they said,"" the wife said. ""He always kept his eyes down, he spoke softly, did not look at any women, and never fought with anybody.""

Dasari told them that he lived with relatives in Thane, but that his wife and children were in his village in Telangana. They did not know much else about him.

The Telangana-based researcher found the police claims about a Maoist operative meeting openly with workers suspect.

""It is highly unlikely that if this person was a Maoist, he would go around telling people he was one,"" he said. ""In general, Maoists use cities as safe zones, where they don't take up any activity.""

An Anti-Terrorism Squad official familiar with the case who asked not to be identified agreed that ""Maoists keep their open activities away from secret ones to prevent detection."" However, he claimed that if Dasari was ""allowed access to both sides"", it indicated that he was in fact a ""high level functionary"".

It is not clear how Ramesh Gondiala, a poet and milkman, came to be linked to this case. A pro-Telangana activist from Nalgonda district, his connection with the workers is tenuous - according to Gondrigalla and Vasudevan, he met them in November 2013 at a meeting to support the formation of the state.

Venugopal, who wrote the preface to a book of poetry that Gondiala published, said his poetry covered issues of gender, Dalit rights, labour and the Telangana state.

Gondiala worked to deliver milk to houses in his neighbourhood and also worked as a driver. His wife told Scroll.in that he also regularly helped construction workers to arrange compensation or treatment for them if they suffered injuries or died while on duty.

The ATS also questioned another writer and translator, Prabhakar Macha, in the case. A teacher who was quite popular in Telugu writing circles, Venugopal said Macha was a significant link between Marathi and Telugu literature. He had written a 200-page book on the contribution of Telugu migrants to the building of Mumbai city.

In the first week of January, Macha's wife died. On January 23, a week after he was questioned by the ATS, he killed himself.

In the First Information Report filed hours after the arrests, the ATS claims its operative received a confidential tip-off from an informer, who told them that members of the Maoist party were raising money, recruiting new members and spreading Maoist propaganda to destabilise the nation. The informer said the members were going to congregate at Kalyan station at around 4.30 pm. The FIR charges seven men - excluding Singapanga at this stage - under sections 20, 38 and 39 of the the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which pertain to membership of and recruitment to banned organisations, but not to fundraising for them. The charges of fundraising appear only in the chargesheet.

In the chargesheet, the police claims to have CCTV footage from an apartment building in Tilak Nagar, which purportedly shows Dasari meeting the arrested workers between 12 pm to 3 pm.

The ATS claims in the FIR that it arrested Dasari at Kalyan station at 5.30 pm. Through his interrogation, within a matter of hours, it was able to get the residential addresses of seven accomplices. At midnight, in simultaneous raids, six men were arrested.

Saidulu Singapanga is not among the seven individuals named in this FIR. Like several other union members at the time, Singapanga too did not appear for work for some weeks after the other union members were arrested, fearing that it was the union itself being targeted. When he reported for work on February 5, he was arrested immediately.

But questions have been raised over the police claims.

Jumpala's wife pointed out only her husband was arrested, even though cheques from the contractors association require three signatures. The union's founding minutes, a copy of which is in the chargesheet, designates three individuals - the president, general secretary and treasurer - as elected officers for bank transactions.

""When I confronted [another contractor in the association] about this, he became very aggressive and started shouting at me,"" Jumpala's wife told Scroll.in. ""He said he had nothing to do with the cheques, and that my husband had signed a cheques in his personal capacity and handed them over for illegal activities.""

Anthati, president of the contractors' association, said that all three signatories had indeed signed two cheques, each amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh, but did not hand them over to the union representatives at the meeting because they did not have a receipt book with them.

""I told them we would give them the cheques only after they gave us the receipt,"" Anthati said. However, he added, a few days later, Jumpala took the cheques from the office assistant, saying that he was going to Chembur, would give them to the union people and bring back a receipt. This never happened. Instead, the cheques were made out to two individual members of the union and the receipt never made it to the association office, he claimed. Scroll.in could not independently confirm this.

It is not clear from the chargesheet how the money from the cheques was passed on to the Maoists, nor is it clear whether or how the accused recruited new members for the Maoist cause.

Most of all, what is mysterious are the 12 near-identical statements purportedly made by contractors to the police.

Anthati said that as he operated in Kandivali zone in another part of the city, he did not know what the others had said to the police and whether they knew that their statements in Hindi had been identically translated into Marathi. Contractors in the east zone deflected numerous attempts by Scroll.in over almost two months to speak with them.

Advocate Rebecca John said that identical statements were a common feature of the UAPA cases she was familiar with. ""It is common to have nebulous evidence, nothing very concrete,"" John said. ""The police looks into their personal lives, including their computers, so that even if you download an article, you can become a member by association. The police also gets surrendered Maoists to make statements in which there is a fair degree of police control. In a fair world none of these cases would see the light of day.""

However, Atul Chandra Kulkarni, additional director general of police in charge of the Anti-Terrorism Squad staunchly defended the investigation. ""UAPA cases are especially serious because I know that people don't get bail or they will get a longer prison term if convicted,"" he said. ""That is why I don't cook up evidence nor do I let my officers do so. But of course, I have the prerogative to take X [fact or person] and not Y in my case if it supports that. Facts will be chosen to marshal evidence.""

He pointed out that his team was simultaneously working on a case involving Hindutva extremists who had been arrested with large caches of weapons and bombs.

Ten months after the arrests, the families of the union members are struggling. Reduced to single-income households, one family left for their village in Telangana, unable to pay the rent for their room. The others are being supported by women who have taken up domestic work to make ends meet. There is uncertainty over whether they would be able to pay their children's school fees.

There are other consequences too. The families of the workers were reluctant to meet Scroll.in in their homes to avoid drawing more attention to themselves. They said the ATS officials still visit them regularly, making their neighbours wary of them. One of their landlords even asked them to leave, to avoid the police attention.

Since the arrests, the scrappy union, which took on the company to fight for provident funds, safety equipment, identity cards and even a kind of job security with assured daily work to all its members, has become somewhat dormant.

""Because of this atmosphere, the workers are scared that if they remain with our union, they too will be arrested,"" Vasudevan said.

There are other losses which the workers rue, including the hard-earned one of dignity.

""When we go to make demands of the contractor now, they tell us to go away or we will also be arrested,"" said Laxman Bomma, one of the workers suspended on January 9. ""They normally give us our new uniforms in January, but we have not got that this year. We now have to go to Vile Parle to collect our salaries, when earlier they would give it at the offices where we report for work.""

Said Gondrigalla, ""Earlier, they would treat us with some respect and dignity. That is no longer there."""

Although she is singing loudly and powerfully, her words fall on my ears slowly, deliberately -- perhaps because I am shaken by what she is doing -- and like a sponge, I want to absorb every single thing she is saying.

Maltirao Baudh during her performance. All images courtesy of the author.

We are at the 20th-anniversary celebrations of NCDHR (National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights) and since morning, a lot has happened -- panel discussions, speeches, declarations. Everyone has spoken about revolution, politics and Ambedkar. But as Asha Zech, General Secretary of AIDMAM (All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch) observed -- no revolution is as powerful as Maltirao Baudh's voice.

She stands tall onstage. Her pink dupatta never slipping off her shoulder, even if she's moving, dancing, gesturing -- which she does very often. I like to think that this is not just the job of safety pins. Something else is at work here.

Behind her, sit three men with a harmonium, a dholak, and a banjo. Maltirao looks at them often -- responding to each of their beats with a ferocious nod, and sometimes with an invitation to leave the instruments and come join her celebration.

When she sings about Ambedkar, she sings with the pride of a mother praising her son and the abandon of a devotee waiting for many more Ambedkars to be born again and again.

""Karshako toh apni wadi main woh honhar paida karo -- aur rukh hawaaon ka badal do -- woh ashar paida karo -- agar jeena hai iss duniya main, arre insaan ki zindagi -- toh har ek ghar main, ek ek Ambedkar ko paida karo""

(Bring a promise into the world that can change the direction of wind -- let there be one-one Ambedkar in each house if you want to live like a human being)

In another part of the same world, I imagine many men in Saffron frothing at the mouth and rolling on the floor, weeping -- as Maltirao says this:

""Kyunki hamare bhim ne aisa samvidhan diya hain, dharti kabhi jhukti nahi asmaan ke aage aur koyi dusra rasta nahi, samshaan ke aage. Arre aakhir ram mandir ka bhi faisla court main aagaya kyunki ram ko bhi jhukna pada samvidhaan ke aage""

(Because our Bhim has given us such a constitution -- where the earth will never bow down before the sky and there will be no other road beyond a graveyard. After all, even the Ayodhya verdict has been decided in court because even your Lord Ram had to bow down before our constitution)

""Bhim aise ek asra hai, zaha uzhala hi uzhala kar dala -- hamein jo andhere main rakhte the, unka toh mooh kala hi kala kar dala""

(Bhim is a weapon who has brought light everywhere and he has blackened the faces of those who kept us in darkness before)

You never know what you are going to get when you listen to her. The first couple of stanzas in her songs are popular Bollywood numbers - with their lyrics intact. But the next couple of stanzas offer shock, pause, and reflection - all in one line. So you'll never know that after singing the first few lines of 'Hume toh loot liya milke husna waalon ne' - the next lines are going to be 'Hume toh loot liya dekho chai wale ne'.

***

When she begins singing about Savitri Mai, her sweat becomes her tears and her tears become her sweat. All around me, men and women are removing their shawls and sweaters and clapping loudly. During Maltirao's performance, there is no room for Dilli ki sardi (Delhi's winter).

When Savitri Mai walked to work every morning -- upper caste men and women stood with cow dung in their hands and threw it at her. She taught at a school that both she and Jotiba Phule had established for young girls despite upper-caste opposition and threats.

And with the voice of something that's soft, like honey, and harsh like jaggery -- Maltirao says that Savitrimai never bothered throwing the cow dung back at them. She didn't even run.

She walked calmly, receiving all the cow dung. She carried an extra saree in her bag and when she reached school, she'd change and wear the other one.

After school, she changed back into the cow dung saree knowing that like every day, they would be standing, there waiting with cow dung in their hands again -- almost as if they didn't move all day, almost as if the only point to their entire lives was holding cow dung in their hands, and waiting for Savitri Mai to return from work.

There is no word in the English language to explain how my body responded to this story. This story was like a slap, a punch, a moment of seize. It was an answer, a solution that Maltirao dropped heavily on my lap, like a sack of onions, and I caught it. I caught it loudly and I am never letting it go.

Indeed how much time do I, and those like me spend every day in defending our work against attacks? Sometimes it feels like all we ever actually do is defend our work. And if you are a DBA man or woman in academia today -- it's all you end up doing. Defending your writing, defending your classes, defending reservation, defending your course, defending your department and defending yourself. Against whom? Not important. Wait while I change my saree.

It never occurred to me that walking quietly and carrying an extra saree is the solution. The answer need not be taking the cow dung and throwing it back and getting late to work. The answer could simply be walking away. The answer could be loving oneself just a little more than hating others.

Watching Maltirao perform on stage is an experience in love. If Hannah Gadsby makes comedy confront anger, Maltirao makes anger confront love.

***

Next morning, at a writing workshop that I am conducting for the Dalit women activists of AIDMAM, Maltirao Baudh tells us that she works as a midwife in Ambedkar colony, Ghaziabad. She has been suspended at least 12 times and right-wing goons have tried to kill her at least four times. The last time this happened, the bullet passed by her ear and wounded her husband who was hospitalised for months.

We have to prod her to tell us about the first three times she was shot at, even though Maltirao dismisses it as 'kuch nahi hua' (nothing happened).

Apparently, the first two times happened in the middle of her performance and she had to be rushed backstage. The third time, the goons arrived at her house and waited for her to get out of the car. But they were in a hurry to kill her and began firing at the car. They emptied all their bullets which, much like the historical cow dung -- fell about lifelessly, and Maltirao survived.

Maltirao Baudh

Someone asks her about why she was suspended and she tells us about the Panditjis in Ghaziabad who hate her and her guts. They keep preventing her from working. The last time this happened, she chased a Panditji down the road, held him by the collar and slapped him.

'Patak patak ke maara' she says showing us pictures of this spectacle on her phone. All of us clapped and howled madly.

***

Aapko dar nahi lagta? (Aren't you afraid?)

""Arre dar kis baat ka? Marenge toh manch pe marenge - gaana gaathe gaathe' (Why Fear? If I die, I'll die on stage - singing"".

I am curious about her response to the Savarna audience who watch her perform. The ones who make faces and sulk, the ones who think they know better and don't use either guns or cow dung to attack.

She says 'Mujhe yeh doubt hain dil main, ki aise log humse bohat darte hain.' (Somewhere in my heart, I have a doubt that these people are very afraid of us).

So what do we do? How to deal with them?

""Apne shabdon se maaron unko"" (Kill them with your words).

So many answers.

Amid the ongoing commotion in the Lok Sabha over several issues, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on Tuesday said she often receives messages that schools function better than parliament and wondered whether these disruptions go on to indicate that the behaviour of the members are worse than school kids.

As the House re-convened at noon for the second time, members of the AIADMK, the TDP and the Congress started protesting again.

The Congress, demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), continued sloganeering on the Rafale issue. The BJP members demanded an apology from Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

The TDP members were demanding special status for Andhra Pradesh while the AIADMK MPs were protesting against a dam on the Cauvery river.

Amid all this, the National Institute of Design (Amendment) Bill, 2018 was introduced in the House.

Upset with the disruption of proceedings, Ms Mahajan said the members were well aware that this was an important session as elections will follow.

She said the government was ready for discussion, but the ruckus continued.

""I receive messages several times saying, madam our schools run better. Please understand, what message are we trying to give: that are we worse than school kids,"" she said addressing the members.

Ms Mahajan said people from other countries were questioning as to ""what was happening in our country"".

She said she will talk to the government to ensure that issues demanded by the opposition are discussed.

""But please, I request you with hands folded. Please maintain a standard in the House. I am sorry, but I am saying this openly. Many a time, people from other countries say, what is happening in India,"" she said.

Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said his party was ready for discussion, but demanded formation of a JPC to probe the Rafale deal so that every file related to the matter can be scrutinised.

To this, Ms Mahajan said that constitution of JPC was not under her purview.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the Supreme Court verdict has made things clear, indicating that there was no need for a JPC on the controversial issue.

Unhappy with the response, Congress members again started raising slogans, following which the House was adjourned for the day.

Some prominent schools are also giving points to those opting for pick and drop service.

Apart from the mandatory 25 per cent of the total seats reserved for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS)/disadvantaged groups, private schools can select a set of criteria against which they allot specific points to each applicant for admission into nursery or entry level classes.

To ensure that schools don't adopt any arbitrary criteria, the Directorate of Education had last month issued a list of 50 disallowed criteria, including vegetarianism, social/noble cause, parents' education, declaration regarding picking or drop, first-come-first-get, non-alcoholic, non-smoker parent criteria. The DoE said these criteria were ""unfair, unreasonable and non-transparent"".

But several schools are openly allotting points on such criteria, flouting the guidelines. Mahavir Senior Model School for instance, is giving five points each to children of parents who are non-smokers, vegetarian and teetotalers. Darshan Academy in north Delhi has reserved 15 points to ""freelancers or original research/recognition received in the area or contribution, physical or professional work, (both pro-bono) through a registered NGO or freelancers.""

Some popular schools such as Tagore International School, East of Kailash and Vasant Vihar, Apeejay School in Saket and Pitampura, and Bloom Public School have separate points for areas covered by school transport. In its guidelines, the DoE had pointed out that declaration regarding picking or drop is ""illogical"" and it is the choice of the parents to opt for school transport or not. A senior DoE official said the criteria would be reviewed soon and action would be taken against schools flouting the norms.

""Schools are asking parents' designation, organisation name, PAN card details, annual income, etc...

Both drivers -- Sahil Hussain (21) and Shahid alias Saddam (22) -- had Swift Dzire cars, which they used to drive as Uber cabs during the daytime, and used them to lure victims they would rob at night. Taking cognisance of this, Gurugram police said they were preparing a notice to be issued to the cab aggregator, asking it to strengthen its verification process.

The accused have so far allegedly admitted to 15 robberies in the last three months, using cabs with registration numbers HR55AE3259 and HR73A9812. They were produced in a city court on Tuesday, which sent all four to three days of police remand for questioning, while a police team is also conducting raids to nab their accomplices.

""They have been active for the past three months. They would ask their victim where he wanted to go, and say the cab was also headed there.

Shamsher Singh Dahiya, the ACP (crime), said, ""The accused took no chances, but ensured they earned maximum with every loot by forcing their victims to withdraw money from ATMs immediately. They would threaten the victims with removing their kidneys or gouging out their eyes if they resisted when asked for the ATM pin. We will issue a notice to Uber, asking them to strengthen their driver verification process.""

An Uber spokesperson told TOI, ""We stand ready to assist law enforcement authorities in their investigation, as needed."" Gurugram police's crime units had been trying to track down the gang for the past month, ever since police commissioner K K Rao directed them to prioritise the gang's arrest.

The Sector 17 crime unit got the first major lead when one of the accused made a call from the cellphone of a victim.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday banned the high-power gun attachments of the type used in last year's Las Vegas shooting massacre of 58 people, giving the owners of ""bump stocks"" 90 days to turn in or destroy the devices and blocking owners from being able to register them.

President Donald Trump's Republican Party typically supports gun ownership, and its members have fiercely fought off perceived threats to the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment guaranteeing Americans the right to bear arms.

His administration, though, is sidestepping any potential debate in Congress in issuing a final rule on Tuesday that adds bump stocks to a definition of machine guns written 80 years ago, during the heyday of gangsters' use of ""tommy guns.""

The attachments use a gun's recoil to bump its trigger, enabling a semiautomatic weapon to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, which can transform the firearm into a machine gun.

The Justice Department's regulation follows the lead of many states and retailers that imposed stricter limits on sales of guns and accessories after a deadly shooting in February at a Florida high school.

Gun Owners of America said on Tuesday that it was going to court to fight the new rule and would seek an injunction. The group said the department was attempting to rewrite laws, the regulation would lead to bans on other weapons, and bump stocks do not qualify as machine guns.

On an earlier call with reporters, senior Justice Department officials said they were ready for any possible lawsuit and confident in the review of case law they conducted while writing and revising the regulation. The department received nearly 190,000 comments on its proposal for the regulation.

The websites for the most well-known bump stock manufacturers, Bumpfire System and Slide Fire, displayed notifications on Tuesday that they had already ceased direct sales of the devices. RW Arms, which both manufacturers described as a leading retailer, was not immediately available to comment on the ban.

While bump stocks are not widespread, they are still plentiful in the market, with high sales over the internet and in big-box stores, the officials said on the call.

Walmart Inc stopped selling assault firearms and accessories in 2015. After the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the retailer raised the minimum age for buying guns at its stores. Other retailers, including Kroger Co , have also raised the minimum buying age.

Mumbai terror attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed openly addressed a rally in Lahore and threatened to wage a war against India. A video of him threatening India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has surfaced.

In the video, Hafiz Saeed was heard saying that the war (against India) will continue and threatened that it will not be fought at the borders but in the Indian cities across the country.

The rally was organised under the banner of Difa-e-Pakistan Council at Mall Road in Lahore to mark the fourth anniversary of Peshawar school massacre.

""You forgot Somnath Modi. The time is near when this war will be fought in your cities not at the borders. You will not be able to hide your terrorism behind curtains,"" Hafiz Saeed was heard as saying in the video.

""We do not accept Bangladesh. We still consider it as East Pakistan. These decisions were made in Delhi, we reject them. We seek revenge on the basis of Nazaria Pakistan,"" Saeed said.

Hafiz Saeed also threatened to target PM Modi. ""Modi's dream of Hindutva and his programme to wage war against Pakistan will be responded with the program of La Ilaha Illallah,"" he said.

""The day is near when 30 crore Muslims in India will rise against your tyranny... Takmeel-e-Pakistan is a reality, the decisions are being made in the skies...dealing with you [India] is piece of cake for us.""

""We have a simple slogan against you Modi. If your Hindutva mission is alive, so is Pakistan's movement.""

Hafiz Saeed's video has surfaced a day after Pakistan minister Shehryar Afridi allegedly vowed to ""protect"" the Mumbai attack mastermind and his party.

""As long as we (the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf) are in the government all those including Hafiz Saeed who are raising voice for Pakistan and righteousness, we are with them,"" Afridi said, adding ""this is our belief.""

""I request you to come to the National Assembly and see whether we are supporting those who on the right path or not,"" he told the Milli Muslim League (MML) leaders.

Saeed was declared a global terrorist by the US and the UN after the 2008 Mumbai attack and was put under house arrest in November 2008 but freed by a court some months later. He carries a USD 10 million American bounty on his head for his role in terror activities.

Elmore told the Post she recalled the first instance of abuse took place at her grandmother's home in LeRoy, New York, when she was three years old. The abuse continued for the next 15 years, and escalated to what she termed ""night visits"" to her room.

For the past three decades, she told the Post, she confided in few friends and fewer family members. A high school boyfriend interviewed by the newspaper corroborated that she had told him of the abuse years ago. Letters from Elmore and one from her mother, Ann Marie Grazioplene, to James Grazioplene's sister Elizabeth Powley, all reviewed by the Post, provide written accounts of Grazioplene's disturbing abuse.

""Jim has ... made an attempt at sexually molesting Jennifer. She was sleeping, thank God,"" said one letter reviewed by the Post, addressed to Powley by Ann Marie Grazioplene. ""I caught him before he got started.""

One of Elmore's confidants, a coworker named Julie Adams, accompanied Elmore to Fort Bragg in 2015 to submit evidence to investigators, according to the Post. She made the decision to report her father to the Army, she told the newspaper, after a troubling phone call with her parents. During the call, which her current husband heard, Grazioplene told her ""the only thing worse that I could have done to you is murder you,"" Elmore told the Post. The Army investigated Elmore's allegations and brought a case against the general in 2017. But the case was dismissed on a technicality; a decision in February 2017 placed a five-year statute of limitations on rape charges.

Over a year later, Grazioplene was arrested December 7, 2018, on multiple charges of rape and incest after an indictment by a grand jury in Prince William County, Virginia, where there is no statute of limitations.

Elmore and her attorney declined to comment further due to the new charges. Officials for Prince William County and the Army also declined to comment.

Grazioplene told the Post, ""I will not comment. The charges are false and incorrect.""

Elmore told the Post, which typically does not publish the names of alleged sexual assault victims, that she wanted her story to be told.

One of the loudest cries often heard in the political gatherings across the country is that youth should play more prominent role in the politics. But the fact is that despite the entry of young energetic leader like Jamyang Tsering Namgyal (JTN) in the politics, people find it hard to accept a person like him from humble background on the highest post of decision making. The similar case in consideration/deliberation here is the present Chief Executive Councilor (CEC), LAHDC Leh.

Ever since the death of Dr. Sonam Dawa Lonpo, the former CEC, political stage of Leh have been marked by high drama. This high drama has something exciting in store for all of us who are concerned with the changing political landscape of Ladakh.

After the untimely demise of Dr. Sonam Dawa, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal has emerged as one of the prospective CEC candidate but he then decided not to pursue the same and chose to support veteran leader Dorjay Motup for the post instead. Subsequently Dorjay Motup was unanimously elected as the CEC, Leh. Another turn in the event took place with the resignation of Dorjay Motup from CEC post, citing health grounds.Again debate on the prospective candidate for the post was started. Point of discussion among the general public was, who can fill the vacuum created by the resignation of Dorjay Motup? Finally in a move that surprised many, the 33-year-old councilor from Martho, JTN was unanimously elected as new CEC. Though circumstances leading to elevation of the young leader to this highest post in the Council began with the demise of Late Dr. Sonam Dawa, credit goes to the young leader himself as he was quick to capitalize on this.

The youngest ever CEC for Ladakh region, JTN followed the footstep of his mentor Sh. Thupstan Chhewang, the former MP Ladakh. But a doubtful turn took place in the political drama as latter resigned just after former's taking oath as the new CEC, Leh. MP Ladakh resigned alleging the Centre for failing to deliver on the electoral promise made during the 2014 general election. Now the question arises, why he suddenly chose to resign as MP Leh that too just after the young leader taking oath as the CEC, Leh. Was it too difficult for him to accept a leader as the new CEC Leh that he chose to resign as MP Ladakh?

Within this high political drama, we have to understand that the larger debate is on aristocrats v/s democrats. The real implementation of democracy requires egalitarianism, openness and an inclusive social mindset. Democracy without these traits becomes an aristocracy where specific privileged class emerges as system runner and commoners become only fuel to run such system.

What makes young leader's elevation to the CEC post interesting is the fact that unlike other leaders of Ladakh he is coming from a humble family and does not boast of any hereditary title like LONPO. But it is unfortunate that the post of CEC has never been undermined so much as it does these days. There has been a joke doing the round in social media, which says it is easier to be CEC than to be the Principal of Lamdon School. This is a serious issue and shouldn't be brushed aside as mere joke. Deep down it raises questions like- who is suitable for the post of CEC? Why do people find JTN unsuitable for the CEC? Is it merely because he is coming from a humble family background? Is it because JTN does not belong to a Lonpo family unlike our revered former MP Ladakh? Because the argument of education qualification for the same does not hold well ground as he is more qualified than the present Prime Minister of India.

If a youth leader from a humble background has claimed the seat of CEC he is neither being opportunist nor endangering the future of BJP in Leh as many have blamed him. Rather he is reassuring thousands of poor people, who are not born with silver spoon, that if they work hard and do not bury their aspirations they can also claim the highest seat of power. His success as the CEC Leh would promote the feeling that anyone can participate as top decision maker in the democratic setup and that family background does not matter. From working for student welfare as student leader at Jammu, to the corridors of power first at Delhi then in Ladakh, he has travelled a long way to reach the coveted post of the CEC, LAHDC, Leh.

The second eldest son of the family, JTN, a graduate from M.A.M College Jammu, had entry into politics as a BJP party worker in Jammu in 2012. Within few years, he has been assigned with the duty of managing election campaign for Thupstan Chhewang, who was running for MP seat from Ladakh on a BJP ticket. He was also the main speaker during the election. It was a time when BJP party in Ladakh was almost non-existent and there were slim chances for him to secure victory. But thanks to the hard work of JTN who toured every nook and corner of Ladakh campaigning for Thupstan Chhewang that the latter won MP seat from Ladakh by smallest margin of 30 votes. This victory took him to the streets of parliament, where he has worked as the Private Secretary to MP Ladakh for 3 years. Things however took a turn for good when he decided to contest LAHDC, Leh election and resigned from the PA to MP. He was given party ticket to contest the election of LAHDC Leh from Martselang constituency and he won by a record margin of 825 votes.His nearest rival in the election then was Tsering Angdus, who was running for third term in the office and was one of the most influential persons in Leh.Even at that time many were discrediting him and were saying that BJP is going to lose this seat but he proved them wrong and marked the politics of Ladakh by registering the record victory in the said election. It was also under his presidency that for the first time a BJP councilor from Lungnak, Zanskar, also made entry into the LAHDC, Kargil.

Hailing from the Martho village in Leh district, he is coming from a family of Aam Admi unlike most of other leaders in Leh who were born with silver spoon. His father served as carpenter in Military Engineering Service and his mother is a housewife. Unlike him most of other leaders in the Ladakh region have an aristocratic background, means they had their ancestors in the royal court who were either serving as Lonpo or were enjoying royal patronage. This gave them unparalleled advantage over others in getting elected to various posts. These democratic aristocrats are distinguished from the traditional aristocrats in one key respect that is their dependence on electoral politics for the endorsement of privilege. Rise of a young leader to the highest post of decision making breaks many stereotypes, foremost among them is the belief that to be successful in the politics you have to be either from an aristocratic family or a rich family. More than breaking long held stereotype, young leader offers a renewed sense of vitality and excitement to Ladakh region, which is facing regional discrimination from Kashmiri centric politician. At the same time the emergence of youthful figures in positions of power gives hope to youth of Ladakh who might have seen politics as no-go zone. Besides dealing with strong opposition leaders, the youngest CEC Leh also faces high expectations of the public.

It still remains to be seen how far the policies of the young leader actually represent a departure from the past. We might reasonably be skeptical about the capacity of one so young, rising against the overwhelming tide of barriers; and it is not enough for the young leader to believe him but society must also believe in him.

Despite his young age, JTN already has significant political experience and we can't discredit his capability of lobbying for the divisional status for Ladakh in the power corridors of Jammu.

He has also been able to prove his leadership qualities by seccefully assuming the mantle leadership for the slogan of ' 'Free Ladakh from Kashmir' and has already been able to lead this fight better than any other CEC from Ladakh in past.

Within a one month in the office he has already started his campaign of freeing Ladakh from Kashmir and the biggest strides towards securing this vision is his demand for divisional status for Ladakh. And it is to youngest CEC's credit that Governor is already contemplating on granting Divisional status for Ladakh.

JTN becoming youngest CECis a landmark political development of 2018, but only the time can tell about his durability as it too early to write off him and his political career.

Despite all these, the attempt to break the old glass ceiling for the entry into the political class, which until now, was forbidden for a poor, is a perfect beginning of an egalitarian democratic space for all.

JTN's rise and this Generational shift in the political class is nevertheless a tale well begun.

But justice still seems only half done.

The life sentence handed down by the Delhi High Court to Sajjan Kumar of the Congress party has, no doubt, brought a modicum of closure to victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh massacre; but it's not nearly enough considering the quantum of reprisal killings in Delhi and elsewhere, purposefully instigated by some Congress party members like Kumar.

Jagdish Kaur, one of Kumar's principal accusers, tersely termed the sentence a ""little balm applied to long time scars"". She also resignedly declared that at least one high-profile individual accused in the Sikh killings would now be jailed, in what remains the most reprehensible episode in independent India's history, in which the Congress-ruled state turned avenger.

Kaur's son and husband were amongst her five family members clubbed to death and set alight by marauding Hindu mobs under Kumar's instigation, within hours of Indira Gandhi's assassination on October 31, 1984, by her two Sikh bodyguards. Their only sin, like that of some 3,000 others like them in Delhi, was that they were easily identifiable as Sikhs, and hence fair game for mobs, some led by Congressmen, to be slaughtered.

Kumar's comeuppance also took 34 years in coming, or a time frame of one generation-and-three-quarters, to adjudicate in India's lugubrious judicial system. The tortuous lead-up to sentencing the 73-year old former Congress parliamentarian to spend the rest of his natural life in jail, too, was riddled with crafty legal and procedural wrangles manipulated by his political colleagues for decades.

At times, the outcome of Kumar's guilt appeared chimerical as the maze of 10 inquiry commissions and investigative panels established by successive administrations into the 1984 massacre failed in indicting either him or other culpable Congressmen. A lower court even acquitted Kumar, but miraculously a dogged Central Bureau of Investigation challenged the exoneration in 1990 and, despite impediments, pursued his indictment all the way to the Delhi High Court.

Understandably, senior Congress members have distanced themselves from Kumar after his sentencing. Some feebly reasoned that he had been adequately penalised by being denied a party ticket in recent years to contest elections, whilst others said neither the Congress nor the Gandhi family had any role in the 1984 strife.

They seemed to be in total denial of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's appalling justification of the Sikh massacre by publicly declaring that the earth shakes when a great tree falls. But more importantly, these Congressmen in times of competitive pogrom politics, discounted Manmohan Singh's remorse for the 1984 Sikh killings in Parliament in 2005.

""I have no hesitation in apologising to the Sikh community (for the 1984 carnage)"", Singh declared in the Rajya Sabha in response to an Opposition-sponsored motion demanding that the prime minister seek forgiveness from the country for the inexcusable strife.

Singh went further by stating that he apologised not only to the Sikh community, but also to the Indian nation, because what occurred in 1984 was the ""negation"" of the concept of nationhood enshrined in the Constitution. ""On behalf of our government and on behalf of the entire people of this country, I bow my head in shame that such a thing took place"", said the country's first Sikh prime minister.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi, too, disavowed his party's role in the 1984 butchery. Speaking at the London School of Economics earlier this year, he categorically declared that his party was not involved. But with Kumar now sentenced, he, too, will have to do a rethink, in addition to strategising on ways to counter allegations regarding Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath's involvement in the 1984 killings. Witnesses alleging the MP chief minister's involvement are still around and as dogged as Jagdish Kaur and her family.

The wave of ethnic cleansing that consumed Delhi for 72 hours like a prairie fire within hours of Indira Gandhi's assassination was terrifying. During these three days, Sikhs were hunted down, corralled and killed. The city's entire law and order machinery had willfully collapsed at the behest of the federal and local administrations, and the capital was besieged by marauding mobs, including those led by bloodthirsty Congressmen, armed with voters' lists to target Sikh households.

Policemen magically disappeared and the handful who were visible were unwilling, or under orders not to open fire upon cowardly mobs that drew encouragement solely from their numbers and assurances of immunity from prosecution. Instances of Sikhs being necklaced were common, as rubber tyres doused with petrol were jammed around their chests and arms and set alight. The victims took some 20 minutes to die.

None of the army units summoned from cantonments around the capital were provided necessary help, guidance or logistic direction by the local authorities. Neither were the bewildered soldiers, treated little better than riot police in olive green, issued any directives or shoot-to-kill orders, obligatory under the circumstances, to quell the mobs.

And whilst unbridled mayhem proliferated unimpeded across Delhi's Sikh neighbourhoods, the killing of some 350 Dalit Sikhs, including women and children, over 48 hours in the trans-Yamuna resettlement Trilokpuri colony was, without doubt, the most brutal. The charred and hacked remains of the hundreds that perished in Trilokpuri's Block 32 on the smoky and dank November 2 evening revealed an unbelievable tale of slaughter, which I, as a reporter for this newspaper, chanced upon, accompanied by two colleagues.

The massacre took place, uninterrupted, in two narrow alleyways no more than 130 metres long, with one-room tenements on either side. It lasted over 48 hours with the murderers, never ever caught, taking breaks for meals before returning and resuming their senseless slaughter.

Thirty-four years later, the memory and stench from slain bodies and hacked limbs piled high with mounds of hair still haunts my senses. HKL Bhagat, the alleged architect of the Trilokpuri massacre, was indicted by the Nanavati Commission, but died in 2005. The families of the Trilokpuri victims will never have the closure that the court delivered to Nirpreet Kaur, Jagdish Kaur and Jagsher Singh, who testified against Sajjan Kumar.

Advertising

The judges passing sentence on Kumar sagely declared that the Sikh killings in Delhi and elsewhere in November 1984 were ""crimes against humanity"", a massacre that will continue to shock the collective conscience of society for a long time to come. It most definitely will, but in the sentencing, justice seems to be only half done. More remains."

The bench was dealing with a taken-up PIL in this regard. BS Prasad Rao, Advocate General of Telangana, pointed out that it was proving to be difficult to ensure complete plastic ban due to pressure from the plastic industry.

""The industry owners will resist the ban, they will use political influence and money power. Only by withstanding the pressure, ban would be possible. Under Environmental Protection Act, abundant powers are available to the government, utilise it to ensure the compliance of the orders of the court,"" the Chief Justice said.

Notices to educational institutions

The same bench directed the Telangana government to obtain instructions in the matter pertaining to suicides committed in Sri Chaitanya Educational Institutions and Narayana Group of Educational Institutions.

The bench was dealing with a PIL filed by People's Union for Civil Liberties seeking directions to the government to constitute special investigation teams/committees to inquire into the suicides in these institutions. The petitioner complained that pressure from school in the name of providing better education and their fee structure are the main reasons for the suicides. The bench directed the petitioner to issue notices to these institutions and posted the matter after three weeks.

Centre told to file counter in MSP case

The same bench directed the government of India to file its comprehensive counter in the matter pertaining to fixing of price of 25 agricultural products produced by way of minimum support price. Advocate C Venkata Raman filed a PIL questioning the action of the Central government and its departments in constituting the Commission for Agricultural Cost and Price and fixing price by way of MSP, inclusive of paddy.

The petitioner complained that the Central government used unscientific methods of data collection and information from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation for fixing the rates. He also complained against the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution for not increasing the distribution price of the States as per the Food Corporation Act 1964. The bench directed the various departments against whom allegations were made to file their counter in three weeks.

Probe team asked to give deadline

The same bench directed the investigation team conducting inquiry into the Yadadri child trafficking case to report back by next week the time it will take to complete the whole investigation. The bench was dealing with a taken-up matter relating to the Yadadri minors trafficking victims case.

Earlier the bench directed the Magistrate, Children's Court, Bharosa - Support Centre for Woman and Children to record the statements of 164 children who were victims. The bench wanted to know the time it would take for the investigation to be completed so that the matter could be placed before a Special Child's Court for efficient and speedy trial.

The same bench directed the Director, Swachh Bharat Mission for Telangana, be impleaded as a respondent in the matter pertaining to misappropriation of funds allotted towards construction of Sowchalayas. M Shekhar Reddy filed a PIL against the Sarpanch, Narsangi Gram Panchayat, Medak district, for misappropriating funds amounting to Rs 40 lakh which was allotted towards Sowchalayas Fund by the Central government.

The petitioner complained that the said funds were transferred to personal accounts of Sarpanch, Panchayat Secretary and Bill Collector of Narsangi village without laying of cement roads, sewerage, pipelines and without taking any developmental works by the gram panchayat."

""In the West Wing! It's a very serious offense. You can't minimize that."" He later asked prosecutors whether Flynn could face charges for treason, but government lawyers said they didn't want to broach that territory.

Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser, faced harsh blowback from US District Judge Emmet Sullivan on Tuesday during his sentencing hearing after nearly a year of cooperating with federal investigators.

Flynn pleaded guilty last December with one count of lying to the FBI about his communications with Sergey Kislyak, then-Russia's ambassador to the US. He also admitted to lying about the lobbying work he did for the Turkish government.President Donald Trump has frequently suggested that Flynn was duped into lying to the FBI. On Tuesday, Flynn threw cold water on that assertion and said he ""was aware"" lying to the FBI was a crime when he misled investigators.

During his sentencing hearing, Sullivan asked Flynn whether he wanted to challenge the circumstances under which he was interviewed by the FBI.

""No, your honor,"" Flynn replied.

Sullivan later gave Flynn another chance to withdraw his guilty plea if he felt he had been unfairly coaxed into pleading guilty.

""I would like to proceed,"" Flynn said.

Asked whether he wished to proceed because he was guilty, Flynn said, ""Yes, your honor.""Sullivan asked prosecutors whether Flynn was still cooperating.

""It remains a possibility,"" they said, but added that their decision to move forward with his sentencing was based on the fact that he had already given them the ""vast majority"" of potentially useful information. They emphasized an indictment unsealed on Monday against his former associate, who was charged with acting as an illegal agent of the Turkish government.

Nonetheless, Sullivan said, ""this crime"" that Flynn committed ""is very serious.""

""In the White House!"" he said. ""In the West Wing! It's a very serious offense. You can't minimize that.""

He added: ""Arguably, you sold your country out.""

Sullivan also asked the government whether Flynn could be charged under the Logan Act, and even whether he could face charges of treason. Prosecutors declined to broach that territory.

The judge then declared that the court would go into recess until 12:30 PM ET, at which point they will reconvene so Sullivan can rule on Flynn's prison sentence.

The memo said Flynn told investigators ""no,"" he had not tried to influence Russia's vote on a United Nations Security Council resolution about Israeli settlements.

But investigators knew Flynn had asked Russia to vote against or delay the resolution, according to charging documents filed in his case last year.

Mueller's memo said Flynn also lied when FBI agents asked him about then-President Barack Obama's expulsion of Russian diplomats and closing of Russian diplomatic facilities in response to the Kremlin's meddling in the 2016 election.

Investigators asked Flynn whether he had asked Kislyak during a phone call in December not to retaliate following Obama's move, and Flynn replied, ""Not really. I don't remember."" He added that he didn't tell Kislyak, ""Don't do anything,"" the memo said.

But his answers contradicted signals intelligence the FBI had collected that indicated Flynn had asked Kislyak during the phone call not to punch back.

In a sentencing memo Mueller's office filed in Flynn's case last week, prosecutors recommended that Flynn get little to no jail time, citing the ""substantial assistance"" he provided to the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election - as well as other, separate ongoing investigations.

Flynn was among the first defendants to plead guilty in the Russia probe. His sentencing was delayed five times after prosecutors said they needed more information from the former national security adviser, who served as a key surrogate on Trump's 2016 campaign.

In their sentencing memo, prosecutors emphasized that Flynn began cooperating early, that his assistance was critical in encouraging other witnesses to come forward and be candid, and that he helped the investigation in several ways.

In typical fashion, Mueller's office revealed very little information, if any, about the specifics of what Flynn told them. Prosecutors also attached a largely-redacted six-page addendum to the sentencing memo laying out how Flynn had cooperated in what appears to be a separate investigation not being conducted by Mueller's office.

In the original sentencing memo, prosecutors laid out the crux of what Flynn was charged with: his lies to the FBI about conversations he had with Kislyak about US sanctions on Russia.

But that's not the only thread of which Flynn may have had valuable information.

The former national security adviser was also not forthcoming about his involvement in three key areas: his now defunct lobbying firm's work for the Turkish government in 2016, his efforts with Russia and Saudi Arabia to develop nuclear reactors in the Middle East, a project that would have benefited from the US lifting sanctions on Russia, and payments he received from the state-owned media outlet Russia Today that he failed to disclose when he applied to renew his security clearance in January 2016.

Flynn was also a participant in a controversial meeting with Kislyak and senior adviser Jared Kushner during the transition period, in which Kushner reportedly discussed setting up a secret back channel between the Trump team and Moscow using Russian diplomatic facilities.

And he also served as an adviser to the campaign when Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and Donald Trump Jr. met with two Russian lobbyists offering dirt on the Hillary Clinton campaign. The meeting, which took place at Trump Tower in June 2016, is a key investigative focus for the special counsel and congressional committees.

Flynn's sentencing memo said he provided ""firsthand information"" about contacts between Russian officials and members of the Trump transition team.

""We do not yet know everything about Flynn's cooperation,"" said Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor from the Southern District of New York, in an interview with INSIDER. ""The heavy redactions in the filing hide nearly all the details that Mueller provided to the court.""

Jens David Ohlin, a vice dean at Cornell Law School and an expert on criminal law, echoed that view.

""There is more to come, but we don't know what that is,"" told INSIDER. The substantial redactions in Flynn's sentencing memo indicate that the targets of other investigations he's cooperated with have not yet been charged, he said. ""It could be a reference to an obstruction of justice investigation, possibly involving the president, but we don't really know. So this is a known unknown.""

Honig emphasized, however, that ""if you read around all that black ink, Mueller did say enough to let us know this: Flynn gave up the goods, and Mueller's work is far from over."""
"541","1021513981","2018-12-18","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-american-legal-expert-leads-opinion-to-indict-donald-trump/articleshow/67150815.cms","Indian-American legal expert leads opinion to indict Donald Trump - Times of India","The Times of India",FALSE,"WASHINGTON: An Indian-American legal eagle who represented the US government in the Supreme Court is leading a growing band of legal experts who are challenging the assertion of President Donald Trump and his minions that he is immune from criminal indictment by virtue of his office.

Neal Kumar Katyal, who has served as the acting solicitor general of the United States and other key positions in the justice department, first laid out a case for Trump's indictment that has since been picked up by many analysts - including some Republican commentators - who believe the legal walls are closing in on the President and he has no option but to cut a deal with special counsel Mueller and resign, or face the prospect of prison after office.

In a powerful argument that he first made on social media and has since elaborated on air on various channels, the Chicago-born Katyal agrees there are justice department memos that say a sitting president cannot be indicted, but they are generic memos that don't apply to the Trump case.

""They don't apply to a situation like this, in which the crime that is being alleged is one that allowed someone to get the presidency in the first place; they do not necessarily apply to crimes that go to obtaining Presidency itself,"" is the centerpiece of the Katyal argument.

In other words, Katyal suggests the hush money Trump admits paying to women such as porn actress Stormy Daniels who claimed to have affairs with him was aimed at suppressing their stories with the intent of winning the White House.

More commentators, including some prominent conservatives, have now began writing Trump's political demise following the Katyal argument which comes amid multiple investigations that cover almost every aspect of Trump's life - from his business interests to his presidential transition and inauguration.

There are now 17 separate ongoing Trump-related investigations that can be distilled into six broad heads: Russian interference in 2016 campaign; Hush money payments to suppress stories during his campaign for the White House; inaugural committee spending; transition committee conduct; foreign payments and emoluments clause; and misuse of charity funds.

Even conservative pundits who are known Trump supporters are starting to believe the President will not be able to weather the combined weight of the special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, the justice department's investigations through the South District of New York attorneys, inquiries and challenges from the attorney generals of New York and Maryland, and the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives next month that will give them subpoena powers to look deeper into Trump's affairs, financial and beyond.

""There's ample evidence - this doesn't require too much analysis - to indict the president, the question is do they (the justice department) want to do it. The DOJ has three opinions in this: two say you can't indict a sitting president, one says you can, but all three address the problem of 'what do you do when the statute of limitations is about to expire?' All three agree in that case you indict in secret, keep it sealed and release it the day he gets out of office,"" Fox News legal analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano said on Monday, throwing a bombshell among Trump supporters.

Effectively, that means Trump's immunity lasts only till Jan 20, 2020, unless he is re-elected. If he loses a re-election bid, the moment he resigns as President, there will be someone to lead him way - a scenario invoked by Democratic lawmaker Adam Schiff who says Trump may be the ""first president in quite some time to face the very real prospect of jail time.""

Some others are envisaging a situation where Trump resigns to make way for Mike Pence as President if he foresees losing an election, and obtains a Presidential pardon from Pence. Still others, including prominent political pundit, MSNBC's Chris Matthews, go so far as to predict Trump would resign in the ""next few weeks"" after cutting a deal with prosecutors since his children Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump could be the ""next dominoes to fall.""

Political analysts are now starting to see greater dangers for Trump from various other probes beyond the special counsel's investigations, where the Trump defence has essentially boiled down to ""there was no collusion and even if there was collusion, it is not a crime.""

Katyal on his part has zeroed in on the hush money pay-off, describing it as the ""most significant campaign contributions in US history,"" and one which lubricated his way to the White House.

Katyal was born in the US to Punjabi immigrants - mom a paediatrician and dad an engineer - and went to Yale Law School studying under another celebrated Indian-American legal scholar Akhil Amar. He worked in the Clinton-Gore administration and served as Vice-President Al Gore's co-counsel in Bush vs Gore of 2000.

Although critical of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, a case in which he served as an attorney, he also defended former attorney general John Ashcroft against alleged abuses of civil liberties in the war on terror.

""I try my hardest to tell it to you straight. I'm not a particularly partisan person,"" he explained in a recent tweet after winning acclaim for his analysis of the Trump situation. ""Am just deeply worried about the attack on the Rule of Law, a tradition that brought my parents here from another land,"" he added, in a rare reference to his Indian heritage."

Late one night in June, Jody Pagliocco was driving down a long, wooded road in southern Maine. She was working for Uber, and her passenger, a man, was in the front seat. That was unusual -- but she hadn't felt comfortable telling him to get in the back when he opened the front door. She had picked him up from a bar in town, and he was drunk. The road was dark and there was nobody around. Pagliocco was getting uncomfortable.

""He made a joke about not being a serial killer,"" Pagliocco said. ""Then he started talking about sexual stuff,"" and all she could think about was: ""What if he tries to grab or touch me?""

Pagliocco drove to the front gates of his house and told the passenger to get out of the car. She was relieved he left, though the incident left her scared and shaken, causing her to stop driving for several days. Soon after she got back on the road, she drove another passenger who she said tried to grab her and kiss her. Pagliocco has only been driving for about half a year, yet of the thousand or so rides that she's driven for Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc., she says a few hundred of those have led to inappropriate advances or uncomfortable encounters.

Experiencing assault and harassment on the job is terrible. And on top of that, it affects her paycheck. After many of those instances, Pagliocco has taken a day, or several days off from driving. Though she prefers to drive late at night when she makes the most money taking people home from bars and events, Pagliocco says after these ""unnerving"" incidents, she will drive at earlier times of the day, when she makes far less money.

Driving is a full-time job for Pagliocco. She signed onto the services after a cross-country move and mostly drives for Uber. Her daughter had an accident that left her paralyzed, and Pagliocco wanted to be nearer to where she was receiving medical treatment, so she moved from Seattle to Maine. She was having trouble finding full-time work, and driving seemed like a job that allowed her to make her own schedule so she could also care for her daughter.

Uber and Lyft have been hailed as economic saviors, offering flexible work for mothers juggling childcare responsibilities. While the quick pay and autonomous work have drawn people in, many women like Pagliocco who drive for Uber and Lyft say they frequently encounter harassment or assault.

In a private Facebook group for female drivers that's grown to more than 10,000 members since it was started in 2016, women frequently ask questions, give advice, and share driving stories. Many of the posts include experiences of sexual harassment. In one post, a woman wrote that a passenger grabbed the steering wheel and sexually assaulted her. She called 911 and the passenger was jailed. Another woman wrote that a male passenger slapped and hit her, hurting her back and shoulder. She said she called the police. Another shared a screen shot of a report she made within the Uber app, where she wrote that a rider forcibly kissed her.

Uber and Lyft allow drivers to report incidents in the app or through a 24/7 call line. They've also recently added new safety features to the platforms, including the ability to easily call 911 in the app. Uber recently added a feature that allows drivers to share trips with friends and family, a capability that is offered to riders on both platforms.

""Any situation reported to us is something that we take extremely seriously,"" said Stephanie Bryson, Uber's Head of Safety and Consumer Protection Policy. ""Uber should be a place where both our riders and our drivers feel comfortable.""

""The safety of the Lyft community is our top priority,"" Lyft wrote in a statement. ""We do not tolerate harassment or violence on our platform, and such behavior can and does lead to a permanent ban from our service.""

But Harry Campbell, who runs the Rideshare Guy, a popular blog among drivers, says the companies can do more. ""Both Uber and Lyft have been extremely innovative when it comes to transforming the rideshare and mobility industry, but there have been areas like safety where they have been a lot more reactive,"" he said. ""They should put their brainpower and innovation towards safety.""

Zuwena, a 36-year-old in Portland, Ore., started the Facebook group for women drivers after a frightening experience driving for Lyft. She had picked up a drunk man from a bar. He sat in the front seat. As she was driving, he grabbed her arm several times. ""My hands were shaking but I told him to get out and that I was grabbing my mace, and I told him to get on the side of the road,"" said Zuwena. ""My whole night was pretty much done after that."" She called the police and Lyft, who told her that they would deactivate the rider's account. Zuwena's last name, and those of a few other women drivers, are being withheld because of concerns over retaliation.

Emily, who is 23 and in school to become a paramedic, started driving for Uber and Lyft in Phoenix, Arizona a year ago, after her mother started working on the platforms. ""I feel safer than most women you'd ask,"" Emily said. ""I'm comfortable with drunk people. They'll get touchy and make weird comments."" But she's also had experiences that disturbed her, like the drunk man who masturbated in her car.

Hannah Minter, a driver in Savannah, Georgia, said that the inappropriate encounters she's had with passengers are what's keeping her from driving full-time for Uber and Lyft.

She didn't finish college, and after her divorce, she began driving for ride-share platforms to supplement her income designing T-shirts and mugs that she sells on Etsy. Minter drives six to ten hours a week at night, when her kids are in bed. She said she frequently encounters passengers who make sexual comments or try to touch her inappropriately.

""Every single time, every day that I drive, every night that I drive, there is at least one questionable experience,"" Minter said.

Paul Oyer, a labor economist at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, co-authored a study published earlier this year that found men earn about 7 percent more than women per hour on average on the Uber platform. Oyer worked with Uber and other academics to study a sample of more than one million drivers in the U.S. between January 2015 and March 2017. Oyer found several factors putting women at a disadvantage. They included differences in driving speed, where and when they drove, and how long male and female drivers were staying on the platform.

Oyer found that on average, men were driving longer hours per week and were less likely to quit. That meant they were accumulating more experience, like learning when and where to drive and how to strategically cancel and accept trips, contributing to higher earnings on the platform.

Despite the flexibility advantage, ""there's some other things going on in this platform that make it more attractive for men than for women,"" Oyer said. ""You could imagine that they [women] don't feel it's safe.""

Several women said that after rebuffing a passenger's advances, they worried about the rider retaliating by giving them a bad rating or erroneously reporting them for a serious infraction like drunk driving. That can lead to a suspension from driving for multiple days, as the platform conducts an investigation.

""For female drivers dealing with advances and people hitting on them, they should be able to say they want to stop the ride, but it's like they have to let them down gently,"" Campbell said. ""Drivers don't receive training on how to handle these things.""

Former Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick was ousted last year after female employees made allegations that the company did not respond appropriately to sexual harassment. Since then, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has tried to overhaul the culture and make safety a greater priority of the company, said Bryson, the company's head of safety.

""We've really taken the need to improve to heart,"" she said. Uber is working on a transparency report that will show data on reports of sexual assault. The company also eliminated forced arbitration agreements for employees, riders and drivers who make sexual assault or harassment claims against the company. That means instead of resolving any legal claims in an arbitration hearing, people can take those claims to court.

When a driver files a complaint about a passenger because of a safety issue on Uber, it's flagged to a special team with training on dealing with high-sensitivity incidents, according to Bryson. Depending on the severity, the company will open an investigation to speak with the rider and driver before making a decision on next steps.

Lyft said On Lyft's app, if a driver or rider rates someone 3 stars or below, they will never be matched with them again, according to a statement from the company. Lyft also said that that it's announcing 15 new features by the end of this year, many of which focus on driver safety.

Pagliocco's still driving, but looking for other work. ""I loved the flexibility and everything, but the money just isn't consistent enough,"" in addition to dealing with the ""sexual harassment stuff,"" she said. ""I mean, I would much rather have a full-time job."""

A Division of the Kerala High Court has expressed its displeasure over the lack of progress in the investigation into the case relating to the missing of a Plus Two student of a school in North Paravur.

The Bench comprising Justice C.K. Abdul Rahim and Justice T.V. Anil Kumar noted that the minor girl was missing since November 8, 2018. There was no considerable progress in the investigation of the case. The court said that it had directed the Aluva Rural SP to personally monitor the investigation of the case. The SP was also directed to intensify the investigation with all the earnestness to trace the girl. It was conceded now that there had been no fruitful result.

The court made the observations when a habeas corpus petition filed by the father of the girl came up for hearing.

In an affidavit, the Deputy Superintendent of Police, District Crime Branch, stated that 23 persons were questioned and their statements recorded. A request was submitted to the district cyber cell for getting the CDRs of the telephone numbers of seven persons who are family members and friends of Sulfikar, who had allegedly abducted her. Information had also been sent to three airports in the State to verify whether Sulfikar and the girl had left the country.

The court granted the police more time to complete the investigation. The court also directed the SP to file a detailed affidavit if the police could not trace the girl by January 9. The SP should also state his views on whether the investigation could be transferred to other investigating agencies."

Proceedings in both Houses of Parliament were disrupted for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday over various issues, including the Rafale fighter jets deal.

The Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day hours after it met as both opposition and treasury benches created a ruckus over the Rafale deal, prompting admonitions from the Speaker for being unruly and ""worse than school kids"".

Following the first adjournment at noon, when the House reassembled, the scene inside the lower House was no different.

Speaker Sumitra Mahajan tried to transact the business for the day but was repeatedly interrupted due to the sloganeering.

""It's not sending a good message outside. I have heard from people from abroad asking what is happening in the Indian Parliament,"" she said.

Mahajan said she had received feedback that even school children behaved better than parliamentarians.

As the din continued, Mahajan urged the members to go back to their seats and allow the House to function smoothly.

""Parliament is for debate and discussion, but this is not the way. This session is very important and we all have to face elections next year. The government is ready for discussion.

""We have a responsibility. We have to maintain the standard of Parliament,"" she said.

Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that opposition was ready for discussion and urged the government to accept the demand for JPC probe into the Rafale deal.

""We respect democracy. But the Prime Minister is silent. We are demanding a JPC probe into the Rafale deal. The deal was discussed at length during the No-Confidence Motion.

""Accept the probe for smooth functioning of the House,"" he said.

To this, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government was ready for discussion on any issue but the JPC probe.

""The need for JPC doesn't arise as the Supreme Court in its verdict has made it clear that a probe is not needed,"" he said.

As the din continued, Mahajan adjourned the House for the day.

Earlier, when the House met, the Congress, AIADMK and the TDP raised their respective issues.

Amid the din, Mahajan had to adjourn the House initially till noon.

The Rajya Sabha was also adjourned for the day minutes after it met in the post-lunch session amid ruckus by both opposition and treasury benches.

As soon as the House met, Congress member Anand Sharma raised a point of order and referred to a remark made by Minister of State (MoS) for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel in the morning with respect to Congress President Rahul Gandhi.

Sharma said Goel -- who had sought an apology from Gandhi for allegedly making false allegations against the government on the Rafale deal -- had violated the rules as the Congress chief was not a member of the Rajya Sabha.

He demanded to know as to ""on what basis"" Goel made such a remark.

This led to noisy exchanges between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Paty (BJP) members, who were on their feet.

In the meantime, the AIADMK members again trooped to the podium with placards.

Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu adjourned the House for the day amid the ruckus.

Earlier in the day, as the upper House met, members from Tamil Nadu-based parties -- AIADMK and DMK -- came near the podium holding placards and raising slogans. They were protesting against a proposed dam on the Cauvery river.

Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said the most important issue was the breach of privilege of the House by the government on the Rafale deal.

Chairman Naidu said that he was ""examining"" the breach of privilege notices given by the opposition and would soon take a decision.

Upset with the disruption of proceedings, Mahajan said the members were well aware that this was an important session as elections will follow.

She said the government was ready for discussion, but the ruckus continued.

""I receive messages several times saying, madam our schools run better. Please understand, what message are we trying to give: that are we worse than school kids,"" she said addressing the members.

Mahajan lamented that people from other countries were questioning as to ""what was happening in our country"".

She said she will talk to the government to ensure that issues demanded by the opposition are discussed.

""But please, I request you with hands folded. Please maintain a standard in the House. I am sorry, but I am saying this openly. Many a time, people from other countries say, what is happening in India,"" she said.

Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said his party was ready for discussion, but demanded formation of a JPC to probe the Rafale deal so that every file related to the matter can be scrutinised.

To this Mahajan said that constitution of JPC was not under her purview.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the Supreme Court verdict has made things clear, indicating that there was no need for a JPC on the controversial issue.

Unhappy with the response, Congress members again started raising slogans, following which the House was adjourned for the day.

The lower house has been witnessing daily disruptions since the winter session began last week. It had passed a bill on transgender rights on Monday.

Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Suresh Prabhu was hell bent on supporting the mode of governance instituted under Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his session at Agenda Aaj Tak 2018 despite the drubbing that BJP got in the recent elections across five states.

When session moderator Anjana Om Kashyap asked him about what he thought about the party's performance in these elections, Prabhu said, ""We should not look at the seat share as that is something completely different. In fact we should look at the difference in votes. The difference in votes between the BJP and Congress was just 0.2 per cent in Rajasthan. This does not mean the entire state has lost faith in BJP,"" Prabhu said.

Prabhu also said the change that PM Modi brought about after 2014 cannot be ignored and Modi already has a vision for what's to come after 2019.

Replying to Anjana Om Kashyap's question that the people were looking for change on ground, he said that PM Modi indeed did bring about that change by ensuring a gas connection in every house and a toilets in every school.

Talking about the jobs scenario, he said the present government was taking several efforts to ensure that people are gainfully employed ""district by district"".

""The way employment was as a whole has changed in the last few decades. Even in media, if ten years ago you wanted to join a news channel then you'd have to join Doordarshan. Today there are so many news channels with a number of job opportunities. If someone back in the day wanted a job as a postman man then they would join the post office.

""Patients everywhere suffer from donor shortages, and we all want to do whatever is possible to most efficiently allocate organs to the sickest people most likely to benefit and survive,"" says Errol Bush, M.D., a member of the research team and the surgical director of the Advanced Lung Disease and Lung Transplant Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

The new analysis, he says, demonstrates that for U.S. patients awaiting a lung transplant prior to 2017, where you lived or received your health care may have unintentionally been more important than how sick and likely to benefit you were when it came to how long you had to wait for a donor organ.

""The data told us that where transplant candidates live unfortunately had (and continues to have) a huge impact on the probability of receiving a transplant,"" says Martin Kosztowski, M.D., M.P.H, a research fellow at Johns Hopkins and first author of the new paper. ""And it means that patients who have the resources to travel to a different donor service area (DSA) or list at multiple centers are at an advantage.""

The older allocation system, operated under policies set by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), was in place for many years, Bush says, and was tweaked in response to the 2017 court filing in a New York case.

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of a young woman on the transplant waiting list who claimed that she was being unfairly discriminated against because of her location--New York City. Less sick people just across the Hudson River in New Jersey, the suit claimed, were receiving organs faster. The UNOS guidelines called for donor lungs to be assigned to the sickest patients on a regional basis, a system designed to use donor organs locally because of time constraints. Lungs that became available within any one of 58 DSAs would first go to someone waiting within that region, even if there was a sicker patient elsewhere.

But the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York filing claimed the guidelines were needlessly discriminatory, and in response, the UNOS changed its policy so that lungs would be offered to the highest-ranking candidate within 250 nautical miles, rather than within DSA boundaries.

In an effort to put more evidence behind that filing and other calls for allocation changes, Bush says, he and his colleagues analyzed data on 7,131 patients over the age of 12 who were awaiting lung transplants in the U.S. between Feb. 19, 2015, and March 31, 2017--all under the old allocation system.

The data included each patient's lung allocation score (LAS), a number used to determine transplant priority between 0 and 100 based on how sick a patient is and how likely the patient is to survive a transplant. The higher the lung allocation score, the more in need a patient is and the more likely that patient will be to die without receiving a lung transplant. Each year more than 2,000 lung transplants are performed nationwide.

The researchers calculated lung transplant rates by LAS in each DSA across the country by tallying the number of transplants performed divided by the number of active person-years spent waiting in a given LAS category (0-32, 32-34, 34-38, 38-42, 42-50 and 50-100).

The ratio in lung transplant rates between any two DSAs ranged from 1.0 (for DSAs with identical rates) to 21.73--someone in one DSA would be nearly 22 times more likely to receive a lung than someone in the other DSA with the same LAS.

On average, Bush says, there was a 2.05-fold difference between the lung transplant rates in any pair of DSAs. This meant that moving from one DSA to another actually had more of an impact, on average, than jumping between some LAS categories--the difference in transplant rates between an LAS of 38-42 and 42-50 was 1.54 fold, for instance.

The Johns Hopkins researchers note that the findings clearly back up the complaint of the 2017 lawsuit--the lung transplant rate for patients with an LAS of 50-100 (the LAS category of the lawsuit plaintiff) in New York City was 3.2 lung transplants per person-year, while the rate in New Jersey for that LAS category was 12.49, almost four times higher. The researchers also note that Arizona and parts of Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina had some of the highest transplant rates compared with other states.

Moreover, the disparity between locations rose over the course of the study--the average difference between transplant rates in any two DSAs was 1.69 in 2006 and 2.10 in 2016.

While the new study didn't analyze the new 250-mile-radius allocation system, the researchers suspect it may still hold some of the same biases, since it's still based on location. Certain places in the country, Kosztowski points out, have much higher organ donation rates because of the rising drug overdose pandemic or deaths due to traumatic events, as well as trends in local donor organizations communicating with families and communities about the importance of organ donation.

""That 250-mile radius is still arbitrary, and won't necessarily fix the problem,"" says Kosztowski. ""We certainly want to assess the new system to see whether it's improved things. Ideally, a transplant candidate shouldn't have to worry about where they get on the transplant list.""

The findings may also hold true for the way other organ allocation systems assign transplants based on location.

The demand for lung transplants continuously outpaces donations, and nationwide there are generally more than a thousand patients waiting for a lung at any time. For every hundred patients on a waitlist for one year, about 15 die. Patients waiting for lung transplants--as well as those who have just received transplants--cost the health care system thousands of dollars a month.

Although lung transplantation is a large operation and can be pricey, improvement in quality of life for patients and their families is worth it, say the researchers. Currently, lung transplant recipients at Johns Hopkins benefit from an almost 97 percent likelihood to live for at least one year after transplant.

Mohammad Khan lived in a slum near the lakebed in Bellandur area five years ago. When Citizen Matters reached out to him asking what he did for a living, he said he was involved in collecting and segregating waste. Many other families who lived in the same place also did the same thing for living. They roamed around in Sarjapur Road and Jakkasandra with bicycles stacked with recyclable waste from across the area. They segregated it, sold it and made their living.

Recently, about 5000 migrant labourers living in makeshift sheds in Thubarahalli were threatened by cops to vacate the land, after local residents complained of garbage incineration in the slums.

While BBMP did not issue a direct eviction order, a few Health Department officials visited the place with police on November 30, 2018, asking them to vacate the place in two days. On December 1, BESCOM cut the electricity supply to the slum.

A report in The New Indian Express claims that an exodus of these workers began since a posse of police started patrolling the place round the clock. While some families have left for their hometown, many are on the lookout for a new shelter in other parts of the city.

Shariful Sheikh, a school bus driver hailing from Nadia district in West Bengal has been living in this slum for a decade now. ""I have no money to go anywhere. I rented 40 hutments in this place and earned a rent of Rs 30,000 from all of them. A part of this sum would go to the original land owner as well. On the other hand, both my boys study in a private school here and have examinations soon. If I change house, their studies will be affected too and I don't know if I will get a job easily,"" he says.

Vinay Sreenivasa of Alternate Law Forum and an activist says: ""State has the obligation under the Constitution Article 243 (w) that ULBs must upgrade the living of people in slums and provide basic amenities. There is clear class angle in this eviction. Residents who have complained about garbage incineration have not paid attention that these slum dwellers living amidst heaps of waste dumped from nearby,"" he adds. Now ALF and other parties have obtained a stay in the court and the hearings are being held regularly.

Eviction of the urban poor sheltered in 'unauthorised' tenements always churns up the single point argument -- whether the urban elite or well-to-dos respect the former as humans or not. And evictions have proved that they definitely don't get the respect that other citizens do. However, a few are citizen groups supported the migrant workers by helping them clean the area and supporting them in court-related issues.

Who are these slum dwellers who are wiped out now and then, like they were dark patch of the city scape? They are our domestic helps, masons, pourakarmikas, security guards, drivers, plumbers, cooks, nannies, delivery boys, sales employees in malls and hypermarkets, etc. They live in clusters called slums that have no basic amenities, because the city and its administration do not care enough.

Geeta Menon, secretary of Stree Jagriti Samithi, calls it a ""culture of development that captures power, plays with land ownership and thinks that those who really build the city are just necessary labourers and should have not have houses or own land.""

A majority of the slum dwellers from Thubarahalli say they are from West Bengal who have lived here for a decade now. But the origin of people living in slums has been a contentious issue. A lot of migrant crowd from Bihar and West Bengal living in Southern and Eastern parts of Bengaluru has been misunderstood to be illegal immigrants.

There was even an incident where a FIR was filed against a non-government organisation working with waste pickers by providing them identity cards and improving their lives.

The Member of Legislative Assembly from Mahadevapura Assembly, Aravind Limbavali was also instrumental in getting the migrant workers in Thubarahalli evicted. The reason, as per his Twitter post, was this:

Illegal Bangladeshi immigrants are a threat to national security & their number has drastically increased in Bengaluru. I have met honourable Home Minister of India Rajnath Singh in the past. Deportation cePicnter in this regards will be setup by Govt at Sondekoppa, Bangalore.

I would take strict action on any land owners or construction companies in Mahadevapura constituency if found employing these illegal immigrants. Your act will be termed as a threat to national security & shall be punished as per indian penal code.

There have been other similar instances. In August, about 400 sheds near Bellandur Lake were bulldozed after residents of upscale apartment complexes complained about open defecation and nuisance in the area, and termed the residents illegal immigrants.

This eviction had another angle. Occupying the lake bed area is a crime according to the orders by National Green Tribunal which makes it illegal to build and temporary or permanent structure within 75 meters of a lake. The migrants and homeless labourers in Bengaluru are forced to occupy lake beds and private lands, which always comes at a price. In Thubarahalli, people were staying in a private land and were paying monthly rental to the land owner.

Geeta says, ""The problem is with the mindset which looks down upon urban poor. Whom do we consider citizens of this country? This is exactly what is happening with Assam and its people, who are suddenly thought to be illegal Bangladeshis.""

Another reason for disdain towards them is them getting voter identity cards. Vinay says that there is a political agenda behind such claims. ""If these people go away, who will do their work?"" he asks.

Geetha says that this is about the political economy fostering a development that serves the purpose of power brokers, coupled with control on land. ""People who actually build the city with their hands are not considered to be at par with those who live in skyscrapers. Thus they don't have the rights to own a land or a house. It is the capitalist framework of mind where we want them to do our odd jobs but question their legality of citizenship whenever it suits the needs of the power brokers,"" she analyses."

She said she has received feedback that even school children behave much better than Indian Parliamentarians. But no amount of chiding helped as the Congress, AIADMK and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) members trooped near the Speaker's podium and started sloganeering against the government.

The Congress demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the 36 ready-to-fly Rafale fighter jets deal with France while accusing the government of lying before the Supreme Court on the matter.

The AIADMK members wanted Karnataka to take back its proposal to construct a dam across the Cauvery river at Mekadatu, while the TDP raised several issues related to their demand for special status to Andhra Pradesh.

Both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress members exchanged heated arguments with the Opposition seeking an apology from Prime Minister Narendra Modi while the other demanding the same from Congress President Rahul Gandhi for misleading the House and the nation on the defence deal.

This means that you will not have to link your bank account or mobile number with Aadhaar or give the 12-digit number for school admissions and other private services.

Earlier, it was mandatory to provide Aadhaar details for a host of services and welfare measures. However, this key change will enable the Aadhaar holder to refuse to share details for opening a bank account or getting a cellphone SIM card.

Aadhaar, however, is still necessary for PAN and welfare schemes.

Aadhaar-PAN linking:

Aadhaar is compulsory for filing Income Tax return, so you must link it with your PAN number. PAN-Aadhaar linking deadline is March 31, 2019.

Aadhaar-Welfare Schemes Linking:

If you wish to avail the benefits from government's welfare schemes and subsidies, you must link them with Aadhaar.

The amended law is expected to get Parliament's nod in the winter session. Going forward, the law is likely to be amended further to safeguard personal data and ensure the privacy of the Aadhaar holder.

Aadhaar is a unique 12-digit identification number issued to individuals by the UIDAI after storing their biometrics data. The UIDAI uses iris and fingerprint scans to obtain bio-metric data from an applicants and stores it in a database. It was launched in India in 2009 to streamline welfare payments and reduce wastage in public spending.

Over one billion Indians have already signed up for Aadhaar. The Unique Identification Number was earlier made compulsory for bank accounts, PAN cards, cellphone services, passport and even driving licenses as an overarching proof of identity and residence but after the Supreme Court verdict and amendment in laws, linking it to bank accounts, phones and other private services has become optional."

Where was the need to get Air Force officers to commend the choice when it was already established when the previous government had received clearance on all technical issues?

That the Supreme Court dismissed as ""minor"" the fact that an order finalised by Rafale and the UPA government was summarily discarded by the present dispensation is intriguing. There were several divergences from the established procedures for approval, which were raised by some petitioners but overlooked. If the Supreme Court felt that the judiciary cannot interfere with executive decisions then they could have rejected the petitioners straight away. The price issue was not looked into.

Appeals by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan to allow the House to function went unheeded as Congress members displayed placards and trooped into the Well demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the Rafale jet fighter deal.

In the din, the National Institute of Design (Amendment) Bill, 2018 was introduced in the House. The bill seeks to declare the various NIDs as institutions of national importance.

In the Rajya Sabha too, Chairman Venkaiah Naidu urged the members to allow the House to function as various notices on urgent matters, ranging from cyclones affecting lives in some states to price rise to agriculture crisis, have been admitted for discussion.

However, soon after the papers were laid by the ministers, members from the two major political parties of Tamil Nadu -- AIADMK and DMK -- trooped into the Well of the House, carrying placards and shouting slogans against construction of a dam on Cauvery river.

Some members from Andhra Pradesh were also seen displaying placards demanding special status for the state.

Amid the sloganeering, Leader of the Opposition in the upper house Gulam Nabi Azad said the privilege motion moved by the opposition against the government should be taken up for allegedly misleading Parliament and the Supreme Court on Rafale deal.

Naidu initially adjourned the House till 2 PM. But as the protests continued after the Rajya Sabha met again, the Chairman adjourned the House for the day.

In the Rajya Sabha, Azad alleged the government has misled Parliament and the Supreme Court on the issue, triggering vociferous protests from the treasury benches.

Tripura government has imposed a set of restrictions on the creation of new government jobs and advised abolition of vacant posts, in case new posts are created.

A memorandum issued by the Finance Department on Monday stated that Tripura already has the highest level of government employment in the country, in proportion to its population.

Tripura has roughly 200,000 government employees, including 60,000 pensioners. The estimated population of the state is 4,000,000.

""The need for this provision arises due to the fact that salaries and wages constitute the largest item of expenditure and it is absolutely necessary to exercise financial prudence and discipline while committing expenditure under these heads.

""Hence, whenever a department submits a proposal for post creation, it should be accompanied by a proposal for surrender/abolition of posts with equivalent financial implications, the memorandum signed by Chief Secretary L K Gupta, who also holds the Finance portfolio, said.

Restrictions were imposed on filling up of vacant posts saying all government departments must ensure that no process of filling up vacant posts is initiated without prior concurrence of the Finance Department and violation of the newly laid out plans would invite disciplinary action against concerned officers, it said.

""Some departments have a wrong notion that the Finance Department has unlimited funds for salaries and wages and that it is their entitlement to fill up all the vacant posts and create new ones. This is not the case,"" the memo said.

The Department of School Education has violated these instructions and was asked to explain their action.

Earlier this year, the department announced recruitment in over 14,000 teaching positions to fill up vacancies, that were to be created by the retirement of 10,323 school teachers, who were terminated by the Supreme Court in 2017.

As per the new rules, the Finance Department would monitor expenditure on salary and wages by each department on a monthly basis and impose cuts from non-salary budget for departments which exceed their approved funds.

If the food court saw maximum turnout so did the martial arts display, weaponry and the exhibition of Operation Vijay, Military Arts and Photography exhibition, along with Clarion Call Theatre, which too attracted massive crowds.

However, the highlight of each of the three days was the stimulating panel discussions on varied topics which left the visitors completely in awe.

Surgical Strikes Hype unnecessary

One of the most interesting sessions that took place during the festival was on the topic, 'Role of Cross-Border Operations and Surgical Strikes', wherein Lieutenant General DS Hooda (Retd), who was heading the Northern Command when the much-touted surgical strikes were carried out on September 29, 2016, across the Line of Control (LoC), said that the hype around these strikes were unwarranted.

During the session, Retired Lt Gen Hooda said that the initial euphoria over the success of the surgical strike was natural but the constant hype around it was unwarranted. ""I do think there was too much hype over it. The military operation was important and we had to do it. Now how much should it have been politicised, whether it is right or wrong is something that should be asked to politicians,"" he averred.

In fact, many war veterans citing their own examples on how these strikes are a routine affair seconded Lt Gen Hooda's views and said that the Surgical Strikes' was unnecessarily hyped by the Centre to garner political mileage, endangering India's future defence cross-border responses to inflict enemy damage.

During the discussion, well-known defence expert and commentator Colonel (Retd.) Ajai Shukla cautioned against the recent trend to colour military achievements with political motives. He also underlined the need to maintain operational decency and sanctity of the operations undertaken by the defence forces.

""Success has its burden"", Colonel Shukla said, adding that Pakistan had in fact been emboldened by the strikes as they now know that the Indian government would always be under immense pressure to strike across the border

after each terror attack.

Shukla went on to add that the excessive publicity of the September 2016 strikes, which were an actually reactionary strike to Pakistan's attacks' on Indian Army's Pathankot base and Uri, had set a dangerous benchmark for the Indian political dispensation, which they would find difficult to maintain in the eventuality of future terror attacks.

To a query from the audience, General Hooda said, ""In hindsight, it would have been better had we done it(referring to the surgical strikes) secretly. The aim of any such offensive had to be not only tactical but strategic too, which substantially hampers enemy morale"", he said, adding that he could not say with certainty if India had actually achieved that objective in full measure.

Citing the example of the 1981 Israeli air strikes on Iraqi nuclear sites, which had caused considerable damage, Lt. General (Retd.) NS Brar too underlined the need to ensure the long-term impact on the enemy before undertaking any such operation in future.

Cautioning the political masters against being adventurers, General Brar asked if the political masters would have taken responsibility had there been any causalities in the strikes.

Proposal to have marigold flower declared as a remembrance flower as a tribute to the fallen soldiers

One of the key developments at the Military Literature Festival was the unanimous call by the veterans, experts during the session on ""India's contribution to the World War I"" to moot a proposal to the centre government that orange marigold be declared as a

remembrance flower for honouring the memory of fallen heroes, on the lines of the Red Poppy chosen for by the British government for the same cause.

The proposal, mooted by noted military historian Squadron Leader Rana Chhina, was supported in by all panellists, and it was resolved to formally forward this proposal to the Central Government. The discussion also resulted in a demand for a dedicated war memorial to commemorate the sacrifices of all World War I heroes.

The panellists consisted of Squadron Leader Rana Chhina, Prof David Omissi, Prof. Anju Suri, besides Dr Santanu Das and Lt. Gen. NS Brar, engaged in a discussion that underlined the social and emotional turbulence suffered by soldiers and families during the 1914-1918 War.

Government not keen on taking inputs from Defence Experts, rue Veterans

Another highlight of the event was the plain-speaking by the former officers and war veterans alike who minced no words when it came to India's defence strategy and the way ahead.

Defence experts regretted the reluctance of the central government to take inputs from them in drafting the country's defence strategy and called for brainstorming for a long-term

cohesive combat and defence plan.

At a session on 'Evolving Challenges in Indian Defence', the experts underlined the need for decision-makers to ensure that, along with a booming economy, there should be no shortage of funds for the armed forces.

Gen. VP Malik (Retd), former Chief of Army Staff (COAS) moderated this session while Lt. Gen. KJ Singh (Retd), Col PK Vasudeva (Retd), Lt. Gen. Aditya Singh (Retd) were the panellists.

Lt. Gen. Aditya Singh (Retd) said that China is bringing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in drones, which is equipped with face recognition features. He said that the future of war would be the war of drones and robots along with hypersonic aircrafts. Gen. VP Malik (Retd) said that along with these, the next warfare would also be cyber and space-based.

Col PK Vasudeva (Retd) questioned whether India was spending enough on its Armed forces as compared to China. ""In case of any conflicts, I can frankly say that we will not be able to face as blatantly as we have done in 1971 or 1965. What has happened? The army is basically indulging in counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism operations in Jammu & Kashmir and North East. Our soldiers are suffering because there are a large number of casualties because of lack of equipment, small arms, lack of ammunition etc. This is an economy which is one of the largest in the world, but has not been able to provide the

basic minimum equipment to soldiers,"" he rued.

Giving the example of Israel, he said that the small country was surrounded by 17 of its enemy countries, but still, the entire region was afraid of them. He regretted that the Indian government was spending crores on statues and bullet trains while neglecting the defence budget. Lt Gen KJ Singh (Retd) said India should focus on punitive deterrents against its enemies so that they think twice before initiating any action against our country. He said that our country needs more credible deterrents such as surgical strikes.

Wisdom of spies

No military gathering would be complete without mentioning the Kargil war and therefore, Kargil was a major part of discussion during a session on ""Wisdom of Spies"" wherein former RAW chief A S Dulat disclosed that sufficient Intelligence reports pointing to intrusion of Kargil heights were submitted to the central government just ahead of the Kargil conflict.

Participating in a discussion on 'Wisdom of Spies', Dulat said the intelligence reports were shared with the Centre with all the pointers gathered by the Army before the war had started. Dulat, who was with the Intelligence Bureau at the time of the Kargil conflict, said the vital information was shared with the then Union Home Minister, who was also holding the charge of Deputy Prime Minister.

Earlier, Lt Gen Kamal Davar highlighted the importance of putting all the three defence wings physically under one unified command, with convergence in decision making ensured. Cautioning against the current trend of NSA being the 'Intelligence Czar' of the country, Davar said it was one thing to have information but totally another to act on all available inputs. He also highlighted the need to invest more aggressively in acquiring language mastery in South Asian languages like Mandarin, Sinhalese and Pashto.

Underscoring the need to adopt the technology, he said in the present times, intellect and technology need to be synchronised to achieve desired ends. ""Our covert capability would depend on the marriage of these two aspects"", General Davar added.

Experts call for more indigenous equipment of Information Warfare

Defence experts also called for the development of more indigenous equipment of Information Warfare in the country to build an edge against adversaries in the battlefield.

Participating in a discussion on 'Information Warfare- the new face of war', Lieutenant General (Retd.) Vijay Oberoi said despite major advancements in the field, India was still banking on Information Warfare Techniques imported from other countries, which could be very fatal.

Citing an example, he said that GPRS Technology, belonging to the US, did not perform as well during the Kargil War as was expected to. Lieutenant General (Retd.) Oberoi said that at a time when all forms of weapons, whether nuclear, conventional or sub-conventional, were being managed by computers it was not good that we were still banking on equipment made by others.

In his address, Lieutenant General (Retd.) RS Panwar said that while countries like the US, China and Russia had already taken concrete steps to strengthen their Information Warfare techniques, India was still to take an appropriate call on it. He said that like Army, Navy, Airforce, Space and Cyber Domain, it was also a part of modern warfare.

Lieutenant General (Retd.) Panwar batted for framing new doctrines and new structures, besides adequate skill development to give a major push to Information Warfare in the country.

Another session saw experts advocate a level playing field for private entrepreneurs for boosting Defence production in the country in order to make the country self-reliant in military hardware.

Taking part in a discussion on Military Industrial Base and Make in India, Former Chief of Indian Army General (Retd.) VP Malik said that India was importing 14 per cent of the total arms and ammunition globally, which was more than what China and Pakistan import collectively. He said that in 1992, the Defence Research and Development Organisation had chalked out a 10-year plan under which the then trend of 80 per cent import of weapons and 20 per cent export was to be reversed within ten years. However, General Malik said that in 2005 it was found that exports had increased to just 30 per cent and imports had decreased to 70 per cent."

The Pakistani establishment, a softer expression for its Army-led ruling clique, has succeeded in manoeuvring the main pillars of the democratic polity, the legislature, media and the judiciary. The executive, the prime minister and his cabinet is subservient to the generals, both overtly and covertly. The country is presently being ruled through a façade of democracy. Initially, those who control the country appeared to be successful in projecting and then installing a popular figure as its prime minister, but now it stands exposed. Pakistan's main supporters, USA and China, directly deal with the generals. They get the decisions or agreements reached with the political government get endorsed by the generals. India too has learned this reality, but only after the Kargil aggression. The Pakistani Army not only rejected the peace initiative of the two prime ministers, Atal Behari Vajpayee and Nawaz Sharif, but dared engage India in a war ignoring the saner advice of its civilian government. Sharif was dismissed.

During the recent tenure of Sharif, he did not have a foreign minister, instead this crucial ministry was handled by Sartaj Aziz, an expert in foreign affairs directly reporting to the General Army Headquarters (GHQ). In the strategic affairs, if the civilian leaders found inconvenient, they are sacked, exiled, jailed or hanged. Sharif was fortunate to be spared being sent to gallows, but he is put behind bars under various charges, with hardly any substance. For GHQ, he was increasingly becoming inconvenient, because he had exposed the generals' power games and their key role in promoting the so-called non-state players. With a planning or conspiracies hatched by the GHQ and its secret service outfit, Inter-services Intelligence (ISI), Imran Khan and his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) emerged on the centre-stage of the politics. Shah Mehmood Qureshi, a favorite of generals, who also had served in the Musharraf's government, became the vice-president of this new party, which came into being in 1996.

The Army generals knew that Sharif is keen for a genuine peace with India. He would oppose any encouragement to the Canada based Khalistanis and favoured action against those who mastermind of the Mumbai terrorist attack and other mischievous activities of the Army and ISI. There were reports that for the past two years the new conspiracy against India was being hatched. Now an inconvenient prime minister sacked and implicated in corruption cases, the new Pakistani game is now exposed.

Sharif's another crime was his reluctance to the handing over of Baluchistan to China under the pretext of CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor), which is much more than an economic cooperation between the two countries with the setting up of a naval base at Gwador and providing strong optical fibre connectivity of the GHQ with the PLA (People's Liberation Army) of China. The GHQ is convinced that with the exit of USA from Afghanistan, Pakistan with its new collaborator, China, will play the key-role in the region. The new prime minister, who is known for his innocence, could be used by Qureshi and GHQ without any hurdle in the political system.

To ensure its absolute control on the political executive, the GHQ operating through the ISI had ensured election victory to Imran Khan, the most popular face of Pakistan and his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. It also ensured Khan divorces his journalist wife, Reham, a follower of pure Islam of the Deobandi school. His new wife, Bushra Maneka, is reportedly having close ties with the establishment. Her control on Khan's personal life is quite known that he could not invite his London-based sons in the swearing-in ceremony. Bushra asserted and Khan conceded. It all happened a few months before the polls, when all possible tricks, money and threats were unleashed to ensure Khan's majority.

The GHQ has succeeded in manipulating media too. Earlier, the press was quite assertive and could even dare the military rulers. Many journalists were imprisoned and suffered personal violence too. During the elections, a number of journalists were picked up by ISI operatives, and they were silenced. Apart from this technique, a number of electronic channels with highly paid journalists and anchors came into being in recent years to project Army as the only saviour of the country. These channels malign India and openly undermine the political leaders. In case of Sharif and his family, these channels painted him a rogue leader undermining Pakistani interests. The third challenge, the GHQ could have faced from judiciary, too is now being fully manipulated. Earlier, during the regime of General Zia-ul-Haq, an elected prime minister was first deposed and then hanged through a sham judicial process. Emboldened by the past experiences, and the new organization, National Accountability Bureau (NAB), GHQ ensured removal of a sitting Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, under the pretext of corruption charges that too under a democratic regime! Sharif lost his wife during the present jail term. His daughter, Mariam, who now symbolizes the woman power of the country, too is undergoing prison term.

Within a few years of its existence as a country only for Muslims, Pakistani Army started functioning as the supreme authority. The British Indian Army, which had recruited a large number of Punjabi Muslims during the World War-II years, continued in the force till the country was partitioned in 1947. It was a much larger force than the new country needed, but its political clout enabled it to the main ruling elite. Since there were no land reforms and the rich and powerful retained their huge properties, both urban and rural, they became the key supporters of the successive military coups in the country. It all began in 1954, when the Ghulam Mohammed government dissolved the Constituent Assembly. Its members were elected during the united India days under British, and had formed a constituent assembly, a counter-part of the Indian legislature, which drafted the Constitution and got it promulgated on January 26, 1950. The dissolution was challenged, but the Pakistani Supreme Court upheld the dissolution under the pretext of Law of Necessity. The then chief justice of Pakistan, Muhammed Muneer, who had justified the dissolution by inventing this logic, has regretted his decision in his book, Jinnah to Zia. However, it is now too late.

In its effort to challenge the Bengalis of East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, in 1954, the then Pakistani prime minister, Muhammed Ali Bogra merged the provinces of the West Pakistan in one unit. The Pakistani Constitution enacted during the regime of Martial Law Administrator General Ayub Khan too endorsed this merger of all the provinces. However, it later years, the provinces were restored their old identities, but the political clout increased manifold. In spite of committing genocide, the Army continued to assert in the Western Pakistan. Pakistan, perhaps, is only country, where the democratically elected prime minister is summoned the General Headquarters, to explain his conduct before the generals. The present strategy of the establishment is to ensure a pliable government using all possible tricks, which included pressurizing the local leaders to join the political outfit being patronised by the forces.

This practice was not so much exposed during the regimes of military junta under Ayub Khan, Iskander Mirza, Zia-ul Haq and Musharraf years. The establishment used to keep and promote only those politicians, who were ready to follow its diktats, but it did not rule directly. However, the role of Army is now much more pronounced. During the swearing-in ceremony of Imran Khan, Army chief Bajwa tells the Indian cricketer-turned comedian and politician, Navjot Singh Sidhu, that we are ready to open the Kartar Singh corridor enabling Sikh pilgrims to visit the place, where Guru Nanak had breathed his last. Like a brainless parrot, Sidhu, promotes this suggestion, and the corridor was inaugurated amidst the presence of Khalistanis. Siddhu, who was seen sitting with the Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai explosions, did not mind sharing a place with the Khalistanis, who are keen to revive the Sikh militancy in the Punjab in India.

They were just lap dogs and if they ever asserted they were either hanged or exiled. Z.A. Bhutto used to call General Ayub Khan ""papa"" and as a favourite of the Army he persuaded Ayub Khan's successor, Iskander Mirza, to crush the Awami League, which had won majority in the Pakistan National Assembly, by its overwhelming victory in the Eastern wing of Pakistan, now Bangladesh, where the majority of Pakistanis were living. These dark complexioned short-highted Muslims, though they had led the Muslim homeland movement in British India had to be crushed. Their crime was that in spite of being Muslims, they declined to snap their traditional culturally Indian identity. The tall Punjabi Muslims , who believed themselves racially superior, not only declined to accept the democratically elected Mujibur Rehman, but triggered off genocide against the common Bengali Muslims. The Pakistani Army having majority Punjabis not only massacred half-a-million East Bengal Muslims, also violated 350,000 women to improve their breed!

Bhutto, though initially a favourite of the establishment, was hanged by a fake judicial process by General Zia-ul-Haq. Bhutto, who as the new prime minister of West Pakistan, now named Pakistan, was elevated as the Army chief superseding a number of military officers. Bhutto's Peoples' Party was ousted by the Pakistani Muslim League (Noon) led by Nawaz Sharif. Earlier, Musharraf ensured that Bhutto's daughter, Benazir, too is eliminated by the goons having tacit support of the Pakistani Army. During the tenure of the People's Party's rule, Pakistani Army and its intelligence wing, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) continued to promote the non-state players, the Jihadis and terrorist mainly focused against India and Afghanistan. The ISI was the brain child of the British officer, Major General Sir Robert Cawthrone was deployed in the Pakistani Army to lead the Muslim soldiers of the newly created state. The intelligence agency came into being following the failure of Pakistani forces to occupy Jammu and Kashmir in 1948. During the Zia regime ISI was entrusted to keep a vigil on the country's political parties, mainly, the People's Party and the leftists."

Tripura government has imposed a set of restrictions on the creation of new government jobs and advised abolition of vacant posts, in case new posts are created. A memorandum issued by the Finance Department on Monday stated that Tripura already has the highest level of government employment in the country, in proportion to its population.

Tripura has roughly 2,00,000 government employees, including 60,000 pensioners. The estimated population of the state is 4,000,000.

""The need for this provision arises due to the fact that salaries and wages constitute the largest item of expenditure and it is absolutely necessary to exercise financial prudence and discipline while committing expenditure under these heads. Hence, whenever a department submits a proposal for post creation, it should be accompanied by a proposal for surrender/abolition of posts with equivalent financial implications,"" the memorandum signed by Chief Secretary L K Gupta, who also holds the Finance portfolio, said.

Restrictions were imposed on filling up of vacant posts saying all government departments must ensure that no process of filling up vacant posts is initiated without prior concurrence of the Finance Department and violation of the newly laid out plans would invite disciplinary action against concerned officers, it said.

""Some departments have a wrong notion that the Finance Department has unlimited funds for salaries and wages and that it is their entitlement to fill up all the vacant posts and create new ones. This is not the case,"" the memo said.

The Department of School Education has violated these instructions and was asked to explain their action. Earlier this year, the department announced recruitment in over 14,000 teaching positions to fill up vacancies, that were to be created by the retirement of 10,323 school teachers, who were terminated by the Supreme Court in 2017.

As per the new rules, the Finance Department would monitor expenditure on salary and wages by each department on a monthly basis and impose cuts from the non-salary budget for departments which exceed their approved funds.

As the House met at 11 am, Congress members rushed into the well with placards in their hand and raised slogans demanding a joint parliamentary committee probe into the Rafale deal.

There were more than 30 members from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the Telugu Desam Party and the Congress in the well during the Question Hour.

The TDP members were demanding special status for Andhra Pradesh while the AIADMK MPs were protesting against a dam on the Cauvery river.

In the din, only one question related to production of garlic was taken up. Even as Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh was responding to supplementary questions, Bharatiya Janata Party members continued sloganeering on the Rafale issue.

The BJP members were demanding an apology from Congress president Rahul Gandhi. The House proceedings barely lasted for five minutes and it was adjourned till noon.

As the House re-convened at noon, the protests continued.

In the melee, the National Institute of Design (Amendment) Bill, 2018 was introduced in the House.

Upset with the disruption of proceedings, Mahajan said the members were well aware that this was an important session as everyone will face elections after this.

She said the government was ready for discussion, but the ruckus continued.

""This does not send a good message and we have to face the public,"" she said.

Mahajan lamented that people from other countries were questioning as to ""what was happening in our country"".

""I got a message that school kids are better than us. Are we worse than school kids?"" she said.

Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said even they were ready for discussion, but demanded formation of a JPC to probe the Rafale deal so that every file related to the matter can be scrutinised.

To this Mahajan said that constitution of JPC was not under her purview.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the Supreme Court verdict has made things clear, indicating that there was no need for a JPC on the controversial issue.

Unahppy with the response, Congress members again started raising slogans, following which the House was adjourned for the day.

Five hundred years after the death of Leonardo da Vinci, a silk mill incorporating one of his designs is still shuttling some of the finest threads in the world across its looms.

Tucked away in the historic San Frediano neighbourhood in Florence, L'Antico Setificio Fiorentino was founded in 1786 and is one of the oldest silk workshops in Europe.

Its looms date back to the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, but the jewel at its heart is a machine to unwind the reels of threads, designed by Renaissance genius Da Vinci, who died in 1519.

""It is a warping machine made in the late 17th century according to the maestro's original design, and we still make passementerie (tassels, cords, trimmings) today"" using it, silk worker Beatrice Fazzini told AFP.

The polymath's device is used to prepare the threads before they are placed on the loom, following a technique that has been closely guarded down the centuries.

Golden chenille, damask and taffeta with floral or geometric motifs are among the fabrics made here and sold for between 200 euros ($226) and 1,500 euros ($1,700) per metre.

The workshop, which since 2010 has belonged to the family of Italian fashion designer Stefano Ricci, manufactures fabrics, lace and ribbons in styles and colours favoured by the historic House of Medici, an Italian banking family and political dynasty.

It was during the Medici's rise to power that silk manufacturing enjoyed a boom along the banks of the Arno River.

Mustard yellow, petrol blue

Fabrics produced by L'Antico Setificio Fiorentino can be found in places of grandeur both home and abroad, from Italy's palaces and the famous Uffizi Galleries in Florence, to the royal residence in Denmark and the Kremlin in Russia.

Pope Francis and opera singers Maria Callas and Andrea Bocelli have also worn garments created on its aged looms.

""It's a museum that is also a factory,"" said Briza Datti, interior designer and head of the commercial sector.

The hand looms move to the weaver's rhythm and bear ""the imprint of the family to which they belonged in the past,"" she says.

The designs and fabrics produced down the ages are preserved in the workshop's historical archives, which can be visited by school children or tourists.

The 15 or so artisans that spend their days teasing threads say it is a privilege to produce precious fabrics in silk, linen and cotton once used by kings and emperors.

""I'm lucky to work here, surrounded by centuries-old looms, but it doesn't feel like a museum, just a special environment,"" says Simona Polimeni, who trained at the school of weaving and restoration in the Tuscan capital.

""Each fabric must be woven by the same person. The rhythm must always be the same, or you risk imperfections,"" the 26-year old says, as she crosses the warp and weft threads in an echo of age-old gestures.

No fewer than eight hours of work are needed to produce two metres of this fabric, worthy of the court of 15th century Italian statesman Lorenzo the Magnificent himself.

On one of the looms, 50-year old Silvana expertly shuttles shimmering colours, from mustard yellow to fuchsia and petrol blue.

The Brazilian, who came to Italy 30 years ago to work in the world-renowned textile industry in Tuscany, said she is proud to have such ""a very creative job, in such an area of excellence""."

The Congress demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the 36 ready-to-fly Rafale fighter jets deal with France while accusing the government of lying before the Supreme Court on the matter.

The AIADMK members wanted Karnataka to take back its proposal to construct a dam across the Cauvery river at Mekadatu, while the TDP raised several issues related to their demand for special status to Andhra Pradesh.

Both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress members exchanged heated arguments with the opposition seeking an apology from Prime Minister Narendra Modi while the other demanding the same from Congress President Rahul Gandhi for misleading the House and the nation on the defence deal.

Amid sloganeering, Minister of State for Corporate Affairs introduced the National Institute of Design (Amendment) Bill 2018.

The Lok Sabha was adjourned thrice since it met in the morning, before being adjourned for the day, as the treasury and the opposition benches sparred over the Rafale jet deal issue with both sides raising slogans against each other.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was unfortunate that the Opposition members were not allowing the Lok Sabha to function. The BJP workers and leaders also held protests in several parts of the country against the Congress party over the Rafale issue.

Michael Flynn will likely walk out of a courtroom a free man due to his extensive cooperation with federal prosecutors, but the run-up to his sentencing hearing Tuesday has exposed raw tensions over an FBI interview in which he lied about his Russian contacts. The former national security adviser's lawyers have suggested that investigators discouraged him from having an attorney present during the January 2017 interview and never informed him it was a crime to lie.

Prosecutors shot back, ""He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents to know the importance of telling them the truth."" On Monday evening, the dispute -- and a judge's intervention -- led prosecutors to publicly file a redacted copy of the notes from Flynn's FBI interview that largely bolster the case, showing he told agents things he later said were false. Still, the mere insinuation of underhanded tactics has been startling given the seemingly productive relationship between the two sides, and it was especially striking since prosecutors with special counsel Robert Mueller's office have praised Flynn's cooperation and recommended against prison time. The defense arguments spurred speculation that Flynn may be trying to get sympathy from President Donald Trump or may be playing to a judge known for a zero-tolerance view of government misconduct.

""It's an attempt, I think, to perhaps characterize Flynn as a victim or perhaps to make him look sympathetic in the eyes of a judge -- and, at the same time, to portray the special counsel in a negative light,"" said former federal prosecutor Jimmy Gurule, a University of Notre Dame law school professor. Until the dueling memos were filed last week, Flynn had cooperated extensively and largely eschewed the aggressive tactics of others involved in the Mueller probe. Prosecutors, for instance, have accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to them even after he agreed to cooperate.

Another potential target, Jerome Corsi, leaked draft court documents and accused Mueller's team of bullying him. And George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser recently released from a two-week prison sentence, has lambasted the investigation and publicly claimed that he was set up. But then came Flynn's sentencing memo. Although Flynn and his attorneys stopped short of any direct accusations of wrongdoing, but they suggested the FBI, which approached Flynn at the White House just days after Trump's inauguration, played to his desire to keep the encounter quiet and as a result kept him from involving a lawyer.

They also insinuated that Flynn deserves credit for not publicly seizing on the fact that FBI officials involved in the investigation later came under scrutiny themselves. Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who contacted Flynn to arrange the interview, was fired this year for what the Justice Department said was a lack of candor over a news media leak. Peter Strzok, one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn, was removed from Mueller's team and later fired for trading anti-Trump texts with another FBI official.

Mueller's team has sharply pushed back at any suggestion that Flynn was duped, with prosecutors responding that as a high-ranking military officer steeped in national security issues Flynn ""knows he should not lie to federal agents."" Trump has made no secret that he sees Mueller's investigation as a ""witch hunt"" and has continued to lash out at prosecutors he sees as biased against him and those who help them. He's shown continued sympathy for Flynn, though, calling him a ""great person"" and asserting erroneously last week that the FBI said he didn't lie.

Flynn has not tried to retract his guilty plea, and there's every indication the sentencing will proceed as scheduled. Arun Rao, a former Justice Department prosecutor in Maryland, said the defense memo is striking because it's ""inconsistent"" with Flynn's cooperative stance so far. ""You also wonder in this very unusual situation,"" he said, ""whether it is a play for a pardon."" It's also possible that at least some of the defense arguments may resonate with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who was the judge in the Justice Department's botched prosecution of now-deceased Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska.

He dismissed the case after prosecutors admitted that they withheld exculpatory evidence, prompting the judge to say that in nearly 25 years on the bench, ""I've never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I've seen in this case."" In an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last year, Sullivan said the case inspired him to explicitly remind prosecutors in every criminal case before him of their obligation to provide defendants with favorable evidence. He says he has encouraged colleagues to do the same.

In Flynn's case, he directed prosecutors to produce FBI records at the center of his case, including portions of the notes from his Jan. 24, 2017, FBI interview.

Michael Flynn will likely walk out of a courtroom a free man due to his extensive cooperation with federal prosecutors, but the run-up to his sentencing hearing Tuesday has exposed raw tensions over an FBI interview in which he lied about his Russian contacts.

The former national security adviser's lawyers have suggested that investigators discouraged him from having an attorney present during the January 2017 interview and never informed him it was a crime to lie. Prosecutors shot back, ""He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents to know the importance of telling them the truth.""

On Monday evening, the dispute and a judge's intervention led prosecutors to publicly file a redacted copy of the notes from Flynn's FBI interview that largely bolster the case, showing he told agents things he later said were false.

Still, the mere insinuation of underhanded tactics has been startling given the seemingly productive relationship between the two sides, and it was especially striking since prosecutors with special counsel Robert Mueller's office have praised Flynn's cooperation and recommended against prison time. The defense arguments spurred speculation that Flynn may be trying to get sympathy from President Donald Trump or may be playing to a judge known for a zero-tolerance view of government misconduct.

""It's an attempt, I think, to perhaps characterize Flynn as a victim or perhaps to make him look sympathetic in the eyes of a judge and, at the same time, to portray the special counsel in a negative light,"" said former federal prosecutor Jimmy Gurule, a University of Notre Dame law school professor.

Until the dueling memos were filed last week, Flynn had cooperated extensively and largely eschewed the aggressive tactics of others involved in the Mueller probe.

Prosecutors, for instance, have accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to them even after he agreed to cooperate. Another potential target, Jerome Corsi, leaked draft court documents and accused Mueller's team of bullying him. And George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser recently released from a two-week prison sentence, has lambasted the investigation and publicly claimed that he was set up.

But then came Flynn's sentencing memo.

Although Flynn and his attorneys stopped short of any direct accusations of wrongdoing, but they suggested the FBI, which approached Flynn at the White House just days after Trump's inauguration, played to his desire to keep the encounter quiet and as a result kept him from involving a lawyer.

They also insinuated that Flynn deserves credit for not publicly seizing on the fact that FBI officials involved in the investigation later came under scrutiny themselves.

Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who contacted Flynn to arrange the interview, was fired this year for what the Justice Department said was a lack of candor over a news media leak. Peter Strzok, one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn, was removed from Mueller's team and later fired for trading anti-Trump texts with another FBI official.

Mueller's team has sharply pushed back at any suggestion that Flynn was duped, with prosecutors responding that as a high-ranking military officer steeped in national security issues Flynn ""knows he should not lie to federal agents.""

Flynn has not tried to retract his guilty plea, and there's every indication the sentencing will proceed as scheduled.

Arun Rao, a former Justice Department prosecutor in Maryland, said the defense memo is striking because it's ""inconsistent"" with Flynn's cooperative stance so far. ""You also wonder in this very unusual situation,"" he said, ""whether it is a play for a pardon.""

It's also possible that at least some of the defense arguments may resonate with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who was the judge in the Justice Department's botched prosecution of now-deceased Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska.

He dismissed the case after prosecutors admitted that they withheld exculpatory evidence, prompting the judge to say that in nearly 25 years on the bench, ""I've never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I've seen in this case."" In an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last year, Sullivan said the case inspired him to explicitly remind prosecutors in every criminal case before him of their obligation to provide defendants with favorable evidence. He says he has encouraged colleagues to do the same.

In Flynn's case, he directed prosecutors to produce FBI records at the center of his case, including portions of the notes from his Jan. 24, 2017, FBI interview.

The notes, publicly filed Monday evening, show that FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his contacts with Russia, including his past trips to the country and his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, then Russia's ambassador to the US.

Trump weighs in on military case","Hindustan Times",FALSE,"Legal observers pounced on Donald Trump's tweet, saying it could have a chilling effect on the prosecution and could amount to ""unlawful command influence.""(REUTERS)

A decorated officer in an elite US Army unit killed an unarmed Taliban suspect in Afghanistan. Of that, there appears to be no doubt.

What is less certain is whether Major Matt Golsteyn, who has admitted to the killing, should be considered a cold-blooded killer or a war hero.

The Army last week charged Golsteyn, a Green Beret special operations reservist, with premeditated murder in the shooting death of an alleged Taliban bomb-maker in volatile Helmand province in 2010.

Though highly unlikely, he could ultimately face the death penalty.

Golsteyn's case on Sunday was suddenly thrust into the spotlight, when President Donald Trump suggested he might intervene in the long-running legal saga.

""At the request of many, I will be reviewing the case of a 'U.S. Military hero,' Major Matt Golsteyn, who is charged with murder,"" Trump said on Twitter, having apparently seen a sympathetic segment about the case on Fox News.

""He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas,"" Trump wrote.

Army investigators looked into Golsteyn in 2011 after he took a lie-detector test as part of a job interview with the CIA.

He reportedly told agents he had killed an unarmed, suspected bomb-maker detained by his unit, who he believed was responsible for the deaths of two Marines who had died in a roadside bombing.

According to court document excerpts, Golsteyn worried that the suspect, who he was unable to detain for more than 24 hours, might make more bombs and kill an Afghan tribal leader who had identified him.

Investigators have said Golsteyn and another soldier eventually took the suspect back to his house and killed him.

'Unlawful command influence'

Legal observers pounced on Trump's tweet, saying it could have a chilling effect on the prosecution and could amount to ""unlawful command influence.""

As the commander-in-chief of the US military, Trump can technically take whatever action he likes in the prosecution of a service member, including issuing a full and pre-emptive pardon.

But ""he shouldn't be tweeting about it,"" said Rachel VanLandingham, a former military prosecutor and law professor at Southwestern Law School, ""as it sure seems to be a signal to lower-level commanders not to prosecute.""

""The president is not ensuring justice by his tweet. He is most likely obstructing it,"" she told AFP.

Golsteyn was stripped of a medal and given other reprimands following the 2011 probe, but he was not criminally prosecuted.

Then in 2016, during an interview on Fox News, he said he had killed an Afghan man, prompting the Army to re-open the case.

Golsteyn's attorney Phillip Stackhouse could not be reached for comment, but he told Fox the Army had sought initially to build a fake narrative in which his client ""released this Taliban bomb-maker, walked him back to the house... and assassinated him in his house.""

As to why Golsteyn is being charged now, Stackhouse said: ""The prosecutor in this case has intimated to me that they have new evidence.""

Why prosecute?

David ""Bull"" Gurfein, who runs United American Patriots, which is helping pay for Golsteyn's defense, blasted the prosecution.

""Right now we have rules of engagement that are actually in favor of our enemies, as opposed to providing our warriors the ability to address real-world threats,"" Gurfein told AFP.

Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter last week wrote to Trump asking him to look into Golsteyn's case.

""He is not a murderer,"" Hunter wrote.

""He is an elite warrior that was executing the mission he was trained to do. He engaged an Afghan bomb-maker, who had built the bomb that was responsible for the death of two Marines only days prior.""

But VanLandingham noted that the Army has a legal duty to investigate war crimes allegations.

""If the major admitted to others that he killed a detainee in US custody, other than in self-defense, that's one of the most straightforward and long-standing war crimes there is, and the Army was legally bound to investigate,"" she said.

""President Trump as commander-in-chief likewise has a legal duty to ensure war crime allegations are investigated and appropriately prosecuted, a duty his tweet seems to show he fails to understand.""

Military authorities have, to varying degrees of success, prosecuted dozens of cases against US troops accused of unlawful killings or prisoner abuse in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In some cases, military jury members are willing to grant wide latitude to defendants, whose alleged wrongdoings occurred while fighting a deadly insurgency under frequently shifting rules of engagement.

Trump has intervened in at least one other military case, when as a candidate he branded as a ""traitor"" Bowe Bergdahl, a US soldier and former Taliban captive."

Tripura's BJP-IPFT government has imposed a set of restrictions on creating new government jobs in the state. It has also advised abolition of vacant posts that are no longer required and in case new ones are being created.

A Finance Department memo on the creation of posts and filling up of vacant posts issued by Chief Secretary LK Gupta on December 17 said that Tripura already has the highest ratio of government employment in the country in proportion to its population. Fresh recruitments should, therefore, be done to fill post rendered vacant post- retirements every year.

""The need for this provision arises due to the fact that salaries and wages constitute the largest item of expenditure and it is absolutely necessary to exercise financial prudence and discipline while committing expenditure under these heads"", the memo reads.

It also said that each department in state government has a number of posts created in the past that are vacant and no longer required. ""Hence, whenever a department submits a proposal for post creation, it should be accompanied by a proposal for surrender/abolition of posts with equivalent financial implications"", the memo added.

Advertising

Restrictions were imposed on filling up of vacant posts saying all departments must ensure that no process of filling up vacant posts is initiated without prior concurrence of the Finance Department. Violation of the newly laid out plans would invite disciplinary action against officers concerned.

""Some departments have a wrong notion that the Finance Department has unlimited funds for salaries and wages and that it is their entitlement to fill up all the vacant posts and create new ones. This is not the case"", the memo said.

The Department of School Education has violated these instructions and was asked to explain their action. Earlier this year, the department announced recruitment in over 14,000 teaching positions to fill up vacancies that were to be created by the retirement of 10,323 school teachers who were terminated by the Supreme Court in 2017.

As per the new rules, the Finance Department would monitor the expenditure on salaries and wages by each department on a monthly basis and impose cuts from a non-salary budget for departments that exceed their approved funds.

Erstwhile Left Front government, in Delegation of Financial Power Rules (DFPRT), 2017, said that creation of new posts, filling up of vacant posts by direct recruitment, engagement of Daily Rated Workers, Multi Purpose Workers, contingent workers and contractual employees would need prior concurrence from the finance department.

The new Finance Department memo has advised ""strict compliance"" to provisions of the DFPRT-2017 regarding creation and filling up of posts."

The Congress president highlighted that the party had already waived the loans of farmers in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, two of the three states where the Congress came to power after the Assembly elections.

Rahul demanded an answer from Modi on why he had not waived farmers' loans yet, when he could work for the benefit of big corporates.

Parliament set for a stormy session on sixth straight day

Despite the first five days being a near washout, the commotion over Rafale row is unlikely to die down on the sixth day of Winter Session as Opposition and the government continue to spar over the issue outside Parliament. Reports say that Congress party is planning to hold 50 pressers in the coming days, while BJP ministers and leaders fanned out across the country Monday to allege Congress of spreading ""falsehood"" with an ""amazing audacity"" over the Rafale issue.

On Monday, the opposition party gave privilege notices against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government -- only to be countered with a notice against Rahul Gandhi by the ruling party MPs.

Parliament LIVE updates: The Lok Sabha session resumed at noon amid shots of ""chowkidaar chor hai'. The ruckus continued even as Speaker Sumitra Mahajan tried to get the session underway. Mahajan appealed to MPs to allow the session to proceed, saying Parliament was a place for discussion. As her appeals fell on deaf ears, she adjourned the Lok Sabha for the day.

BJP MPs Sanjay Jaiswal, Anurag Thakur and Nishikant Dubey have moved a privilege motion in the Lok Sabha against Congress president Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale controversy, seeking action against Rahul over his speech during the debate on the no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government in Parliament's Monsoon Session. Congress MP KC Venugopal, too, has moved a privilege motion against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that the government submitted misrepresented facts on the Rafale deal to the Supreme Court.

Meanwhile, the All India Trinamool Congress party has given a notice under Rule 267 in Rajya Sabha to take up discussion on the rising unemployment and lack of job opportunities, another thorny issue that the Opposition parties use to corner the government.

The Rafale row was expected to rock Parliament on the sixth straight day of the Winter Session even as the first week was a wash out over the controversy. The Congress party will move an Adjournment Motion for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the deal.

Moreover, Left parties will seek a reply from the government on the questions raised against the Supreme Court verdict on the Rafale deal last Friday. The Congress and BJP, meanwhile, are locked in a battle of privilege motions, with the Congress giving a notice against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the BJP responding with its own notice against Rahul Gandhi.

Monday, too, saw a stormy session in Parliament as the Lower House was adjourned for three times over Opposition protests relating to the Rafale issue. The Congress on Monday gave notices of breach of privilege in both Houses of Parliament, demanding an explanation from the Centre on why it provided the Supreme Court ""wrong"" information on the Rafale deal. Likewise, three members of the ruling party -- Anurag Thakur, Nishikant Dubey and Sanjay Jaiswal -- in the Lok Sabha too moved a notice of breach of privilege against the Congress president, alleging that he spoke ""falsehood"" and ""misled the House"" over the fighter aircraft deal in his speech during a debate in July.

The Lok Sabha was adjourned thrice since it met in the morning, before being adjourned for the day, as the treasury and the opposition benches sparred over the Rafale jet deal issue with both sides raising slogans against each other.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was unfortunate that the Opposition members were not allowing the Lok Sabha to function. The BJP workers and leaders also held protests in several parts of the country against the Congress party over the Rafale issue.

Other businesses listed for the day include a discussion on the increased frequency of natural calamities in coastal India and the Centre's preparedness in dealing with it. P Venugopal will raise a discussion on the natural calamities in various parts of the country, particularly in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, with special reference to cyclones Gaja, Titli, etc.

In legislative business, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan is set to move the Consumer Protection Bill, 2018, in Lok Sabha to establish authorities for timely and effective administration and settlement of consumers' disputes. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is likely to move for passage The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Bill, 2018.

The All India Trinamool Congress has given a notice to Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to include the issue of rising unemployment in the listed discussions today. The party has been attacking the government over the lack of employment opportunities for youth, alleging that the Modi government failed to fulfill its poll promise of creating 2 crore jobs every year.

Opposition to move Adjournment Motion in Lok Sabha

Two Members of Parliament (MP), one each from Congress and Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI (M)] have given adjournment motion notice in Lok Sabha over the Rafale issue. CPI(M) MP Mohammed Salim and Congress MP Ranjeet Ranjan have given adjournment Motion Notice in Lok Sabha during the ongoing Winter Session of the Parliament over Rafale jets issue pertaining to the Centre's decision to purchase 36 ready-to-fly jets from French company Dassault Aviation.

Parliament set for a stormy session on sixth straight day

Despite the first five days being a near washout, the commotion over Rafale row is unlikely to die down on the sixth day of Winter Session as Opposition and the government continue to spar over the issue outside Parliament. Reports say that Congress party is planning to hold 50 pressers in the coming days, while BJP ministers and leaders fanned out across the country Monday to allege Congress of spreading ""falsehood"" with an ""amazing audacity"" over the Rafale issue.

On Monday, the opposition party gave privilege notices against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government -- only to be countered with a notice against Rahul Gandhi by the ruling party MPs.

Parliament LIVE updates: The Lok Sabha was adjourned within minutes of convening amid slogans of ""Rahul Gandhi maafi mango"" and ""Rahul Gandhi chor hai"" shouted by BJP members. Congress MPs also countered with shouts of ""Modi sarkar chor hai"", when Speaker Sumitra Mahajan adjourned the House till 12 pm. Rajya Sabha was also adjourned till 2 pm amid ruckus over the Rafale deal.

BJP MPs Sanjay Jaiswal, Anurag Thakur and Nishikant Dubey have moved a privilege motion in the Lok Sabha against Congress president Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale controversy, seeking action against Rahul over his speech during the debate on the no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government in Parliament's Monsoon Session. Congress MP KC Venugopal, too, has moved a privilege motion against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that the government submitted misrepresented facts on the Rafale deal to the Supreme Court.

Meanwhile, the All India Trinamool Congress party has given a notice under Rule 267 in Rajya Sabha to take up discussion on the rising unemployment and lack of job opportunities, another thorny issue that the Opposition parties use to corner the government.

The Rafale row was expected to rock Parliament on the sixth straight day of the Winter Session even as the first week was a wash out over the controversy. The Congress party will move an Adjournment Motion for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the deal.

Moreover, Left parties will seek a reply from the government on the questions raised against the Supreme Court verdict on the Rafale deal last Friday. The Congress and BJP, meanwhile, are locked in a battle of privilege motions, with the Congress giving a notice against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the BJP responding with its own notice against Rahul Gandhi.

Monday, too, saw a stormy session in Parliament as the Lower House was adjourned for three times over Opposition protests relating to the Rafale issue. The Congress on Monday gave notices of breach of privilege in both Houses of Parliament, demanding an explanation from the Centre on why it provided the Supreme Court ""wrong"" information on the Rafale deal. Likewise, three members of the ruling party -- Anurag Thakur, Nishikant Dubey and Sanjay Jaiswal -- in the Lok Sabha too moved a notice of breach of privilege against the Congress president, alleging that he spoke ""falsehood"" and ""misled the House"" over the fighter aircraft deal in his speech during a debate in July.

The Lok Sabha was adjourned thrice since it met in the morning, before being adjourned for the day, as the treasury and the opposition benches sparred over the Rafale jet deal issue with both sides raising slogans against each other.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was unfortunate that the Opposition members were not allowing the Lok Sabha to function. The BJP workers and leaders also held protests in several parts of the country against the Congress party over the Rafale issue.

Other businesses listed for the day include a discussion on the increased frequency of natural calamities in coastal India and the Centre's preparedness in dealing with it. P Venugopal will raise a discussion on the natural calamities in various parts of the country, particularly in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, with special reference to cyclones Gaja, Titli, etc.

In legislative business, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan is set to move the Consumer Protection Bill, 2018, in Lok Sabha to establish authorities for timely and effective administration and settlement of consumers' disputes. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is likely to move for passage The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Bill, 2018. Suresh Prabhu will introduce The National Institute of Design (Amendment) Bill, 2018 to amend the National Institute of Design Act, 2014.

A fascinating excerpt from heart surgeon Dr Raamesh Koirala's Charles Sobhraj, Inside The Heart Of The Bikini Killer.

'Sir, I will make the skin incision.'

'And I will cut his sternum.'

The two young doctors -- Subita and Ansu -- rattled off their wish-list in a single breath. It seemed like a pledge. Or a demand. I cannot say what exactly it was.

I was used to seeing these young doctors giggling and gossiping every day, always as cheerful and excitable as schoolgirls.

Their conversations usually seemed merry, far away from thoughts of dusty Kathmandu or its political system.

Neither of them had even bothered to register their names in the voter list for the recent local election

And yet, all of a sudden, they were making demands like these. No giggles. No smiles. Just a final, unchangeable decision.

They looked at me with solemn faces, determination writ large in their eyes. After a moment's consideration, I nodded, and pretended to get back to my papers.

From the corner of my eyes, I could see their excitement -- the excitement to cut open Charles Sobhraj's chest.

Subita and Ansu had been working at the hospital for a year. They had made up their minds to resign before something happened to change the course of their lives.

It wasn't unusual in the medical community for young doctors to take time off for postgraduate entrance examinations.

But both of them had postponed their plans for one reason -- to witness the surgery that would fix Charles Sobhraj's heart

Now, not only were they getting a chance to witness the surgery but they would be an integral part of it. They would see his heart beating, almost human and yet not quite.

I was beginning to understand their excitement.

****

'Hey! Did you know I am repairing Charles Sobhraj's valves?' I was back home and called out to Poonam, my wife. She was in the kitchen, marinating a chicken for dinner

Poonam is a doctor herself and is always very interested to hear about the cases I pursue. But today, she did not answer.

Perhaps she hadn't heard me.

'I am fixing Charles Sobhraj's heart,' I repeated.

She turned around to look at me. There was no excitement on her face, no happiness for the challenging case her husband had been entrusted with. It was most unusual.

Okay,' she said.

It dawned upon me at that moment -- the reason for her cold, almost scared, response.

Poonam's father had been a junior police officer at Tihar Jail in India, the jail from where Charles Sobhraj had escaped several years ago.

Although Poonam had then been a little girl, she had watched her father fret every night, consumed by anxiety and unable to sleep.

And now her husband was talking about the same notorious man -- Charles Sobhraj.

My wife spent the next couple of hours locked up in her room. From the sound coming through the door, I could guess what she was up to.

She was watching YouTube documentaries on Charles. She wanted to find out all she could about the con man, the cold-blooded murderer who had brought untold trauma to her father and had now sprung up in her husband's life.

During dinner that night, I tried to read her emotions. It was a quiet and tense meal; Poonam's mobile phone was lying next to her plate, overheated from streaming one video after another.

I could still see a film by National Geographic on the screen, paused midway.

My wife met my eyes, voicing a question I had no idea how to answer.

'Does he even have a heart?'

In the coming week, the ICC Cricket Championship was set to start. I was eagerly waiting for it.

I was rooting for India to win, primarily because of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. I will admit, I am quite an M S Dhoni fanboy, and became a fan of the Indian cricket team mainly because of him.

The recent news about Dhoni giving up his captaincy had dismayed me, but even so, it was thrilling to see him sail through as a batsman, scoring a thousand, 5,000, and then, 10,000 ODI runs!

I was thinking about him as I finished my routine duties at the hospital.

It was Wednesday -- my outpatient clinic day. I completed my rounds of the ICU and the wards by 11:30 am and headed towards the OPD -- room number 16.

I switched on the light in the corridor. In the waiting area, patients sat waiting for me, chatting with their friends and relatives.

Some of them called out to me in greeting. I smiled at them and opened the door to my room.

And I saw him. Mr Hatchand Bhaonani Gurumukh Charles Sobhraj. The infamous con man, the serpentine murderer, now in his early seventies.

He sat there inside my cabin, handcuffed, and surrounded by four policemen.

I sat down on my chair and switched on the patient-call machine. Charles Sobhraj hurried towards me almost as soon as I had pressed 1, 2 and 3.

'Hey, doctor! Can you help me?'

'Hello,' I said, quickly looking at one of the policemen. I was distinctly uneasy, seeing four burly, uniformed men in my clinic, all guarding my patient as if he could dash off any minute.

'Please sit down,' I pointed to the stool opposite my chair.

'Can you fix a meeting with my doctor? I think I need heart surgery.'

I tried to look nonchalant. I did not particularly want to divulge that I knew all about his ailment.

Navin and I had discussed at length the specific type of surgery that Charles needed.

It had been all we had talked about ever since we first got the news. Moreover, I could guess where this conversation was headed.

'I think Dr Navin was supposed to operate on you. What happened?'

I wanted to play a purely defensive game, just like Rahul Dravid batting in front of the wickets, extremely conscious of Shane Warne's bowling.

'Not him. Can you fix a meeting with my doctor?'

'Who is your doctor?' I persisted.

As an MS Dhoni fan, I was ready for the helicopter shot, if only I was offered a relatively loose ball.

'I heard that my doctor is climbing the mountains.'

Mountains? Really? Even though I had once gone to the Annapurna base camp and had recently returned from a subalpine meadow, I was no mountaineer. 'Who?'

'They told me Dr Koirala had taken an off for climbing.'

Ah, there were two Dr Koiralas in the hospital. I jumped at the chance to hit his off-stump yorker. 'Which Koirala?'

'No, no, not that one.' For someone new to the hospital, he seemed uncannily aware of all its doctors. 'I want Dr Ramis Koirala from Gangalal.'

Oh, god.

'I'm Raamesh Koirala. Is it me you are looking for?'

His facial expression changed; his jaw dropped visibly. He probably remembered me from one of his old visits.

There was that time when he had even allowed me to click a picture. He had probably put me down as a member of the paparazzi.

For a few seconds, he didn't say a word. I enjoyed those seconds tremendously.

'Are you the Dr Ramis Koirala?'

It is Raamesh, I wanted to pinpoint again. I hated it when people mispronounced my name.

'Doctor saab, he wants you to correct him the operation,' one of the policemen -- an assistant sub-inspector -- stepped forward. 'We had to take him back last week.'

Normally, I didn't take too long to decide the cases I wanted to handle. Previously too, I had been approached by friends and relatives of my ex-patients, people who selected surgeons based on recommendations, much like the movies they watched.

But this time, it wasn't that straightforward to say yes. I knew I had to review many aspects first.

Would I be able to reschedule my operating list? Or would I need to operate him on overtime? I needed to talk to Navin -- his surgeon-in-charge -- about this swapping.

I also had to check with the hospital administration on the procedural requirements of admitting a convict of such monstrous reputation from the central jail.

But most importantly, I had to convince myself that I was steely enough to operate on a cold-blooded killer. For all my medical experience, this was something I had never done!

I found myself unable to decide. As a doctor, it was my moral -- and professional -- responsibility to attend to my patients, even if their occupation was murdering people.

But that morning, reluctance prevailed. I looked at my medical officer, Sabita. Her face was blank.

'Let's meet another day.'

Doctors are said to be bound by the Hippocratic oath that prohibits them from refusing medical treatment to anyone, on any basis.

Being the best student of my batch in medical school, I had enjoyed the rare luxury of standing next to the dean and leading the oath-taking ceremony.

But neither the original text in Latin nor its Ukrainian translation at the L'viv Medical Institute had anything about not being allowed to refuse treatment.

The fourth point of the Code of Conduct of the Nepal Medical Council did have something to that effect, but I found it incomplete:

Will not allow consideration of age, sex, religion, nationality, ethnicity, politics, or social standing to intervene between my duty and my patient.

So? I wasn't! He wasn't my patient at all, and government hospitals have a rule against the swapping of doctors without mutual consent.

I could just tell Charles Sobhraj that I was following the norms of the medical practice

Poonam was very decisive.

'No. You will not do it. Just tell them so outright.'

While I understood her sentiments, I could not share them fully.

One night, I heard her talking on the phone with her father. 'Why is this happening to me?' she said. 'Why is that sick man a part of my life in two different countries, involved with the only two men I love? Is destiny giving me an ominous sign?'

I was sitting on the balcony, sipping tea and brooding over my wife's worries, when Madan, Charles's doctor-in-charge at the central jail, called.

'Raamesh, please take over the case of Sobhraj.' No small talk, no background. Here was a senior doctor issuing an order to me, all under the guise of 'please'.

I was glad I was finally speaking to a doctor in the know-how of things, someone well-versed with Charles's case.

Surely, he could tell me why it was so important that I perform the surgery, even when Navin -- the designated surgeon -- was fully capable.

'Why must it be me?'

'His plea created a huge drama. That's why we want you to operate.' He paused.

I got the feeling that if it hadn't been for the plea and the international media coverage that followed, Charles would have probably been operated upon while I was in Khaptad.

'Dai, I don't understand. He is imprisoned for life, isn't he?'

'Yes.'

'Is there any harm to you, Nepal, or even the mankind if he dies?'

'No.'

'Will you get a promotion if he gets cured?'

'No.'

'Will you face any inquiry if he dies during or after the surgery?'

'No.'

'But he is still important for us?'

'Yes.'

'Then why am I being involved?' I was getting tired of his monosyllabic yes or no answers.

He spoke after a moment or two. 'I am pretty sure Charles Sobhraj will pass his last days in the Golghar. But we cannot afford his death during heart surgery.'

'Why not?'

'Don't be naive. It would lead to so much international defamation you cannot even imagine!'

'So, you'd rather put my reputation and entire career at risk than risk the life of a convict slated to die one day in jail?'

'You are free to think that way, bhai. Anyway, you are not well known, are you?'

I abruptly disconnected the call. I didn't like the tone that doctor took with me -- I don't have false notions of being a world-famous doctor, but I was certainly not inferior to the murderer.

Madan's phone call ruined the rest of the evening for me. I tried to seek some consolation from the India-Pakistan cricket match for the ICC Champions Trophy.

But it did me no good. I kept waiting for Dhoni to bat, to inch towards 10,000 ODI runs, but his turn never came.

He came to my outpatient clinic first, for preliminary scans. I glanced at the policemen accompanying him, peering slyly through my spectacles, and wondered what weapons they possessed.

Charles looked frail and sick, seemingly having aged several years in a few weeks. If it had been anyone else, even the prospect of 'escape' would have been ludicrous. But this was Charles Sobhraj.

A few hours earlier, we had completed our preparations for his stay. It was a deluxe cabin, charged at 3,000 rupees a day.

We decided to keep his whereabouts a secret -- no patient's name on the whiteboard, simply to trick the media.

Five gunmen had been designated to guard him continuously. Ram had also requested to keep Sobhraj handcuffed throughout his time in the hospital.

'Do I have to pay?' Charles raised his eyebrows.

'Forget about the pay. Instead, pee.' His creatinine levels, a marker of kidney function, were unnaturally high and constantly rising.

A creatinine reading of 211 micrograms per litre was not good news for a patient about to undergo heart surgery.

I administered some diuretics and also added a dopamine infusion to his medicine chart.

The dopamine, a catecholamine, would help boost his heart's pumping capacity and assist it in delivering more blood to the kidneys.

I am a heart surgeon. I had taken on many challenging cases in the past -- cases that demanded swift decisions. 'A surgeon's hands must never shake; his mind must never double guess itself,' one of my professors in medical school would always say.

And yet, that day, decisions didn't come easily to me.

I knew the slightest error in judgement could set me up for a public trial. In a feudal society, a teenager could be beaten to death for the crime of -- or merely the suspicion of -- pickpocketing.

A girl could be beaten, fed human excreta, and tied to a tree for supposedly being a witch. When the public meted out justice, everyone was the police, the law, the judiciary -- all at once.

If something happened to Charles, I knew my fate was sealed for me. I would be called Doctor Death until I breathed my last. Success was my only hope of escaping that fate.

I spoke to Charles, 'Whenever you go to the toilet, measure the amount of urine and inform the nurse. Don't forget. I need to know that the drugs are working as they should.'

Charles turned out to be a model patient. By Sunday morning, his urine volume had reached seven litres.

The swelling in his leg had gone down considerably, and his breathing had also eased a little. The creatinine levels were down to 180 micrograms per litre.

If nothing else, it was a welcome sign that his kidneys could function well, if only the heart would allow it.

It made me feel a little better to note that the catecholamine was working; it had managed to power up his heart's contractions, leading to better blood flow to his vital organs, especially his kidneys.

'I feel better, doctor.' Charles gave me a small, watery smile on Sunday afternoon while nibbling at a lychee.

Earlier that day, a representative from the French embassy had turned up with a basket of lychees and mangoes.

I couldn't imagine why the embassy held him in such high regard, calling every day to inquire about his well-being, sending people with baskets of fruit.

If only they gave half of this consideration to our campaign to free the pavement for pedestrians!

By Monday morning, Sobhraj's creatinine levels were down to 155 -- only a little higher than the average mark.

Another significant decision now faced me -- the specific type of surgery to perform on his heart valves.

I was desperate to conduct a successful operation, to see Charles emerge alive and healthy. There was no scope for error, human or otherwise.

'When do you plan to operate?' On the day of admission, Shakuntala Didi asked me.

'I am arranging for the blood donors as you asked.'

'Sometime next week,' I said vaguely. Mondays and Thursdays were my operation days, but I had yet to accept the finality of it all.

SEEKING COMPENSATION for the loss of life of his son and grandson in an accident at Banur, a 56-year-old Banur resident has filed a case in the Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal (MACT) at district courts in Chandigarh against the car driver and owner of the car Abhinav Bindra, a 2008 Beijing Olympics gold medallist.

The petition for compensation has been filed by Mukhtiar Singh, father of Mangat Singh, in the court of Rajesh Sharma, seeking compensation of Rs 50 lakh on account of death of his son Mangat Singh, 32, and Rs 20 lakh on account of death of his grandson Gursewak Singh, 10. Both the victims are survived by Mukhtiar Singh, as Mangat had been separated from his wife while Mukhtiar's wife has already died.

The application for the claim has been filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act against Banty (driver of the offending vehicle), a resident of Firozepur, and Abhinav Bindra (owner of the offending vehicle), a resident of Mohali, and also against the Oriental Insurance Company Limited. As per the petition, Mangat Singh worked as a junk dealer and earned Rs 20,000 per month while Gursewak was a student of class II and was studying at Holy Marry Public School at Banur.

As per the petition filed by advocate C M Attri, it has been alleged that the accident occurred on March 10, 2018, when around 4.45 pm, the duo father Mangat Singh (32) and his son Gursewak Singh (10), both residents of Khizargarh village, Banur, were heading on the motorcycle (PB-11-AR-1528) from Banur to their village. While they were crossing the Banur village, on Rajpura road to Zirakpur, a rashly driven Volvo car (PB- 65-H-3049) came from Zirakpur side, driven by Banty in an uncontrollable speed, and hit the victim's motorcycle from behind. Due to the impact of the hit, the motorcycle was dragged for around 100 metres as it stuck in the tyres of the car. The incident was witnessed by another motorcyclist, Ramdiya, who belonged to the same village of victim, who was also on the same road on his motorcycle (PB-65-AJ-8825). Due to the impact of the accident, Mangat Singh died on the spot while Gursewak suffered grievous injuries, who was then rushed to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, by Ramdiya and other people gathered on the spot. However, the two were declared dead on arrival.

The accused car driver, Banty, who managed to escape, was arrested later by the police and a case was registered against him at the Banur police station under sections 279, 304 A and 427 of the IPC. Banty is now facing a trial in the JMIC court at district courts of Mohali.

When contacted, the father of Abhinav Bindra, Apjit Bindra, told Chandigarh Newsline that the car was sold to a car dealer in Chandigarh a year before the accident occurred. ""After the car was sold to the dealer, he had sold it further to the accused person Banty, whom we do not know. We have all the sale deed documents of the car and we have nothing to do with the accident,"" said Apjit Bindra."

Michael Flynn may have given extraordinary cooperation to prosecutors, but the run-up to his sentencing hearing Tuesday has exposed raw tensions over an FBI interview in which the former national security adviser lied about his Russian contacts.

Flynn's lawyers have suggested that investigators discouraged him from having an attorney present during the January 2017 interview and never informed him it was a crime to lie. Prosecutors shot back, ""He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents to know the importance of telling them the truth.""

The mere insinuation of underhanded tactics was startling given the seemingly productive relationship between the two sides, and it was especially striking since prosecutors with special counsel Robert Mueller's office have praised Flynn's cooperation and recommended against prison time. The defense arguments spurred speculation that Flynn may be trying to get sympathy from President Donald Trump or may be playing to a judge known for a zero-tolerance view of government misconduct.

""It's an attempt, I think, to perhaps characterize Flynn as a victim or perhaps to make him look sympathetic in the eyes of a judge _ and, at the same time, to portray the special counsel in a negative light,"" said former federal prosecutor Jimmy Gurule, a University of Notre Dame law school professor.

Advertising

Until the dueling memos were filed last week, the sentencing hearing for Flynn _ who pleaded guilty to lying about a conversation during the transition period with the then-Russian ambassador _ was expected to be devoid of the drama characterizing other of Mueller's cases.

Prosecutors, for instance, have accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to them even after he agreed to cooperate. Another potential target, Jerome Corsi, leaked draft court documents and accused Mueller's team of bullying him. And George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser recently released from a two-week prison sentence, has lambasted the investigation and publicly claimed that he was set up.

Flynn, by contrast, has been notably silent even as his supporters advocated a more combative stance. He met privately with investigators 19 times and provided cooperation so extensive that prosecutors said he was entitled to avoid prison altogether.

Then came his sentencing memo.

Although Flynn and his attorneys stopped short of any direct accusations of wrongdoing, they took pains to note that Flynn, unlike other defendants in Mueller's investigation, was not informed that it was against the law to lie to the FBI. They suggest the FBI, which approached Flynn at the White House just days after Trump's inauguration, played to his desire to keep the encounter quiet by telling him the quickest way to get the interview done was for him to be alone with the agents _ rather than involve lawyers.

They also insinuate that Flynn, of Middletown, Rhode Island, deserves credit for not publicly seizing on the fact that FBI officials involved in the investigation later came under scrutiny themselves. Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who contacted Flynn to arrange the interview, was fired this year for what the Justice Department said was a lack of candor over a news media leak. Peter Strzok, one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn, was removed from Mueller's team and later fired for trading anti-Trump texts with another FBI official.

Mueller's team has sharply pushed back at any suggestion that Flynn was duped, with prosecutors responding in their own sentencing memo Friday that there was no obligation to warn Flynn against lying.

""A sitting National Security (Adviser), former head of an intelligence agency, retired Lieutenant General, and 33-year veteran of the armed forces knows he should not lie to federal agents,"" prosecutors wrote. Former FBI Director James Comey criticized the broadsides on the Flynn investigation during a Monday appearance on Capitol Hill, saying, ""They're up here attacking the FBI's investigation of a guy who pled guilty to lying to the FBI.""

Trump has made no secret that he sees Mueller's investigation as a ""witch hunt"" and has continued to lash out at prosecutors he sees as biased against him and those who help them. He's shown continued sympathy for Flynn, though, calling him a ""great person"" and asserting _ erroneously _ that the FBI has said he didn't lie.

Flynn has not tried to retract his guilty plea, and there's every indication the sentencing will proceed as scheduled. Arun Rao, a former Justice Department prosecutor in Maryland, said the defense memo is striking because it's ""inconsistent"" with Flynn's cooperative stance so far.

""You also wonder in this very unusual situation,"" he said, ""whether it is a play for a pardon.""

It's also possible that at least some of the defense arguments may resonate with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who directed prosecutors to produce FBI records related to Flynn's interview. That included portions of the notes from Flynn's Jan. 24, 2017, FBI interview, which is at the center of his case.

In response to Sullivan's order, prosecutors publicly filed a redacted copy of the FBI interview notes late Monday evening. The notes show that FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his contacts with Russia, including his past trips to the country and his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, then Russia's ambassador to the U.S.

Last year, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about the contents of his conversations with Kislyak during the presidential transition.

The notes show Flynn told agents he didn't ask Kislyak not to escalate Russia's response to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in response to election interference. But Flynn admitted in court papers last year that he did.

The notes also show Flynn told agents he didn't ask Kislyak to see if Russia would vote a certain way on a United Nations resolution involving Israeli settlements. But in court papers last year he admitted that he did ask Kislyak to see if Russia would vote against or delay the resolution. Court papers show Flynn made that request at the direction of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner. It's unclear what impact, if any, the notes will have on Sullivan's sentencing decision.

Sullivan was the judge in the Justice Department's botched prosecution of now-deceased Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska. He dismissed the case after prosecutors admitted that they withheld exculpatory evidence, prompting the judge to say that in nearly 25 years on the bench, ""I've never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I've seen in this case.""

In an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last year, Sullivan said the case inspired him to explicitly remind prosecutors in every criminal case before him of their obligation to provide defendants with favorable evidence. He says he has encouraged colleagues to do the same. But while Sullivan has proved especially sensitive to hints of government overreach, nothing about the Flynn case comes close, said Gurule, the law professor.

3. 2 Women Arrested for Rs 3 Crore Scam at Mumbai's Hindu Gymkhana

Police recently arrested two women, including the senior manager of an investment company, after Bombay high court pulled them up for poor progress of investigations in a Rs 3-crore fixed deposit scam of Hindu Gymkhana, Mumbai.

Binal Shah and agent, Bina Barot were arrested on 13 December for cheating, forgery, breach of trust, using bogus documents as genuine and criminal conspiracy.

Early this month, a division bench of Justices B P Dharmadhikari and S V Kotwal, hearing a petition filed by P J Hindu Gymkhana and seeking details of investigations, had come down heavily on police and directed the police commissioner to look into the matter and file an affidavit.

The gymkhana is one of many entities defrauded by the syndicate, which under the pretext of availing good interest rates in FDs, opened overdraft loan accounts in the names of various companies and siphoned huge amounts with forged documents.

5. CID Charge Sheets Officer in Sexual Harassment Case

Criminal Investigation Department has filed a charge sheet against Bihar cadre IPS Pushkar Anand in Bhabua court in case of sexually harassing his sub-ordinate woman deputy superintendent of police.

Anand's parents had also been accused in the complaint.

A magistrate court on Monday, 17 December, sentenced two men to a year in jail for robbing a woman's handbag in Bandra.

Ashraf Sayyed, 28, and Asif Shaikh, 23, in May last year robbed Lordin D'Souza while she was travelling with her husband, Francis, in an autorickshaw on the Western Express Highway (WEH) near the Bandra railway bridge.

Her purse contained Rs15,000 in cash and her phone, apart from other objects. The Khar police later managed to arrest the duo based on a tip-off and also recovered a pistol with its magazine and bullets on them. The bike used while committing the robbery was also seized.

While the defence counsel sought leniency in punishment, the court noted that the duo, although young, has been involved in many similar cases. The fact that they were arrested with pistol and bullets shows their tendency in committing serious offences against property"", order said,

Justice was deliberately delayed during the UPA regime through the pressure tactics of the then central ruling dispensation by intruding into the independence of the judiciary. Now justice is at last delivered after 34 long years. Congress leader Kamal Nath, Sanjay Gandhi's Doon School buddy was Indira Gandhi's ""third son,"" the richest minister with assets worth Rs 263 crore as early as in 2011. Kamal Nath's appointment as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh is widely seen as a case real-politik trumping common sense.

Kamal Nath was accused of leading a mob outside the Rakabganj gurudwara during the pogrom. Two Sikhs were burnt to death in his vicinity. His presence at the gurudwara was testified to formally by the police and a journalist. H S Phoolka and Manoj Mita in their book on the pogrom point out that his presence for two hours at the head of a mob near the gurudwara was never satisfactorily explained. As explanation Kamal Nath said that he was there at the behest of Rajiv Gandhi. He denied complicity in the violence and the Nanavati Commission set up two decades later (a face-saving exercise of the Congress party) to enquire into the pogrom have given Kamal Nath the benefit of the doubt.

Again none of the high profile Congressmen accused of abetting mob violence during the pogrom were convicted, despite allegations. HKL Bhagat, Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler survived probes and investigations for want of clinching evidence; the sort of evidence that seldom survives the State's complicity in organised killing; rather the worst lynching episode of the country. However Bhagat, Kumar and Tytler had their political careers cut short because of their association with 1984 annihilation of Sikhs. But Kamal Nath continued to prosper being in the inner circle of Rajiv Gandhi, a part of the young gang of courtiers who defined the craven political culture of Indira Gandhi's durbar in her last years. From Sanjay Gandhi's thuggish orbit to 1984, Kamal Nath is both a survivor and a representative of the dark times of the Congress.

The appointment of Manmohan Singh as prime minister twenty years later was seen as a landmark in a process of hidden contrition. In response to Opposition demands, in 2005, Singh addressed directly (as he was prompted and rehearsed by the Ala Kaman as a henchman) during a parliamentary discussion on the Nanavati Commission report to apologise to the Sikh community on behalf of the Government and to the whole Indian nation because the events of 1984 ran against the concept of nationhood enshrined in the Constitution. Does this absolve the Congress party of their dastardly acts of perpetrating genocide against a minority community as enshrined in Article 25 of the Constitution of India? And all this while appeasing another minority community as ""vote-bank"" and preaching pseudo-secularism only to remain in power by hook or crook? Although the symbolism of Manmohan Singh's elevation allowed people to give Sonia Gandhi's Congress the benefit of doubt, people of the country also realize that this is a clear dichotomy of the Congress party consisting of sycophants and cohorts.

Thirteen years later, it is clear that Sonia Gandhi's son and heir does not share the sense of shame and contrition of that hideous pogrom and his party's role in it. If he did, he would not have chosen Kamal Nath to represent the Congress's political revival. Rahul Gandhi was fourteen years old when his grandmother was assassinated and thousands of Sikhs were killed in retaliation with the complicity of the ruling party, the Congress. He might have been too young to take in the enormity of that massacre. That does not absolve him now as the President of the Congress when a person or a party fudges the starkness of its evil. What does Manmohan Singh, whom Congress had used as shield to cover-up deftly the heinous and most cruel massacre ever executed in the history of independent India, think of Kamal Nath's coronation?"

The application process for admissions to entry-level classes in over 1,600 private schools began on Saturday.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has also advised parents to not approach these schools till the department issues further orders in case any penal action is initiated against schools found to be defaulting the new rules.

""In order to maintain transparency and uniformity in admission, the admission process of these 105 schools at entry level for session 2019-20 shall be on hold till further orders,"" a senior DoE official who was familiar with the matter said. ""If it is found that the said schools are taking admissions despite being prevented to do so, necessary action as per norms will be taken without any further notice,"" the official added.

The distance of student's residence from school, sibling quota, parents being alumni of the school, single child, first child are some of the criteria listed by schools for admissions to the entry-level classes. According to the schedule released by the DoE, the application window will be open from Saturday and the last date of submitting application forms for nursery class admission for 2019-20 session is January 7.

The first list of selected children, along with marks secured by them, will be out on February 4.

The second list will be out on February 21 and the nursery admission process will conclude on March 31.

Twenty-five per cent seats in pre-school, pre-primary and class 1 will be reserved for economically weaker sections EWS)/disadvantaged groups under the Right To Education Act. The directorate had instructed all private schools to upload their criteria -- with points for each criterion -- for admission in open seats, on its official website by December 14. There is, however, no clarity yet on the schedule of the EWS admissions.

The government has also set an upper age limit of less than four years to be eligible for nursery, less than five years for kindergarten, and less than six years for admission to class 1. The proposal for an upper age limit was challenged in the court last year. Though a Delhi High Court order last year had allowed the imposition of the upper age limit, the DoE had decided that the order will be applicable only from 2019 academic session. Apart from the abolished criteria, the schools have been given autonomy to come up with their own points system.

The shock decision by Judge Reed O'Connor on Friday that ruled the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, unconstitutional was made with a partisan tinge and likely will not stand, experts say.

Health policy experts from across the political spectrum rejected O'Connor's reasoning for the decision and expected it would be overruled on appeal.O'Connor's decision determined that when Congress reduced the ACA's individual mandate - or penalty for not having health insurance - to $0, this effectively made the rest of the law unconstitutional. This is a broad view of Congress's intent, legal scholars said.

""Congress amended one provision of a 2,000 page law and did not touch the rest of the law so it is implausible to believe that Congress intended the rest of the law not to exist,"" Abbe Gluck, a health law expert at Yale Law School, said following the ruling.

Under O'Connor's decision, the entirety of the ACA would be thrown out, including popular provisions like preexisting condition protections. Given that such changes could throw the healthcare system into chaos and leave as many as 20 million people without insurance, it has caused an uproar among both politicians and healthcare advocates.

In a Washington Post op-ed, Nicholas Bagley, a law professor with a focus on health policy at the University of Michigan, failed to make sense of O'Connor's legal case. He determined that the ""logic of the ruling is as difficult to follow as it is to defend.""

""This case is different; it's an exercise of raw judicial activism,"" Bagley said. ""Don't for a moment mistake it for the rule of law.""

Indeed, O'Connor has been a favorite judge of conservative lawyers and has ruled against Obamacare on numerous occasions. And even many Obamacare critics have spoken out against the ruling.

""If Congress repealed all of Obamacare tomorrow, I'd throw a party. Despite my policy preferences, I'd say the latest decision from U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor of Texas declaring Obamacare unconstitutional is an assault on the rule of law,"" he wrote in an op-ed Monday.

While most experts agree that O'Connor overstepped, the prevailing sense is that nothing will change for the time being.

The judge issued what is known as a declaratory judgment - which, unlike an injunction, allows the law to continue unabated until the case is taken up by another court. Democratic states have pledged to appeal the ruling, so O'Connor's decision will likely not be the last word. Meantime, people who get access to healthcare through Obamacare's marketplaces or Medicaid expansion will continue to have coverage.

Looking to the future, many health policy experts also believed a higher court - whether it's an appellate court or Supreme Court - will eventually reject O'Connor's huge scope."

Panikkar was the acting dean when artist Chandra Mohan as a student had prepared artworks that allegedly hurting religious sentiments. The teacher, who is under suspension, only recently came to know that the university has decided to permanently withhold all his financial dues or retirement benefits.

Terming the university's decision, completely vindictive, Panikkar said that the inquiry committee appointed by the university has not even considered the witnesses presented by him.

The decision taken by the university was recently conveyed to the dean of Faculty of Fine Arts but not to Panikkar, who is presently working with the School of Culture and Creative Expressions at Ambedkar University, Delhi.

""Professor Panikkar is found guilty in the departmental inquiry report by inquiry officer K K Vaishya, retired district judge in the case of exhibition of artefacts of Gods and Goddess for public display at Faculty of Fine Arts in May 2007 created and caused communal disharmony in the society under the provision of O. 215 A, his all financial dues or retirement benefits if any with the university be withheld permanently,"" the university's letter states.

Panikkar said all this years he kept silent hoping that he would get justice. ""But this is totally unfair,"" he said questioning whether the university wants him to turn into a beggar at the time when he has reached 65.

""Despite reminders, I am not even given my last pay certificate,"" said Panikkar, ""I am left with no choice but to approach Gujarat High Court or university tribunal.""

Stressing that the right-wing managed university right from the beginning is working with malafide intentions, Panikkar said that the fact remains that Chandra Mohan had prepared the artefacts for the annual examination display in which no outsider was invited.

""It was Niraj Jain who had barged into the faculty. I was supporting the faculty's position that its autonomy and freedom of expression was being attacked,"" he said.

""Statements of none of the 13 witnesses including Chandra Mohan have been considered even as everybody asserted that it was an examination, an internal process of the faculty in which Jain had barged in,"" he said.

After the obscenity row, Panikkar, had decided to support a decision taken by students of the faculty to put up an exhibition dealing with the long history of erotica in both Indian and Western art. He however faced 'disciplinary action' after he refused to abide by the directives of the then university officials to close down the exhibition and was later suspended."

A modified swing, merry go round, climbers as well as a herb garden and a sandpit are some of the facilities at the Infinity park in Santhome adjoining the State Resource Centre for Inclusive Education of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.

A project of the Greater Chennai Corporation and Smart City (P) Ltd along with the Disability Rights Alliance, Kilikili and CityWorks, the model sensory park and garden was conceived to be an inclusive space for all abilities.

""A safe play area for children with disabilities is much needed and the park seems to offer that. Since it is close to her school as well, we're excited about the park and hope to come here frequently,"" said Parameswari's father R. Chelladurai, who had brought her to the facility. He said that the rubberised flooring in the play area would ensure that the children do not hurt themselves easily.

Tactile markers have been used to line the pathways, to ensure easy navigation for persons with visual impairment. The park also has an accessible basketball court where the hoops are placed at a lower level for children on wheelchairs.

On the sides of the park, games such as Aadupuliyattam and snakes and ladders have been fixed on stone installations for people or children who want to stay in a quieter area of the park. An accessible toilet has also been constructed on the premises.

""An accessible park is extremely critical to a city like Chennai and we had several discussions with the children themselves as well as parents, teachers, therapists and other people who are part of the disability sector to provide inputs,"" said Kavitha Krishnamoorthy, founder, KiliKili , a network of parents of children with disabilities, who have been focussing on inclusive play areas.

The Corporation was receptive to their suggestions and was ready to get feedback over the next few months to accommodate any modification if necessary, she said.

The vice-chairman and chief creative officer of Ogilvy India, Sonal Dabral, and his attractive wife, Beverley Soares, an erstwhile model, have a strong Bandra connection. Soares is a Bandra girl, a Goan-East Indian combo who grew up a stone's throw away from her current home in one of those ginger-bread fairy tale cottages that you and I fantasise living in every time we're in Bandra. ""My mum used to cook earlier, but since she passed away, we've kept the tradition of a Christmas lunch going,"" said Soares about her Sunday brunch repast. ""Even when we lived in Singapore, we used to host a brunch every year,"" she said, adding, ""It's the time of year where everyone's in great spirits and work winds down, so we always have it before everyone heads off for their holidays."" And, to be sure, the guests at the Dabrals' -- old friends from their shared lives -- were in good spirits with many adhering to the stated dress code of red, white and gold. We spotted Jimi Kapur, Nita and Piyush Pandey, Aarti and Kailash Surendranath, Gayatri and Prasoon Pandey, Nandita and Sanjeeb Chowdhury, and Jaya and Sanjeev Lamba, amongst the happy crowd. And, with a table groaning with traditional Christmas goodies like mulled wine, pepper lamb chops, honey-roasted ham, roast chicken, marzipan fruit cake, milk cream and kulkuls, and a Christmas tree all lit up, the season of yuletide and ho ho ho appeared to be certainly upon us. ""Bandra is at its best during the Christmas season, with decorations and lights all over,"" said the exuberant hostess. ""There are carol singers at the Bandra Gym, and you can get the most yummy food at the Xmas bazaar. It's so festive!"" she said.

A Charlottesville, Virginia, native, Grant Kersey can remember spending Saturdays cheering on the Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team at John Paul Jones Arena throughout his childhood.

He recalls taking a particular interest in the players at the far end of Virginia's bench. As a ballboy and spectator, Kersey found himself cheering for walk-ons to get playing time and to score during blowout victories.He never dreamed that one day he would become one of them.

Kersey had played basketball all of his life and became a dominant player at Albemarle High School. He considered playing in college, but he was presented with the opportunity to become a manager for the perennially dominant Cavaliers squad. He then realized having the opportunity to continue his love affair with the game ""was too hard to pass up at a school like this.""

Kersey didn't get to soak in the glory of representing a college as a player. Instead, he spent his first two years at UVA organizing equipment, wiping the sweat off the hardwood, dispensing towels and drinks, and rebounding for players after practice.

That's when everything changed. The night before Virginia's first game of the 2018-19 season, head coach Tony Bennett presented Kersey with the opportunity of a lifetime.

""'We just want to reward you,'"" Kersey recalls Bennett saying. ""'We're giving you a jersey, and we're going to dress you for the home games this year.'""

Kersey hadn't played competitively since high school, but the following day, he found himself on the floor for the team he grew up idolizing. He donned a jersey far too big for his 6-foot-1, 160-pound frame with ""Virginia"" printed across the back instead of his last name.He made his way into another game five days later and onto the stat sheet after he was fouled. He made both shots with ease and glowed as the rambunctious home crowd cheered in his honor.

""That was really cool to see when I was at the free throw line to hear the crowd,"" Kersey told INSIDER. ""I was trying not to think too much about everything because I didn't want to psych myself out, but it was really surreal, so I was also trying to take it all in.""

The following game, Kersey went viral. He used his four minutes on the court against the Coppin State Eagles to drain a three-pointer, earning him a spot in ""SportsCenter's"" top-10 plays and catapulting him into the spotlight.

Kersey has since secured a better-fitting jersey and more clips for his highlight reel.

He notched an assist on a dunk and finished on an and-1 against the Morgan State Bears.

But despite his newfound fame and success on the court, Kersey still happily performs his managerial duties at practices and away games.

""I wouldn't trade my two years as a manager for anything,"" Kersey said. ""Putting in the hard work, being able to see behind the scenes, and helping out whenever I could to serve the guys just kind of makes me who I am. I love being able to help out and do whatever they need.""

Virginia has three non-conference opponents remaining before conference games begin in early January, so Kersey may play again before the end of the year. But regardless of what comes next, Kersey says he's just appreciative for all of the good fortunes that have already come his way.

""Growing up, I remember I used to be in the stands waiting for the walk-ons and the guys at the end of the bench to get in and just hoping that they would score,"" Kersey said. ""To be on the other side of that and then hear everyone cheer for me being on the court, that was really a dream come true."""

The Women and Child Development Ministry runs Swadhar Greh as short-stay or temporary rehabilitation centres for adult women survivors of domestic violence and trafficking, as well as for women who have nowhere to go after being freed from jail.

The survey, conducted in August and September, found that most of these centres were not being used for the beneficiaries, and often functioned as hostels for school girls and working women; in some cases, girls and women were housed there without an order from a court or a child welfare committee.

The Ministry has now written to all the States to submit a list of Swadhar Greh after verifying their performance. They have also been asked prepare a quarterly progress report on the condition of the shelters and conduct surprise visits. The Centre has also asked that CCTVs be installed and entry of men restricted in the centres.

A home at Bhadoi in Uttar Pradesh had girls in the age group of 15-19, and most of them had eloped. The homes in Mirzaganj and Allahabad were found to provide shelter to its inmates without a court order. They also had mentally challenged women, who were rolling on the floor at the time of inspection, but there was no sign of treatment given to them.

A centre at Chikkaballapur in Karnataka was found to have a rape survivor under severe mental trauma, but it had no provision for her special care. There was no counselling for inmates suffering from depression. It housed girls who had eloped, but wanted to return to their partners.

A victim of human-trafficking was an HIV patient but a shelter in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, failed to provide her access to treatment. The report said she wanted to return to her family but was forced to stay. Many other inmates wanted to return home, but the shelter did not pay heed to their requests. In a Cuttack facility, a third of the victims were mentally challenged who needed to be shifted to a mental asylum.

Two centres in 24 Paraganas in West Bengal were found to be operating as a hostel for school girls who were in touch with their parents, the study said."

"605","1020453860","2018-12-17","https://starofmysore.com/the-joke-that-is-jpc-congress-wants-it-on-rafael-deal/","The joke that is JPC: Congress wants it on Rafael deal ! - Star of Mysore","starofmysore.com",FALSE,"The Supreme Court (SC) was perceived as soft towards some senior advocates appearing for Congress or in cases where success of the case would indirectly benefit Congress in the 2019 Parliamentary elections. For example, when an advocate told the Court that the case about Ayodhya Land Dispute be taken up after 2019 Parliamentary election and when the matter relating to the allegedly 'mysterious' death of Judge B.H. Loya, who was presiding over the infamous Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case was admitted by the SC.

Again when SC admitted multiple PIL cases demanding Rafael deal probe (rejected by the Apex Court on Dec. 14, 2018). Now with the SC snubbing the lobby and the Congress in the Rafael deal case, the perception about the Supreme Court being soft to the ""lobby"" is changing.

But then the trouble for the Modi Government, specially Modi, who has been called 'chor' by Congress President Rahul Gandhi to the point of ad nauseum, does not seem to have abated much less ended with this historic verdict of the SC. Look at the pandemonium in the Parliament on Friday, Dec. 14, 2018 created by the Congress. Having lost its battle, vicariously fought, in the SC, Congress was insisting on a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe.

Small wonder, why Congress did not think of demanding a JPC probe alongside the pending PIL cases in the SC which sought the Rafael deal to be terminated as it allegedly suffered from serious irregularities and when another petition (paradoxically) by former BJP Union Ministers, Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie, and advocate Prashant Bhushan sought a probe on the basis of former French President Francois Hollande saying that the French Government had no option in the choice of an Indian Offset Partner (IOP) and that the Modi Government wanted a novice Reliance Defence Company as the IOP. In other words, to favour Reliance with financial benefits.

Be that as it may, I wonder, if a JPC is set up to probe into the Rafael deal, whether it would really bring out the truth at all. For two reasons: First when the SC itself has found that there was no substance in the allegation and no wrong doing as alleged by the multiple petitioners, that too after scrutinising documents given to the Court in sealed envelopes, how could JPC unearth wrongdoing or corruption? Should the JPC, if and when set up, come out with evidence of wrongdoing, what will be the predicament of the SC? A matter of conjecture.

From our experience, JPCs in the past had produced only a fiction. In any case, the JPC would not be any different in its composition and also findings from the one constituted to probe the Bofors-India deal. It would be interesting to recall how that JPC and the Congress party reduced the Parliament to a rubber stamp and damaged one of the strong pillars of our Democracy. By sheer habit, it seems, Congress wants to repeat the JPC drama to keep the heat on Modi till 2019.

According to a report in the Indian Express of Dec. 2010, the JPC that probed Bofors-India deal was set up, after much resistance, following revelations made by Swedish Radio on April 16, 1987, that Indian politicians and officials were bribed by Swedish arms-maker Bofors to win a contract to supply field guns.

The Bofors deal was signed by the Rajiv Gandhi Government just a year before the scandal broke out. Though the Congress had 410 MPs in the Lok Sabha, it was rattled by the 'Breaking News' from Sweden and launched a massive cover-up to shield Rajiv Gandhi and his family from the allegation that they had received commissions from Bofors via front companies and friends with Swiss Bank accounts. As more and more information about the payoffs poured in, the Opposition stepped up pressure for a JPC.

The Congress conceded the demand in three months when it realised that the people had begun to believe that the Prime Minister had something to hide. However, even as it did so, it ensured that the terms of reference put the Committee in a straitjacket. It did not want the Committee to travel abroad or record the testimonies of witnesses in Sweden and Switzerland.

Given these constraints, the Opposition felt that the JPC was a toothless wonder and decided to stay away. The Congress, however, went ahead with this lame duck inquiry and packed the committee with loyalists of Nehru-Gandhi family and chose the most trusted loyalist -- B. Shankaranand -- as its Chairman.

Since it had over 400 members in the LS, this JPC was an overwhelmingly Congress Committee. Further, in order to give the Committee an 'all-party' veneer, some MPs of the smaller, friendly parties who reluctantly occupy Opposition benches, were drafted as members.

Shankaranand lived up to the great expectations that his leader had in him and produced a report which was dubbed a 'whitewash' by all citizens who could sift fiction from fact. The Committee claimed in its April 1988 report that no middleman was involved in the gun deal and there was no evidence of commissions or bribes having been paid. The Committee did not summon a single Minister or pose a single question that would have embarrassed the Government.

Surprising, at that time neither the Opposition party nor the NGOs went to the SC with a PIL like it is done now by the well-wishers of Rahul, Congress and internal dissenters of BJP regarding Rafael deal.

Within weeks, the media produced damning evidence of payments made by Bofors to several entities including Ottavio Quattrocchi, a friend of Sonia and Rajiv Gandhi, in whose account Bofors had deposited $7.3 million. Quattrocchi escaped from the country, with Police under Congress closing their eyes. Alleluia!

A year later, the Comptroller and Auditor General questioned many conclusions of this JPC, including the ones pertaining to agents and commissions. He wondered why the government had not acted on the advice of the Indian Ambassador in Sweden that Bofors' Books of Account be examined by Indian auditors and why the Bofors contract did not specifically contain the 'no agents' clause.

As all this evidence tumbled out, it became obvious that Shankaranand Committee Report was not worth the paper it was printed on. No other Parliamentary Committee had wrought such damage to the institution of Parliament as this one. But then, the credibility and dignity of the Parliament has always been sacrificed by the Congress to protect its first family. And now, one wonders, with what face the same Congress is demanding a JPC on Rafael deal after a clean chit given by the SC !

Unfortunately, we now hear the rumblings of resentment to the judgement from both the BJP and the Congress, of course, for different reasons.

While the BJP says the verdict of the SC was a great victory for the Government, the Congress says the BJP Government has misled the SC by filing a misleading affidavit.

In a rebuttal, the Government says the SC misread the note (affidavit), hence has moved the Apex Court on Dec. 15 for correction in the judgement saying, the Court erred in English grammar and misinterpreted the information submitted to it in a sealed cover with the note about the pricing of 36 fighter jets deal.

Reading about the corrections sought, I realised, English is the most deceptive language ever; not a precise one. I should now learn the difference between 'has been' and 'is' and probably turn to Wren & Martin grammar text of my school days. I am afraid, our SC Judges may have to now call in an English language expert to clarify this confusion !

Interestingly, today's newspapers inform us that the DMK Supremo M.K. Stalin, son of late M. Karunanidhi, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, has proposed Rahul Gandhi's name as the Prime Ministerial candidate at an Opposition meet in Chennai. It is nothing but one Dynasty paying tribute to another Dynasty. In fact, except for Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati, all others in the Opposition are from Regional Dynasties. It is like Kings paying tributes to the Emperor. Nawabs of small principalities paying Nazrana to the Shahenshah.

Today, it is an imperative for Indian voters to save India from its Dynastic rulers in order to save India's Democracy and Secularism. Has the Indian voter thought about correcting this fault-line in our present Democracy?"

Having written nearly two dozen analyses on Afghanistan since 2010, I can give you two good and one not-so-good news today. First of all, the Afghan war of past 17 years is coming to an end. President Barack Obama's words resonate to recall: ""I think Americans have learned it's harder to end wars than it is to begin them.""[1] Secondly, Daesh (the so-called Islamic State) has no future in the region. Similar to my prediction in spring 2017 (Radical Islamism: Understanding Extremist Narrative and Mindset) about Daesh's elimination in Iraq, I foresee the terrorist group's total rout in Afghanistan (though it would first need the U.S.-led coalition forces to leave).[2]

However, one cannot be certain about Afghanistan's internal security and stability, taking into account Afghan nation's historic ethnic distrust and tribal discord. 'Washing blood with blood' this time some 17-year-old 'scores' need to be settled too. In An Account of the Kingdom of Caubul (1815) Mountstuart Elphinstone (the East India Company's administrator who negotiated with the Afghan ruler Shah Shuja) had noted, ""To sum up the character of the Afghans in a few words: their vices are revenge, envy, avarice, rapacity, and obstinacy.""[3]

Washington's Revision of Stance

Taliban have always been insistent on a direct dialogue with the United States and the departure of foreign forces from Afghanistan to end their insurgency.[4] The two demands are now being met. Amid reports of President Trump getting frustrated with stalemate in the ongoing war,[5] the U.S. has not only showed its willingness to talk with the Taliban and discuss withdrawal of foreign troops,[6] but the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Alice Wells, has already reportedly met with the Taliban representatives in Doha, Qatar, resulting in some ""very positive signals.""[7]

However, it's too early to rejoice. Washington still seems ambivalent about its departure, carrying the stigma of another failed war from the ""graveyard of empires."" Eminent British journalist, Christina Lamb, records in her book Farewell Kabul: From Afghanistan to a More Dangerous World: ""Maybe we hadn't been chased out as in previous wars, but Afghanistan would always be remembered as a failure, in the same breath as Vietnam and Gallipoli.""[8]

The indecision, or reluctance, if your will, is reflected in NATO's Brussels summit in July 2018, pledging to continue to train, fund and assist Afghan security forces until 2024 - an extension of its earlier commitment to contribute US1$ billion annually until 2020 at the Warsaw summit in 2016.[9]

While Taliban stick to their list of demand: 1) Withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan; 2) Removal of the names of their leaders from the UN terror-watch list; 3) Release of prisoners; and 4) Allowing Afghan people to decide their political issues per their religion, culture and traditions, the U.S. remains preoccupied with the: 1) Survival of its setup created after 2001's Bonn agreement, including Afghan government and a democratic constitution; 2) Country going-down in another civil-war (similar to that of 1992); and 2) Rise of global terrorism from Afghan soil once again (after al-Qaeda).

A revision of thought in the U.S. mind has probably occurred after it saw that while a military strategy against the Taliban remained unsuccessful, al-Qaeda's reincarnation has taken place in the shape of Daesh in Afghanistan.

While a political settlement with the Taliban was always encouraged by all and sundry, it belatedly dawned upon Washington that ""Taliban are part of the social fabric"" of the country, who ""believe in the nationhood of Afghanistan, in contrast to other militant groups like Islamic State,"" as noted by Alice Wells, the special U.S. envoy.[12] Taliban's open letter in February 2018 addressed to the American people further helped in softening the U.S. stance and developing a better understanding about the group.[13]

The Eid-ul-Fitr ceasefire observed by the Taliban rank and file further demonstrated its unity of command, putting to rest any suggestion of (mainstream) Taliban infighting or factionalization.[14] A BBC study in January 2018 had found Taliban openly operating in Afghanistan's 70 percent districts, fully controlling 4 percent of the country and demonstrating their overt presence in another 66 percent territory[15] (see FDD's Long War Journal's interactive map of Taliban control of districts here).[16]

Foreign Forces' Disappointing Report Card in Afghanistan

Amid quite a few American failures in Afghanistan, the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) gave a poor report card to the U.S. led coalition forces in April 2018 for acute deficiencies in the Afghan National Defence and Security Force (ANDSF). SIGAR noted, for instance: ""Despite US government expenditures of more than $70 billion in security sector assistance to design, train, advise, assist, and equip the ANDSF since 2002, the Afghan security forces are not yet capable of securing their own nation.""[17] Afghan territory keeps slipping out of the hands of Western-trained Afghanistan's six field and one commando corps spread countrywide: 201 Corps, garrisoning Kabul; 203 Corps, Gardez; 205 Corps, Kandahar; 207 Corps, Heart; 209 Corps, Mazar-i-Sharif; and 215 Corps at Lashkargah.

Moreover the jittery manner in which the Afghan gunship helicopters killed 36 innocent villagers, including 30 children and wounded 71 others at Dasht-i-Archi in Kunduz province on 2 April 2018, demonstrated the level of training of Afghan soldiers imparted by the foreign forces. There had been a rationale behind denying Afghan security forces the use of gunships or fighter jets as they then begin settling their personal scores, tribal disputes and ethnic feuds themselves.[18]

Lastly, the staggering 1.17 million war crime claims collected by the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague must have also unnerved the stakeholders in Afghanistan.[19] Unlawful and illegal atrocities, including killings of unarmed prisoners by not only the Taliban and Daesh, but also involving Afghan security forces and government-affiliated warlords, the U.S.-led coalition and foreign and domestic spy agencies constitute war crimes in Afghanistan. Under immense international and domestic pressure, investigations have already begun in Australia and New Zealand[20] with the U.S. and U.K., also likely to come under ICC's scrutiny.[21]

U.S. Rapprochement with Pakistan

Having threatened Pakistan with dire consequences - including cross-border attacks and hot pursuit operations on Pakistani soil[22] - Washington has since stepped back from its bully (discussed in my last two papers entitled: America's Waterloo: 'Scapegoating' Pakistan for Failures in Afghanistan and Afghanistan's Managed Chaos: US Strategic Regional Designs).[23]

In February 2018, seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had warned the Congress about a nuclear-armed Pakistan slipping-out of America's influence into China's sphere, becoming a threat to Washington's strategic interests in the South Asian region.[24] Since an antagonized - and uncooperative - Islamabad remains detrimental to Washington's interests, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, John Sullivan, changed his tone during a visit to Kabul the same month, clearly conveying to the Afghan leadership that America has no intentions of severing ties with Pakistan or launching military strikes inside its territory.[25]

In fact, it had been Pakistan's army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, who told the Americans point-blank at the 54 Munich Security Conference in February 2018 to stop blaming Pakistan for its problems in Afghanistan and instead search for the reasons for its failures.[26] The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a leading British security think-tank, found the general's confidence in his celebrated ""Bajwa Doctrine"" - standing up against the U.S. intimidation, demanding Pakistan to ""do more.""[27] In his address at the nation's Defence Day in September 2017, the army chief thundered: ""[N]ow ... the world must do more.""[28]

Pakistan's defiance worked. Washington not only guaranteed to respect Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity,[29] but Alice Wells also acknowledged Pakistan and Taliban having legitimate grievances, saying, ""Pakistan has an important role to play in helping stabilise Afghanistan.""[30]

In a related development, President Trump elevated Washington's ambassador to Islamabad, David Hale, to under secretary of state for political affairs, a position which grants the diplomat more sway to implement president's new Afghan strategy.[31] Mr. Hale, who has been performing his ambassadorial responsibilities since 2015, seems to have the confidence of Pakistan's Army and its intelligence establishment as he strongly supports normalization of ties between India and Pakistan. The ambassador played a lead role in bringing-back Washington-Islamabad relations from a breaking point after President Trump slammed Pakistan (while outlining his new Afghan strategy on 21 August 2017)[32] followed by his ""lies and deceit"" New Year's tweet, condemning Pakistan for supporting the Taliban.[33]

In a rare coincidence, a U.S. drone targeted and killed Pakistan's most wanted terrorist, Mullah Fazlullah, the head of Pakistan's bête noir, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, in Afghanistan on 15 Jun 2018.[34] Pakistan had long demanded action against the fugitive terrorist who had masterminded one of the most heart-wrenching terrorist attacks in Pakistan killing 132 school children in December 2014. Demonstrating a modified outlook towards Pakistan - long accused for harbouring the Afghan Taliban - not only President Ashraf Ghani picked up the phone to announce the news to Pakistan's army chief,[35] but in an equally rare admission U.S. defence secretary, James Mattis, took credit for Fazlullah's elimination.[36]

I believe, it has been Pakistan's army chief, General Bajwa's astute military diplomacy - mentioned above as the ""Bajwa Doctrine""[42] - and some of his out of box initiatives that brought a much needed thaw in the conflict. The general, beyond doubt, has given some 'extraordinary assurances' to the other parties to the conflict with regards to the Taliban, to ensure its 'niche' in mainstream Afghan politics.[43]

Having huge stakes in Afghanistan, Pakistan has always pushed for a political settlement with the Taliban granting the militia some political accommodation in the future setup of the country. Pointing out such reconciliation in the past, through which a former rebel leader was not only accommodated in the political setup in Kabul but his name was also expunged from the UN terror list, Pakistan's former ambassador to the U.S., Aizaz Chaudhry stated: ""There's a precedence for this [political reconciliation] in the rehabilitation of Gulbadin Hekmatyar.""[44]

Criticising the disastrous militaristic approach of Washington and Kabul, Pakistan's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. (Ret'd) Nasser Janjua also stated at a seminar: ""Afghanistan is a story of pains. It is a story of injuries. It is a wound of the world and also of region which should be healed as quickly as possible. Every investment has been made to win Afghan war but, unfortunately, we have not invested in winning peace.""[45]

In my view, the revived bonhomie between Kabul and Islamabad - ending a hostile rhetoric and blame-game from Afghanistan[46] - has resulted from 'Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity' (APAPPS) signed between the two countries on 15 May 2018. Ostensibly approved by Washington and Beijing, the APAPPS is a Pakistani initiative carrying seven principles: 1) Pakistan's commitment toward supporting an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace and reconciliation process; 2) Undertaking actions against fugitives and irreconcilable elements posing security threats to either sides; 3) Denying use of their respective territory by any country, network, group or individuals for anti-state activities against the other; 4) Placing a joint supervision, coordination and confirmation mechanism to realise agreement pledges; 5) Avoiding territorial and aerial violations; 6) Refraining from public blame game, utilizing instead APAPPS platform for the resolution of issues; and 7) Operationalize six working groups including the ones on security and intelligence cooperation.[47]

In all likelihood, APAPPS carries some hidden pledges that have brought a sea-change in Afghan attitude and behaviour. An obstinate and fire-breathing President Ghani immediately softened his stance. Pleading the Taliban to come forward and ""save the country,"" Ghani not only offered significant concessions to the insurgents (details here),[48] but also recognized the militia as a political party at the second round of 'Kabul Process' on 28 February 2018.[49] The president further climbed down through his Eid-ul-Fitr ceasefire offer - unexpectedly reciprocated by the Taliban for the first time in the 17-year-old conflict (by Pakistan's persuasion or arm-twisting).[50] Another ceasefire is expected at the Eid-al-Qurban on 22 August 2018.[51]

A Collective Regional Front against Daesh

As seen in Daesh's defeat in Iraq and Syria[52] - and al-Qaeda's earlier trouncing in Afghanistan - no terror-group can withstand the might of a state, carrying monopoly over violence. Daesh in Afghanistan is a combination of three elements:[53] 1) Those militants who retreated from the Middle East and found sanctuaries in the lawless and ungoverned areas of Afghanistan; 2) The left-over elements of al-Qaeda who, after losing hope in Aiman-al-Zawahiri's uncharismatic leadership to advance their Islamic cause (sic), swore allegiance to Abu-Bakr-al-Baghdadi; and 3) The local criminal bands such as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, Lashkar-e-Islam, East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and anti-Shia Jaish-ul-Adal and Lashkar-e-Jhangavi al-Aalmi. Pakistan's Zarb-e-Azb military operation in North Waziristan (tribal area) in June 2014[54] had uprooted and pushed these terror-franchises into Afghanistan, only to come together under the banner of Daesh.[55]

President Barack Obama had told cadets at West Point in May 2014: ""[T]oday's principal threat no longer comes from a centralized al-Qaeda leadership. Instead, it comes from decentralized al-Qaeda affiliates and extremists, many with agendas focused in countries where they operate.[56]

As highlighted in my abovementioned paper on Islamic extremism, these terror-groups not only seek power and prestige through their acts, but some of them genuinely aspire to fulfil Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) prophesy about the last battle of Islam, the Ghazwa-e-Hind, to be fought in Khorasan - present day Central Asia, Afghanistan and South Asia.[57] Unsurprisingly, Daesh in Afghanistan calls itself Wilayat-e-Khorasan.

Not being an apologist for Taliban, I have always maintained that had the Taliban given some political accommodation in Afghanistan, Daesh could never have established its foothold in the country. Daesh's (anti-Shia and anti-minorities)[58] sectarian overtone had alarmed the Taliban right from the beginning.[59] As Taliban's foot-soldiers began to break ranks to join Daesh, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, then Taliban's deputy chief, had warned al-Baghdadi through a letter on 16 June 2015 to stay out of Afghanistan.[60]

However, Alice Wells, the U.S. special envoy doesn't seem to concur with Taliban's anti-Daesh hypothesis. During a discussion at the U.S. Institute for Peace she rejected the notion by saying: The U.S. was ""disturbed by some countries justification of the Taliban as a fighting force against the Islamic State - Khorasan. I think we see a tendency to exaggerate the IS-Khorasan threat as a pretext to almost justify a hedging behaviour.""[61]

Former President Hamid Karzai has, however, raised serious questions about the rise of Daesh and extremism in Afghanistan, blaming the U.S. for using Daesh as its ""tool.""[62] In a surprise move, Washington further blocked a Pakistani request at the UN Security Council's sanctions committee to declare Daesh-linked Jamaat-ul-Ahrar's head, Abdul Wali (alias Umer Khalid Khurasani) a globally designated terrorist in May 2018.[63]

Worried about Daesh's spillover in its backyard, the Central Asian Republics, Russia also keeps warning about the northern Afghanistan becoming a ""resting base"" of international terrorism and a ""bridgehead"" for establishing its ""destructive"" caliphate in the region.""[64] Russian envoy to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, told the Security Council in June 2018 that ""[Daesh] has up to 10,000 fighters in its ranks, and is already active in at least nine out of [Afghanistan's] 34 provinces ... constantly consolidating its position in the north of the country, turning it into a springboard for the expansion into Central Asia.""

In fact, in its naivety and indecent haste to crush the Taliban militarily, Washington largely ignored the threat of Daesh spreading its tentacles in Afghanistan and becoming a global threat since 2014. United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has totaled-up a record number of 1,692 fatalities in the first six months of 2018, attributing 52 percent of civilian casualties in Afghanistan to Daesh's suicide and complex attacks.[65]

However, fortunately, the regional countries like Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan have woken-up to the threat of Daesh to their internal and regional stability.[66] The extraordinary secret meeting of heads of the intelligence agencies of the four countries in Pakistan on 11 July 2018 demonstrated their collective resolve to eliminate Daesh in Afghanistan.[67] The huddle took place as a follow-up of an earlier meeting between Pakistan's national security adviser, Lt. Gen (Ret'd) Nasser Janjua, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Rear Admiral Shamkhani and secretary of the Security Council of Russian Federation, Nikolai Platonovich Patrushev in Russia in April 2018.[68]

Afghanistan's Internal Squabbling

Three elements remain fundamental for any insurgency to sustain and find its justification: 1) A grassroots support among the people; 2) Alienation of masses towards the sitting government, and, 3) Foreign/outside support. Therefore, even if we cross-out the alleged support of Pakistan, Iran and Russia to the Taliban, there has been abundant proof of disillusionment among Afghan people towards their 'constitutionally-incongruous' - and corrupt to boot - Afghan 'national unity government.'[69]

Lauding Taliban's code of conduct - La'iha - Shadi Hamid, Vanda Felbab-Brown and Harold Trinkunas find in their book Militants, Criminals, and Warlords: The Challenge of Local Governance in an Age of Disorder, that ""conflicts over land and water and tribal feuds have escalated after the end of the Taliban regime as a result of weak and institutional rule and power usurpation. The post-Taliban formal courts have not been able to stop or resolve such conflicts. Worse, the courts became corrupt and themselves a tool of land expropriation."" The authors keep noting: ""The Taliban has moved to fill the gap by providing free mediation of tribal, criminal, and personal disputes. Afghans report a great degree of satisfaction with Taliban verdicts, unlike those of the official justice system, where petitioners often have to pay considerable bribes.""[70]

Despite President Ghani's peace overtures, an intra-Afghan dialogue under his government remains an impossible proposition. Calling the Afghan officials as foreign ""puppets,"" Taliban's spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has already rejected the High Peace Council's talks offer.[71] The reason behind Taliban's reluctance to join mainstream politics and accept the constitution is its undemocratic credentials. Despite Taliban's grassroots support base in the rural areas, the militia knows full well it has no chance of winning at the ballot in the cities. Thus, until the Afghan Loya Jirga figures out an alternate arrangement for Taliban's political representation and power, Afghanistan will stay in turmoil.

Another hindrance is factionalization among the insurgent groups. With too many tongues, you don't know whom to speak, or how many to please. Though the small splinter group led by Mullah Mohammad Rasool backs peace talks, the Fidai Mahaz led by Mullah Najeebullah keeps rejecting a dialogue. Even Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, the head of Taliban's mainstream group stays in two minds under pressure from younger fighters who keep consolidating their hold over new districts every day.[72]

Furthermore, in his vain effort to establish Kabul's central control and to cleanse the Afghan democratic system and improve governance, Mr. Ghani, of late, has been sidelining powerful Afghan warlords accused of human rights abuses and narcotics trade. However, demonstrating lack of political acumen and proper familiarity with Afghanistan's history and culture, a technocrat president has exacerbated ethnic fault-lines.

First of all, having denied his Uzbek vice-president, General Abdul Rasheed Dostum to return to Afghanistan from his self-exile in Turkey for 14 months - after allegations surfaced of Dostum torturing his political opponent[73] - Ghani had antagonized the powerful Junbish-i-Milli (political party) and almost four million Uzbek voters in the northern Afghanistan. Despite Sarwar Danish, the second vice president, negotiating Dostum's return on 22 July 2018, the political fate of the warlord of yesteryears harbouring presidential ambitions, who, Mr. Ghani had branded a ""remorseless killer"" in 2009, is still not clear.[74]

Ghani further stoked ethno-nationalism by impulsively sacking his non-Pashtun governors and other senior officials:

First, as the president dismissed the governor of the Balkh province, Atta Mohammad Noor, in December 2017, the so-called ""King of the north"" eyeing to be the next Afghan president, refused to oblige. Despite handing over the province to an ally in March 2018, Noor's insubordination demonstrated limits to Ghani's powers.[75]

Secondly, kicking up a constitutional crisis, a second provincial governor, Abdulkarim Khaddam of the northern Samangan province also defied a whimsical president by refusing to step down in February 2018.[76]

Third, a competent administrator and a person of high repute, Governor Mohammad Gulab Mangal, was also sent packing on corruption charges and security deterioration in the Nangarhar province in May 2018.[77]

Fourth, sparking violent protests Ghani's Shaheen 209 Corps further arrested Nezamuddin Qaisari, a powerful militia commander and district police chief of the Faryab province on flimsy grounds.[78]

Finally, the president unsuccessfully tried to remove the popular and influential police chief of Kandahar, a so-called general named Abdul Raziq Achakzai, only to be retorted back: Ghani's government ""cannot fire me."" Condemned by the Human Rights Watch as ""Kandahar's torture-in-chief""[79] and a notorious drug smuggler, Raziq had been an unknown foot-soldier trained by the U.S. contractors only to rise as a local hero against Taliban.[80]

Among many of Afghanistan's misfortunes the Ghani-Abdullah national unity government will find prominence in history chronicles. Such an anomaly did not allow necessary checks and balances to be instituted, making the governance fail on all accounts. Under lack of proper oversight of US$10 billion by 34 donor nations and agencies, SIGAR's head, John Sopko, found Afghanistan flooded with more money than it could absorb, exacerbating corruption and fuelling a drawn-out conflict.[81]

Conclusion

As the Afghan war soon enters its 18 year, U.S. must be reckoning how laborious it is to fight someone else's war with alien culture, history and geography. In the fog of insurgencies and civil-wars the collateral damage cannot be avoided. Yet it brings a bad name to the liberators when immense international pressure comes for mistaken-identity attacks. While SIGAR's May 2018's report highlighted U.S. forces dropping 1,186 munitions in Afghanistan between January and March 2018, it also cited UNAMA's collected figures of 2017 attributing 6,768 civilian casualties (2,303 deaths) to anti-government forces and 2,108 civilian casualties (745 deaths) to pro-government forces.[82]

The shrinking of Afghan security forces by nearly 11 percent is another indicator of loss of people's faith in a futile war.[83] The loss of numerical strength of the Afghan National Defence and Security forces (ANDSF) and the territory held by them had panicked the Pentagon to the extent that the department of defence classified the public data, instructing SIGAR not to release the information.[84] Left with no choice, SIGAR complained to the U.S. Congress on 30 April 2018 about receiving inaccurate data from the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.[85]

In my last paper on Afghanistan (mentioned above), I had concluded that probably it is America's long-term strategic interests that do not allow it to take leave from the region. However, the time for the U.S. forces to depart Afghanistan has arrived, letting the regional countries to tackle - and eliminate - Daesh. China seems to be seeking a military base at Wakhan border in Afghanistan for the same purpose.[86]

Notwithstanding, U.S. secretary of state, Mike Pompeo describing American footprint in Afghanistan as a ""humble mission"" with objective to leave after ""greatly diminishing the threat to [U.S.] homeland that may emanate from there,"" Senator Rand Paul, argued at the secretary's congressional confirmation hearing that now was the time to leave as ""all those terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan"" who had participated in the 9/11 attacks, had been eliminated and some of the soldiers fighting there were not even born when 9/11 happened.[87]

The scenes of conviviality and affection seen during the last ceasefire between the Taliban fighters and government security officials show a kind of war-fatigue on both sides. While the Afghan government remains adamant not to budge for power sharing, the ordinary Afghans are fed up with the prolonged conflict - as demonstrated through the 700km long march by dozens of peace protesters from Helmand to Kabul chanting slogans such as ""We want peace"" and ""stop fighting"" during the fasting month of Ramadan (June 2018).[88]

Despite more than 100 Muslim scholars from around the world pleading ""mutual understanding and direct peaceful negotiations"" among ""Muslim Afghan[s]"" at the Saudi city of Mecca on 11 July 2018, the 'Islamic diplomacy' is unlikely to convince the Afghan government or the insurgents.[89] On 7 March 1993, Saudi King Fahd had also sponsored a peace accord between the warring Afghan Mujahedeen leaders, who all swore at the Holy Ka'ba to end their fighting, only to break their vow upon returning to Afghanistan. Similarly, the Trilateral Ulema Conference, a conclave of Islamic scholars from Indonesia, Afghanistan and Pakistan, denouncing violent extremism, terrorism, and suicide attacks as against the Islamic principles on 11 May 2018 may also fail to pacify the historic vengeance in Afghan blood.[90]

The killing of 15 Taliban fighters by Daesh rivals means intensified fighting among the militant groups in the coming days.[91] Considering Daesh a major threat to global security, effort should be made to reconcile with the Taliban at priority - who have publicly pledged not to house al-Qaeda again or pursue any global agenda - and eradicate the menace of terrorism and Islamic extremism once and for all from the region.

With elections for Wolsei Jirga (lower house) - oft postponed since 2015 - scheduled for 20 October 2018 and a new presidential election next year, the anomaly of 'national unity government' is going to be thankfully over.[92] However, the elections are not panacea of Afghanistan's peace and stability until the country's political fundamentals are first corrected.

The problem is that historically the 'differences' among various Afghan ethnicities have been treated as 'disputes' - not resolved through 'discussions.' While worries abound about Afghanistan descending into another ethnic conflict or a civil-war after the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces, the security ownership taken by the regional countries should be satisfying. The collective resolve shown by Russia, China, Pakistan, Turkey and Iran means Daesh will not be allowed to fester further or spillover into those countries. Period.

However, it is the Afghans who have to sort out their internal issues themselves. At another place in her book Farewell Kabul, Christina Lamb quotes an elderly Afghan observing pensively, ""War never leaves this land.""[93] However, it is time the Afghans bring an end to the four-decade long conflict and open a new chapter towards mutual understanding and harmony, progress and prosperity. For once, Afghans must prove Alexander Cockburn wrong for reinforcing the myth that Afghanistan is ""nothing but mountains filled with barbarous ethnics with views as medieval as their muskets.""

It was for such redefining moments in the history of nations that T.S. Eliot had said: ""What we call the beginning is often the end. And to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from.""

He has been in custody since 2012.

A top court in Pakistan had given the federal government one month to complete all formalities required to deport Ansari, after he completes his 3-year jail term in the country, on Saturday, 15 December.

It's been six years since Mumbai resident, Ansari, was caught with a fake Pakistani ID in his pocket in Kohat, a town near Peshawar. He had travelled to Kohat, Peshawar ""illegally"" in order to find and rescue the woman he loved, from being forcefully married to someone else. On being caught, a military court in Pakistan had found him guilty of espionage and convicted him for allegedly being an Indian spy.

A day ahead of his three-year jail term completion, Ansari's lawyer, Qazi Muhammad Anwar, informed the bench that despite it being the end of his term, the Ministry of Interior and prison authorities had been completely silent about his release and deportation to India, PTI reported.

Speaking to The Quint, Fauzia Ansari, Hamid's mother, expressed her helplessness in the situation.

We've tried everything we could, now we are waiting for the one month (designated to completing the paperwork for his deportation to India) is completed and he can come home.Fauzia Ansari, Hamid Nehal Ansari's Mother

As the Ansari family waits for their prodigal son to return home after six long years, here's a look back at his story of a cross-border love that led him to a Pakistan jail.

From Versova to Peshawar

Ansari was 27 when he left home for Kohat in Pakistan. With a degree in engineering and an MBA, Ansari was reportedly working as a management teacher for the education of Afghan Students when he was caught and taken away by the Pakistani authorities in 2012, according to Fauzia in a Facebook post.

Ansari lived with his parents- Fauzia and Nehal- in a rented apartment in Versova in Mumbai. Fauzia is a teacher at a school in Mumbai, and Nehal is a banker.

In an earlier interaction with The Quint, Fauzia had said that Hamid had left for Kabul on 4 November, 2012, on the pretext of having received a job as an airport manager in Afghanistan. Although his parents had advised him against the move, fearing for his safety, he had not relented.

He was in constant contact with his parents everyday for the next few days, until 10 November. He told them that he would return back to Mumbai in two days. But right after this, Ansari went missing, which we now know, is because he had been picked up by Pakistani authorities.

But what was the real reason behind Ansari's decision to visit Kabul? In an investigative piece by Scroll, Ansari's parents said that after he had gone missing, they logged in to his Facebook account and checked his emails. They found out that he had been talking to a Pakistani woman for two years, and seemed to be in love with her.

But the woman's sister had reportedly gone and ratted out Ansari's affair to her parents.

What Made Ansari Illegally Cross the Border?

The woman's father announced that she would immediately be married to someone else in Pakistan, and the woman, now desperate, allegedly asked Ansari to come and rescue her from her fate.

I found several of Hamid's conversations on Facebook after he went missing. The girl was desperate; she wanted to be rescued, and I could see that that the desperation had built in Hamid too. (sic)Fauzia Ansari, in conversation with The Quint

Ansari began to plan. He wasn't able to contact the woman he loved, so he managed to track down another woman in Kohat. Ansari asked her to find out what was happening with the woman. But she couldn't.

He also reportedly wrote several letters to the Pakistan High Commission and even requested Mumbai-based activist Jatin Desai of the Pakistan-India People's Forum for Peace and Democracy, for his help. Neither option worked.

He was then advised by friends he had made online to travel to Kabul, and then infiltrate into Pakistan. He was informed that the Pakistan-Afghanistan border did not have any serious checking and his friends told him that they would help him with a fake Pakistani ID.

Who Caught Hamid Ansari?

Ansari had reportedly managed to sneak into Kohat, according to reports of the incident in Scroll.in. Later it was found that on the day Ansari had gone missing, he had checked into a hotel in Kohat under a fake name and had been arrested by the police within an hour of his check-in. This information was unearthed by a Pakistan-based journalist named Zeenat, who had reached out to Fauzia for information on Ansari

Zeenat later found out that Ansari was then placed in the custody of the Pakistani military and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), who had accused him of being an ""Indian Spy"" and locked him up, Fauzia had told The Quint.

When Ansari's parents learnt of his arrest, fourteen months after it took place, they moved pillar to post to seek legal help and finally crossed paths with Qazi Muhammad Anwar, a renowned lawyer in Pakistan. Anwar helped file their habeas corpus petition, in the Peshawar high court.

Anwar had also said that the Lahore High Court had been informed that Ansari faced a court-martial on unspecified charges. The battle in the court has been ongoing since.

We're Helpless at This Point: Fauzia Ansari

Speaking to The Quint, a day ahead of the official end of Ansari's jail-term, Fauzia said that her family had hoped that the Pakistan court wouldn't agree to the one-month extension of Ansari's detention in jail, as recommended by the Interior Ministry of Pakistan.

""But, we're helpless at this point...all the communication is happening through our lawyer and I know that this (one-month extension) was also questioned, but they (the court) are saying they are following procedures.""Fauzia Ansari to The Quint

Speaking about how she has not seen her son since he first left Mumbai to travel to Kabul, Fauzia said that she had tried extremely hard for the first few years to secure a Pakistan visa, so she could meet him.

However, she realised that this wasn't a possibility, and instead, focused all her energies on communicating with the necessary court of law. Fauzia also said that the Ministry of External Affairs had done a lot of work on the case, on the behalf of their family.

""Our government has asked the Pakistan government, at least 95 different times for consular access (to Ansari).""Fauzia Ansari to The Quint

In November, 2017, Minister of External Affairs, Sushma Swaraj had said that the MEA had made 52 requests to Pakistan for consular access to Ansari.

Looking forward, Fauzia is hopeful of seeing her son again soon. She says,

Last month we were in Delhi, and we met with several MEO officials, who have assured us that as soon as the paperwork for his deportation is drawn up from Pakistan government, there won't be any delay from the Ministry's side to get him back home.

Louisiana law already prohibits the hiring and retention of a person convicted of, or who has pleaded no contest to, a crime which falls within La. R.S. 15:587.1(C) which, in turn, covers various crimes including, but not necessarily limited to, first degree murder, second degree murder, manslaughter, various sex crimes, kidnapping, criminal neglect of family, contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile, cruelty to juveniles, and child desertion. The sex crimes include, but are not limited to, rape, female genital mutilation, prostitution, pandering, carnal knowledge, ""crime against nature,"" voyeurism, and obscenity.

Act 634 adds to existing law to prohibit hiring any person as a teacher who submits fraudulent documentation to the Louisiana Department of Education or Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) as part of an application for a teaching certificate or other teaching authorization, even if that individual neither was convicted of nor entered a no contest plea for a crime listed under La. R.S.15:587.1(C). Act 634 also adds a prohibition on hiring a teacher who has been found to have facilitated cheating on any state assessment. A school board or non-public school, however, may hire a teacher who has been found to have submitted fraudulent documentation or facilitated cheating if the BESE approves a formal appeal request.

Act 634 also adds to existing law by allowing BESE to assess a civil fine against a school governing authority that knowingly employs a teacher in violation of either the pre-existing law or Act 634. Act 634 sets the civil fine at an amount equal to the average state yearly compensation for a public school teacher, inclusive of salary and benefits.

Act 634 became effective on July 1, 2018.

SB 209: This state senate bill would provide additional protections to workers facing massive layoffs. The legislature has not passed the bill.

SB 209, the ""Louisiana Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act"" or the ""Louisiana WARN Act,"" would require ""large corporations"" to warn employees of impending ""mass layoffs.""

The Louisiana WARN Act would not supersede the federal WARN Act of 1988, which applies to employers who employ 100 or more employees. The Louisiana WARN Act would apply to companies who employ between 50 and 99 employees.

The Louisiana WARN Act defines ""mass layoffs"" as the closure of a workplace (or portion thereof), modernization of a workplace (or portion thereof), relocation of a workplace (of portion thereof), or implementation or any management policy, in which the employer permanently reduces the number of employees by 50 or more during any 90-day period.

SB 209 would require the employer to refrain from a mass layoff until 60 days after the employer serves written notice of the layoff to each of the following: affected employees, the executive director of the Louisiana Workforce Commission (LWC), members of the state Senate who represent the parish (i.e. county) in which the workplace is located, members of the state House of Representatives who represent the parish in which the workplace is located, and the president of the parish-governing authority.

SB 209 would provide for limited exceptions to the 60-day notice period, such as mass layoffs due to natural disasters (such as a flood), disputes between labor unions and employers, layoffs at a construction site or other temporary workplace, layoffs that are the result of seasonal factors, layoffs which occur as a result of the completion of a particular project or undertaking where the affected employees were hired with the understanding that their employment was limited to the duration of the project or undertaking, or business circumstances not reasonably foreseeable at the time SB 209 would have required notice.

An employer violating the Louisiana WARN Act would face liability for lost wages and health benefits, as well as reasonable attorney's fees and costs, but SB 209 limits damages to a maximum of 60 days.

SB 209 is still in the Senate.

HB 126: The FLSA already requires that an employer shall compensate a tipped employee at a rate of $2.13 per hour, and if the employee fails to earn sufficient tips to bring his or her hourly earnings to the federal minimum wage rate, the employer shall pay the difference to ensure that the employee earns at least the federal minimum wage. HB 126 would create a state minimum wage rate for tipped employees and set it at the rate set by the FLSA. HB 126 would define a tipped employee as an employee who regularly earns at least $30 per month in tips.

HB 126 is still pending in the House Committee on Labor and Industrial Relations.

HB 605: Louisiana requires that women employed as public employees be entitled to the same compensation as men employed as public employees. HB 605 would extend the equal pay requirement to all persons employed in the state of Louisiana. HB 605 would also allow an aggrieved person to file suit in any district court of competent jurisdiction. Currently, since the state equal pay protection law applies only to state employees, an aggrieved employee must file suit in the Baton Rouge-based 19th Judicial District Court. An aggrieved individual must first file a complaint with the Louisiana Human Rights Commission.

In April 2018, the Louisiana House Labor & Industrial Relations Committee members voted 7-4 to involuntarily defer HB 605. An involuntarily deferred instrument may be rescheduled for a committee hearing only by motion adopted by the vote of two-thirds of the committee members present and voting. The author of HB605 vowed to continue to bring similar bills to address pay disparities between men and women.

HB 790: Currently, Louisiana law only provides for workers' compensation benefits for hearing loss when the loss is sustained in a single traumatic accident. HB 790 would delete the requirement that any hearing loss suffered must have been the result of a single traumatic accident in order to recover workers' compensation benefits.

HB 790 is still pending."

Jirga to negotiate with miscreants who torched schools in Diamer

The Gilgit Baltistan government has tasked a 30-member jirga, a tribal council sorts, to negotiate with those who set fire to more than a dozen schools in the province's Diamer district, half of which were for girls, in August this year, reported Dawn.

Faizullah Faraq, spokesperson for the Gilgit Baltistan government, said Sunday that the jirga was working with the aim to get the militants to surrender. He added that the jirga has been given the directive to hold these talks which are being organised high up in the mountains where families of the militants also live with them.

The spokesperson remarked that the government does not want to use force on these miscreants as their wives and children are also living with them.

An initial report on the incident gave suggestions that the work was of some foreigners and few local facilitators who first vandalised the school buildings and then burnt them down.

Around 40 people suspected of planning the attacks have been arrested so far while search for 15 are underway.

Online petition demands ban be lifted on Nandita Das's Manto in Pakistan

An online petition started by Pakistani journalist Saeed Ahmed has been launched on change.org to urge the country's Prime Minister Imran Khan to lift the ban on the release of the film Manto, directed by Nandita Das, in Pakistan, reported Dawn.

The film stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Saadat Hasan Manto, a prolific yet controversial Urdu writer, and focuses on some of his most tumultuous phases of his life, especially after Partition.

""The audiences and critics worldwide have appreciated the film. However, it is a matter of huge concern that the Pakistan Censor Board has recently decided to debar the film,"" the online petition reads. ""The disappointing decision to ban the film has created a hue and cry among writers, poets, and intellectuals in the literary circles of Pakistan... It is therefore, appealed that the ban is dismissed with immediate effect.""

The plea also questioned if Manto would face the same fate of torture and court trials in 'Naya Pakistan' as he had to undergo during 'Purana Pakistan'.

The petition has been signed by high-profile personalities and public figures including Manto's daughters Nighat, Nusrat and Nuzhat, human rights advocates I.A. Rehman and Hussain Naqi, artist Salima Hashmi, Urdu writer Mirza Hamid Baig and journalist Saleem Asmi.

Nandita Das on Twitter thanked people for launching this initiative and demanding the release of the film in Pakistan.

The fencing of the 2,611-km long Pakistan-Afghanistan border is set to be completed by next December, Pakistan army spokesperson Asif Ghafoor said Saturday, reported The News International.

Ghafoor on Twitter announced that ""work on forts and fence continues on the Pak-Afghan border"" as 233 of the 843 forts and fencing of 802 out of 1,200 km priority one areas has been completed.

He also said that this will benefit ""people of Pakistan and Afghanistan while restricting terrorists"".

Pak Army releases song to honour Peshawar school attack victims

The Pakistan army's media spokesperson, Major General Asif Ghafoor, released on Twitter a four-minute song, Hamey agay hee jana hai (we have to move forward), as a tribute to those who lost their lives in the terror attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar four years ago, reported Geo TV.

According to a report in Dawn, nine militants massacred over 131 schoolchildren and 10 others during the attack on 16 December, 2014. It remains the deadliest attack in Pakistan's history.

The incident gave rise to a number of national policies, including a National Action Plan to curb terrorism and militancy in the country and setting up of military courts so that terrorists could be tried.

""We are a resilient nation, our enemies shall never succeed...We are succeeding, united and steadfast and we shall attain our objectives of enduring peace and prosperity,"" Ghafoor tweeted Sunday.

A wreath-laying ceremony was organised Sunday in Peshawar to commemorate the martyrs in the attack. A contingent of the Pakistan army presented the guard of honour and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province's governor Shah Farman laid a floral wreath at the martyrs' monument in the city's Warsak Road. Several people remembered the tragic incident, including Imran Khan."

The favourable signals were there from the party's earlier by-election victories in the two states. But despite the Congress's latest success, what must be worrying for the party is that it missed losing by a hair's breadth, given how close the voting percentages were for the two contenders - 39.3 per cent for the Congress in Rajasthan against 38.8 for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and 40.9 per cent in Madhya Pradesh for the Congress against the BJP's 41.

What this means for the Congress is that it doesn't have a moment to lose to show that it can provide better governance than its predecessor. There is no time for the party to bask in the glory of having risen like a Phoenix from the ashes of the 2014 drubbing. It has to hit the ground running, as the phrase goes.

It will not do for the Congress to bank only on populist measure like loan waivers for farmers which are frowned upon by economists as sops which ultimately help neither the farmers nor the agricultural economy. The loan waivers are in line with Sonia Gandhi's favourite rural employment scheme of the Manmohan Singh government which was of no help to the party in 2014.

Nor will the pursuit of a ""soft"" Hindutva line to project the Congress as a BJP minus the gau rakshaks be of any help. Instead, the party will have to take definitive steps to demonstrate that it means business in dealing with agrarian distress and unemployment - the two main factors which brought about the BJP's downfall.

Neither of the two steps will be easy for a state government, especially when there is an unfriendly regime at the centre, waiting to see how it fumbles. But an emphasis on irrigation and on groundwater and surface water management can underline the state government's serious intent.

An expansion of the formal credit facilities can also reduce the dependence of the farmers on rapacious money-lenders, as can efforts to ensure that the routine subsidies are not misappropriated by the richer farmers.

Similarly, joblessness can be partly alleviated by helping in the growth of small and medium businesses in states which haven't yet been able to shed the damaging BIMARU tag of being ""sick"" where the social and economic indicators are concerned.

But, in addition to such initiatives which are within the capabilities of the state governments, it is time that the Congress at the national level outlines its broad economic vision, which has been hazy so far as was evident from Rahul Gandhi's reluctance to specify what he means when he talks of supporting farmers, creating jobs and extending health care, as he did at the London School of Economics last summer.

The Congress and its president will have to realise that such generalities no longer pay political dividends. The voters, especially the youth, are interested in specifics, including the spelling out of targets.

Since the problem with the Congress is that it has been unable to make up its mind between populist and pro-market policies, it appears to be suspended in midair where economics is concerned with no one knowing what to expect from a Congress government - a return to Manmohan Singh's economic reforms or to Sonia Gandhi's focus on freebees.

So far, the Congress governments in Punjab and Karnataka have been run-of-the-mill ones with little to show them as result-oriented, especially in the matter of bolstering the economy.

But, now that three more states have come under the party's aegis, there has to be greater focus in its policies instead of a recourse to homilies.

For Rahul Gandhi, the unambiguous projection of an economic direction in the run-up to the next general election will be a bigger test than containing the Congress' age-old malady of internal factionalism dating to the Tilak-Gokhale split of 1907.

If Narendra Modi is perceived to be faltering, it is because he tried to tackle the country's economic ills with patchwork repairs like opening myriad bank accounts, providing direct cash transfers for cooking gas cylinders, extending rural electrification and undertaking faster highway construction. But he failed in carrying out what are called ""big bang"" reforms to rejuvenate the economy, which was the expectation behind his 2014 success.

If Rahul Gandhi, too, is found to be following in the BJP's footsteps not only in pursuing ""soft"" Hindutva, but also in the economic field, the unforgiving people of India, who are increasingly becoming impatient for quick results, will have no hesitation in dumping the Congress.

The Congress president's problem is that he will have carry with him his allies in the mahagathbandhan - if and when the grand alliance is formed - and so he cannot make unilateral announcements on key issues.

But he must remember that the eagerness with which many of them court foreign investors shows that the earlier aversion of the average politician to capitalism is dying out.

Rahul Gandhi will have to state whether he shares their views or still considers himself to be a foot soldier of the Niyamgiri tribals of Odisha who ensured the eviction of investors from their sacred hills.

Illustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com

India must have vernacular public intellectuals who can and should 'grasp the popular as the most efficacious language and mode of resistance,' said Grant Farred, adding, 'Vernacularity signals the discursive turning away from the accepted, dominant intellectual modality and vocabulary and the adoption of a new positioning and idiomatic language'.

In recent decades, majoritarian right wing reaction emerging across many countries has partly to do with the communalisation of vernacular spaces. Jenny White's Islamist Mobilization in Turkey (2002) demonstrated the majoritarian shift of Turkey through vernacular spaces during the 1980-1990, paving the way for Recep Taiyip Erdogan's rise to power.

About Uttar Pradesh in India, Zoya Hasan's Quest for Power (1997) demonstrated how certain Hindi dailies peddled majoritarianism in the late 1980s.

What about the case of Urdu language? Well, faced with multiple problems, most Urdu news periodicals are preoccupied rather with theology, inṭra-Muslim sub-sectarian debates, and creative literature-literary criticism.

This makes it important for us to know about Professor Riazur Rahman Sherwani of Aligaṛh, an academic who, in his late 90s, has been constantly writing in Urdu newspapers since 1949.

Not many Urdu intellectuals could possibly be as frank and harsh against Muslim conservatism and communalism in independent India as Professor Sherwani (born 1924). He is an intellectual whose recognition as one has been woefully inadequate despite the acknowledgement of his scholarship and teaching among the Urdu intelligentsia.

Most of his writings, including his autobiography (Dhoop Chhaon) and a compilation of his columns/rejoinders and essays, published in various Urdu news periodicals during 1949-2015 (Masael o Mabahis), have come out this year.

His relentless interventions on almost every issue concerning India and Indians underscore the necessity and relevance of his ideas in our woeful times.

In his autobiography, Professor Sherwani has chosen to speak only about his student days, spanning 1941-1949, besides an introductory chapter on his aristocratic Afghan ancestry.

His palatial house in Aligaṛh offered hospitality to stalwarts such as Gandhiji, Nehru, Jinnah, Azad, Rafi Kidwai, Liaqat Ali Khan, etc.

Maulana Azad's 'letters' from Ahmednagar prison (compiled as Ghubar-e-Khatir) are addressed to Habibur Rahman Khan Sherwani (1867-1950), Procfessor Riazur Rahman's grandfather.

A frank narrative of these eight formative years of his life testify to the evolution of his worldview informed by wide studies and deep insights and observations about the events happening close around him, mostly political.

By his own admission, he has always been taking a keen interest in politics, though without formally joining any party. It has been amply clear to him, he underlines, that there is absolutely no conflict between religion (mazhab) and nation (watan), only if both the categories have well-defined boundary limits.

The universal and spiritual content of religion, he insists, equips politics with ethics. According to him, this is what secularism is, and that freedom is the birthright of every human.

Both these considerations make him arrive at a conclusion that inter-faith harmony -- Muttahidah Qaumiyat (united or composite nationalism) -- is a sine qua non for pluralistic nations to march forward.

He has a keen memory of the details of India's Partition to which he was vehemently opposed. He justifies the creation of Bangladesh and believes that Kashmir's better future is linked preferably with India, even though, he adds, India has not been fair and judicious with Kashmiris.

His publications against communal hatred and for the secular democracy of India abhor the homogeneity espoused by reactionaries of all hues.

His columns articulating the problems of India's Muslims display a strong optimism that India's secular democracy offers enough scope to ameliorate all these problems. He is as sharp against majoritarian communalism as against minority communalism.

His column (December 1973) criticising the Congress and Communists for aligning with the Muslim League in Kerala in the early decades of Independence is a sharp and brave one.

The collection of his columns deserves to be rendered into English, Nagri, and other Indian vernacular languages.

He hates the personality cult even while being deeply impressed by Gandhiji, Nehru, Maulana Azad, Jayaprakash Narayaṇ, and many more. His pen, however, spares none, the only exception being Gandhiji and Azad, in whom he hardly sees any fault.

His harshest criticism is reserved for Jinnah and Maulana Maududi (1903-1979). His earliest columns considered these two as the biggest of villains, and unambiguously assert that a lot of problems faced by Muslims of the subcontinent are because of Jinnah's communal separatism and Maududi's ideology of a theocratic State.

He frankly admits that till 1937 he had a little soft corner for the League even though he had doubts about its class base and ideological positions, particularly its lack of anti-colonial stance.

In 1939, when the League observed the Day of Deliverance following the resignation of Congress ministries in the provinces, his doubts about the League were confirmed and ever since he remained vehemently opposed to it.

As a student activist, he confronted the League sympathisers at AMU, who included his father who was also serving in a higher position in the university.

His understanding about the causes of Partition is: Jinnah and the League who asked for it were primarily responsible for the vivisection.

British imperialists played their own roles though the majoritarianism of the Hindu Mahasabha-RSS as also such tendencies within the lower ranks of the Congress, was no less significant a factor.

Sherwani records in his autobiography that at the AMU High School (Minto Circle), Syed Mohammed Tonki taught him history and it was he who nurtured anti-colonialism and patriotism in him through history classes. Tonki was emphatic about Hindu-Muslim unity to fight British colonialism.

Tonki's extraordinary and unforgettable mentoring of students, in drama and cricket, has been acknowledged by distinguished alumni such as the late actor Saeed Jaffery (1929-2015) in his memoirs, and by the late historian Mushirul Hasan as well in one of his columns in the Agra supplement of The Times of India.

Ironically, such a fierce opponent of India's Partition as Sherwani was pushed into Pakistan after Independence. This is very poignantly described as part of his life story.

In August 1947, while doing his MA at AMU, he was at Kasauli in a sanatorium for the treatment of his ailing sister.

When Partition occurred, he, his mother, younger brother, and the terminally ill sister, were forced out of the Kasauli sanatorium to Kalka, from where they were pushed into a Lahore-bound train. The fear and anxiety that enveloped the train is described more powerfully by Intizar Husain (1923-2016) in his memoir Chiraghon Ka Dhuan: Yadon ke Pachaas Baras (1999).

In Lahore, Sherwani's sister eventually died. While stuck in Lahore for several months, he completed his MA (Arabic) from the Oriental College, Lahore.

He then managed to come back to India after a lot of difficulty.

Sherwani minces no words in revealing that the theology classes at AMU didn't ever add to his knowledge.

On the Hindu Code Bill, his column (in 1955) was quite forthright; that the Indian State must interfere to legislate on all personal laws.

He, however, opposed the Uniform Civil Code. Instead, he suggested that the Indian government should ask each community to form select committees and their proposals for reforms should then be debated in Parliament for legislation.

He castigated Muslim conservatives on this count who altogether denied any State intervention to reform personal laws.

In May 1985, when Muslim conservatives and gender reactionaries stood up against Shah Bano going to the Supreme Court, he subjected them to scathing criticism. He condemned them for neither reforming the Shariat nor letting the hapless lady get justice from the judiciary.

Being an Arabic scholar, he argues that even the Quran does provide for maintenance to the divorced, helpless, old lady.

He also argued that even Islam in its spirit is actually against polygamy as it is against slavery. He always favoured a rational interpretation of the Quran informed by social realities.

He is extensively well read in English literature and particularly impressed with Matthew Arnold's Culture and Anarchy.

Surprisingly, this collection (Masael o Mabahis) of his newspaper interventions, doesn't include his views on:

The imposition of Emergency in 1975 (whereas, he has good words for Jayaprakash Narayaṇ and his role in the Quit India Movement); On parliamentary legislation against the Supreme Court verdict for Shah Bano in 1986 (though, as said earlier, he did write against Muslim conservatives when her case went to the Supreme Court in 1985); and Almost nothing on caste among India's Muslims. These three omissions are striking. Or, maybe, his columns on these subjects could not be retrieved for publication in Masael o Mabahis.

In his polite but unambiguous words, he complains against the majoritarian prejudices of Purushottam Das Tandon (1882-1962), Sampurṇanand (1891-1969), and those Muslims who had once wished to join the Bhartiya Jan Sangh.

His articulation is candid, lucid and frank. He argued (in 1966) that there are two kinds of forces, one communal (among both Muslims and Hindus) and the other secular.

Negotiation between the two is uncalled for. One has to be clear about one's options.

He, however, keeps adding that the ruling Congress is not the sole monopoliser of secularism in the Indian Republic.

He says that India can be strengthened by all non-communal forces -- the Congress, Socialists, Left forces, in competitive and complementary ways.

He urged Muslims to further the ideologies of any of these forces, and sternly warned against forming any Muslim exclusive political party.

He was particularly associated with two Urdu newspapers in Aligaṛh, Naya Hindustan (launched on August 15, 1948), and Jamhoor (launched on January 26, 1950). These ran roughly up to the late 1950s. Their objective was to wrest the common Muslims out of the clutches of the conservatives and to shun their isolation syndrome.

He contributed his columns, rejoinders, letters to editors, in almost every important Urdu newspaper of Delhi, UP, and in Paṭna, which he subscribed to and has preserved all files in his residence.

His understanding about communal violence was that these were always motivated by the politics of polarisation and that its recurrence had to do with the failure of the criminal justice system. In this regard, at least once, he is unsparing even about Nehru in the case of the Jabalpur riots of 1961.

He has neatly categorised sections for his columns on communalisation of society and polity, and on communal violence.

His columns and travelogues of the early 1950s, castigate the failing state of Pakistan which according to him had its genesis in exclusionary nationalism.

It won't be an exaggeration to argue that his columns are necessary reading for any researcher working on India's Muslims since Independence.

He wrote around 30 obituaries. These include people of all ideological shades: Acharya Narendra Dev (1889-1956; a Gandhian socialist); K G Mashruwala (editor of Gandhiji's weekly Harijan), Syama Prasad Mookerjee (1901-1953; the Hindu Mahasabha leader), Gandhiji, Maulana Azad (Azad's passing was greatest of all tragedies, according to him), Nehru, Rafi Kidwai (1894-1954), Asaf Ali (1888-1953), among others.

Sherwani detested Jinnah's unpalatable words of condolence over Gandhiji's assassination, and he voiced it in Lahore, in the midst of Jinnah's fans. Even in his death, and a tragic one at that, Jinnah had identified Gandhiji as only a Hindu leader.

In Sherwani's list of obituaries, some conspicuous omissions are Ram Manohar Lohia (1910-1967) and the Arabic scholar Ali Miyaṅ Nadvi (1914-1999). They do not seem to have drawn his attention at all.

Despite a versatile intellect and brave interventions on every contentious issue, this intrepid writer has not been identified as a public intellectual even within AMU. This is quite intriguing. Had it anything to do with his personality trait of preferring isolation?

Or is it a reflection on AMU campus society in particular and north Indian Muslim society in general that he has not been raised to the status of a public intellectual?

Why this indifference to Sherwani on the part of the Urdu literati/intelligentsia?

His son Madihur Rahman Sherwani (Suhaib), formerly a teacher of English literature and a CPI whole-timer, seems to suggest that Professor Sherwani is essentially a self-effacing man. Some of his contemporaries and colleagues make similar suggestions about his personality.

Another pressing question that crops up here is: Why have academicians been failing in mentoring and training students who could emerge as progressive interventionists in academic as well as popular (journalistic) domains towards strengthening India's pluralistic traditions of politics and social harmony?

Professor Sherwani, who in his late 90s, has hearing and visual problems, but has not given up on studies and is always surrounded with books.

May he live longer, healthier and happier.

And most important of all, liberal progressive academia must pay attention to writing and mentoring vernacular columnists.

That will ensure greater hopes for a better India.

The nation's oldest and wealthiest college announced that about 26 percent of those admitted by ""early action"" for the class of 2023 are Asian-American, up from 24 percent last year. The year before, it was about 22 percent. Dean of Admissions William Fitzsimmons cited an increase in the number of Asian-American applicants as the likely reason for the steady climb, according to the Harvard Crimson, the school's undergraduate newspaper.

The plaintiff in the lawsuit, which seeks to make Harvard abandon race altogether as a factor in admissions, claims the college engages in a discriminatory game of ""racial balancing,"" and that if the school relied solely on academics, Asian-Americans would make up at least 40 percent of its student body. Asian-Americans account for about 5.6 percent of the U.S. population.

Harvard argues that race is just one factor in its calculus, an approach allowed by the Supreme Court, and that without it the school couldn't provide the educational benefit of a diverse student body, a goal the high court has acknowledged as legitimate. The court is the likely destination for the hotly contested case, currently before U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston.

Among other notable changes reflected in the acceptance emails Harvard sent out Thursday night, African-American students make up 12 percent of the early-action group, down from 14 percent last year; Latin-Americans, 10.1 percent, up slightly from 9.9 percent; international students, 11 percent, up from 8 percent.

Women make up 51 percent of the students, up from 47 percent last year. Nearly 53 percent of those in the group who say they want to concentrate on the physical sciences are women, up sharply from 33 percent last year, Harvard said. For computer science it's 43 percent, up from 29 percent.

The odds of admission were long for everybody, with 6,958 applicants vying for 935 seats. That 13.4 percent acceptance rate was the lowest since Harvard reinstated early action seven years ago, according to the Crimson. For the full class of 2022, Harvard got a record 42,749 applicants and admitted just under 2,000 of them.

The early-action emails went out at 7 p.m., according to Harvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane. Applicants in the regular pool will get their emails in late March."

Hundreds of the company's consultants frolicked in the desert, riding camels over sand dunes and mingling in tents linked by red carpets. Meetings took place in a cavernous banquet hall that resembled a sultan's ornate court, with a sign overhead to capture the mood.

""I can't keep calm, I work at McKinsey & Company,"" it said.

Especially remarkable was the location: Kashgar, the ancient Silk Road city in China's far west that is experiencing a major humanitarian crisis.

About four miles from where the McKinsey consultants discussed their work, which includes advising some of China's most important state-owned companies, a sprawling internment camp had sprung up to hold thousands of ethnic Uighurs -- part of a vast archipelago of indoctrination camps where the Chinese government has locked up as many as one million people.

One week before the McKinsey event, a United Nations committee had denounced the mass detentions and urged China to stop.

But the political backdrop did not appear to bother the McKinsey consultants, who posted pictures on Instagram chronicling their Disney-like adventures. In fact, McKinsey's involvement with the Chinese government goes much deeper than its odd choice to showcase its presence in the country.

For a quarter-century, the company has joined many American corporations in helping stoke China's transition from an economic laggard to the world's second-largest economy. But as China's growth presents a muscular challenge to American dominance, Washington has become increasingly critical of some of Beijing's signature policies, including the ones McKinsey has helped advance.

One of McKinsey's state-owned clients has even helped build China's artificial islands in the South China Sea, a major point of military tension with the United States.

It turns out that McKinsey's role in China is just one example of its extensive -- and sometimes contentious -- work around the world, according to an investigation by The New York Times that included interviews with 40 current and former McKinsey employees, as well as dozens of their clients.

At a time when democracies and their basic values are increasingly under attack, the iconic American company has helped raise the stature of authoritarian and corrupt governments across the globe, sometimes in ways that counter American interests.

Its clients have included Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy, Turkey under the autocratic leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and corruption-plagued governments in countries like South Africa.

In Ukraine, McKinsey and Paul Manafort -- President Trump's campaign chairman, later convicted of financial fraud -- were paid by the same oligarch to help burnish the image of a disgraced presidential candidate, Viktor F. Yanukovych, recasting him as a reformer.

Once in office, Mr. Yanukovych rebuffed the West, sided with Russia and fled the country, accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. The events set off years of chaos in Ukraine and an international standoff with the Kremlin.

Inside Russia itself, McKinsey has worked with Kremlin-linked companies that have been placed under sanctions by Western governments -- companies that the firm helped build up over the years and, in some cases, continues to advise.

It has consulted in many sectors of the Russian economy, including mining, manufacturing, oil and gas, banking, transportation and agriculture. A McKinsey official sat on the Russian government's energy board. Former McKinsey consultants have gone to work in the Russian companies they once advised.

In August, VEB Bank -- which is wholly owned by the Russian state, intertwined with Russian intelligence and under United States sanctions -- hired McKinsey to develop its business strategy.

There is no indication that McKinsey has violated American sanctions, which prohibit only certain transactions with targeted companies and individuals. But the larger question is whether the company, in pursuing legitimate business opportunities abroad, is helping to shore up President Vladimir V. Putin's autocratic leadership.

Other consulting companies serve similar clients, but none have the stature to confer credibility quite like McKinsey, a confidant for 92 years to many of the world's most admired companies.

In China, it has advised at least 22 of the 100 biggest state-owned companies -- the ones carrying out some of the government's most strategic and divisive initiatives, according to a review of Chinese-language material by The Times.

While it is not unusual for American corporations to work with China's state-owned companies, McKinsey's role has sometimes put it in the middle of deeply troubled deals. In Malaysia, the company laid out the case for one of Asia's most corrupt leaders to pursue billions of dollars from China at a time when he was suspected of funneling vast sums of public money into his own pocket, drawing tens of thousands into the streets to protest against him.

McKinsey defends its work around the world, saying that it will not accept jobs at odds with the company's values. It also gives the same reason that other companies cite for working in corrupt or authoritarian nations -- that change is best achieved from the inside.

""Since 1926, McKinsey has sought to make a positive difference to the businesses and communities in which our people live and work,"" the company said in a statement.

""Tens of thousands of jobs have been created, lives improved and education provided thanks to the work we have done with our clients,"" it added.

""Like many other major corporations including our competitors, we seek to navigate a changing geopolitical environment,"" the company said, ""but we do not support or engage in political activities.""

Still, some analysts, veteran diplomats and experts on global governance see McKinsey's role in a different light.

While the United States pulls back from international cooperation and adopts a more nationalist stance, major companies like McKinsey are pursuing business in countries with little regard for human rights -- sometimes advancing, rather than curbing, the contentious tactics of America's biggest rivals.

""It is more likely they enable these regimes and likely become complicit,"" said David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state. ""They don't want to alienate regimes, or they would lose business.""

Oligarchs and Autocrats

His bona fides included two criminal convictions and a rigged election that, many assumed, had finally doomed his presidential ambitions.

So it was a bit surprising when McKinsey helped polish the battered image of Mr. Yanukovych and pitch him as something else: a forward-thinking leader with an economic vision of a better future for all Ukrainians.

McKinsey's role in resurrecting Mr. Yanukovych's political career has been lost in the clamor surrounding the conviction of Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, for secretly taking millions of dollars to help the Ukranian leader win the presidency in 2010.

But McKinsey was financed by the same oligarch who backed Mr. Manafort, and it wrote an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych wielded to disarm his critics -- before discarding much of it after becoming president.

On his 100th day in office, in a Soviet-era palace adorned with Cossack art, Mr. Yanukovych stiffly briefed the nation, laying out his economic plan. After sipping Cognac and Scotch, legislators and guests packed the hall, where the cameras conspicuously stopped on a man with a bright blue suit and a résumé that touched the lives of virtually everyone in Ukraine.

His name: Rinat Akhmetov, the country's richest oligarch. As much as anyone, he was the reason for the gathering, and he had reason to feel good.

He had rescued Mr. Yanukovych through a strategy that included hiring two very different consulting groups: Mr. Manafort, whose Russian-linked team had worked for dictators with little regard for human rights, and McKinsey, the purveyor of best practices for the world's most important corporations.

That these two disparate groups found common ground is a testament to Mr. Akhmetov's vast business empire and political skill. But for McKinsey, it underscored the risk of consulting in an unstable part of the world, where the company might be perceived as enabling autocratic or corrupt governments.

Mr. Manafort's job was twofold: to soften Mr. Yanukovych's reputation and strengthen his Russian-leaning Party of Regions, facilitating his rise to the presidency. McKinsey provided something different -- an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych could use to portray himself as a market-based reformer, tilting to the West.

To ensure that the message got through, Mr. Yanukovych and Mr. Akhmetov pointedly mentioned McKinsey in talks with American officials, according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Akhmetov assured the Americans that his candidate was ""a strong McKinsey supporter,"" while Mr. Yanukovych emphasized that he had instructed his aides ""to work directly with McKinsey experts.""

Diplomats remained wary. A respected Ukrainian journalist warned American officials that Mr. Yanukovych might ""sing a song one moment and knife someone the next.""

There were also questions about Mr. Akhmetov, who had long been suspected of links to organized crime, which he denied. One diplomat called his Party of Regions a haven for ""mobsters and oligarchs,"" noting that it might be trying to shed that image.

Mr. Akhmetov's financial ties to Mr. Manafort and McKinsey went beyond politics. He hired both to advise parts of his corporate empire, which included steel, mining, energy, finance, telecommunications, real estate, media, transportation, agriculture and soccer. He also hired former McKinsey consultants to help run his businesses, placing them in senior positions.

Mr. Akhmetov paid Mr. Manafort by wire transfers funneled through a Cypriot shell company, court records show. Other Party of Regions operatives paid Mr. Manafort through shell companies, eventually resulting in his conviction in the United States for failing to declare the money on his tax returns.

McKinsey, by contrast, was paid through a Ukrainian foundation financed by Mr. Akhmetov and run by a former McKinsey consultant now living in Moscow. Set up to promote economic reform, the foundation also sought to publicize McKinsey -- and by extension, Mr. Yanukovych.

To reach its prime audience in the United States, the foundation held two forums on the Ukrainian economy -- one at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York and the other in Washington. On the whole, McKinsey's work was well received.

But the promise of a better future didn't last long.

Within a few years, Ukraine careened toward economic collapse while Mr. Yanukovych looted the nation, living in a palatial residence surrounded by a private zoo, a golf course, a garage filled with classic cars and a private restaurant in the form of a pirate ship.

If that were not enough, he was also quietly building an enormous seaside retreat, complete with 40-foot ceilings and an indoor swimming pool, that eclipsed his presidential residence.

The capital soon turned against him. Mr. Yanukovych had long promised to tie Ukraine to the West by signing sweeping political and trade agreements with the European Union. Then he abruptly reneged, siding with Russia instead.

Protesters flooded the streets for months, chanting pro-Europe slogans. Mr. Yanukovych's government responded with a heavy hand, culminating in what the European Parliament's envoy called a ""Ukrainian Tiananmen,"" referring to China's deadly crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. More than 80 protesters were killed before Mr. Yanukovych fled the country in 2014.

The chaos didn't end there. Outraged, Mr. Putin pushed into Ukraine, annexed Crimea and stirred up a war that has claimed more than 10,000 lives. The West responded by kicking Russia out of the Group of 8 industrialized democracies and imposing sanctions. The standoff between Mr. Putin and the West had begun.

McKinsey defended its role in Mr. Yanukovych's rise by saying that the foundation was serious about promoting economic development in Ukraine and featured prominent Westerners on its board. The foundation quietly folded -- without achieving its goals -- just before Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia. Neither Mr. Akhmetov nor McKinsey would say how much money McKinsey earned.

""When we concluded that the government was not following through on its stated reform agenda, we ended our work,"" McKinsey said in a statement.

Mr. Akhmetov, who publicly broke with Mr. Yanukovych during the protests, declined to speak to The Times. Inside his gold and chrome headquarters, a spokesman said the foundation had been unsuccessful because politicians lacked the will ""to embrace the reform agenda.""

But critics like Anders Aslund, a Swedish-born economist who advised the Russian government in the 1990s and later the government of Ukraine, lamented how Mr. Yanokovych's image had been sold in Western capitals. It was clear, he said, that Mr. Yanokovych ""was about power and robbery.""

McKinsey's role in Ukraine did not end with Mr. Yanukovych's downfall. ""We build leaders who can deliver lasting, meaningful impact for Ukraine's major companies, its economy and society,"" the company wrote on its website

McKinsey quickly became a favorite of Mr. Yanukovych's successor, Petro O. Poroshenko, an oligarch known as ""the chocolate king"" for his confectionary business.

In a speech last November, Mr. Poroshenko praised McKinsey for its 15 years of work in Ukraine. His daughter-in-law also worked for the company during most of his presidency.

Meanwhile, McKinsey has continued to consult for Mr. Akhmetov, sharing the top floor of a Kiev office building with an Akhmetov company. Another Akhmetov company sits a floor below. In fact, Mr. Akhmetov owns the entire building, which includes a business in the lobby fit for an oligarch: an Aston Martin-Rolls Royce dealership.

Building China's Dream

Deep in the Malaysian jungle, a sprawling construction site sits abandoned, the relentless monsoon rain taking its toll on the rusting fields of steel girders.

It is supposed to be a railway -- part of China's signature Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion global undertaking financed by big Chinese loans, and usually built by Chinese companies.

Chief among them is the China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned behemoth whose initials are stenciled in black on the cement plant at the abandoned site.

China Communications, which was barred for eight years from doing business on some World Bank projects because of a corruption scandal, played a leading role in building artificial islands in the South China Sea that have raised tensions with the United States.

The company's subsidiary also built a new port for Sri Lanka. But the debt turned out to be such a burden that the Sri Lankan government had to give up the port and hand it over for 99 years -- to China.

Sri Lanka's fate was so alarming that Malaysia's new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, worried that the same thing might happen to him. So he suspended the railway project in July.

""That is not good for us,"" Mr. Mahathir said in September. ""Malaysian workers have no jobs that they can do. All the work is hired from China. You can see how one-sided it is.""

But for McKinsey, it was anything but one-sided. The company represented both parties involved in the deal.

In 2015, as China Communications was building the artificial islands and still under World Bank sanctions, McKinsey signed it on as a client, advising it on strategy.

Months later, McKinsey won another contract: this one with the Malaysian government, to review the feasibility of the rail line.

In a confidential PowerPoint report, McKinsey told Malaysian officials that the rail line could increase economic growth in parts of the country by as much as 1.5 percent. It was a figure that the prime minister at the time, Najib Razak, who now has been charged with corruption, liked to cite.

In bullet points, McKinsey also said the project would help improve ties with China -- ""build the nation-to-nation relationship"" -- because of its importance in China's Belt and Road Initiative.

And McKinsey endorsed the idea of heavy borrowing from China, referring to it as a ""game changer"" elsewhere in the region.

It isn't hard to see where McKinsey's enthusiasm for the Belt and Road Initiative came from: The firm had promoted the Chinese policy at the highest levels of the company.

Dominic Barton, McKinsey's managing partner at the time, made Belt and Road the theme of a keynote address in Beijing in 2015, recounting the Silk Road trade from the second century B.C. onward.

McKinsey's in-house research group, the McKinsey Global Institute, sprang into action, producing reports -- widely cited in the Chinese state news media -- extolling the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Mr. Barton -- who has served on the advisory board of China Development Bank, one of the two biggest Chinese lenders to the Belt and Road Initiative -- also batted down concerns in a 2015 interview with Chinese state media that the undertaking might be used as a tool to expand China's global influence.

""The world is waiting for the 'One Belt, One Road' grand blueprint to move from dream to reality,"" Mr. Barton and his colleagues wrote in a report published on the company's Chinese website in May 2015, expressing McKinsey's enthusiasm to work on it.

The feeling was mutual. Nine of the top 20 Belt-and-Road contractors are or have been McKinsey clients, according to research by The Times and figures from RWR Advisory Group, which tracks such projects.

In 2016, McKinsey's client, China Communications, won the $13 billion contract to build the Malaysian railroad. McKinsey justified the project at a time when Mr. Najib was widely accused of corruption, buffeted by street protests over the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars from a state investment fund, and badly in need of cash from an outside lender like China.

The scandal over the deal has enveloped both of McKinsey's clients. Mr. Mahatir told local reporters that China Communications, which won a no-bid contract for the railroad, may have deliberately overstated the costs in order to help Mr. Najib and his allies shovel extra money into the investment fund to replenish the missing amounts.

Tony Pua, a Malaysian lawmaker and an aide to the finance minister, said the deal was brokered by a hard-partying Malaysian businessman named Jho Low, who is accused of siphoning off hundreds of millions of dollars from the fund and is now believed to be in China, avoiding a Malaysian arrest warrant.

McKinsey says it has no knowledge of any collusion between China and Mr. Najib. It said that of course it would discuss China's sweeping Belt and Road plans but rejected the notion that, by representing both sides involved in the project, the company had a conflict of interest in any way. By the time China Communications won the bid, its work for Malaysia had already finished, the firm said.

""Our firm's rigorous internal policies and procedures"" ensure that ""we bring an independent perspective"" to help each client ""pursue its own strategic goals,"" McKinsey said.

But the political backdrop -- a government facing crippling corruption accusations and the prospect that Mr. Najib might turn to China for funds to cover his tracks -- should have been obvious to McKinsey at the time, argued Bridget Welsh, a professor at John Cabot University in Rome who focuses on Malaysian politics.

""They were choosing to engage with actors that were deeply tainted,"" Ms. Welsh said of McKinsey.

A Special Relationship

It was not the first time McKinsey had been drawn into questionable arrangements through its work in China.

The company opened its first office there in 1995, using consultants from the United States and Britain. By the end the decade, McKinsey was on hand to help as Beijing began pushing its moribund state-owned companies to adopt Western-style management, a McKinsey specialty.

The firm landed some big clients. Its star pupil was Ping An, an insurance company set up as part of a state-owned shipping company. Beginning in 1997, McKinsey began a two-decade relationship with the company as it rose from a footnote to one of the world's biggest insurers.

McKinsey's success soon reached into the pinnacle of Chinese politics, dragging it -- unwittingly and unknowingly, the company contends -- into a potential conflict of interest in the most glaring example of official enrichment in the history of the People's Republic of China.

Always in search of top talent, McKinsey brought on a 27-year-old named Liu Chunhang as a full-time associate in 2002. He had just graduated near the top of his class at Harvard Business School, according to school records, and stayed at McKinsey for less than a year. But in that time, his in-laws took steps that would turn them into billionaires.

Mr. Liu was the son-in-law of Wen Jiabao, the country's vice premier in charge of finance. Several months later, Mr. Wen became China's premier, putting him in charge of running the government.

At the time, McKinsey's client, Ping An, was preparing for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The Wen family and its business associates became secret shareholders of Ping An, having acquired their stakes at low cost in late 2002. And as premier, Mr. Wen presided over China's cabinet, which oversaw the insurance industry and signed off on big I.P.O.s.

According to McKinsey, Mr. Liu left the company in July 2003. It's not clear whether he played any role in his extended family's business activities. But when Ping An went public the next year, the Wen family amassed a staggering fortune, largely in company stock. By 2007, the family was worth at least $2.7 billion.

Mr. Liu, who is now a senior official at China's banking regulator, said through a spokesman that he ""never worked on any projects for the firm's Chinese clients,"" and that it would be ""misleading"" to connect him with McKinsey's work for Ping An.

McKinsey said that Mr. Liu had been hired because he was qualified, not because of his family connections.

""Any suggestion that Mr. Liu was hired or employed for improper purpose is false and extremely misleading,"" the company said.

Today, China's best and brightest clamor to work at McKinsey. Partners in the firm have sat in on Communist Party meetings at companies. More than 90 percent of the company's 350 consultants in China are of Chinese descent, according to its website.

And the importance of China to McKinsey over all is evident: The firm's last two managing partners, Mr. Barton and Kevin Sneader, were promoted from the region. Mr. Sneader now runs the entire company from Hong Kong.

McKinsey's name has become so prestigious in the country that a Chinese copycat sprang up, adopting the company's Chinese name.

The copycat firm -- Chengdu McKinsey Management Consulting Company -- even won a contract to advise Sichuan Province on its economic planning. Its ruse was so successful that the China Economic Weekly, a magazine under the Communist Party's mouthpiece People's Daily, wrote a cover article about the spreading influence of the real McKinsey, likening it to an octopus, and marveling at the success of the fake one.

McKinsey said it had not worked on the economic planning in Sichuan Province.

The company, however, has not shied away from contentious programs like ""Smart Cities,"" worrying scholars and human rights advocates who say the approach will strengthen China's surveillance state.

The idea of smart cities is to make them more manageable by collecting data from sources like cameras. In an authoritarian state like China, that raises broad concerns.

""Police patrols cannot be everywhere, for instance, but predictive analytics can deploy them in the right place at the right time,"" McKinsey wrote in a report in June.

""It is about political control,"" said Samantha Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

McKinsey is now working with Ping An to put smart cities into practice in the Chinese city of Nanning to monitor financial fraud.

The company has also championed -- even parroted, critics say -- the Chinese government's ""Made in China 2025"" initiative to become a global leader in sensitive fields like artificial intelligence and aerospace, a policy rattling European and American leaders who fear the plans will undermine their economies and set the stage for Chinese dominance.

In October, Vice President Mike Pence warned that ""through the 'Made in China 2025' plan, the Communist Party has set its sights on controlling 90 percent of the world's most advanced industries.""

McKinsey has produced at least 10 reports in Chinese focusing on ""Made in China 2025."" But earlier this year, China's government ordered the news media to stop writing about it, given the intense criticism from the United States and Europe. McKinsey's reports also stopped mentioning the policy.

""They sometimes seem to be almost like an arm of the People's Daily,"" George Magnus, a former chief economist at UBS, said of McKinsey. ""Obviously they do it in a slightly more subtle way -- sometimes not so subtle.""

Clients Under Sanctions

When Senate investigators wanted to know why Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, met with the head of a Russian bank under sanctions shortly after the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Kushner explained that, as far as he had been told, the bank chief had ""a direct line to the Russian president.""

It is easy to see how. The bank -- Vnesheconombank, or VEB -- is owned by the Russian government and overseen directly by Mr. Putin's inner circle. The bank's former chief -- the one Mr. Kushner met -- graduated from the training school of the F.S.B., the successor agency of the K.G.B. The bank has also come under scrutiny in Congress and by the special counsel investigating possible collusion in the 2016 election.

And the bank is a McKinsey client.

In August, VEB hired the consulting firm to develop its business strategy -- one of several companies that are under sanctions and that McKinsey advises.

Sberbank -- a state-controlled bank that is on the sanctions list and that sponsored Mr. Trump's Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013 -- is also a McKinsey client. In 2016, it agreed to pay the firm up to $5.2 million for advice on restructuring.

Yet another state-owned bank under sanctions, VTB, agreed to pay McKinsey about $4.4 million in 2017 to develop information technology.

McKinsey's work in Russia is extensive. Its Moscow office, the largest of the Western consulting firms working there, has handled about 2,000 projects, working with market leaders in oil, gas, banking and retail, as well as the mining of diamonds, gold and coal. One of its senior partners is the son of the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

McKinsey is so valued in Russia that even as Mr. Putin and Western nations clashed over Ukraine, a partner in the firm served on a Russian energy commission until 2015, along with several business executives who were either the target of individual sanctions or had ties to companies under sanction.

McKinsey clients help expand Russia's reach abroad. One of them -- PhosAgro, a fertilizer giant with ties to the Kremlin -- is pushing hard for new regulations that would give it greater control over Europe's food supply. The European Union already had concerns about Russian influence over its natural gas supply, much of which came from Gazprom, another Russian company under sanctions that McKinsey has advised on strategy and pricing.

McKinsey says it takes jobs in Russia -- or anywhere in the world -- only when it believes it can make a positive contribution. McKinsey also says its consulting is not political in nature, but focused on helping people lead better lives.

The firm has plenty of accomplishments to point to. In Russia alone, it upgraded Aeroflot, the national airline, improved traffic flow in Moscow and improved worker safety.

And McKinsey is far from the only American company working in legal ways with companies under sanctions. Some American officials have long argued that getting involved in the Russian economy not only benefits the American companies working there, but can also help foster better business practices and a greater appreciation for democratic principles overseas.

Others see little evidence of that. Robert G. Berschinski, a State Department official in the Obama administration, said business leaders and policymakers often believed that actively engaging with authoritarian governments would lead to economic reform, which in turn would drive political reform.

""But what is becoming increasingly clear, in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia -- in all three of those instances -- that belief has not proven to be true,"" he said.

China is a prime example, argued Mr. Kramer, the former assistant secretary of state. He said the country had lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, yet companies that do business there ""have nothing to point to"" showing that Chinese people have been granted more civil or political rights.

In some cases, McKinsey's work may have made things worse.

The firm produced a report tracking how some of Saudi Arabia's most important policies were viewed by the public, singling out three individuals who drove often negative conversations on Twitter.

One was later arrested, according to a human rights group. Another said that Saudi government officials had imprisoned two of his brothers and hacked his cellphone. The third -- an anonymous account -- was shut down.

McKinsey said it was ""horrified by the possibility, however remote,"" that the report could have been misused. But the kingdom is a such a vital client for the firm -- the source of nearly 600 projects from 2011 to 2016 alone -- that McKinsey chose to participate in a major Saudi investment conference in October even after the killing and dismemberment of a Washington Post columnist by Saudi agents.

""The world is divided into people who are for beheadings and against beheadings,"" said Anand Giridharadas, a former McKinsey consultant and former Times writer. He added that the firm and other companies were lending ""their reputation and credibility to a regime that deserves none of that.""

For 19 months, Calvert W. Jones, a University of Maryland professor, crisscrossed the Gulf monarchies in the Middle East as part of her research evaluating the work of management consultants in what she calls ""the black box of authoritarian governance.""

""Even if democracy itself remains a distant hope, so the thinking goes, experts might improve the daily lives of citizens in fundamental ways,"" Ms. Jones wrote.

Her conclusions are not likely to make it into recruiting videos for consulting companies seeking idealistic college graduates.

""In the beginning, the best of them want to help, want to do real research, provide data and expert opinions,"" she said. But after initially speaking their minds, she said, they gradually stop.

""They engage in the art of not speaking truth to power,"" she said. ""They self-censor, exaggerate successes and downplay their own misgivings due to the incentive structures they face.""

Outside experts might even reduce, rather than encourage, domestic reform, Ms. Jones said, partly because consultants are often unwilling to level with the ruling elite. The issue is becoming increasingly relevant, she said, as ""the number of experts circulating around the world continues to grow.""

The expansion is clear enough in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh on a weekday morning. There, a former Western diplomat quipped, you can watch the consultants departing for their jobs ""like bats leaving a cave."""

""What is the name of the Chief Minister"", I asked a group of tribal women in Mahasamund. It was my first field trip to Chhattisgarh and I was a rookie with one year of experience in the development sector. With all the scepticism that new idealists could gather, I felt that women not knowing the name of the Chief Minister of the state would reflect on their agency, and hence would give me a starting point to discuss decentralised governance with them!

""I do not know his name, but 'chawal waale baba' is what we call him"". Mahasamund has always been a Congress dominated belt and the response came as a shock to me. For the next couple of hours, I went on to talk of a lot of things, but what dominated the discussion was how the women in the village zealously monitor the fair price shops and how this 'chawal waale baba' is doing some good work for them.

Few days back, Dr Raman Singh was about to face a defeat in his constituency of Rajnandgaon from which he has been contesting elections since the early 90s. He somehow managed to scrape through but the government and his party could not be saved. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been reduced to 15 seats in the state and has lost out across all demographies and geographies in the state. But, 15 years is not a small time and Dr Raman Singh has presided over the most significant period of change in the state. So what is his legacy and what is the way ahead for him, politically?

Before the arrival of the Gujarat success story by the fag end of 2014, Chhattisgarh was the state where the issue of development was front and centre in electoral terms. It was a state carved out of Madhya Pradesh to help the tribal and the Scheduled Caste communities and hence, the articulation of development here was also very different. Development in Chhattisgarh in the way Raman Singh articulated meant a turnaround in fortunes and not just a facelift.

As one of the states with the largest tribal population, abject poverty and violent Left wing extremism, Chhattisgarh needed that narrative of transition and Raman Singh was the one who provided it. And this was not the development of mega industries and four-lane highways and metros criss-crossing cities. This was the development of getting people adequate food to eat and putting the first generation of learners in schools and bringing the first pucca roads to a village. It was development from scratch.

If we look at the Chhattisgarh story since the past 15 years, there are two aspects of governance which would stand out as the legacy of Dr Raman Singh.

Social Development Legacy

The biggest success story in Chhattisgarh under Dr Singh was the efficiency of the public distribution system (PDS). Chhattisgarh took an unabashed Left route in approaching food security and increased the PDS coverage to 74 per cent. Moreover, when other states were experiencing major issues of pilferage and looting, the Chhattisgarh government undertook a slew of reforms to address the situation.

The first concern that Raman Singh identified after taking office was that more than 50 per cent of the below poverty line (BPL) population, were unable to access the food grains meant for them. The first reform he brought in was taking away the ownership of PDS shops from private businessmen and handing over control to the local community.

Then came other measures like issuing new ration cards with holograms which weeded out over 3 lakh fake beneficiaries, increased commission and even a seed fund to shop operators for making the business viable, increased monitoring and vigilance including community audits, doorstep delivery of food grains and raids and massive crackdown of corrupt rice millers. Raman Singh without any doubt made PDS the key to his re-election in 2008 and there was no other issue which worked, except 'chawal'.

The victory of 2008 was on the back of the almost transformational change in the supply chain of the PDS and sealed the tag of 'chawal waale baba'. The Chhattisgarh success story was so convincing that even some stalwarts in Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council (NAC) had to use it as a template.

The success of PDS in Chhattisgarh had an expected ripple effect on the nutritional levels in the state. Food scarcity in tribal belts leads to malnutrition and stunting, and Chhattisgarh managed to address this issue thoroughly. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 data shows that the percentage of adult women with body mass index (BMI) less than normal has decreased from 43.4 per cent in 2005-06 to 26.7 in 2015-16. It is less than the figures for MP and Jharkhand and almost the same as Odisha, even though it recorded a higher incidence level than all three states in 2005-06.

Another important change has been the decrease in instances of anaemia in infants which has reduced from 71.2 per cent in 2005-06 to 41.6 per cent in 2015-16. It has now reached below the national average, while the states of MP, Jharkhand and Odisha still register more instances of infant anaemia. The final indicator which directly speaks about malnutrition is the incidences of stunting.

The following figure provides an idea of how Chhattisgarh has progressed on addressing stunting and underweight issues in children. The only state which has fared better than Chhattisgarh is Odisha but it also needs to be seen that Chhattisgarh had a much higher base in 2005-06.

This is no minor feat. With the PDS covering basic food-grains in villages, schools and anganwadi centres, the savings of the poor could be used to widen the basket of nutritious food, thus effectively tackling malnutrition. The single minded focus of Raman Singh on one issue paid off both socially and politically for him.

If Vasundhara Raje has been the most economic right wing chief minister from the BJP, Raman Singh has undoubtedly been the most towards the Left. He is known for a slew of populist welfare schemes in the state. His focus on health and nutrition extended to his CM Health Scheme whereby Rs 30,000 worth of free treatment was provided to citizens. Other welfare schemes ranged from the Saraswati Cycle Yojana for school girls to the Mukhyamantri Teerth Yatra Yojana for elderly citizens.

Combating Left Wing Extremism In The State

Since the day the new state of Chhattisgarh was born, the single biggest problem impeding the development initiatives was the 'red terrorism' plaguing multiple districts of the state.

Raman Singh has been at the centre of a lot of controversy when it comes to combating Left wing extremism and his government has been accused of custodial violence against tribals, harassment of activists like Binayak Sen and most importantly tacit support given to the Salwa Judum. Raman Singh in the past has openly defended the Salwa Judum as being the primary resistance force against the Maoists.

In 2009, just two years before the Salwa Judum was disbanded by the Supreme Court, Dr Singh had credited the members of the vigilante group as being the custodians of the republic. The formation of the Salwa Judum led to one of the bloodiest phases in the state and the tribal communities were divided and displaced like never before. It is a cross that both the Congress and the BJP have to bear. But, as the CM for 15 long years, it can never be dissociated from the legacy of Raman Singh.

While Chhattisgarh continues to be the state, most affected by Maoist violence, through the course of the past 15 years, the Raman Singh government had many big and small successes in addressing the alienation of the tribal communities and ushering in peace. From the construction of state highways to schemes like allowances for pregnant and lactating mothers, a mix of infrastructural and welfare measures had been implemented in tribal areas along with numerous awareness and sensitisation campaigns.

While the districts of Sarguja and Jashpur have now been removed from the list of Maoist affected districts, the most significant transformation has been seen in the district of Bastar. The Dandakaranya belt is the hotbed of Maoist activity in the country and has been the scene of the most dastardly acts of violence against the state. Carrying out development activities in this area and then seeing tangible returns of inclusion is no mean feat.

It is a three-pronged strategy where the security forces and the civic administration work in tandem to ensure that relative peace facilitates rapid infrastructural development and the cycle continues without further incidents. The third prong is ensuring that key entitlements to the local communities and their rights under PESA are respected. This has been a strategy that the Chhattisgarh government under Dr Singh has made moderate success in.

One of the most significant changes in the Maoist areas of the state has been the rapid construction of roads. These roads have not only ended the alienation of remote villages but have pushed the Maoists further into the jungles. Conversely, it has also been the cause behind much of the attacks in the state since 2014.

The two stretches which have seen the most attacks are the Dornapal-Jagargunda stretch and the Injeram-Bhejji stretch which are incidentally the two critical road construction stretches. Bastar, today, is being dotted with educational institutions and health care centres. There are three districts in the region which still can be counted as war zones and the Maoist threat is far from over. But, change has happened right under the barrel of the gun and for that Dr Raman Singh deserves a lot of credit.

My first trip to Mahasamund for a study was in 2013. The last one was in 2017 when I travelled to Ambikapur, Sarguja, another Congress belt. This time I was not working with women but with adolescent girls. Their concerns were different. They needed English classes and computer skills, and well-paying jobs. Some of them told me that the 'sattu' provided by the government under the SABLA scheme is used for feeding cattle, a far cry from conversations of adequate nutrition. Survival and chawal was not the topic of discussion. Aspiration and jobs were.

I again asked them about the CM. All of them knew his name, Dr Raman Singh. For the new generation with new hopes, he was not 'chawal waale baba' anymore. He was just another politician who needed to deliver on new demands. That, perhaps, sums up why the development agenda of Raman Singh did not work. There is a new generation holding the keys to power now and the old guard could not keep up with their aspirations.

While the legacy of Dr Raman Singh has been development, it has mostly been around subsistence. Food security, access to health, even footwear for tired feet! It is perhaps what the need was that point but subsistence will never be enough. With his share of successes and controversies and lost time, Dr Singh needs to be given the due credit he deserves.

It is to his credit to have governed one of the most difficult, conflict ridden states in India and gradually relieve parts of it from the backward status it had been stamped with. While a large number of districts in Chhattisgarh continue to be aspirational while the rest of the country surges forward, it is to his credit that the dreams of Naya Raipur and Naya Bastar have not been pushed to the background.

And importantly, his PDS success story has been the one which exhibits what true political will can achieve even in the face of immense odds. This could very well have been the end of his stint as the CM of the state, but the road from Raipur via Bastar may just lead to New Delhi."

The DPS Future Windows School of Mehdipatnam on Saturday took the 75 children and their families to the picnic at a resort.

The parents of the deceased student alleged that it was the negligence of the school staff due to which their son died.

""The incident happened around 2 pm. Azam slipped into the pool and drowned when he was left unattended,"" DCP Shamshabad N. Prakash Reddy said.

The DCP further stated that the criminal action would be taken after a thorough investigation and the parents can approach the court with their complaint and the school's licence can be cancelled.

Rubina, a senior employee at the school while speaking to the Deccan Chronicle said ""I personally know Azam and the family as well. Eleven children from the family are studying in the school. Ayaan was an adorable kid and is not someone who was naughty. If asked to stand at one place for two hours, he would do so.""

A school official in a statement said ""The boy's family had 30 members at the resort including the parents, grandparents and other relatives. We asked the lifeguard to leave as the women wearing hijab and salwar kameez were getting into the pool and were not comfortable. If it was the school's fault, I would have hanged myself but his whole family was present there and Azam's mother was heard shouting and scolding his father, asking him how he could he leave the child unattended, to which he replied that he had gone to the washroom.""

A case was booked under Section 304-A (death by negligence) of IPC against the school and the boy's body was shifted to Osmania General Hospital for post-mortem examination."

","Sakshipost",FALSE,"Jammu, Srikakulam district: Dark clouds gathered this morning and there was no trace of sun anywhere. It seemed that the cyclone was beginning to have its effect. Despite this fact, people walked alongside me in large numbers.

Representatives of a Srikakulam-based non-profit organisation run by women met me. They described in detail the underlying corruption in APCO with respect to the free school uniforms scheme. ""For years we have been stitching uniforms for school children. This government is out to wreck our lives. How do we survive?"" they asked. They told me that about 100 women worked for the organisation. ""Out of the Rs.40 which is paid to us per uniform, Rs.10 has to be given as bribe to the APCO chairman. If the remaining amount is not paid to us for over one year, how can we get by?"" This was their question describing their plight.

Under the TDP, APCO has turned into a major den of corruption, they pointed out. Among the worst hit by corruption, is the free uniform scheme for school children, they remarked. Even as the academic year is coming to a close on the one hand, the uniforms have still not reached the schools, on the other, they pointed out. The few which have, are of inferior quality, they complained. With proper measurements, the uniforms are unfit to be worn by boys who discard them, they said. Girl students find it even more difficult to wear these uniforms of a smaller size.

""Who is this scheme meant for?"", the members of the women's group questioned, with righteous anger. They pointed a finger at the minister concerned, the APCO chairman and higher-ups in the government who subverted the entire purpose and diluted the free school uniforms scheme for their own selfish ends by looting it indiscriminately.

My father took up the Vamsadhara project to check the flooding of water and to prevent agricultural land from getting submerged. He had also sanctioned funds for this purpose. Narsannapeta farmers who met me complained that this government did not complete the pending works and as a result, thousands of acres of land was getting submerged. They expressed their anguish at the negligence of the TDP government. This was the case again with the works related to the head canals, they pointed out. ""Because of the indifference of this government, thousands of acres get submerged at the time of floods,"" they lamented.

On the other hand, when there was no water to irrigate the fields, agricultural land went dry, they pointed out. While the farmers continued to suffer year after year, the government remained completely insensitive to their plight. What can one say about such an apathetic government?

Arogyamitras complained that they were being harassed and discriminated against only because they were appointed during the tenure of my father, late Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy. Their job insecurity became a day to day matter of unending tension, only after this Telugu Desam government came to power, they remarked. They had to seek justice from the court of law when they were removed from service at one stroke, they said. The government paid no heed to the direction from the court that their salaries should be enhanced. The government is still trying to ease them out of service, they feared. ""What is our fault? Is it that we were appointed in the Arogyasri scheme which won national and international acclaim,"" they asked. What can be more inhuman than to torment these poor employees and to dilute the pioneering healthcare initiative launched by my father, only because he would be remembered and get credit for it! What is this sense of envy which drives people at the highest level in this government and who is it wreaking its vengeance upon? After all, who benefits from this universal healthcare scheme -- lakhs of families across the state!

I have a question for the chief minister -- you claim that students are being supplied free uniforms every year. Handloom societies which supplied cloth complain that their arrears have not been paid. Those who stitched these uniforms say that their dues have still not been paid. Students complain that even as the academic year is coming to a close, they have still not received their uniforms, and where they did, the ones supplied are of a very poor quality. What is happening to the funds sanctioned for this scheme of free uniforms? Whose pockets are being filled with these funds?"

More than 150 people, 137 of them kids, were killed in a gun-and-bomb attack by a squad of suicide bombers of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a conglomerate of several Pakistan militant outfits.

In a message, Prime Minister Imran Khan said the tragic incident of attack on Army Public School (APS) unified and solidified the whole nation against an enemy which is a blot on humanity and the worst example of animalism.

President of Awami National Party (ANP) Asfandyar Wali Khan, the grandson of Frontier Gandhi (Bacha Khan), however, said the murderer of innocent children is now a state guest while the victims still await justice. He was referring to Ehsanullah Ehsan, the former spokesperson of TTP. Ehsan had surrendered to the security forces in April 2017 and is currently in custody of law enforcers.

The ANP chief said that unless the terrorist sanctuaries are eliminated, peace and progress cannot be ensured in the country. ""Had the criminals of APS attack been traced and punished, the attacks which followed would have been prevented,"" he said, adding that terrorists' facilitators and helpers were not only roaming across the country armed with weapons but also taking part in national politics.

A petition was filed in Peshawar High Court (HC) by Fazal Khan, father of an APS victim, highlighting that Ehsan had been under custody for a long time but not presented before any trial court. In April, HC had directed the government not to grant clemency to Ehsan.

""Top terrorists are still present in Punjab province where they collect funds from the platform of banned outfits to commit acts of terrorism. Until the policies of good and bad are shunned, incidents such as the APS tragedy will keep occurring,"" he remarked.

Asfandyar also asked the ruler to clarify its position on status of Haqqani network."

The application process for admissions to entry level classes in over 1,600 private schools began on Saturday.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has also advised the parents to not approach these schools till the department issues further order to avoid any inconvenience to them in case any penal action is initiated against defaulter schools.

""In order to maintain transparency and uniformity in admission, the admission process of these 105 schools at entry level for session 2019-20 shall be on hold till further orders,"" a senior DoE official said.

""If it is found that the said schools are taking admission despite being prevented to do so, necessary action as per norms will be taken without any further notice,"" the official added.

The distance of student's residence from school, sibling quota, parents being alumni of the school, single child, and first child are some of the criteria listed by schools for admissions to the entry level classes.

According to the schedule released by the DoE, the application window will be open from Saturday and the last date of submitting application forms for admission to nursery for 2019-20 session is January 7.

The first list of selected children, along with marks secured by them, will be out on February 4. The second list will be out on February 21 and the nursery admission process will conclude on March 31.

The directorate had instructed all private schools to upload their criteria -- with points for each criterion -- for admission in open seats, on its official website by December 14.

There is, however, no clarity on the schedule of the EWS admissions yet. The government has also set an upper age limit of less than four years to be eligible for nursery, less than five years for kindergarten, and less than six years for admission to Class 1.

The proposal for an upper age limit was challenged in the court last year. Though a Delhi high court order last year had allowed the imposition of the upper age limit, the DoE had decided that the order will be applicable only from the 2019 academic session.

Apart from the abolished criteria, the schools have been given autonomy to come up with their own points system."

She knew that her cancer, mesothelioma, arose in the delicate membrane surrounding her lungs and other organs. She knew it was as rare as it was deadly, a signature of exposure to asbestos. And she knew it afflicted mostly men who inhaled asbestos dust in mines and industries such as shipbuilding that used the carcinogen before its risks were understood.

Coker, 52 years old, had raised two daughters and was running a massage school in Lumberton, a small town in eastern Texas. How had she been exposed to asbestos? ""She wanted answers,"" her daughter Cady Evans said.

Fighting for every breath and in crippling pain, Coker hired Herschel Hobson, a personal-injury lawyer. He homed in on a suspect: the Johnson's Baby Powder that Coker had used on her infant children and sprinkled on herself all her life. Hobson knew that talc and asbestos often occurred together in the earth, and that mined talc could be contaminated with the carcinogen. Coker sued Johnson & Johnson, alleging that ""poisonous talc"" in the company's beloved product was her killer.

J&J denied the claim. Baby Powder was asbestos-free, it said. As the case proceeded, J&J was able to avoid handing over talc test results and other internal company records Hobson had requested to make the case against Baby Powder.

Coker had no choice but to drop her lawsuit, Hobson said. ""When you are the plaintiff, you have the burden of proof,"" he said. ""We didn't have it.""

That was in 1999. Two decades later, the material Coker and her lawyer sought is emerging as J&J has been compelled to share thousands of pages of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents with lawyers for some of the 11,700 plaintiffs now claiming that the company's talc caused their cancers -- including thousands of women with ovarian cancer.

A Reuters examination of many of those documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, shows that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, and that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.

The documents also depict successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators' plans to limit asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on the health effects of talc.

A small portion of the documents have been produced at trial and cited in media reports. Many were shielded from public view by court orders that allowed J&J to turn over thousands of documents it designated as confidential. Much of their contents is reported here for the first time.

""RATHER HIGH""

The earliest mentions of tainted J&J talc that Reuters found come from 1957 and 1958 reports by a consulting lab. They describe contaminants in talc from J&J's Italian supplier as fibrous and ""acicular,"" or needle-like, tremolite. That's one of the six minerals that in their naturally occurring fibrous form are classified as asbestos.

At various times from then into the early 2000s, reports by scientists at J&J, outside labs and J&J's supplier yielded similar findings. The reports identify contaminants in talc and finished powder products as asbestos or describe them in terms typically applied to asbestos, such as ""fiberform"" and ""rods.""

In 1976, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was weighing limits on asbestos in cosmetic talc products, J&J assured the regulator that no asbestos was ""detected in any sample"" of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973. It didn't tell the agency that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc - in one case at levels reported as ""rather high.""

Most internal J&J asbestos test reports Reuters reviewed do not find asbestos. However, while J&J's testing methods improved over time, they have always had limitations that allow trace contaminants to go undetected - and only a tiny fraction of the company's talc is tested.

The World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn't been established. Many plaintiffs allege that the amounts they inhaled when they dusted themselves with tainted talcum powder were enough.

The evidence of what J&J knew has surfaced after people who suspected that talc caused their cancers hired lawyers experienced in the decades-long deluge of litigation involving workers exposed to asbestos. Some of the lawyers knew from those earlier cases that talc producers tested for asbestos, and they began demanding J&J's testing documentation.

What J&J produced in response to those demands has allowed plaintiffs' lawyers to refine their argument: The culprit wasn't necessarily talc itself, but also asbestos in the talc. That assertion, backed by decades of solid science showing that asbestos causes mesothelioma and is associated with ovarian and other cancers, has had mixed success in court.

In two cases earlier this year - in New Jersey and California - juries awarded big sums to plaintiffs who, like Coker, blamed asbestos-tainted J&J talc products for their mesothelioma.

A third verdict, in St. Louis, was a watershed, broadening J&J's potential liability: The 22 plaintiffs were the first to succeed with a claim that asbestos-tainted Baby Powder and Shower to Shower talc, a longtime brand the company sold in 2012, caused ovarian cancer, which is much more common than mesothelioma. The jury awarded them $4.69 billion in damages. Most of the talc cases have been brought by women with ovarian cancer who say they regularly used J&J talc products as a perineal antiperspirant and deodorant.

At the same time, at least three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs' mesothelioma. Others have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.

""JUNK"" SCIENCE

J&J has said it will appeal the recent verdicts against it. It has maintained in public statements that its talc is safe, as shown for years by the best tests available, and that the information it has been required to divulge in recent litigation shows the care the company takes to ensure its products are asbestos-free. It has blamed its losses on juror confusion, ""junk"" science, unfair court rules and overzealous lawyers looking for a fresh pool of asbestos plaintiffs.

""Plaintiffs' attorneys out for personal financial gain are distorting historical documents and intentionally creating confusion in the courtroom and in the media,"" Ernie Knewitz, J&J's vice president of global media relations, wrote in an emailed response to Reuters' findings. ""This is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer. Any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.""

J&J declined to comment further for this article. For more than two months, it turned down repeated requests for an interview with J&J executives. On Dec. 8, the company offered to make an expert available. It had not done so as of Thursday evening.

The company referred all inquiries to its outside litigation counsel, Peter Bicks. In emailed responses, Bicks rejected Reuters' findings as ""false and misleading."" ""The scientific consensus is that the talc used in talc-based body powders does not cause cancer, regardless of what is in that talc,"" Bicks wrote. ""This is true even if - and it does not - Johnson & Johnson's cosmetic talc had ever contained minute, undetectable amounts of asbestos."" He dismissed tests cited in this article as ""outlier"" results.

In court, J&J lawyers have told jurors that company records showing that asbestos was detected in its talc referred to talc intended for industrial use. Other records, they have argued, referred to non-asbestos forms of the same minerals that their experts say are harmless. J&J has also argued that some tests picked up ""background"" asbestos - stray fibers that could have contaminated samples after floating into a mill or lab from a vehicle clutch or fraying insulation.

The company has made some of the same arguments about lab tests conducted by experts hired by plaintiffs. One of those labs found asbestos in Shower to Shower talc from the 1990s, according to an Aug. 11, 2017, court report. Another lab found asbestos in more than half of multiple samples of Baby Powder from past decades - in bottles from plaintiffs' cupboards and acquired from eBay, and even a 1978 bottle held in J&J's corporate museum. The concentrations were great enough that users ""would have, more likely than not, been exposed,"" the plaintiffs' lab report presented in several cases this year concluded.

Matthew Sanchez, a geologist with consultants RJ Lee Group Inc and a frequent expert witness for J&J, dismissed those findings in testimony in the St. Louis trial: ""I have not found asbestos in any of the current or modern, what I consider modern, Johnson & Johnson talc products,"" Sanchez told the jury. Sanchez did not return calls seeking comment. RJ Lee said it does not comment on the work it does for clients.

Since 2003, talc in Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys Talc America, a unit of Paris-based Imerys SA and a co-defendant in most of the talc litigation. Imerys and J&J said the Chinese talc is safe. An Imerys spokesman said the company's tests ""consistently show no asbestos. Talc's safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies.""

J&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, its sales outpacing those of all competitors combined, according to Euromonitor International data. And while talc products contributed just $420 million to J&J's $76.5 billion in revenue last year, Baby Powder is considered an essential facet of the healthcare-products maker's carefully tended image as a caring company - a ""sacred cow,"" as one 2003 internal email put it.

""When people really understand what's going on, I think it increases J&J's exposure a thousand-fold,"" said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers for the women in the St. Louis case.

The mounting controversy surrounding J&J talc hasn't shaken investors. The share price is up about 6 percent so far this year. Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against J&J, based on the company's Aug. 2 quarterly report, in which the company said it believed it had ""strong grounds on appeal.""

J&J Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has pledged to fight on, telling analysts in July: ""We remain confident that our products do not contain asbestos.""

Gorsky's comment, echoed in countless J&J statements, misses a crucial point. Asbestos, like many environmental carcinogens, has a long latency period. Diagnosis usually comes years after initial exposure - 20 years or longer for mesothelioma. J&J talc products today may be safe, but the talc at issue in thousands of lawsuits was sold and used over the past 60 years.

""SAFETY FIRST""

In 1886, Robert Wood Johnson enlisted his younger brothers in an eponymous startup built around the ""Safety First"" motto. Johnson's Baby Powder grew out of a line of medicated plasters, sticky rubber strips loaded with mustard and other home remedies. When customers complained of skin irritation, the brothers sent packets of talc.

Soon, mothers began applying the talc to infants' diaper-chafed skin. The Johnsons took note. They added a fragrance that would become one of the most recognizable in the world, sifted the talc into tin boxes and, in 1893, began selling it as Johnson's Baby Powder.

In the late 1950s, J&J discovered that talc from its chief source mine for the U.S. market in the Italian Alps contained tremolite. That's one of six minerals - along with chrysotile, actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite and crocidolite - that occur in nature as crystalline fibers known as asbestos, a recognized carcinogen. Some of them, including tremolite, also occur as unremarkable ""non-asbestiform"" rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits.

J&J's worry at the time was that contaminants made the company's powder abrasive. It sent tons of its Italian talc to a private lab in Columbus, Ohio, to find ways to improve the appearance, feel and purity of the powder by removing as much ""grit"" as possible. In a pair of reports from 1957 and 1958, the lab said the talc contained ""from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of contaminants,"" described as mostly fibrous and ""acicular"" tremolite.

Most of the authors of these and other J&J records cited in this article are dead. Sanchez, the RJ Lee geologist whose firm has agreed to provide him as a witness in up to 100 J&J talc trials, has testified that tremolite found decades ago in the company's talc, from Italy and later Vermont, was not tremolite asbestos at all. Rather, he has said, it was ""cleavage fragments"" from non-asbestiform tremolite.

J&J's original records don't always make that distinction. In terms of health risk, regulators since the early 1970s have treated small fiber-shaped particles of both forms the same.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for example, ""makes no distinction between fibers and (comparable) cleavage fragments,"" agency officials wrote in a response to an RJ Lee report on an unrelated matter in 2006, the year before the firm hired Sanchez. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), though it dropped the non-fibrous forms of the minerals from its definition of asbestos in 1992, nonetheless recommends that fiber-shaped fragments indistinguishable from asbestos be counted in its exposure tests.

And as the product safety director for J&J's talc supplier acknowledged in a 2008 email to colleagues: ""(I)f a deposit contains 'non-asbestiform' tremolite, there is also asbestiform tremolite naturally present as well.""

""THE LUNGS OF BABIES""

In 1964, J&J's Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary bought a cluster of talc mines in Vermont, with names like Argonaut, Rainbow, Frostbite and Black Bear. By 1966, it was blasting and bulldozing white rock out of the Green Mountain state. J&J used the milled powder in its cosmetic powders and sold a less-refined grade to roofing, flooring and tire companies for use in manufacturing.

Ten years after tremolite turned up in the Italian talc, it showed up in Vermont talc, too. In 1967, J&J found traces of tremolite and another mineral that can occur as asbestos, according to a table attached to a Nov. 1, 1967, memo by William Ashton, the executive in charge of J&J's talc supply for decades.

J&J continued to search for sources of clean talc. But in an April 9, 1969, memo to a company doctor, Ashton said it was ""normal"" to find tremolite in many U.S. talc deposits. He suggested J&J rethink its approach. ""Historically, in our Company, Tremolite has been bad,"" Ashton wrote. ""How bad is Tremolite medically, and how much of it can safely be in a talc base we might develop?""

Since pulmonary disease, including cancer, appeared to be on the rise, ""it would seem to be prudent to limit any possible content of Tremolite ... to an absolute minimum,"" came the reply from another physician executive days later.

The doctor told Ashton that J&J was receiving safety questions from pediatricians. Even Robert Wood Johnson II, the founder's son and then-retired CEO, had expressed ""concern over the possibility of the adverse effects on the lungs of babies or mothers,"" he wrote.

""We have replied,"" the doctor wrote, that ""we would not regard the usage of our powders as presenting any hazard."" Such assurances would be impossible, he added, ""if we do include Tremolite in more than unavoidable trace amounts.""

The memo is the earliest J&J document reviewed by Reuters that discusses tremolite as more than a scratchy nuisance. The doctor urged Ashton to consult with company lawyers because ""it is not inconceivable that we could become involved in litigation.""

NEVER ""100% CLEAN""

By the early 1970s, asbestos was widely recognized as the primary cause of mesothelioma among workers involved in producing it and in industries that used it in their products.

Regulation was in the air. In 1972, President Richard Nixon's newly created OSHA issued its first rule, setting limits on workplace exposure to asbestos dust.

By then, a team at Mount Sinai Medical Center led by pre-eminent asbestos researcher Irving Selikoff had started looking at talcum powders as a possible solution to a puzzle: Why were tests of lung tissue taken post mortem from New Yorkers who never worked with asbestos finding signs of the mineral? Since talc deposits are often laced with asbestos, the scientists reasoned, perhaps talcum powders played a role.

They shared their preliminary findings with New York City's environmental protection chief, Jerome Kretchmer. On June 29, 1971, Kretchmer informed the Nixon administration and called a press conference to announce that two unidentified brands of cosmetic talc appeared to contain asbestos.

The FDA opened an inquiry. J&J issued a statement: ""Our fifty years of research knowledge in this area indicates that there is no asbestos contained in the powder manufactured by Johnson & Johnson.""

Later that year, another Mount Sinai researcher, mineralogist Arthur Langer, told J&J in a letter that the team had found a ""relatively small"" amount of chrysotile asbestos in Baby Powder.

Langer, Selikoff and Kretchmer ended up on a J&J list of ""antagonistic personalities"" in a Nov. 29, 1972, memo, which described Selikoff as the leader of an ""attack on talc.""

""I suppose I was antagonistic,"" Langer told Reuters. Even so, in a subsequent test of J&J powders in 1976, he didn't find asbestos - a result that Mount Sinai announced.

Langer said he told J&J lawyers who visited him last year that he stood by all of his findings. J&J has not called him as a witness.

Selikoff died in 1992. Kretchmer said he recently read that a jury had concluded that Baby Powder was contaminated with asbestos. ""I said to myself, 'How come it took so long?' "" he said.

In July 1971, meanwhile, J&J sent a delegation of scientists to Washington to talk to the FDA officials looking into asbestos in talcum powders. According to an FDA account of the meeting, J&J shared ""evidence that their talc contains less than 1%, if any, asbestos.""

Later that month, Wilson Nashed, one of the J&J scientists who visited the FDA, said in a memo to the company's public relations department that J&J's talc contained trace amounts of ""fibrous minerals (tremolite/actinolite).""

""INCONTROVERTIBLE ASBESTOS""

As the FDA continued to investigate asbestos in talc, J&J sent powder samples to be tested at private and university labs. Though a private lab in Chicago found trace amounts of tremolite, it declared the amount ""insignificant"" and the samples ""substantially free of asbestiform material."" J&J reported that finding to the FDA under a cover letter that said the ""results clearly show"" the samples tested ""contain no chrysotile asbestos."" J&J's lawyer told Reuters the tremolite found in the samples was not asbestos.

But J&J's FDA submission left out University of Minnesota professor Thomas E. Hutchinson's finding of chrysotile in a Shower to Shower sample - ""incontrovertible asbestos,"" as he described it in a lab note.

The FDA's own examinations found no asbestos in J&J powder samples in the 1f970s. Those tests, however, did not use the most sensitive detection methods. An early test, for example, was incapable of detecting chrysotile fibers, as an FDA official recognized in a J&J account of an Aug. 11, 1972, meeting with the agency: ""I understand that some samples will be passed even though they contain such fibers, but we are willing to live with it.""

By 1973, Tom Shelley, director of J&J's Central Research Laboratories in New Jersey, was looking into acquiring patents on a process that a British mineralogist and J&J consultant was developing to separate talc from tremolite.

""It is quite possible that eventually tremolite will be prohibited in all talc,"" Shelley wrote on Feb. 20, 1973, to a British colleague. Therefore, he added, the ""process may well be valuable property to us.""

At the end of March, Shelley recognized the sensitivity of the plan in a memo sent to a J&J lawyer in New Jersey: ""We will want to carefully consider the ... patents re asbestos in talc. It's quite possible that we may wish to keep the whole thing confidential rather than allow it to be published in patent form and thus let the whole world know.""

J&J did not obtain the patents.

While Shelley was looking into the patents, J&J research director DeWitt Petterson visited the company's Vermont mining operation. ""Occasionally, sub-trace quantities of tremolite or actinolite are identifiable,"" he wrote in an April 1973 report on the visit. ""And these might be classified as asbestos fiber.""

J&J should ""protect our powder franchise"" by eliminating as many tiny fibers that can be inhaled in airborn talc dust as possible, Petterson wrote. He warned, however, that ""no final product will ever be made which will be totally free from respirable particles."" Introducing a cornstarch version of Baby Powder, he noted, ""is obviously another answer.""

Bicks told Reuters that J&J believes that the tremolite and actinolite Petterson cited were not asbestos.

Cornstarch came up again in a March 5, 1974, report in which Ashton, the J&J talc supply chief, recommended that the company research that alternative ""for defensive reasons"" because ""the thrust against talc has centered primarily on biological problems alleged to result from the inhalation of talc and related mineral particles.""

""WE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS""

A few months after Petterson's recognition that talc purity was a pipe dream, the FDA proposed a rule that talc used in drugs contain no more than 0.1 percent asbestos. While the agency's cosmetics division was considering similar action on talcum powders, it asked companies to suggest testing methods.

At the time, J&J's Baby Powder franchise was consuming 20,000 tons of Vermont talc a year. J&J pressed the FDA to approve an X-ray scanning technique that a company scientist said in an April 1973 memo allowed for ""an automatic 1% tolerance for asbestos."" That would mean talc with up to 10 times the FDA's proposed limit for asbestos in drugs could pass muster.

The same scientist confided in an Oct. 23, 1973, note to a colleague that, depending on what test the FDA adopted for detecting asbestos in cosmetic talc, ""we may have problems.""

The best way to detect asbestos in talc was to concentrate the sample and then examine it through microscopes, the Colorado School of Mines Research Institute told J&J in a Dec. 27, 1973, report. In a memo, a J&J lab supervisor said the concentration technique, which the company's own researchers had earlier used to identify a ""tremolite-type"" asbestos in Vermont talc, had one limitation: ""It may be too sensitive.""

In his email to Reuters, J&J's lawyer said the lab supervisor's concern was that the test would result in ""false positives,"" showing asbestos where there was none.

J&J also launched research to find out how much powder a baby was exposed to during a diapering and how much asbestos could be in that powder and remain within OSHA's new workplace exposure limits. Its researchers had strapped an air sampling device to a doll to take measurements while it was powdered, according to J&J memos and the minutes of a Feb. 19, 1974, meeting of the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA), an industry group.

""It was calculated that even if talc were pure asbestos the levels of exposure of a baby during a normal powdering are far below the accepted tolerance limits,"" the minutes state.

In a Sept. 6, 1974, letter, J&J told the FDA that since ""a substantial safety factor can be expected"" with talc that contains 1 percent asbestos, ""methods capable of determining less than 1% asbestos in talc are not necessary to assure the safety of cosmetic talc.""

Not everyone at the FDA thought that basing a detection method on such a calculation was a good idea. One official called it ""foolish,"" adding, according to a J&J account of a February 1975 meeting: ""No mother was going to powder her baby with 1% of a known carcinogen irregardless of the large safety factor.""

PUSH FOR SELF-REGULATION

Having failed to persuade the FDA that up to 1 percent asbestos contamination was tolerable, J&J began promoting self-policing as an alternative to regulation. The centerpiece of this approach was a March 15, 1976, package of letters from J&J and other manufacturers that the CTFA gave to the agency to show that they had succeeded at eliminating asbestos from cosmetic talc.

""The attached letters demonstrate responsibility of industry in monitoring its talcs,"" the cover letter said. ""We are certain that the summary will give you assurance as to the freedom from contamination by asbestos for materials of cosmetic talc products.""

In its letter, J&J said samples of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 were tested for asbestos, and none was detected ""in any sample.""

J&J didn't tell the FDA about a 1974 test by a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire that turned up asbestos in talc from J&J - ""fiberform"" actinolite, as he put it. Nor did the company tell the FDA about a 1975 report from its longtime lab that found particles identified as ""asbestos fibers"" in five of 17 samples of talc from the chief source mine for Baby Powder. ""Some of them seem rather high,"" the private lab wrote in its cover letter.

Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said the contract lab's results were irrelevant because the talc was intended for industrial use. He said the company now believes that the actinolite the Dartmouth professor found ""was not asbestiform,"" based on its interpretation of a photo in the original lab report.

Just two months after the Dartmouth professor reported his findings, Windsor Minerals Research and Development Manager Vernon Zeitz wrote that chrysotile, ""fibrous anthophyllite"" and other types of asbestos had been ""found in association with the Hammondsville ore body"" - the Vermont deposit that supplied Baby Powder talc for more than two decades.

Zeitz's May 1974 report on efforts to minimize asbestos in Vermont talc ""strongly urged"" the adoption of ways to protect ""against what are currently considered to be materials presenting a severe health hazard and are potentially present in all talc ores in use at this time.""

Bicks said that Zeitz was not reporting on actual test results.

The following year, Zeitz reported that based on weekly tests of talc samples over six months, ""it can be stated with a greater than 99.9% certainty that the ores and materials produced from the ores at all Windsor Mineral locations are free from asbestos or asbestiform minerals.""

""MISREPRESENTATION BY OMISSION""

J&J's selective use of test results figured in a New Jersey judge's decision this year to affirm the first verdict against the company in a case claiming asbestos in J&J products caused cancer. ""Providing the FDA favorable results showing no asbestos and withholding or failing to provide unfavorable results, which show asbestos, is a form of a misrepresentation by omission,"" Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Ana Viscomi said in her June ruling.

""J&J respectfully disagrees with the Judge's comments,"" Bicks said. ""J&J did not withhold any relevant testing from FDA.""

The FDA declined to comment on the ruling.

Lacking consensus on testing methods, the FDA postponed action to limit asbestos in talc. Years later, it did set limits on asbestos in talc used in drugs. It has never limited asbestos in cosmetic talc or established a preferred method for detecting it.

Instead, in 1976, a CTFA committee chaired by a J&J executive drafted voluntary guidelines, establishing a form of X-ray scanning with a 0.5 percent detection limit as the primary test, the method J&J preferred. The method is not designed to detect the most commonly used type of asbestos, chrysotile, at all. The group said the more sensitive electron microscopy was impractical.

The CTFA, which now does business as the Personal Care Products Council, declined to comment.

X-ray scanning is the primary method J&J has used for decades. The company also periodically requires the more sensitive checks with electron microscopes. J&J's lawyer said the company's tests exceed the trade association standard, and they do. He also said that today, J&J's X-ray scans can detect suspect minerals at levels as low as 0.1 percent of a sample.

But the company never adopted the Colorado lab's 1973 recommendation that samples be concentrated before examination under a microscope. And the talc samples that were subjected to the most sensitive electron microscopy test were a tiny fraction of what was sold. For those and other reasons, J&J couldn't guarantee its Baby Powder was asbestos-free when plaintiffs used it, according to experts, including some who testified for plaintiffs.

As early as 1976, Ashton, J&J's longtime talc overseer, recognized as much in a memo to colleagues. He wrote that talc in general, if subjected to the most sensitive testing method, using concentrated samples, ""will be hard pressed in supporting purity claims."" He described this sort of testing as both ""sophisticated"" and ""disturbing.""

""FREE OF HAZARD""

By 1977, J&J appeared to have tamped down concerns about the safety of talc. An internal August report on J&J's ""Defense of Talc Safety"" campaign noted that independent authorities had deemed cosmetic talc products to be ""free of hazard."" It attributed ""this growing opinion"" to the dissemination to scientific and medical communities in the United States and Britain of ""favorable data from the various J&J sponsored studies.""

In 1984, FDA cosmetics chief and former J&J employee Heinz Eiermann reiterated that view. He told the New York Times that the agency's investigation a decade earlier had prompted the industry to ensure that talc was asbestos-free. ""So in subsequent analyses,"" he told the paper, ""we really could not identify asbestos or only on very rare occasions.""

Two years later, the FDA rejected a citizen request that cosmetic talc carry an asbestos warning label, saying that even if there were trace contamination, the use of talc powder during two years of normal diapering would not increase the risk of cancer.

In 1980, J&J began offering a cornstarch version of Baby Powder - to expand its customer base to people who prefer cornstarch, the company says.

The persistence of the industry's view that cosmetic talc is asbestos-free is why no studies have been conducted on the incidence of mesothelioma among users of the products. It's also partly why regulations that protect people in mines, mills, factories and schools from asbestos-laden talc don't apply to babies and others exposed to cosmetic talc - even though Baby Powder talc has at times come from the same mines as talc sold for industrial use. J&J says cosmetic talc is more thoroughly processed and thus purer than industrial talc.

Until recently, the American Cancer Society (ACS) accepted the industry's position, saying on its website: ""All talcum products used in homes have been asbestos-free since the 1970s.""

After receiving inquiries from Reuters, the ACS in early December revised its website to remove the assurance that cosmetic talcs are free of asbestos. Now, it says, quoting the industry's standards, that all cosmetic talc products in the United States ""should be free from detectable amounts of asbestos.""

The revised ACS web page also notes that the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc that contains asbestos as ""carcinogenic to humans.""

Despite the success of J&J's efforts to promote the safety of its talc, the company's test lab found asbestos fibers in samples taken from the Vermont operation in 1984, 1985 and 1986. Bicks said: ""The samples that we know of during this time period that contained a fiber or two of asbestos were not cosmetic talc samples.""

Then, in 1992, three years after J&J sold its Vermont mines, the new owner, Cyprus Minerals, said in an internal report on ""important environmental issues"" in its talc reserves that there was ""past tremolite"" in the Hammondsville deposit. Hammondsville was the primary source of Baby Powder talc from 1966 until its shutdown in 1990.

Bicks rejected the Cyprus report as hearsay, saying there is no original documentation to confirm it. Hammondsville mine records, according to a 1993 J&J memo, ""were destroyed by the mine management staff just prior to the J&J divestiture.""

Bicks said the destroyed documents did not include talc testing records.

In 2002 and 2003, Vermont mine operators found chrysotile asbestos fibers on several occasions in talc produced for Baby Powder sold in Canada. In each case, a single fiber was recorded - a finding deemed ""BDL"" - below detection limit. Bicks described the finding as ""background asbestos"" that did not come from any talc source.

In 2009, the FDA, responding to growing public concern about talc, commissioned tests on 34 samples, including a bottle of J&J Baby Powder and samples of Imerys talc from China. No asbestos was detected.

FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency continues to receive a lot of questions about talc cosmetics. ""I recognize the concern,"" he told Reuters. He said the agency's policing of cosmetics in general - fewer than 30 people regulating a ""vast"" industry - was ""a place where we think we can be doing more.""

Gottlieb said the FDA planned to host a public forum in early 2019 to ""look at how we would develop standards for evaluating any potential risk."" An agency spokeswoman said that would include examining ""scientific test methods for assessment of asbestos.""

""FISHING EXPEDITION""

Before law school, Herschel Hobson worked at a rubber plant. There, his job included ensuring that asbestos in talc the workers were exposed to didn't exceed OSHA limits.

That's why he zeroed in on Johnson's Baby Powder after he took on Darlene Coker as a client in 1997. The lawsuit Coker and her husband, Roy, filed that year against J&J in Jefferson County District Court in Beaumont, Texas, is the earliest Reuters found alleging Baby Powder caused cancer.

Hobson asked J&J for any research it had into the health of its mine workers; talc production records from the mid-1940s through the 1980s; depositions from managers of three labs that tested talc for J&J; and any documents related to testing for fibrous or asbestiform materials.

J&J objected. Hobson's ""fishing expedition"" would not turn up any relevant evidence, it asserted in a May 6, 1998, motion. In fact, among the thousands of documents Hobson's request could have turned up was a letter J&J lawyers had received only weeks earlier from a Rutgers University geologist confirming that she had found asbestos in the company's Baby Powder, identified in her 1991 published study as tremolite ""asbestos"" needles.

Hobson agreed to postpone his discovery demands until he got the pathology report on Coker's lung tissue. Before it came in, J&J asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that Coker had ""no evidence"" Baby Powder caused mesothelioma.

Ten days later, the pathology report landed: Coker's lung tissue contained tens of thousands of ""long fibers"" of four different types of asbestos. The findings were ""consistent with exposure to talc containing chrysotile and tremolite contamination,"" the report concluded.

""The asbestos fibers found raise a new issue of fact,"" Hobson told the judge in a request for more time to file an opposition to J&J's dismissal motion. The judge gave him more time but turned down his request to resume discovery.

Without evidence from J&J and no hope of ever getting any, Hobson advised Coker to drop the suit.

Hobson is still practicing law in Nederland, Texas. When Reuters told him about the evidence that had emerged in recent litigation, he said: ""They knew what the problems were, and they hid it."" J&J's records would have made a ""100% difference"" in Coker's case.

Had the information about asbestos in J&J's talc come out earlier, he said, ""maybe there would have been 20 years less exposure"" for other people.

Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said Coker dropped her case because ""the discovery established that J&J talc had nothing to do with Plaintiff's disease, and that asbestos exposure from a commercial or occupational setting was the likely cause.""

Coker never learned why she had mesothelioma. She did beat the odds, though. Most patients die within a year of diagnosis. Coker held on long enough to see her two grandchildren. She died in 2009, 12 years after her diagnosis, at age 63.

Coker's daughter Crystal Deckard was 5 when her sister, Cady, was born in 1971. Deckard remembers seeing the white bottle of Johnson's Baby Powder on the changing table where her mother diapered her new sister.

""When Mom was given this death sentence, she was the same age as I am right now,"" Deckard said. ""I have it in the back of my mind all the time. Could it happen to us? Me? My sister?"""

K CHANDRASHEKAR RAO, who has won a second stint as Chief Minister of Telangana, has signalled his intent to play a major role in national politics. After his party's victory, KCR announced that he would form a new non-Congress, non-BJP national consortium of regional parties, and pitched once again for more autonomy to the states, suggesting that the Concurrent List be done away with.

As per the Constitution, powers are demarcated as Central, State and Concurrent. While sectors such as defence, aviation, railways and foreign affairs are with the Centre, and those such as municipal administration, transport and health are with the states, the Concurrent List covers subjects in which both the central and state governments have power -- education from primary to university, health and family welfare, science and technology, forest and environment etc.

In calling for doing away with the Concurrent List, KCR stressed the need for decentralisation and devolution of power. ""National parties want to strengthen the Concurrent List so that the Centre has maximum hold over states. In my view, there should be no Concurrent List and state governments should be able to decide what is best for their states,'' he said.

State vs Centre

Some of the areas in which KCR wants a freer hand for states, specifically Telangana:

Advertising

Muslim reservation: Last year, Telangana passed a Bill providing for 12% reservation to Muslims but has been unable to implement it because of a 50% reservation ceiling ordered by the Supreme Court. KCR has said Parliament should pass a law to do away with this cap on reservations, and that the Centre should let the states decide the quantum of reservation.

Primary education: KCR says the Centre should let states decide on issues like primary education. He has questioned why the Centre should decide where a primary school should come up in some corner of Telangana just because it gives funds, or how many teachers should be recruited for a school. The Telangana government has been paying salaries to panchayat school teachers and contract workers after the Centre withdrew funding two years ago.

Urban development: According to KCR, the Centre should not be the one to decide which town to develop in the state with central funds. ""Each state is different. Local leaders would know better which town or city needs development rather than someone sitting in New Delhi,"" he said.

Supreme Court: KCR has even suggested that every state capital should have a Supreme Court, instead of just one in Delhi.

Regional alternative

KCR has said that neither the BJP nor the Congress has been unable to deliver the kind of governance that people expect now. ""There is a dire need for an alternative political party at the national level. People are desperate for it. I will bring together regional parties from across India which will be an alternative to the Congress and the BJP. I am going to give a new definition to the political scenario in this country,"" KCR said.

He said he and his ally, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, would start touring the country to identity regional parties that can be approached to form an alliance. ""There is an acute political crisis in this country and a surgery is urgently required. A revolution is needed in economic and agriculture sectors. There are 15 crore farmers in this country... A high quality change is required in the politics of this country,'' KCR said.

KCR plans to start meeting leaders of regional parties to build the alternative he is thinking of. ""This election is a vindication of our policies and governance. Telangana is a model for the entire country and you will see soon that I will start working towards forming an alternative national party,'' KCR said."

The program was organized by School of Law, University of Kashmir and School of Legal Studies Central University in collaboration with District Legal Services Authority Srinagar from December 14th to 16th at University campus.

The School of Law, University of Kashmir and School of Legal Studies, Central University of Kashmir in collaboration with District Legal Service Authority, Srinagar had organized the two day Internship and Placement Programme in the CCPC Building of University of Kashmir. Seven reputed Law Firms namely Saikrishna and Associates, DSK Legal, L&L Partners Law Offices, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas and Company, Singh and Associates and Nishith Desai Associates counseled the students for three days. Students from School of Law, University of Kashmir, School of Legal Studies, Central University of Kashmir and affiliated law colleges of University of Kashmir participated in this program. Around 50 students are selected for internship and four students got placement.

Sharing her experiences, she said the meaning of Law is not just a career but also a way of life. Law students should be motivated, energized, inspired, meditated, honest, ethical and above all disciplined. They should not confine their search to get jobs in big firms but also explore the options in Judicial and civil service careers.

The Chief Justice reiterated that Lawyers should always stand for the voiceless people like homeless children and marginal people of Kashmir, which means ""Justice to all"" in our constitution. Lawyers are the spokesperson of the community, State and the country. It is imperative to every Law student to know what is happening around the world. He or she should travel outside the State and share experiences other colleagues.

Justice Rajesh Bindal talked about the initiative taken by Chief Justice Gita Mittal, calling all the major Law firms of the Delhi to hold first placement drive and internship opportunities to the Law students of the University of Kashmir. He urged newly recruited law students who will work in New Delhi, to try to bring career opportunities to their other classmates. Vice Chancellor University of Kashmir Talat Ahmad said that this is a historic event where for the first time law firms from New Delhi have come to KU for the placement drive. He said that all this has happened with the help from our Chief Justice Gita Mittal.

The fact-finding teams travelled across Karnataka to meet with survivors and their families, police officers, doctors, lawyers, and some organisations. Those involved in collating information have come up with a set of recommendations for the legislature and political parties, administration, judiciary, police, employers, and individuals.

It has recommended that younger children be taught ways to express discomfort and be aware of danger, while teenagers be taught the more subtle aspects about harassment and consent.

Mallige Sirimane, activist at Peoples Movement against Sexual Assault, said that an important recommendation to the legislature and political parties was to lead by example and prevent politicians accused of sexual assault from contesting elections. Any political or social interference in registering of complaint or in the court procedure should be considered a criminal offence, she said. The report stressed on the need for proper coordination between the many departments concerned with a nodal agency.

Many of the sexual assault survivors and their families spoke at the event. During the study, researchers found that people were made to run from pillar to post to get compensation. To tackle this issue, PMASA has recommended that the State government ensure timely disbursement of victim compensation, with the onus of obtaining the claim to be shifted from the victim or her family to a singular authority and the police when they register the First Information Report."

Thirty-four witnesses were examined during the trial.

The naked body of Sameer Pimple, then a 36-year-old teacher at a zilla parishad school, was found in the bathroom of their first floor Shri Heritage flat in Palghar on July 9, 2015. A case of accidental death was registered by Palghar police.

His wife, Samidha (34), who found the body and her lover, Santosh Sankhe (38), were arrested two weeks later, after an autopsy confirmed death due to strangulation. Samidha was out on bail a year ago but Sankhe stayed in Thane prison.

Palghar court judge S S Gulane found Samidha and Sankhe guilty of murder. The court relied on circumstantial evidence, including CCTV images of Samidha and Sankhe at a nearby mall few minutes after the crime. They were also fined Rs35,000 each.

The couple had married in 2006 and have a son, now 10. The couple reportedly fought over their incompatibility. Sameer knew about Samidha's affair with Sankhe, a family friend and car rental businessman.

She took a half day off from work on the pretext of paying her son's fees on July 9 but came home. Sameer had taken a day off. Offering to perform sadomasochism sex, she used a packaging tape to tie his limbs and mouth. The son was at school.

Sankhe, who was waiting outside, entered and used a plastic bag to suffocate Sameer to death. Samidha held his legs, they undressed Sameer and placed the body in the bathroom. They kept the tap open and left the house. She returned later and informed her in-laws and police.

Public prosecutor Deepak Tare said circumstantial evidence, including call data records, nailed them. Tare said the plastic bag and tape used for the crime were burnt by the two. He said that while Samidha maintained that her husband had suffered a stroke, CCTV footage showed her leaving the house 10 minutes after returning from work. Samidha and Sankhe were also seen in a nearby mall soon after the crime. Tare said the couple's son was not examined during the trial."

Chikara, a Class 12 student at Mother Khazani Convent School in Bawana -- from where the question paper was leaked -- rushed to her house and switched on the television.

""It was all over the news. It was my school. They were my teachers. How did this happen?"" recalled Chikara, adding that the incident took place on her first day of Class 12.

Though Chikara's batch has been allowed to appear for the Board exam to be held in 2019 along with the batch currently pursuing Class 10 from the school, the future of around 1,700 students studying in other classes is ""uncertain"". Reason: the school was de-affiliated by the CBSE after the paper leaked from its premises on March 26.

According to the police, the two teachers had opened the sealed question papers, took photos on their mobile phones and shared them with a tutor in a private coaching centre in Bawana. Later, the school principal was also arrested in connection with the case. The school had approached the Delhi high court against the board's decision. However, it has not received any relief from the court as of now and the matter is sub judice. The next hearing is scheduled on Monday.

Dalbeer Singh, the vice-chairperson of the school, said that as many as 660 students have left the school after the incident. ""The strength of our school has come down from 2,375 to 1,715 in the last seven months. There is a mass exodus from Class 11. Around 50% of students have left after Class 10 this year. There is a sense of uncertainty over the

existence of the school among parents of students studying up to Class 8 and those in Class 10 because they will have to shift to some other school if we do not get a stay from the high court,"" he said.

For Deepanshu Dahiya, a Class 10 student, even the idea of switching schools is ""terrifying"". ""I am studying here in since

Class 5. All my friends and teachers are here. My parents have started shortlisting schools for me but I don't think I will be able to adjust anywhere else easily,"" he said.

Similarly, 13-year-old Palak Rana, a class 8 student at the school, said, ""I have been studying in this school since nursery. Why do I need to suffer because of the deeds of two teachers who are no more a part of our school?"" she said.

Amid the paper leaks, the arrests, the de-affiliation and the court case, the students are the ones who have suffered the most, said Sanjay Singh, Economics teacher at the school. Police had said the two teachers had allegedly shared the leaked paper with their students as well. But Singh denied the claim.

""It's not that the result of our students was bad. The highest score in Economics in 2016-17 was 96% and the overall pass percentage was 90. None of our students had seen the paper before their exam. I don't understand who those teachers were trying to help,"" he said.

Officials said that the school is known for sports activities. ""Our Class 12 student Mohit Jhangra plays for the Under 19 India team which recently won the World Cup. Our students are known for contributions in football and kabbadi. The CBSE held its All India Kabaddi Tournament at our campus in 2016. We have grounds and space for every sport here. If the school loses the affiliation, all this would have been in vain,"" said Dalbeer Singh.

While officials of CBSE denied comment saying that the matter is ""sub judice"", those at the Delhi government's Directorate of Education (DoE) said that they are looking into the matter. ""The directorate had issued a show cause notice to which a reply has been received. An inquiry is underway,"" said a DoE official.

Meanwhile, Singh said that if the school gets a stay from the court, it will never apply for the board examination centre again. ""We can't revert whatever has already happened here. Because of two persons, the future of around 1,700 students and 100 teaching and non-teaching staff members are at stake. We, too, are apprehensive about being an examination centre again. I hope that those who did the crime are punished and the students spared,"" he said."

India's romance with cola did not start with ""Yehi hai right choice, baby, aha"". It began with a punchline that didn't really say anything, but managed to convey light-hearted fun - ""The zing thing"".

Long before Fanta or Mirinda domination, the reigning queen of the orange soda market was Parle's Gold Spot. For obvious reasons, it was a favourite among children.

""We were fond of Gold Spot. Although Coca-Cola was very famous those days, it was a sharp and fizzy drink, which left a bitter taste in our mouth. Gold Spot was sweet and I can recall myself standing in front of the mirror with our mouths wide open and tongue sticking out, both stained with orange colour,"" said Anjana Trivedi, 45.

But Gold Spot did not just conquer the children's segment, it also wanted to capture the youth market with stylish advertisements that showed young fashionable bell-bottomed men and young women dancing. Commercials also showed young couples skating and jiving in a cafeteria. The simple message in the jingle was: He is crazy about me, and she is crazy about me, and both are as crazy as they are for Gold Spot.

""Whenever I pass by the Parle factory in Mumbai, I go back to my school days. My school once organised a Gold Spot factory tour as part of the annual picnic. And when we sat back in the bus, our lips were stained with orange colour,"" recalled Sanket Chaturvedi, a 53-year-old banker.

Gold Spot's owner Ramesh Chauhan, the chairman of Parle Products, bitterly opposed the entry of American cola companies in the late 1980s. He also owned Thums Up and Limca. Till then, Gold Spot ruled the market with its innovative ads and a good understanding of its demographic.

""Some years after the launch of Gold Spot, the company faced some problem with its flavour. They decided to introduce a minor change in the flavour and called us to design the campaigns,"" said Prahlad Kakkar, the celebrated adman who created both ""The zing thing"" and ""Yehi hai right choice baby, aha"" punchlines.

Kakkar shot an advertisement, which would also talk about the company's product Limca.

""The ad was shot in a college canteen and we wanted a funny looking fellow to talk about 'Limca' and then say, 'Oops, I forgot, it's a Gold Spot campaign',"" Kakkar recalled.

""The idea was vague and as presumed, it turned out to be a tough task for the entire team as Ramesh [Chauhan] was not sure about it. He said, 'How can we talk about Limca here, it's silly.' After a lot of back and forth, he was convinced. After all, we wanted something silly to get noticed.""

In the 1940s, Mumbai-based food company Parle was known for a popular brand of glucose biscuits, Parle Gluco or Parle-G as we know it. To cash in on its established brand equity, in 1949, Parle ventured into the cola market with 'Gluco Cola'. Known for its sharp marketing campaigns, the company hired legendary cartoonist, R.K. Laxman, to design the advertisements. The tagline was ""India's first cola"".

But the brand faced several hiccups after its take off. Soft drink behemoth Coca-Cola entered India one year after the launch of Gluco Cola, and took offence over the similar-sounding brand name and even threatened to go to court. Parle renamed its brand to 'Parle Cola', but Coca-Cola was still unhappy. Parle decided to discontinue its cola brand in 1951.

In 1952, Parle came back and launched an orange-flavoured fizzy beverage Gold Spot, which was named after its popular peppermint product called Parle Gold Star. It established Gold Spot and lemon-based Limca (from limbu-ka) as successful brands, and never chose to introduce any cola drink. It positioned Limca as a 'zero bacteria' health drink for the upwardly mobile youth and Gold Spot became a drink for children. But soon Parle began to cede ground to the giant brand Coca-Cola.

Gold Spot tried to reinvent its image later to appeal to the young and hired a model in its advertisements, who was none other than Rekha.

The print ad featuring a very young Rekha in a bright orange top with a floral print and had a tagline, ""Get a taste of something fresh: Livva little hot, sippa Gold Spot"".

""This campaign marked the shift of Rekha from the south Indian film industry to Bollywood. It was directed by Shyam Benegal, and in no time, the face of the model and tagline became the talk of the town,"" said Kakkar.

In 1975, the Emergency was imposed, which impacted the market for soft drinks. People cut down on picnics and parties. Deep-pocketed Coca-Cola survived the slowdown, but Parle was hit badly after huge investments on bottling facilities.

""But we should take pride considering that Coca-Cola was a behemoth, they had humongous financial support and Gold Spot gave it a tough competition through its well strategised promotional campaign and unique flavour,"" said Santosh Sood, former chief operating officer of advertising house, Rediffusion Y&R, who also handled Gold Spot's promotions.

However, in 1977, Coca-Cola left India, protesting the government's new regulations. When the full-blown 'cola wars' began again with the entry of Pepsi (1990) and re-entry of Coca-Cola (1993), Parle sold out to Coke reportedly for $40 million.

Soon, Coca-Cola discontinued Gold Spot and launched its own brands -- Sprite and Fanta."

Quashing the FIR, the court further asked the police to arrange for psychological counselling of the boys so they are groomed to be good citizens.

Psychologists are of the opinion that the families of the boys need to be counselled, too. This, they say, is a rampant social issue and concerns not just an individual but the society at large.

According to case details Sarfaraz Agha, 15, abused and assaulted Suleiman Ansari, 18, for fat shaming him. Both the boys are residents of and the incident took place outside a . The matter escalated and Sarfaraz assaulted Suleiman.

The minor's father even allegedly threatened to kill Suleiman's father. Based on Suleiman's version, the police lodged an FIR against Sarfaraz and his father Rafiq and booked them under IPC Sections 323 and 504. Later, the feuding parties arrived at a compromise since they live in the same locality, and filed a petition in HC seeking to quash the FIR.

When the petition came up for hearing before Justice Gokani, she sought to know the reason behind the aggressive behaviour of the two boys. The boys turned up with their parents in the court on November 30.

Sarfaraz, the minor, told the court that Suleiman teased him by calling him 'fat'. He told the judge that he was unable to control his anger and abused Suleiman right back. When Suleiman retaliated, Sarfaraz's father Rafiq slapped him repeatedly.

'Dropout should resume school' Asked about his education, Suleiman, 18, told the judge that he dropped out of school after failing Class 10 exam. He said he had no interest in studies, found it difficult to concentrate on books and was helping his uncle in business.

After talking to the boys, the judge decided to drop charges against minor Sarfaraz. She observed that Sarfaraz needed to undergo anger management and counselling sessions while Suleiman should complete his schooling. The court entrusted the responsibility of the same to the investigating officer of Valsad police.

""Arrange training of both the boys in a reputed institute of yoga for a period of eight weeks (on weekends) and if necessary, they shall also be given the sessions of consultation by child psychologist/educationalists,"" court directed, and sought a compliance report in three months.

The court asked the investigating officer to speak to the principal and teachers of the school where Suleiman studied and refer him to the medical board to ascertain if he suffered from dyslexia. ""Speak to the principal and teachers of the school last attended by Suleiman to find out about his disinterest in studies as part of his social policing; if necessary, refer him to the Medical Board to find out whether he is suffering from or any other disability and do the needful in the matter in consultation with his parents,"" the court order stated.

The high court also directed the police to make all attempts and provide assistance to Suleiman to complete schooling and stated that District Legal Authority could render assistance to police if required.

Sarfaraz's lawyer expressed his gratitude towards the court following the order. ""Words fall short in expressing gratitude and appreciation for the concern shown and the efforts made by the court with regard to future prospects of the children,"" said Nasir Saiyad, lawyer.

Dr V M Thakur, a child psychiatrist, said this was a rampant problem and not related to any individual but to the society. Thakur said, ""Punishing boys or sending them for yoga sessions or counselling would not solve the problem. The family of the boys should teach them tolerance. It is a trend in the society to punish those who did wrong. So we need to focus on making the society better.""

""This case represents a social problem. I wish the court had included recommendation of family counselling.

The family is the unit of the society, not the individual,"" he added. Behaviour issues mainly because of dyslexia, lack of confidence, inability of others (teachers, parents, peers) to understand genuine difficulties of students lead to frustration and anger issues, said Iti Shukla, psychologist.

""This is also related to a societal problem. Some parents teach children 'maar khake nahi aaneka, maar ke aaneka (thrash the one that beats you), so gradually kids start doing it. The society is also responsible as it teaches that one must punish those who do wrong,"" Shukla said.

""Due to all these problems selfimage goes down and if others tease/bully, teenagers find difficult to control anger,"" she added."

""We remove waste dumped along the beach every day,"" said an official from the zone. He added that area behind St Bedes School in Santhome has been earmarked for building a fish market. He, however, added that they were clueless about who was dumping C&D waste along the beach. ""Fish vendors encroaching road space can be removed only after the fish market is ready. Work on the market will begin in a week,"" said another corporation official.

K Bharathi of the fishermen South Indian Fishermen Association said construction debris was being dumped by third parties in collusion with the corporation officials."

However, a division bench of Justices S Manikumar and Subramonium Prasad made it clear it is the duty of the authorities to ensure proper maintenance and that no nuisance is created due to such dumping yards. The court made the observations while dismissing a PIL moved by MGM Nagar Nala Munnetra Sangam, based in Thiruvallur district. The petitioner wanted the court to restrain the district administration from constructing a dump yard in the park area of MGM Nagar, Rajaji Salai, Thiruvallur.

Noting that it is not open to the municipality to utilise the 8.75 acres of park for solid waste management plant, the petitioner submitted that the residents had purchased the land with an idea that there will be a park which could be used for children to play.

""Construction of the municipal solid waste management plant would cause nuisance to the people living in the area and to over 6,000 students studying in the school located there. Besides this, there is a danger of diseases spreading in the area,"" the petitioner said.

Responding to the plea, Thiruvallur municipal commissioner submitted that the population of the municipality has increased manifold because of which the quantity of waste has increased. To handle the situation, various steps have been taken towards proper disposal of the waste as per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.

""In furtherance of the duty of the municipality to collect and properly dispose of the solid waste, the municipality has set up four micro compost plants in the municipal area. The park has an area of 38,720sqft, out of which only 3,000sqft has been earmarked for the plant. Waste collected from the surrounding area would be brought to the compost unit and would be subjected to a scientific process and there will be no odour and it will not attract insects as apprehended by the petitioner,"" the commissioner said.

Recording the submissions, the bench said, ""Having a proper waste management program is one of the biggest challenges which is being faced by any municipality. Courts can take judicial notice of the increase in the industrial, commercial and residential waste. Due to rapid urbanisation, virtually no space is available for dumping waste. The municipalities have, therefore, to balance the competing interests of having parks/ lung space on one hand and dumping yards on the other hand."""

Only from the portrait hanging at home did I know the handsome, immaculately dressed old man with twinkling eyes, beaming smile and bushy mustachios. However, fond recollections by three generations of family members made him an intimate presence in my life. This man lived in a small town where he did nothing but hold court before spellbound listeners. Exactly what he did when he came on periodic visits to our home in old Madras.

It will be hard for people living today to believe that his sole subject of discourse was Tamil poetry. TK Chidambaranatha Mudaliar (TKC) had given up a lucrative career in law, and political prominence in the Justice Party, to do nothing but enjoy poetry, and share what he read with others. Among his listeners were writers, thinkers and legendary renaissance artists like MS Subbulakshmi, Balasaraswati and Rukmini Devi. Rajaji was his close friend and consulted him on matters literary. Mahatma Gandhi was charmed by his narrative as was Jawaharlal Nehru, who hosted him in his prime ministerial home in Delhi.

TKC remained the elder statesman of our family even though he belonged to a different caste and community, with some affiliations to a political party that my freedom fighting clan opposed. Yet my grandparents did nothing - from launching a nationalist magazine, to fixing a daughter's marriage - without consulting him.

TKC's impact was not confined to bigwigs. My grandma had never stepped into a school. However, as she made dosa, ground chutney or churned curd, she made her kitchen ring with songs from ancient and medieval Tamil. Infected by this Tamil poetry mania, my mother never failed to pepper her lectures and complaints with admonitory verses from irascible Tamil bards. She could also reel off romantic stanzas from Kamban's Ramayana and moving pleas by innumerable saint poets.

What I most loved from this selection were witty verses about poets themselves and about the nature of poetry: ""One day a destitute poet found a woman who gave him a pot of what she called ""buttermilk"". The poet burst into a song of gratitude, not without honesty. ""O delicious nectar!"" he exclaimed. ""Floating in the skies you were named cloud, when you drenched the earth you were called rain. In the hands of this good, generous lady you have acquired a new name: Buttermilk!"" Another anonymous poet sings about how, just before entering the munificent art patron's home, he had bid goodbye to his lifelong companion: Poverty. A clever man seeking rewards from a rich donor? Yes, but doesn't the poem also contrast destitution (suffering, attrition, ignorance, darkness) with generosity (unselfish sharing, supporting talent, protecting the weak, upholding truth, commitment to goodness, spreading light)?

Tamils had always personified their language as a goddess of unmatched beauty and power, but with rising politicians in independent India, the deity became an omnipotent symbol to assert Dravida identity. English was the enemy, Hindi was the tool of the North to subjugate the South. A frenzied Tamil rhetoric was promoted by the Dravida movement led by CN Annadurai and M Karunanidhi. A new, aggressive poetic discourse sloganeered their ideology, dominating the lives of the Tamils through drama and cinema. The drumming was loud and direct.

But I remembered a different strain of poetry, detailed by TKC, also centre staging Tamil, but with subtle image and nuanced metaphor. A connoisseur king insists on hearing his own elegy composed by the minstrel he adores, even though he knows that if recited in his presence, the poem would turn into a spell of death. Isn't this life-risking, protective passion for his culture and for his people? Then there's the poet Avvai who welcomes three great kings to her granddaughter's wedding. Her royal guests demand off-season palm fruit for lunch. Undaunted, Avvai orders the lampstand carved from a palm tree trunk to ""sprout leaves and bear fruit!"" Her impeccable verse achieves the goal. No one takes these stories literally. The metaphors underscore the power of poetry: To destroy and to rejuvenate.

TKC's published writings and personal letters say, ""A writer can make us empathise with characters we like as well as dislike. Literature performs transformational magic to make us understand the good and the bad, so that we acquire culture, which is essentially tolerance, fostering world harmony.""

I finally understand why Tamil Nadu venerates poetry and believes that temples are sanctified not by rituals alone, but when poets write verses about them. Here the magnificent Thanjavur temple attracts tourists, but even little temples where great poets sang draw pilgrims. Why? Because the ancient Tamils knew that you can access your culture through the best expressions in your mother tongue. Such poetry strengthens you to cherish your heritage, but also to appreciate other cultures, other languages, other peoples -- beyond your horizon."

As reported by TOI earlier, excess teachers in Nagpur district have been transferred to different schools, within the district, where vacancies exist. But not all teachers have joined their new postings.

The education department has sent a letter to all such teachers, warning them of salary loss. A separate letter was sent to principals of those schools that have refused to allow these teachers to join their new postings. The principals have been told that their post will be de-recognized which ultimately will lead to stoppage of salary from government coffers.

There are just over 700 excess teachers in Nagpur, who have been now given new postings at least on paper. The department has not yet shared details of how many teachers are yet to join, as it is giving some time to everyone to complete the formalities.

The separate letters to teachers and principals were needed because in some cases it is the teachers who do not want to shift to a new school while at other places it is the school that does not wish to appoint them.

Some of the teachers do not want to join other schools either because of distance or unfamiliarity. In some cases, school management feel the government is infringing on their right to appoint teachers.

A principal, on condition of anonymity, said, ""The education department's letter seeks to deal with us like Hitler did in Germany. This dictatorial attitude will not work and I am sure our management will take this matter to court."""

The parents had earlier filed a case against the school with the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (MSCPCR) against their alleged illegalities.

The school is issuing consent forms to be filled by parents to seek their approval for the vaccination but has not given the same to the twins. One of the grieving parents of the two children studying in class 3 said, ""Despite the case still pending in the MSCPCR, the school has declared that my children are not bona fide students of the school and did not give them any stationary, identity cards, calendar of the school etc, which is a violation of child rights. A few days ago, the school gave consent forms to all the children but did not give the same to my children. They were told by their class teacher that they will not be given MR vaccination. I am wondering if MR vaccination is a government scheme or the school's personal scheme.""

According to the parent, the school was pulled up by the Child Rights Commission for charging advance fees, making their children sit in a separate classroom for not having paid the fees, telling them that PTA is illegal etc. Despite this, the school this year sent a letter to the parents that their children are not bona fide students of the school and will not be allowed to participate in any school activities like sports day, annual day etc. The kids are only allowed to attend the school and sit for examination, the parent said.

Siddharth Sharma, advocate for the parents, said, ""The school has challenged MSCPCR recommendation by filing a writ petition in Bombay High Court. But there is no stay order on child rights recommendation to school. Despite all recommendations to school in favour of parents, the school is continuing to harass children by denying them their rights and now by denying them MR vaccination. We will send a notice to the BMC education department to be present to ensure these children are also given vaccination or else we will file a case against the BMC and the matter will also be presented in front of the Child Rights Commission.""

Despite repeated attempts, the school officials were unavailable for comments. When contacted, Dr Mangesh Rajadhyaksha, vice-president of the management committee said he has no documents in front of him to comment on the issue."""
