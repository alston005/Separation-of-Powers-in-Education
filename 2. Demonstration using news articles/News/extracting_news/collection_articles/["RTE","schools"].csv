(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

To maintain uniformity in admissions under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS)/ Disadvantaged Group (DG) category for entry-level classes in all private unaided recognised schools of Delhi except minority schools, the Directorate of Education will conduct the process online from the 2019-20 session onwards.

A circular released by the DoE has asked all district-level officers to verify and update the list of all private unaided schools in Delhi along with their GPS coordinates. Schools have been given time till Thursday to check EWS/DG vacancies and update the information in case of any discrepancy from the records available with the DoE.

""If no representation is received from the school concerned, then it will be presumed that the data available with the DoE is correct and students will be allotted accordingly through computerised draw of lots. Thereafter, school shall not deny admission, "" added the DoE circular.

It added in case admission is denied once it has been allotted by draw of lots, necessary action will be taken against the school.

The category existed in previous years. However, the department of public instruction (DPI) says it's not necessary and provides ample room for misuse.

December 10 was the last date for furnishing the relevant information online. But the schools couldn't meet the deadline and on Thursday, they were given another 10 days to comply.

The online form includes various heads under which schools can quantify their expenditure. Teachers' salary, transport and dearness allowance, salary of other staff, contingency, rent, building maintenance, consumables for lab, electricity and water are the heads provided this year.

Stating that not failing students from Class 1 to Class 8, under the Right to Education Act, is impacting them negatively, Union human resources development minister Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday said they plan to tweak the no-detention policy.

The no-detention policy was introduced under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009. In 2010, it stipulated that schools cannot fail students from Class 1 to Class 8.

""Not failing students till Class 8 has led to poor quality of education. So far, 25 states have demanded a change. Taking note of this, the HRD ministry came up with a bill to amend the RTE Act to allow schools to conduct examinations in Class 5 and Class 8. Those who fail the exams in March will get an opportunity to clear the exam two months later. Those who fail the second time will not be promoted to the next standard,"" said Javadekar, at the inauguration of the Maharashtra International Education Board (MIEB), an education board set up to give quality education in Marathi.

The ministry also plans to introduce a digital board in educational institutions to form 15 lakh digital classrooms in the next three years. A digital classroom is a technology-enabled classroom where student learning and interaction is supported through strategic use of information and communication technologies. ""The digital classrooms will be for Class 9 to post-graduate students,"" Javadekar said.

On December 20, DoE had issued the fourth circular to invite applications for such seats from December 22.

In the meanwhile, admissions for entry-level classes for the 2019-20 session for general category seats have already begun and the process for reserved seats is set to start by the first week of January.

Following a Delhi high court order, DoE had in July notified 3% reservation for CWSN within the 25% seats reserved for the economically weaker sections in compliance with provisions of Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016.

When the first online application was invited, DoE received just 46 applications (3%) for the vacant CWSN seats. The draw of lots was subsequently postponed on account of such low applications. In the second round held in September, DoE finally conducted the draw of lots and admitted 17 students. A fourth circular was finally issued on December 20 to call for fresh applications.

""Despite inviting online applications, 1,268 seats are still vacant. Hence, the department has decided to call for fresh applications from aspirants with disabilities as defined in RPWD Act, 2016 against these reserved available seats,"" said the DoE order.

The details of the schools where seats are vacant were notified by DoE on December 22 and the applications can be filled till December 24. The draw of lots is likely to be held on December 26.

The official document accessed by TOI mentions that skewed admissions have taken place because ""schools are hesitant in accepting"" such students. The district deputy education (DDE) officers have been asked to ensure that no children with special needs are turned away.

Disability rights activists said that schools have been denying admissions as they don't have the requisite facilities to make CWSN students inclusive.

Abha Khetarpal, a counsellor and disability rights activist, said, ""The 3% quota is complete eyewash as the authorities don't check on the schools. The CBSE checklist for schools to become inclusive includes facilities like accessible washrooms, smart boards, etc, but schools don't abide by the norms. There is no mechanism to take action on violations. Moreover, the special educators are not qualified. They are not even equipped to handle a child with epilepsy.""

The PIL for reservation of CWSN was filed in 2014 by the father of a child with special needs. In his plea, he had claimed that the guidelines under Right to Education (RTE) Act completely ignore the interests of children with special needs and disabilities."

Right To Education (RTE) helpline was launched recently by the Social Welfare Department of Karnataka, which allows one to lodge complaints and get information on the Act. The Executive Director of the Child Rights Trust, Vasudeva Sharma, spoke to RadioActive about how the helpline could be used effectively.

Vasudeva Sharma explained that the RTE Act had been introduced way back in 2009 in Karnataka, and a lot of calls used to be received by the Child Rights Trust members on their personal numbers seeking clarifications. Even though there were no instructions available regarding RTE at that time, they used to clarify or give information in a comprehensible way. Of late, the calls had been about more specific and less common information.

He said they had attempted to set up a hotline back then, which failed because their personal numbers were still popular. The new helpline would have to have employees well-versed in the intricacies of RTE - the national Act as well as the rules for Karnataka and section (12)(1)(C), because (12)(1)(C) was often misused.

He spoke about the dangers of (12)(1)(C) being misused and despite it having popular aspects like forbidding corporal punishment, or stating the kinds of facilities an institution must have, how that could cause people to lose trust in it. It gave the impression that (12)(1)(C) was introduced as an attempt to control private institutions, as the condition laid down for availing this provision spoke only of what was expected of the institutions without placing any responsibility on the government. With the rampant misuse of this section, private institutions became richer but could not be brought under the control - and that such situations would lead to mistrust in the RTE Act itself.

Vasudeva Sharma said that he used to find a lot of children in government schools, but of late the number had been dwindling because they had moved to private schools. However, over time, parents were faced with demands for multiple additional payments. This at times forced the children back into government schools, and other times, they continued education there despite the heavy expenditure.

He also proposed some solutions:

On the move to make 8th standard the equivalent of 10th standard, Vasudeva Sharma said that though there had been discussions, the Central Government was yet to make a decision. He opined that it could not be taken without thorough discussions and analysis but was apprehensive about the imbalance a positive answer would create.

Vasudeva Sharma said that ignorance among activists and officials will deprive the children of the rights extended to them by the government. He suggested that guidelines be prepared wherein the responsibilities of each official is clearly mentioned and that such clarity would enable effective implementation of the Act.

He added that ignorance causes lack of coordination between the concerned departments and organisations, which could lead to failure of the programme."

This is forcing the schools to discontinue the admissions of a few students from the Open category.

Even as admissions for pre-primary sections began in October, many schools in the city are not assuring promotion to selected children from senior kg to the 1st grade. As a result, aggrieved parents are running from one school to another to seek admission for their children.

A parent from South Mumbai said, ""Earlier, the school would give admission forms which the parents would take home to fill them up and submit the next day. But, now the schools are asking parents to fill the forms the same day in the school itself, and return them immediately. This is all because they don't want parents to click pictures of the admission forms and send it to the media to expose them.

There is no doubt that the school education sector is beset with huge problems. However, whether the dismal performance is on account of policy gap or there are other factors that are responsible for the current state of affairs is a moot point.

Let us first try to understand what has not happened in the education sector. Why has it not happened? And, how can it happen (whether through policy intervention or otherwise)?

Two things have certainly happened during the current millennium. The infrastructure (school buildings) has shown remarkable improvement though there is still a long way to go. And, thanks to the mid-day-meal, we have managed to get the child to the school.

However, what is appalling is the poor quality of education that is imparted in most of the government schools. This is evidenced by the fact that the learning outcomes have actually come down during the past decade despite enormous amount of investments. The number of teachers has gone up substantially and the average pupil-teacher ratio comes close to the required levels.

However, this does not solve the problem of quality. To begin with, a large number of teachers are not qualified to teach, yet they are teaching. According to a rough estimate, out of eight million teachers around 1.4 million fall in this category. Politics has seeped into this cadre in the most insidious manner resulting in skewed distribution of teachers in most of the States as the tendency is to hang in and around urban areas.

The Right to Education Act did precious little on this front. In fact, the legislation made the task of delivering quality education complex and difficult. The focus of the Act is primarily on 'inputs' (like infrastructure) rather than 'outcomes'. It has created an adversarial role between 'public' and 'private' schools. The Act mandates under Section 12(1)(c) that even private schools ""shall admit in Class I, to the extent of at least 25 per cent of the strength of that class, children belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group."" The manner in which reimbursement is to be provided has created a number of problems.

The norms and standards prescribed in the schedule for a school are far removed from ground reality. What is perhaps desirable has been made mandatory. This has resulted in a phenomenal increase in the number of teachers. During 2015-16, there were 39,608 government schools that had less than 10 children but each school was mandated to have minimum of two teachers.

The budget private schools, most of whom are doing a great job in imparting education, are under enormous pressure to meet the prescribed standards or face closure. No attempt was made while enacting this legislation to look at the ground reality.

The consequences have been disastrous. On an average, an amount of around ₹10,000 per child gets spent in government schools. The budget schools do it for much less and impart as good, if not better, education. Unfortunately, the focus so far has primarily been on regulation (legislations are perhaps meant for that) and not on development of the private sector. Consequently, even after eight years of enactment, the country is none the better than what it was.

The RTE Act has done more damage to delivery of education. Section 16 of the Act provides that ""No child admitted in a school shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till completion of elementary education.""

The 'expulsion' part can be understood but not holding back a child in a class has meant that a large number of children are getting promoted without acquiring the necessary attributes. The model of 'no detention' was apparently picked up from the West and transplanted in this country without taking into account the objective conditions obtaining here.

Yet again, the consequences have been devastating as there is a huge bottleneck getting created at Class X where the pass percentage has plummeted. The States were not even given freedom to take a call on the issue. The government has subsequently decided to provide an option to the States and the amendment is under consideration of Parliament.

A new Education Policy is round the corner. However, what needs to be understood is whether there is a need for a policy to address the issues that afflict school education. Most of the action relating to education lies in the States. In any case, the country is too diverse to consider a single mandate by way of policy for the entire country. If a teacher does not go to a school in Kerala, he could well be ""lynched"" but in some of the States of northern India, they consider it their right not to go to the school. There are instances of these regular teachers employing a ""substitute"" to represent them and even teach on their behalf.

What is actually required is an action plan clearly outlining: What needs to be done? How it will be done? Who will do it? And, by when it will be done? The roles of respective entities should be clearly defined so that the performance can be assessed. One has often wondered why should only the Centre assess the performance of States? Why can't it be the other way round?

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education. The entire value chain needs to be looked at, understood and interventions clearly outlined. Beginning with pre-service training, to selection process, to in-service training, to transfer and posting, to engagement of teachers in non-educational activities, to their promotional avenues and morale will need to be looked at.

An action plan for each State will have to be worked out in detail, clearly outlining the roles of the Centre and the respective State government. Intervention for each State will vary from State to State. Unlike the present dispensation, there will have to be sufficient flexibility in the central schemes to accommodate the differences among States. The whole approach has to be outcome based rather than input based as has been the case so far.

Our country has been obsessed with the western world. We had looked at Finland, England, Scotland, Holland and all the lands of the world but not at motherland. A lot of wonderful work is being done within the country but has so far gone unnoticed. ""Policy"" cannot help in this regard.

What needs to be done is to facilitate identification, understanding and scaling of successful practices. If these home-grown practices have succeeded in the prevalent objective conditions, the chances of their replication and scaling are pretty high as compared to an 'imported' idea or practice.

What is also required is to learn from States, like Rajasthan, that have turned it around through some remarkable State level interventions both administrative and financial.

Policy debates provide food for intellectual stimulation but what matters is what is done on the ground. Hence, the dire need for an action plan."

This programme subsumes the three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). It is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. It envisages the 'school' as a continuum from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to senior secondary levels. The States/UTs are assisted by the central government to implement the Samagra Shiksha as a programme for providing universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social category gaps in education and enhancement of learning level of children at all levels of school education.

The major interventions under the scheme are: (i) Universal Access including Infrastructure Development and Retention; (ii) Gender and Equity; (iii) Inclusive Education; (iv) Quality; (v) Financial support for Teacher Salary; (vi) Digital initiatives; (vii) Entitlements under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 including uniforms, textbooks etc.;(viii) Pre-school Education; (ix) Vocational Education; (x) Sports and Physical Education; and (xi) Strengthening of Teacher Education and Training. The main emphasis of the Scheme is on improving quality of school education and the strategy of all interventions would be to enhance the Learning Outcomes at all levels of schooling.

The major features of Samagra Shiksha are as under:-

Preference for opening of new school is given to tribal areas, and areas with high concentration of Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and minority population. The districts with high concentration of population of SCs, STs and Muslims have been identified as Special Focus Districts (SFDs) for ensuring equity and inclusion at all levels of school education. Provisions have also been made for 1020 residential schools/hostels for children living in sparsely populated areas, children living in areas where schools cannot be opened due to unavailability of land and children in need of care and protection.

The RTE Act also provides for Special Training for age-appropriate admission of out-of-school children including children of disadvantaged groups in urban and rural areas. Approval has been given for special training of 8.08 lakh children with the financial outlay of Rs. 56353.95 lakh in 2018-19.

During 2018-19 an amount of Rs. 19668.26 crore has been released (as on 30.11.2018) to States/UTs as central share against the total Budget of Rs. 30891.81 crore for implementation of various interventions under Samagra Shiksha."

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

He said IIM Bangalore has also expressed willingness for a study of the reorganization process and its benefit."

Thereafter I'll write a TOI blog post on this topic.

Who are these economists?

Thirteen senior economists, including former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and Sajjid Chinoy of JP Morgan. Others are: Abhijit Banerjee, Pranjul Bhandari, Maitreesh Ghatak, Amartya Lahiri, Neelkanth Mishra, Prachi Mishra, Karthik Muralidharan, Rohini Pande, Eswar Prasad and E. Somanathan.

Unfortunately, I've not heard of any of these economists apart from Raghuram Rajan and read none of them before. I read only the world's best economists (with Hayek and Friedman being my benchmark), and no Indian economist comes in that category. And given what these economists have produced in this report, I will not be reading their work anyway.

In this report, they're OK on labour reforms, ordinary on most issues and pretty hopeless on agriculture, education and healthcare. Most importantly, they have totally missed governance reforms although they repeatedly point out the massive failure of government in every field. A major blind spot these economists need to fix.

The Imperative for Strong, Equitable, and Sustainable Growth

India is one of the fastest growing large countries in the world, having grown at an average of almost 7 percent for the last 25 years. There have been many notable reforms over this period - most recently, the co-operative fiscal federalism that has brought the Goods and Services Tax into being, the enactment of the Indian Bankruptcy Code, and the dramatic dis-inflation of recent years, partly as a result of a move to an inflation targeting regime.

While commendable, we should not be satisfied with this. India is still one of the poorest countries in the G-20, and poor countries ought to grow faster because catch-up growth is easier. As important, the benefits of growth in India have been distributed extremely unequally, with top incomes rising much faster than the rest. [Sanjeev: The real issue remains extreme poverty] We have seen new environmental challenges, in the form of sharp increases in both local pollution levels and in CO2 emissions [Sanjeev: CO2 emissions are GOOD, not bad] that, if unchecked, threaten to stall or reverse progress. India is also not creating enough jobs: even though data on employment in India are both low quality and controversial, the recent news that 28 million applied for 90,000 low level railway jobs suggests we are not satisfying the demand for jobs.1 Unfortunately, we are not well-positioned to follow the export-led growth path that allowed many Asian countries to climb out of poverty. Despite abundant cheap labor, we are not part of many global supply chains. Even as global firms seek to diversify away from China so as to reduce political risk, India is rarely seen as an obvious alternative. [That's because socialism has messed up everything in India]

Given India's continental size, it need not follow the export-led path. It will, however, have to ensure that growth generates jobs and incomes across the skill spectrum, in the process

There are tremendous possibilities for reforms that will take us towards faster and more equitable growth, as this report will lay out. However, we have to allocate scarce resources carefully to make sure that there is enough investment in sectors such as infrastructure to create jobs. India's aggregate fiscal deficit (state plus center) is still close to 6.5 percent of GDP, higher than almost any in the G-20, and not significantly lower than levels that existed five years ago. However, our investment rate has fallen sharply in recent years. Despite that, our external financing requirement (as measured by the current account deficit) increased appreciably earlier this year, increasing vulnerability. Moreover, to the extent that India grows while being more reliant on domestic demand than were other Asian emerging markets, it needs a much greater focus on macroeconomic stability than they did. For all these reasons, it needs to prioritize government spending better, focusing on filling clear investment gaps and protecting the vulnerable. It also needs to increase revenues by making the tax system more progressive both in taxes levied as well as through more effective collection from rich non-payers, by bringing more people into the tax net, and by charging users for government services where appropriate.

A key factor in spurring growth will be reforms that alleviate ""supply side"" constraints on growth and job creation. We have to enable both the industrial sector as well as the service sector to operate at larger scale. This involves embracing highly overdue labor reforms including allowing for a rich menu of contracts with workers that allow for more possibilities than just permanent workers and short term contractual labor in firms [Agree]. Such additional contracting possibilities could give workers more job security, give firms the incentive to train and invest in their skilling, even while giving firms more reason to scale up. Similarly, cleaner title to land, as well as a land acquisition process that protects the seller while simplifying acquisition, will reduce the cost of developing land, a critical need if we are to create jobs [Agree, but these economists should ask why Indian governance system can't perform this most basic function]. A more predictable and better regulatory environment - which prunes redundant or unnecessary regulation, carefully sets regulations in new areas necessitated by our development, and enforces regulations effectively and impartially - will create a much better environment for business. We must also improve the capabilities as well as strengthen the independence of our regulatory institutions. [Agree, but why is India's governance in such a mess even today?]

Scale is also key for productivity growth which, in turn, is essential for India to expand its share of world exports. The ongoing reorientation of the United States away from dependence on China provides India with a great opportunity to position itself as a viable alternative for cheap sourcing of goods and parts. But this would require macro and industrial policy reforms of the kind just outlined that remove existing impediments to India becoming a valued partner in global supply chains. Rolling back the recent increases in import tariffs along with a renewed commitment to resisting protective policies would be a good way of signaling this goal. [Agree]

In outlining an economic agenda, we have to recognize government capacity is limited - the number of government employees is often low relative to the tasks they are assigned [Sanjeev: TOTALLY DISAGREE here. The issue is SHEER AND TOTAL INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION]. This is often compounded by low staff motivation and relatedly high absenteeism, as well as inadequate training. Government takes on too much, while delivering too little. Yet for growth to be equitable, a must in our democracy, effective and well-targeted government engagement is essential. [Why are these economists not talking about governance reforms?]

One partial solution is more decentralization, with more powers and funding delegated to the states, and perhaps more importantly, within the states to municipalities and panchayats. It will allow for a much more dynamic decision-making process, resulting in government policies that are more sensitive to local conditions, as well as more local democratic control of officialdom. [This is fine in principle but totally fails to account for the fact that the SAME bureaucracy and political incentives will lead to the SAME outcome.]

The strategic use of technology has the potential to help here as long as we are careful not to make a fetish of technology, are mindful of the human dimension of transactions, and deploy technology with enough safeguards. Technology can make it easier to monitor flows of funds and uses of funding locally, allowing for more devolution of funding, something that has been proposed by previous Finance Commissions. More generally, effective use of technology can also help substitute for government manpower, increase the points of access to government services, help monitor service provision, and reduce leakage in the system.

The debate on whether the public sector should occupy areas that can be done by the private sector will no doubt continue, and there is an obvious case for exiting areas where the public sector contributes little while draining the exchequer and distorting competition. [Sanjeev: Why is government involved in ANY business at all? And this is not a specific recommendation: a motherhood statement] The government should also reconsider its interventions in areas where it adds noise and uncertainty - for instance, the constant fiddling with agricultural import tariffs, the unpredictable closures or opening of export and import windows, and the inability to procure agricultural commodities or release them effectively, does significantly more damage than good to agriculture. While actions are taken in the name of the farmer or the consumer, it is the middleman who often benefits. [Sanjeev: there's nothing wrong with the middleman benefiting in a competitive and open market. But the market is not open. This recommendation fails to recognise the huge blockages on agriculture sector trade.]

Moreover, even when the consumer benefits from high farm production and low agricultural prices, which also help contain inflation, the cost to the farmers can be significant. The case of pulses is revealing. In 2016-17 for example, India witnessed its highest ever domestic production - close to 23 million metric tonnes -- likely reflecting a combination of a normal monsoon after successive droughts and the farmer response to higher market prices and MSPs. This was sufficient to fully satisfy domestic demand. Despite that, India imported a hefty 6.6 million tonnes of pulses (almost a third of total domestic production) at zero import duty - leading to a massive domestic supply glut, and a sharp and sustained fall in pulse prices over the next two years which continues to this day, with prices currently 30% lower than their 2016 peaks.

In addition to getting the government out of areas it should not be in, there is an equally urgent task of strengthening the government in areas it does poorly or is virtually absent in - for instance, regulating and certifying educational or medical service providers, apprehending and successfully prosecuting economic offenders [What about non-economic??!!], or regulating haphazard development and environmental despoliation without blocking growth. [When even murderers like Modi can remain on the loose, then what hope of justice? This was the opportunity to talk about governance reforms.]

For growth to be equitable and sustained, we have to reform our education, skilling, healthcare, and welfare systems significantly. Our record on primary education is dismal, with only about half of the children in class five able to do math or reading at the second-grade level. Parents have responded by increasingly migrating to private schooling, but private schools are only slightly better than government schools, and in their current form will not solve the problem of low education quality. [This is a TERRIBLE comment to make - to downplay private enterprise, the only thing that is working in India for the POOR] It does not get better at higher grades -- our PISA scores were so low that we refused to participate again in that international benchmarking exercise. The poor quality of human capital may already be constraining growth (industry is increasingly concerned about the large and growing skill deficit), limits its inclusiveness and prompt a premature move to replace workers with machines.

Healthcare is another area of major concern. In particular, the public system has largely been abandoned by the patients seeking regular primary care. They prefer paying for private treatment even though many practitioners are unqualified and prescribe the wrong treatment in more than 70% of the cases. This is partly a consequence of the failure of the public sector -- public sector practitioners are often absent, and when present they put very little effort into treatment. It is unclear how the recent Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, which is the main current effort to deal with healthcare issues, will address this issue. [Sanjeev: with the BLATANT failure of government staring in the face, where is the talk about governance reforms?]

This is especially a problem because dealing with the large growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the many, only partly-solved, child and maternal health issues, relies heavily on getting frontline providers to lead the charge. Similar concerns apply in the education sector. A failure to ensure high-quality education and health care provision means that a substantial proportion of our future labor force will grow up underequipped with skills needed in the labor market and suffering from the long term consequences of stunting and wasting. Much of the middle-aged population will be dealing with debilitating diseases that could have been prevented or controlled. This obviously limits the sustainability and the inclusiveness of growth.

The environment is, of course, a critical challenge to the continuation of our growth and to the extent to which growth translates into improved quality of life. Many of our cities are increasingly experiencing levels of pollution that border on the toxic. If we cannot manage the environment at our present level of development, greater growth will make matters far worse. [Sanjeev: once again, this points to severe government failure - but no mention of the need for governance reforms] The consequences of environmentally myopic policies are reflected, for example, in the rapidly falling water table in many parts of the country, which threatens the sustainability of our agriculture. Relatedly, climate change is already having very significant effects on productivity and the quality of lives in India and we need to be at the forefront of global efforts to combat it. [Sanjeev: this claim is, of course, CRAP]

That our current policies do not add up to an inclusive and sustainable growth agenda is reflected in growing agitation across our society. Agrarian unrest, and the constant demand for loan waivers, is now compounded by demands for some form of government support from sections of society that are nowhere near the poorest. This reflects Indians' growing anxiety about their future and that of their children in an increasingly winner-take-all society, where they often end up on the losing side. Our welfare schemes like the MGNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana are mostly directed towards the very poor (the one exception being the public distribution system), so they do not serve the purpose of protecting those outside that group. Without stronger, sustainable, and inclusive growth we simply do not have the resources to expand our welfare schemes significantly, [Sanjeev: BUT WHY SHOULD WELFARE BE EXPANDED?] but if we do generate that growth, not only will there be less demand for welfare but there will be more resources to service any demand.

The bottom line is that while we have performed creditably in the last 25 years across different administrations, we cannot be complacent about our economic challenges. They are mounting. We are a group of economists, each with different specializations and interests, who have come together to offer proposals for the way ahead. Some of us are based in India, some outside, but we are all closely engaged in, and concerned about, India's development. We do not belong to any party, nor are we from the government. We hope this non-partisan analysis of our situation, while not intended to be comprehensive, will help spur debate as India moves to elections. The rest of this note summarizes our proposals, and offers our consensus view on some of the key issues we face. We then append individual notes by members of the group, which offers more details of individual views and proposals. Each note reflects the view of the author(s) in their personal capacity, and does not necessarily represent the institution they are affiliated with.

Macroeconomic stability: a prerequisite to sustainable growth and job creation

India's economic history is replete with the same lesson: preserving and protecting macroeconomic stability is an essential prerequisite to strong and sustained growth. Every time macro stability has been traded off to boost growth, the economy has been pushed towards a crisis, the consequences of which have undermined the very growth that was the initial policy focus.

Ensuring macroeconomic stability has at least three elements to it: maintaining low and stable inflation, ensuring the consolidated fiscal deficit leaves enough space for private investment, and ensuring that the current account deficit is sustainable and can be financed largely through stable capital inflows, to help insulate the economy from sudden swings in global sentiment. High and variable inflation constitutes a regressive tax, with the poor bearing the biggest brunt, since their incomes are typically least indexed to inflation. It also dissuades foreign investors from investing in rupee assets. Similarly, large and unsustainable fiscal/external imbalances impart significant macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty, push up borrowing costs and risk premia in the economy and threaten financial stability. All this impedes private and public investment.

Fiscal consolidation to creating space for more investment

The economy has made significant progress in combating inflation in recent years. Over the last 4 years inflation has averaged just over 4% versus almost 10% in the previous five years, and household inflation expectations are getting progressively anchored. The same, however, cannot be said of the fiscal side.

While the center's fiscal deficit has been steadily brought down, the combined deficit of the states - even after adjusting for UDAY - has continued to widen in recent years and, thereby, largely undone the center's consolidation. Consequently, the consolidated fiscal deficit in 2017-18, stood above 6.5%, not very different from its levels five years ago. Our primary suggestions to make progress on this difficult issue:

De-risking the external sector

India's heavy dependence on oil imports often results in ""boom-bust"" cycles on the balance of payments when crude prices change. For example, the CAD narrowed to 0.7% of GDP in 2016-17 as crude prices fell and was then tracking close to 3% of GDP in 2018 when crude prices bounced back up. This resulted in a large balance of payments surplus in the first instance and a large deficit in the second. These sharp swings complicate monetary policy, as well as exchange rate and liquidity management, and create undue external and fiscal volatility (since oil prices also alter the fiscal math). We should:

Fixing the Stressed Sectors

Careful but quick policy reforms are needed for the sectors/areas that are stressed. These include agriculture, infrastructure (including power), exports and banking. There are common themes in any revival. Typically, we need to redeploy government effort in each of these sectors, focusing it on areas where it is truly needed to play an enabling role, while freeing the sector of excessive bureaucracy and intervention, which results in inadequate access to markets, distorted prices, and poor incentives. While the recent focus on improving India's ranking on the World Bank's Doing Business measures is commendable, we should guard against the temptation to focus on the specifics of the World Bank measures, while neglecting the broader impediments to producing in India. [Agreed] We now consider each of these sectors in more detail.

Agriculture & the rural economy

We need deep rooted transformation of agriculture, treating it not as a sector that has to be propped up through repeated sops, but as an engine of India's job creation and growth. For that, it is imperative that we thoroughly reform agricultural and land policies. In particular, a key source of agrarian distress in recent years has been that the terms-of-trade confronting farmers has turned progressively more adverse, partly as a result of policies to combat food inflation. While low inflation is desirable in itself, the impact on farmers also needs to be taken into account. A policy priority should be to reduce distortions in farm product prices as well as input prices. Another important enabler is technology, both in educating and informing farmers, as well as in opening access to markets. Some specific proposals include

Infrastructure

Accelerating the pace of the infrastructure build-out will help in a number of ways; it will create jobs in construction and new economic activity around the resulting roads, ports, airports, railways, and housing; it will promote inclusion as it connects interior rural areas to markets; it will make our exports (and import-competing manufacturing) more competitive as it reduces input costs such as land (as cheaper areas are connected) and power, as well as improves logistics and reduces transportation costs; it will open up India to both domestic and foreign tourism, which can be a tremendous source of semi- skilled jobs. This will require

Power

Despite having some of the largest reserves of coal, as well as having substantial unutilized power generation capacity, India is both short of coal as well as short of power. These are policy self-goals, arising from both the dominant presence of government in coal mining and power distribution as well as populist impulses in pricing. Nevertheless, our low base allows us to choose a path that is both more energy efficient as well as less polluting as we reform the system for the twenty first century. For this we need:

Exports

India's non-oil, non-gold current account has deteriorated by almost 3% of GDP in the last three years, suggesting an urgent need to improve the underlying competitiveness of the tradable sector. Boosting exports should be the lynchpin of that strategy. [Sanjeev: Any economist who says this is simply not a good economist. Refer to Kautilya, and the best economists who agree that IMPORTS are the key. Let consumption be the focus of economists, and exports are a minor subset of this production process.] The existing constraints in the export sector appear to be reflective of more general problems in manufacturing: low scale of production, low productivity, bureaucratic impediments, high cost of inputs like land and power. We have suggested ways to address these earlier. In addition,

Financial Sector

Given the non-performing asset (NPA) build up in the banking system, it is imperative we make the banking system more robust and well capitalized [Sanjeev: HOW? By taxpayer subsidy??], expand its capacity to extend credit, and improve incentives to lend to the most productive sectors. While the recent travails of the NBFCs are a matter of concern, some of their problems stem from an overly rapid expansion of their balance sheets as they grew to substitute for banks. Stability in the banking system will help spread stability to other parts of the financial system as, of course, will the reverse.

The main challenges for the banking sector are to improve governance, transparency, and incentives in the banking system. Key measures should include

The non-bank financial sector needs a strong banking system as well as deep equity and bond markets, supported by liquid secondary markets and a robust regulatory and legal infrastructure. Key priorities include:

Making growth inclusive and sustainable

A good job is often the most important form of inclusion. In addition, we need to help individuals obtain the human capabilities that will enable them to secure and hold that job, as well as protect those who cannot get jobs. Let us now turn to proposals on inclusion.

Education

The single greatest limitation of the Indian education system is its inability to deliver universal functional literacy and numeracy in primary school. Several studies show that students who fail to achieve basic skills by the end of class 3 learn very little in subsequent years even if they are enrolled in school. Our top education policy priority is therefore:

The Right to Education (RTE) Bill's input-based approach to education quality was unlikely to succeed given the extensive evidence that most school inputs are neither necessary nor sufficient for improving learning outcomes. RTE has led to an unnecessary and disruptive closure of several low-cost private schools that parents were choosing of their own accord. In many cases, even government schools are in violation of these input-based norms. We therefore recommend:

While improvement in schooling is a key building block to education, we cannot neglect either vocational training/skilling or college education. Both will be critical to providing our youth with the wherewithal for the jobs of the future. High quality research universities will be essential, both to train the teachers for our colleges as well as to fuel the innovation needed for the next stage of our growth. [Sanjeev: GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THESE]

Dealing with the skills shortage

There is wide recognition that the current models of publicly subsidized skilling are not performing very well even though skills are extremely scarce. What seems to work better is the skilling provided by private firms that are training their own labor force. However, under current laws, firms can employ workers for up to one year after which they either have to fire them or make them permanent. Since there are significant costs and inflexibilities in making workers permanent, many firms keep workers on short contracts and terminate them before they can become permanent. This state of affairs serves neither the firm, which has to hire new workers frequently and has no incentive to train them, nor the worker, who has no security of employment, and who is not trained. At the same time, since the government is often the only employer that offers secure jobs, young people spend their twenties applying for these jobs rather than working. However, these jobs are extremely expensive thanks partly to the munificence of the Pay Commissions and therefore there are too few of them. As a result, a cynic could argue that the government and the private sector lack manpower, while young people sit at home filling applications and preparing for tests. We propose that:

Women's labor force participation

There are clearly both supply-side issues-families not allowing women to work, women feeling disempowered -- and demand-side issues -- lack of women-friendly jobs in the private sector as well as discrimination. Some useful first steps here:

Healthcare

There is much to be done to reform the healthcare system in India. Increasingly, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer play a much bigger role, so healthcare needs to be reoriented to address these.

Environment

Even while business complains about the difficulty of getting environmental approvals, the quality of our environment leaves much to be desired and with climate change looming we should be thinking in terms of reaching peak emissions within the next decade or so and then sharply reducing them. For all of this we need to get more professional about the environment and climate change, as well as more transparent about the regulatory process.

Social Protection

India has more than 400 separate social protection schemes. A vast majority of them are funded at very low levels and do very little. However, they absorb some amount of bureaucratic capacity. And despite the wide variety of schemes available on paper, as the many protests make clear, people do not feel protected. In particular while MGNREGA provides some support for the rural landless, most other relatively poor people have only the PDS to fall back on. This is one reason that it is so difficult to remove any government scheme, however inefficient. There is a clear need to create a reliable pipeline for providing compensation for losers, as we move towards a more rational system of social protection. The Direct Benefits Transfer is a good starting point and building on it by being credible in compensating losers will be key. Specifically we suggest"

New Delhi: Private schools in India have over 20 lakh seats reserved each year for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society, but only 20 per cent of them get filled, a report by legislative rights group Indus Action has revealed.

Under Section 12 (1) (c) of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25 per cent of seats from private, unaided schools are reserved for EWS children. However, over the years, many schools and even state governments have not taken the Act seriously.

States like Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan have performed very well, but others are yet to catch up, the report said.

Indus Action is a Delhi-based organisation, which works closely with the state and Central governments on the implementation of legislative rights like RTE.

From an all-India enrolment figure of 5.1 lakh in 2013-14, the first year that the Act was seriously implemented by schools, the number declined to 4.8 lakh in 2014-15, then rose to 6 lakh in 2015-16, and finally hit a low of 4.3 lakh in 2016-17. The data has been collated by the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), which is the official data collecting platform of the government of India.

The 2015-16 figure represented 27 per cent enrolment on EWS seats, while for the other three years, the percentage has hovered around the 20 per cent mark.

The report also showed that many schools are still not opening their doors to children from poor families. The number of schools that offered EWS seats was just 16 per cent in 2016-17.

""Lack of school participation is one of the biggest reasons for a low fill rate,"" said the report.

Looking at the low rates of admission in the EWS category, the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development sent a letter to all the states earlier this month, asking them to submit reports on the issue. The ministry, however, said it could only play a monitoring role, and not force states to adopt the rule, as education is a state subject.

There are many reasons for low admissions in the EWS category, ranging from private schools not willing to give admission to students to parents not approaching schools because of lack of awareness.

""A major factor which affects enrolment in this category is the social stigma. Many schools don't open up their doors to children from the weaker section of society, thinking that they will not be able adjust with the rest of the children,"" said Kanika Verma, strategy head of Indus Action.

""Also, many parents are not aware that their children can get admission in private schools, so they end up sending them to government schools only. That is where we are trying to step in and create awareness about the Act,"" she said.

A private school teacher who wished to remain anonymous pointed to another factor. ""Apart from social factors, another factor that plays a part in EWS admissions being low is because there is a very big government school lobby in states, which pushes private schools to not admit children under EWS category, fearing a drop in (government school) numbers,"" the teacher said.

The EWS category is also misused by well-to-do people who are not able to get admission for their children through regular methods. Nursery admission is a major problem for parents, especially in Delhi. Earlier this year, the Delhi Police had arrested a man who produced a fake EWS certificate to get his son admitted in a reputed private school.

The Indus Action report said while the Act is supposed to cover both economically and socially-disadvantaged sections of the society, the breakdown of admissions data between the two categories indicates that the latter group is not getting anywhere near adequate coverage.

""These categories include child in need of care and protection, orphan children, children with special needs, child labourers, transgender children, HIV+ children, among others,"" it said.

""In Delhi, in 2018, only 1 per cent of admissions were under the disadvantaged category. In Gujarat in 2018, less than 1 per cent of admitted students were covered by students in disadvantaged categories.

""While several states have a policy to ensure gender equity in admissions, the policy has not been successful in admitting vulnerable children at a disadvantage,"" the report said."

No proposal was sent by the State government after the Centre in September, 2017 sought a proposal for the Metro Rail project as per the new guidleines of the revised Metro Rail policy, he clarified.

""Urban transportation is an element of the town planning framework, which is completely a State subject. The State governments have the responsibility to provide the basic amenities related to urban transportation,"" he concluded.

Responding to another query raised by Vijayasai Reddy in the Upper House, Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Dr. Satya Pal Singh said a majority of primary schools across the country were running in compliance with the Right To Education (RTE). The RTE requires schools to have sound buildings, a classroom per a teacher, an convenient entrance to the school, separate toilets for boys and girls, a kitchen in school premises to cater to the midday meals scheme, a playground within the premises and a compound wall, he explained.

The Union Minister further explained the role of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA) in implementing the RTE. Since the SSA's rollout in 2001, 4,455 primary schools have been started, 70,204 classrooms and 36,906 toilets have been built. SSA provided for drinking water facilities in 7,143 schools."

Talking to TOI on the sidelines of a meeting, attended by education department officials and representatives of private schools on Wednesday, the DM said parents could get in touch with the block education officer for seeking help in the admission process.

""A grievance cell will be made functional where parents can lodge complaints against schools denying admissions or violating the RTE Act. The district administration has set a target of getting approximately 5,000 students, belonging to the economically weaker sections and disadvantaged groups, enrolled in private schools in their neighbourhoods,"" the DM said and added the administration had helped almost 3500 'poor' students get admission to private schools under the RTE Act last year.

Besides, school buses will be checked near Gandhi Maidan from December 22 to see whether they are abiding by the instructions of the district administration and following the guidelines of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). These include guards in buses, speed governors, CCTV cameras, global positioning system, contact details of drivers and conductors, name of schools, grills on windows, entry and exit gates.

The DM also asked the school authorities to participate actively in the 28-day measles-rubella campaign starting from January 15.

Alleging that the inspections by the government teams are ""motivated"" and ""an attempt just to tarnish the image of civic bodies"", the education committees of both south and north corporations have directed their officials not to let the ""survey teams enter the school premises"".

The government has asked Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to assess each government, private, and municipal school on parameters like safety, teaching-learning facilities and community engagement. DCPCR is the statutory body to monitor implementation of rights of children and Right To Education Act, 2009 in the city.

The chairperson of the south corporation's education committee, Nandini Sharma, said the House had already rejected the inspection proposal. ""The survey teams had taken permission from us three months ago after showing us a set of questions. But now they have completely changed their track, which is unacceptable."" These inspections also disrupt entire work in schools, she added. ""No permission is sought from the principals and committee members barge into classrooms,"" she alleged.

Sharma's counterpart in the north corporation, Ritu Goel, said she had directed education officials to discontinue the visits with immediate effect. ""We had agreed to the exercise keeping child welfare in mind but the government is using it politically to malign the image of corporation schools."" Goel said she had received complaints from 20-25 teachers about the conduct of inspection teams.

The little kids are asked ""motivated"" questions, Goel alleged. ""Which brave child gets beaten by teachers? Which good student brings the tea for teachers? When a teacher is talking on mobile phones then you don't disturb them -- such types of questions are being asked,"" she said. ""The purpose is only to create a controversy.""

Showing the files about the ""agreed-upon"" questions, she added that the survey was meant to be about issues like safety of kids, guard rooms and visitors in the school. Corporation officials were also asked to provide details of students' family members but they are yet to send any information.

DCPCR member Anurag Kundu, however, claimed that the corporations couldn't legally stop the inspections. ""DCPCR is not under Delhi government and it is an independent statutory body. It is legally obligated to monitor implementation of RTE Act in all schools. The education committee has no authority to stop us,"" he said.

Kundu said the teams were asking the questions agreed upon in joint meetings in September. ""The questions cited by the education committees are not being asked. Only questions like how do you feel in classroom? Are you allowed to ask questions,"" he added.

He also pointed out that Quality Council of India, a central government agency, had been selected as the project management agency for the survey."

The city government informed a bench of justice Sanjiv Khanna and justice AJ Bhambani that by collecting the data they can bring back children who have dropped out of school and this was not possible in the absence of a detailed and comprehensive data bank.

""The data so collected will not be shared or retained at the school/zonal/district level for personal or any other use and it will be collected in strict compliance with guidelines,"" the reply read.

The reply came while hearing a plea filed by the Delhi Government School Teachers Association, through advocate Kamlesh Kumar Mishra, challenging the move by the government, seeking the voter ID details of the parents and relatives of students.

On Tuesday, the court was informed that on November 27, a circular was issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE) where it is specifically mentioned that, ""except DoE, no outside agency' has been hired or engaged for data collection or verification"".

""Once it is uploaded on the DoE website, no one can see or use (the data) without permission of competent authority,"" the reply read.

The court was also told that it is absolutely impossible to plan and allocate budget for suitable infrastructure and facilities for children in the absence of comprehensive data.

Earlier, the Delhi government had removed Aadhaar card from the list of the documents sought from children after the Supreme Court had delivered its verdict. The high court had also rapped the state government for collecting the phone numbers and voter ID details of relatives and parents. The matter would be now heard on February 25, 2019."
