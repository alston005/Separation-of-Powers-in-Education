Over a month after the gangrape of a 16-year-old girl at a school in Dehradun, police have arrested four minor boys on rape charges, and 5 members of the administration for destroying evidence. The four boys, and five members from the school administration - the director, the principal, an administrative officer along with his wife, and a hostel caretaker -- all named in the FIR, were arrested Monday.

""The girl did inform the school administration about the gangrape by the four boys and the pregnancy, but instead of informing the police and the family of the girl, the school administration gave her various medications to end the pregnancy. The school officials later took the girl to a nursing home for an abortion,"" a police official said, adding that the school administration had put ""immense pressure on the girl so that she doesn't tell anyone about the incident"".

While the gangrape allegedly happened on August 14, a preliminary investigation in the case was ordered by the Dehradun Senior Superintendent of Police Nivedita Kukreti, on Sunday, after she received information about the incident.

On Monday, an FIR was registered against nine persons under sections 376 D (gang-rape), 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, a police official said.

The school, located at Ghana in Khamaria region of the district, celebrated Independence Day a day earlier, on August 14, by organising cultural programs, said Father Maria Stephen, spokesperson of Madhya Pradesh Catholic Church.

On August 15 the principal hoisted the tricolour in the presence of all staff members, but students were not invited as there was possibility of rain and the school ground was slushy, he said.

The next day, activists of Hindu Sena, a local organisation, and some parents reached the school and demanded apology from the principal for not inviting students for the Independence Day function, Stephen alleged.

The school had a valid reason for not inviting students, and it had been celebrating Independence Day and Republic Day with zeal every year, he said.

""We condemn such type of pressure tactics. We missionaries celebrate the national festivals with great zeal,"" he added.

While representatives of Hindu Sena could not be contacted for comment, Khamaria Police Station in-charge inspector J Masram said the organisation's activists and the school management sorted out the issue ""amicably"" and the principal tendered an apology."

In a story that is sure to set a new benchmark in terms of the affection and respect that teachers can earn from students, the transfer of an English teacher at government high school teacher in Tiruvallur, north of Chennai, had to be delayed by 10 days following an unusual protest from students.

28-year-old G Bhagawan was one of the two English teachers at school and was transferred along with one more as part of a routine redeployment of staff to maintain the teacher-student ratio in government schools.

The students, however, were left shocked by the move to transfer their favourite teacher and launched a protest on Wednesday. The protest saw over 100 students from various classes of Government High School in Veliagaram virtually holding the teacher hostage after learning of his transfer to another school in the region.

The principal of the school A Aravindan told The Indian Express that Bhagwan had completed the process to leave the school but was stopped by the students.

""Bhagawan was teaching English from 6th to 10th standard. Transfer orders came on Tuesday. Another teacher came to the school on Wednesday at 9 am, completed procedures and left to join the new school before 10 am. But Bhagawan, who got delayed in the process, was stopped by students,"" he was quoted as saying.

He said that students had also informed their parents about the transfer of both the English teachers and they also reached the school leading to dramatic events. Aravindan added that Bhagwan was one of the best teachers of his school.

""I was told to wait for 10 days to execute the transfer order. Parents are realising that it is part of the usual process,"" Aravindan said.

The Parents and Teachers' Association (PTA) also reached out to local MP PM Narasimhan asking him to cancel the transfer order. However, he convinced PTA members that the transfer was a part of the regular procedure.

Speaking about this emotional reception, Bhagwan said that his colleague who got transferred had left before him. He revealed that the students had even taken away his scooter key and snatched his bag as well.

""I was stopped by students when I stepped out of the office. They took away my scooter key first. Then they snatched my bag, crying and shouting loudly. Then they literally dragged me to the classroom. I earned not only my salary but their love and affection too,"" he added."

The basic facts are these: On 8 March, 10 students of the Kamala Girls School said they were forced to sign a ""confession letter"" admitting they were lesbians. The angry parents claimed the girls were arm-twisted into signing the letter. They said that if two persons hold hands or put their arms around each other, it does not mean they are lesbians. The acting headmistress Sikha Sarkar said some students had complained about other students engaging in ""such behaviour"". So she called them in and considering ""the sensitive nature of the issue"", she asked them to admit it in writing and then called in their guardians to discuss the matter, ""so we can bring these girls on the right course"".

Whatever might have been demonstrated in this whole sorry episode, it's certainly not sensitivity. ""Sadly our teachers are being trained to teach different subjects,"" says Paro Anand, award-winning author of books for young adults. ""But they are not taught to handle issues that confront young people.""

Stigmatising sexuality or the suggestion of it is treading into dangerous territory. Representational image from Reuters

First off, why does anyone have to ""confess"", and that too in writing, to being a lesbian? In an official statement, the Indian Psychiatric Society has declared there is ""no evidence to substantiate the belief that homosexuality is a mental illness or a disease."" ""Are students in co-ed schools asked to write a confession about their heterosexuality when they are seen spending time together?"" wonders Malobika, co-founder of Sappho for Equality -- The Activist Forum for Lesbian, Bisexual Woman and Transman Rights, in a report by Indian Express.

And what is the ""right course"" anyway? It's one thing for a school not to promote homosexuality, or even approve of it, it's another thing to extract letters of confession.

The parents are right in saying two girls holding hands does not mean they are lesbians. But even if they are, does it mean the school can make them sign a ""confession""? ""In this kind of public name-and-shame game, what space do we leave for honesty?"" wonders Anand.

The issue is not whether some girls in Kamala Girls School are lesbians or have romantic crushes on each other, or play pranks. The issue is that schools and authorities seem to have no idea about how to deal with the sexuality of young people. ""Adolescent sexuality is a problem for schools and parents,"" says YA author Himanjali Sankar. She points to the Delhi Public School scandal from some years ago where two students recorded a sexual act which someone tried to sell on baazee.com (now acquired by eBay). ""The discourse is particularly skewed when it comes to homosexuality. One doesn't need video recordings. Just the suggestion of homosexuality is condemnation enough,"" she says.

Sankar is the author of Talking of Muskaan, a book which deals with a 15-year-old girl and homosexuality, among other things. Talking of Muskaan, along with Payal Dhar's Slightly Burnt where a teenaged girl grapples with the knowledge that her friend is gay, is one of the few YA books that deals with the subject in an Indian context. Sankar says her previous books about the Superdog Rousseau resulted in many interactions at schools. But when Talking of Muskaan came out, her publisher found that schools were reluctant to invite her. ""Some got back saying they liked the book but are afraid parents will complain if they have a session around it,"" she says.

""Through my work with over 3 lakh young people and their guardians, I have discovered that we as a people are less queasy about violence than about sex and sexualities,"" says Anand. ""So we can watch, read and witness violent acts, but an act of affection, between opposite, or worse, same-sex people, is too 'hot to handle'.""

But not wanting to talk about it can backfire, as the incident at Kamala Girls School shows. The state's education minister Partha Chatterjee says the government does not approve of the fact that the school extracted ""the statement under duress"" and has not handled the matter with maturity. But Chatterjee also tells The Quint he does not approve of inculcating the idea of lesbianism in schools because it ""can influence others"" and that this ""is not the culture of Bengal"".

Adolescent sexuality can be confusing and complicated enough, without dragging the ""culture of Bengal"" into it. Schools obviously have to maintain discipline and they are well within their rights to reprimand, rebuke and even punish students who violate their rules. But stigmatising sexuality or the suggestion of it is treading into dangerous territory.

The students say they were told to write they had put their hands in their friend's blouses and tickled them under their skirts. They were asked why they held hands. Whether minister Chatterjee or the school headmistress likes it or not, teenagers are curious about sex and sexuality. But the very idea of homosexuality lays bare an ""underlying outrage"" says Sankar. An overt exhibition of heterosexual romance could also draw rebukes, but in that case, the more likely outcome is of a student being counseled about how this is not the ""right age"" and that their studies must not suffer. But even a mention of lesbianism brings forward threats of transfer certificates and signed statements.

What is tragic is that in its effort to bring girls on the ""right course"", school authorities miss how vulnerable homosexual children are in a school. A school is a place where fitting in is all-important and a child who seems different from her peers risks bullying, or worse. They are called names, teased, and ostracised. A survey by Mental Health America says LGBT youth are four times more likely to commit suicide and two-and-half times more likely to harm themselves with each instance of verbal or physical harassment. The fact that we do not conduct such studies in India does not mean we do not face these issues.

In Talking of Muskaan, Muskaan is comfortable with her sexuality but some of those around her are not, and she attempts to kill herself. That's fiction. But in real life, by stigmatising even the suggestion of lesbianism, a school sends out a terrible message. Students will often bully a student who seems different, who seems gay. That is sad, but not unusual. It is much more disheartening when the school itself comes across as the bully.

The minister, claiming that ""lesbianism is against our culture"", said the school was free to take any action it deemed fit. ""We believe we should maintain our culture. If the school found it was indecent, it is free to take action against those students,"" he said.

He further said that he had learnt that the students were lesbians through media reports and has asked his department to investigate this issue. ""We have sought a report form the school,"" he said.

The minister's remarks came despite the Kamala Girls' School rubbishing the allegations that 10 girls were summoned to the office of the headmistress on March 8 and were made to sign such statements in the school's bid to ""discipline students who were up to mischief"". Parents of the girls reportedly stormed into the headmistress's chamber on Monday and confronted her for the act.

Speaking to News18 on Wednesday, the acting headmistress Sikha Sarkar said, ""No such incident happened in our school. There were some disciplinary issues and some miscommunication with parents and it was resolved in a meeting with the students and their parents.""

""I have strong objection to the word 'lesbian' used by a section of the media. While running a school we face several issues related to student's future and discipline. It's our duty to guide them towards right direction. I don't know from where the issue of lesbianism came into the picture,"" she added.

Asked about the so-called 'confession letter' she said: ""We have not asked anyone to write such a letter. I would like to request you, not to sensationalize the matter. I think it was blown out of proportion.""

The acting headmistress, however, admitted that the girls were made to write a statement saying they indulged in ""mischief"", but refused to explain what that word meant.

Parents, however, alleged that the school authorities were using the incident to shift focus from the alleged molestation of a student by a non-teaching staff of the school on February 9. The accused staff, Malay Barua, was later arrested.

Talking to News18, father of one of the students who was allegedly forced to write the so-called ""confessional letter"" said: ""There were three eyewitnesses to the molestation and all four girls involved in the previous incident were among the 10 girls who were forced to sign the statement on March 8. The incident was even videographed by school authorities.""

He asserted that nothing has been sorted out between the school authorities and the parents as claimed by the acting headmistress.

President of West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE), Dr. Kalyanmoy Ganguly, refused to comment on the matter on grounds that he was busy with the Board exams.

Dr. Saumitra Mohan, Commissioner of School Education, also denied knowledge about the incident."

(Representational Image) UK school wants govt to ban hijab, fasting for childrenIndian-origin shopkeeper beaten to death by UK teenagers for refusing cigarette paperMumbra school bans naqaab, cites security issues; parents upset

One of the UK's leading state-funded schools which had hit the headlines as one of the first to impose a ban on the hijab for girls under eight has been forced to reverse its decision after widespread criticism. St Stephen's School in Newham, east London, had been planning to extend the ban to girls under 11 later this year but has chosen to withdraw the plans.

""The school's uniform policy is based on the health, safety and welfare of our children. The school has taken the decision to make changes to this policy with immediate effect and this follows on from conversations with our school community,"" the school said in a statement. ""We will work with our school community to continue to review this policy going forward in the best interests of our children,"" it adds.

Arif Qawi, the chair of governors of the school who had recently called on the UK government to take a firm stand on young children wearing the hijab and fasting during Ramadan, resigned from his post on Friday. According to 'The Sunday Times', the resignation followed offensive messages posted on social media against him and the school's Indian-origin principal Neena Lall.

""Now the head-teacher needs to go. Kick her out and force her to wear hijab. Let her see what forcing means,"" one of the messages against Lall reads. Under the UK's Department for Education guidelines, uniform policy is a matter for individual head-teachers and their governing bodies.

The school, with a majority of pupils from Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds, had urged the UK government to issue clear guidelines on the issue of hijab-wearing and religious fasting relating to very young pupils to prevent a backlash from parents. ""The department should step up and take it out of our hands and tell every school this is how it [fasting] should be... The same for the hijab, it should not be our decision. It is unfair to teachers and very unfair to governors. We are unpaid. Why should we get the backlash,"" Qawi had said.

Amina Lone, co-founder of the UK's Social Action and Research Foundation who has campaigned for young girls not to have to wear the hijab, warned that after his resignation other schools in the country would find themselves under pressure if the Department for Education did not issue clear guidelines. ""These issues are not going away,"" she said.

The Department for Education said it is a matter for individual schools to decide how to ""accommodate children observing Ramadan, and to set uniform policies"".

""But we would expect them to consider the needs of their pupils, and to listen to the views of local parents,"" a spokesperson said. In November 2017, St Stephen's School had topped a prestigious primary schools league table published by 'The Sunday Times' annually. It was listed as the best school in England in the 'Schools Guide 2018' for a strong teaching record."
