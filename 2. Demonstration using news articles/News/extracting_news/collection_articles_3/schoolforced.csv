According to child rights activists, the students' parents allege that it was the principal who humiliated the students by asking them to remove their clothes for being late to school.

Some parents also say that the kids were punished for not completing their homework. The parents have been staging a protest in front of the school since Thursday morning, 27 December.

Speaking to TNM, Achyuta Rao, president of Hyderabad-based child rights organisation Balala Hakula Sangham, alleges that not just the principal, but the Mandal Educational Officer (MEO) is also colluding with the school authorities and is trying to hush up the issue.

""Our organisation had a word with the MEO. Instead of immediately cancelling the recognition of the school, the MEO Leela Rani is trying to cover up the issue and has said that she will be taking up the matter with the higher authorities. Is that how an issue of such serious nature has to be dealt with? The principal of the school should be booked under POCSO Act as it's a clear case of exploiting the children's modesty. The children should also be given psychological counselling in the aftermath of such a traumatic experience,"" Rao said.

Balala Hakula Sangham has filed a complaint with the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and has demanded that action be taken under the POCSO Act. Until now, the police have not registered a case against the school management.

Speaking to the local media, Chittoor DEO B Pratap Reddy, said an investigation into the issue is underway and that the school's recognition for the academic year 2019-2020 could be withdrawn.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The Central European University, founded by billionaire George Soros, said on Monday it had been forced out of Hungary in ""an arbitrary eviction"" that violated academic freedom, and it confirmed plans to open a new campus in Austria.

CEU's statement is the culmination of a years-long struggle between Hungarian-born but U.S.-based Soros, who promotes liberal causes through his charities, and the nationalist, anti-immigrant government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

For nearly three decades CEU has been a gateway to the West for thousands of students from ex-communist eastern Europe, offering U.S.-accredited degree programmes in an academic climate that celebrates free thought.

The university said it would leave Budapest if it had not secured guarantees of academic freedom by Dec. 1.

""CEU has been forced out,"" said CEU President and Rector Michael Ignatieff in a statement. ""This is unprecedented. A U.S. institution has been driven out of a country that is a NATO ally. A European institution has been ousted from a member state of the EU.""

""Arbitrary eviction of a reputable university is a flagrant violation of academic freedom. It is a dark day for Europe and a dark day for Hungary,"" CEU's statement added.

Ignatieff told a news conference later that the CEU had received a ""clear and unequivocal"" welcome in Austria.

The United States said it was ""disappointed"" that CEU was unable to remain in Hungary.

The European Commission, which has taken Hungary to the EU's supreme court over the education law that prompted the CEU move and has clashed with Orban over democracy issues, said it was ""deeply concerned"".

The law ""needs to be brought back in line with EU law"", said an EU spokesman. ""It is now for the Court (of Justice of the European Union) to clarify this matter.""

Guy Verhofstadt, the liberal leader in the European Parliament and a former Belgian prime minister, said Orban should feel ""shame"", adding that it was the first time since Oslo University was forced to close by Norway's Nazi German occupiers in 1943 that a European university had been shut down.

CEU's legal status has been in limbo for more than a year since changes to a higher education law that meant a foreign-registered university could no longer operate in Hungary unless it also provided courses in its home country.

Hours after an 8-year-old was killed and eight other students were injured when their private van was hit by a tempo, parents of the injured children alleged they were forced to hire the private van because Rosary Senior Secondary School does not provide buses.

The accident happened in north Delhi's Timarpur on Tuesday afternoon. The injured children were taken to Sushruta Trauma Centre here.

A. Mishra, the father of Class III Nivedita Mishra, said he had no other option but to send his daughter in the private van because the school has repeatedly refused to provide buses to students in the area.

Five BJP supporters -- Krishna Sardar, Shyam Babu Roy, Sanjay Goldar, Gopal Mahato and Rana Saha -- were arrested on Thursday for targeting a school bus, belonging to DPS Megacity, near B T College in the city's northeastern suburbs on Wednesday. The BJP workers, according to police, were ""trying to enforce the bandh"".

Now, in a turn of events that no one had foreseen, children from these families find themselves in a sticky situation for no fault of their own. No one has been able to attend school for a variety of reasons and all of them are now worried that they may not be able to return to school at all.

""My mother has been making the rounds of the court and the police station since my father's arrest and I have been staying at home. Some of my friends have told me that my name may be struck off the school register as my father has been arrested in a criminal case,"" the son of one of the five arrested BJP supporters, a student of Class IV in a local school, said.

'How could my son target schoolchildren?'

The situation is the same at the home of a 19-year-old youth, who was the first to be arrested. ""My mother and grandmother spent Thursday at court and spent most of Friday at the police station to see my uncle. So there is no one to take me to school,"" the Class-II student told TOI, playing in the courtyard of a ghetto in Ganganagar.

All five arrested stay in the same neighbourhood, which is known as a ""BJPsupporting neighbourhood"". Many young supporters of the party fled their home on Thursday, fearing arrest, as news of the police action spread.

My uncle is the head of the family,"" a Class XII student, niece of one of the arrested, said on Friday. ""We are now looking after the household while our parents are trying to get my uncle out of jail. I don't know whether we will be able to resume school any time soon,"" the elder of the two sisters said while cooking on the verandah of their home.

But all the families said the attack on aschool bus was ""reprehensible and shameful"". ""I support the BJP,"" Krishna Sardar's mom, Anima Sardar, said. ""But the BJP bandh was to protest against the death of two students. How could my son and other BJP supporters target schoolkids? It is shameful and they should have never done so,"" she said. Others in the neighbourhood, too, criticised the attack but said the attack was by ""outsiders"".

""We are questioning four of the five, who are in police custody,"" a senior Bidhannagar Commissionerate officer said."

Srinagar: While it seems the General Administration Department is trying to make strike calls 'a failure' by installing Bio-metric Systems in government offices in Jammu and Kashmir, some private educational institutions are also pressing the employees to reach offices on strike days, jeopardizing their lives.

However, the school admins deny the allegations saying the staff 'enjoys' holiday on a strike day.

Kashmir, which is caught up in a conflict as both India and Pakistan claim the territory and have fought three wars over it. In order to protest the 'atrocities of the Indian armed forces', the Joint Resistance Leadership, calls for shutdowns and strikes in order to send out a message to the world that everything is not right in the valley.

On strike days, the business and offices are supposed to come to a halt for the said dates. It only incurs losses to Kashmir and education is also a sector that suffers grossly. At present, on strike days, the educational institutions send text messages to parents asking them to keep their wards at home. However, the staff members are asked to come to the school.

""Whatever be the case, we are supposed to go. The authorities would try to keep us engaged with paperwork but we would really face hardships in order to mark the attendance,"" says a former teacher from a private institution located in Pulwama. On condition of keeping his and the school's identity anonymous, he also told Free Press Kashmir that the school would force the local teachers to come to the school and make them sign a contract so they don't claim the salary for the vacation time.

""On the days when we work, we work enough to deserve the salary while the school is shut. The contract they would make us sign would remain with them. Asking for salary or not coming on strike days meant termination,"" he says adding that he resigned from the school.

The teachers from Srinagar would be allowed to stay back home while the local teachers from the 'always on boil' Pulwama would be asked to attend the school with no students to teach.

""Pulwama is the area that is not safe to travel. When you leave home in formals, you send a message that you are not on strike which hurts the sentiments of those who are on strike. This is something that the school doesn't consider. We literally risk our lives for peanuts,"" says the tutor.

Moreover, teachers from Urban areas complain about the same, saying that they ought to attend the school despite all odds. While talking to FPK, a faculty member from Oasis Educational Institute said that the administration calls them to school even if they have to kill time just by sitting there.

""The students are sitting at home and we are asked to come. We keep sitting for the day but we are not allowed to stay back home. This not only puts our lives at risk but also frustrates us,"" said the member. The school authorities did not respond to the calls on the contact number provided on their website.

Another institute, International Islamic School (IIS) also follows the same line when it comes to going against the strike calls.

""The staff would not be allowed to leave early on Fridays, not to talk of the strike days. Even today, it follows the same lines,"" says a former employee from IIS.

While in rural areas, the authorities threaten the employees out loud, here in Srinagar the authorities deny all the allegations.

""The staff doesn't come on strike days. They enjoy the holiday at their home. In fact, we pay them for that day too,"" said the Public Relations Officer of IIS.

""When the call for the strike is not so serious, we do come to the school. On that day, we work on the maintenance of registers, hold meetings, check and update the syllabus, make activity reports. There is always something we get to work on,"" says Khawaja Irfan, a +2 lecturer from Tyndale Biscoe School, Srinagar.

""Even on days when we don't have much to do, we play matches and the time passes. On strict strike call days, we are asked to stay home but the non-teaching staff is supposed to come, come what may,"" Ifran says.

An official from the school told FPK that ""it doesn't matter to the non-teaching staff whether there is a strike or not.""

""We have nothing to do with the children. We have official work and that is what we are supposed to do even when there are strikes. So, we come,"" he says, wishing to remain anonymous.

The number of newly-registered school and college buses has halved in the past five years and an increasing number of institutions are shying away from adding new vehicles to their existing fleet.

Of late, some schools have reduced the frequency of existing buses and merged routes.

Also, more than 6,400 school buses have been booked for overloading in the past three years.

School managements defended reduction of bus services saying they did not want to take the 'extra risk' and the amount collected as bus fee from parents was not covering the cost of maintaining vehicles.

Schools said it was difficult to meet the criteria set by the special cell -- which comprises transport, education and police departments -- that inspects and renews fitness certificates of buses.

""Parents want school buses to drop their wards at their doorsteps and quarrel with us if we try to merge bus stops or take a longer route due to practical constraints,"" said R Vishalakshi, president of the Tamil Nadu Private Matriculation Schools Association.

The world may not be such a happy place, but until a few years ago, schools were considered to be safe havens for students. It was a place where they not just learnt their lessons and about life in general, they made friends and enjoyed their time under the watchful eyes of the teachers. However, things aren't the same anymore and schools are fast becoming a place where students sometimes go through very tough and traumatising times.

In a shocking incident, the father of a student of Mayo College, Ajmer, has alleged that his son was sexually assaulted and sodomised by six of his seniors. The class 11 student was reportedly abused multiple times by six class 12 boarders between July 10 and 26.

The family of the boy filed a complaint against the students at the Alwar Gate police station on Tuesday, July 31.

Speaking of the complaint, Priti Chaudhary, deputy superintendent of police, who is investigating the case, told Hindustan Times: ""We have registered a case on the father's complaint under different sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POSCO) Act against six named students of Mayo College and are investigating. It is very early to say anything on this.""

In the complaint, in which the school's management committee is a co-complainant, the father of the student said that the class 12 boys barged into his son's room on July 10 and forced him to consume alcohol and take drugs. They then took the boy to the washroom and took turns to sodomise him.

""Each time they sexually abused my son, they forced him to take drugs. They threatened him of dire consequences if he reported the incident to anyone,"" he added.

The boy's ordeal continued until July 26, when he finally left the school and told his parents about the abuse. ""He is under great distress and is deeply disturbed. This was his first year in the boarding school,"" the father added.

Even though Mayo College's management committee is a co-complainant, the school has refused to comment on the case. ""The police is investigating the matter, let's wait for the findings; I have nothing more to say at this juncture,"" Mayo college's principal and director Surendra Kulkarni told HT.

Just weeks ago, a class nine student of a private school in Bihar's Saran district alleged that she was raped by about 18 people in her school over the last eight months. The 18 people include the school's principal, two of the teachers and 15 other students.

The girl explained that she remained quiet for all these months fearing social stigma, but approached the police later and filed a complaint alleging that she was raped since December 2017. She explained that three of her schoolmates had raped in the school toilet in December and shot a video of the act. They then warned her against telling anyone and said that they would make the video public.

Even though she did not discuss the incident with anyone, the students circulated the video that even reached the teachers. However, instead of taking action, they too are said to have blackmailed and raped her.

The class nine girl then approached her principal hoping for some action. However, she was asked not to speak of it as it would bring her and the school bad name. If that wasn't enough, the principal of the school too is said to have called her to his office and raped her"

Police in the Cheyur town of Tamil Nadu have caught seven men, who have been accused of harassing a Dalit cook. The victim works at a government school kitchen and was recently forced to resign from her job.

The Cheyur Police have sent the accused to judicial custody for 15 days.

The accused have been identified as Palanichamy (61), Moorthy (47), Sakthivel (42), Kandasamy (42), Shanmugam (40), Palanisamy (40) and Moorthy (27).

Why was the Dalit woman targeted?

The 42-year-old victim, Paappal, belongs to a scheduled caste community and lives near Avinashi in Tiruppur.

She had been appointed in the government school to prepare midday meals for the students. Paappal has said that she was harassed last week by members from the Gounder community. The locals refused to let her work, claiming that the meals cooked by her are ""impure"" as she belongs to the scheduled caste community, reported The News Minute.

Further, the parents of children protested last week asking for Paappal's removal and warned the school that they will not send their children to school unless she leaves. Not only this, the locals who were protesting against Paappal also locked her in the school for around three hours and put pressure on the school principal to follow their demands.

The principal complained to the Block Development Officer (BDO) of Avinashi. However, the BDO allegedly gave a nod to the parents' demands and issued a transfer order of Paappal.

Paappal has claimed that this is not the first time that she has faced harassment over her caste

Police investigation into the matter

After Pappal's complaint, the Cheyur police have registered an FIR against 80 people under Sections 147 (Punishment for rioting), 506(i) (Criminal intimidation), 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 294(b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place) of the IPC.

Section 4 of Tamil Nadu Prevention of Women Harassment Act 1998 has also been filed against accused.

A school in England has devised a novel way to prevent UK-born children being taken to India and other Asian countries and being forced into marriages -- it is handing out spoons to be hidden inside undergarments and thus trigger metal detectors at airports.

Harinder Kaur from the Co-operative Academy in Leeds has urged pupils to hide the cutlery in their undergarments if they fear they are being taken overseas to be married. It will trigger metal detectors at airports, allowing them to raise the alarm with security staff privately.

British authorities deal with several cases of forced marriages in India and other countries, when parents take children on the pretext of a holiday or meeting relatives, and then force them into marriage with local partners for family honour or visa reasons.

In 2017, the Forced Marriage Unit in the Foreign Office dealt with 82 cases linked to India. Figures released by the FMU in May showed that India was among its top four countries of focus during 2017 with 82 cases. The other countries on the list were Pakistan (439 cases), Bangladesh (129) and Somalia (91).

Kaur told BBC that the spoons can ""save lives...In the six-week holidays we know there is no contact between school and the family and families have that opportunity to go abroad, get their child married and come back. It's a way of making our children aware there is a safety net"".

She said that 80% of UK forced marriages happened abroad during the summer holidays.

""The proportion of cases linked to India in 2017 was similar to 2016. There was a higher proportion of older victims as well as male victims this is most likely due to the fact that many of these cases were reluctant sponsors,"" a statistical of the FMU note said.

It noted that the cases are not broken down by religion: ""(No) major faith in the UK advocates forced marriage. It is also important to note that freely given consent is a prerequisite of Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh marriages.""

Of the 82 India-linked cases, the largest number - 29 - were reported from London, followed by the West Midlands (14) and the East Midlands (12), which have a large population of Indian origin in cities such as Leicester, Wolverhampton and Birmingham.

Official sources say a forced marriage is one in which one or both spouses do not (or, in the case of some adults with learning or physical disabilities or mental incapacity, cannot) consent to the marriage and violence, threats, or any other form of coercion is involved.

""Coercion may include emotional force, physical force or the threat of physical force, and, financial pressure. In an arranged marriage, both parties have consented to the union but can still refuse to marry if they choose to,"" the statistical note said.

The pressure put on people to marry against their will can be physical (including threats, actual physical violence and sexual violence) or emotional and psychological (for example, when someone is made to feel like they're bringing shame on their family). Financial abuse (taking your wages or not giving you any money) can also be a factor.

Set up in January 2005, the FMU operates both inside the UK, where support is provided to any individual, and overseas, where consular assistance is provided to British nationals, including dual nationals."

28-year-old G Bhagawan was one of the two English teachers at school and was transferred along with one more as part of a routine redeployment of staff to maintain the teacher-student ratio in government schools.

The students, however, were left shocked by the move to transfer their favourite teacher and launched a protest on Wednesday. The protest saw over 100 students from various classes of Government High School in Veliagaram virtually holding the teacher hostage after learning of his transfer to another school in the region.

The principal of the school A Aravindan told The Indian Express that Bhagwan had completed the process to leave the school but was stopped by the students.

""Bhagawan was teaching English from 6th to 10th standard. Transfer orders came on Tuesday. Another teacher came to the school on Wednesday at 9 am, completed procedures and left to join the new school before 10 am. But Bhagawan, who got delayed in the process, was stopped by students,"" he was quoted as saying.

He said that students had also informed their parents about the transfer of both the English teachers and they also reached the school leading to dramatic events. Aravindan added that Bhagwan was one of the best teachers of his school.

""I was told to wait for 10 days to execute the transfer order. Parents are realising that it is part of the usual process,"" Aravindan said.

The Parents and Teachers' Association (PTA) also reached out to local MP PM Narasimhan asking him to cancel the transfer order. However, he convinced PTA members that the transfer was a part of the regular procedure.

Times","oyetimes.com",FALSE,"An 18-year-old student in Osaka, Japan, has filed a lawsuit against the local government after she says her public high school repeatedly forced her to dye her naturally brown hair black -- or risk being kicked out of the school for good.

Local media sites report that students of Kaifukan School, in Habikino City, are required by school policy to have black hair, as many students naturally do. The Japan Times says that this rule led the student's mother to contact the school before enrolling her daughter in 2015 to inform them that her hair was naturally brown, and had not been dyed, bleached, or artificially colored in any way. But officials at the school continually ordered the student to dye it black to fit their guidelines -- as frequently as every four days, according to the Tokyo Reporter. Even after following the initial order, the school reportedly claimed that it was ""not enough."" The student says that the constant dyeing eventually burned her scalp and caused painful rashes.

Now, the teenager is suing the Osaka Prefectural Government for Â¥2.2 million (about $19,000) in damages, on the grounds that she was forced to dye her hair so often that it constituted abuse. Her mother first lodged a complaint with the school, but it was dismissed, and the student stopped attending classes in September 2016.

A survey conducted by Osaka-based newspaper The Asahi Shimbun this past May found that nearly 60% of public high schools in Tokyo request that students with brown or light-colored hair provide ""proof"" in the form of childhood or junior-high photos to verify that their hair color is real. The publication says that this practice is in place to protect students by preventing schools from ""scolding or humiliating"" those whose hair is not naturally black, because it seems unusual and is therefore treated as strange. (Another way to protect students is to not scold or humiliate them by treating any physical appearance that doesn't fit mainstream beauty standards as unusual.)

This unfortunate incident is a particularly severe example of how rules are enforced to not only restrict self-expression, but also to create homogeny. As outrageous as it seems, it's not an anomaly -- as many students in the U.S. unfortunately know full well."

An investigation conducted by law firm Latham and Watkins verified those claims.

A representative from the New York College of Podiatric Medicine declined to comment when asked if the school was aware of Bakotic's background when he was asked to speak at commencement.

Keith Greathouse, a member of the school's board of trustees, told Business Insider he was unaware of allegations made against Bakotic. Greathouse said he was ""shocked"" to hear about the claims and said he would look into the matter.

Bakotic could not be reached for comment when contacted through e-mail, his foundation and LinkedIn.

The first day I got an auto-rickshaw to reach the school, but the bumpy ride left me in severe pain.

""I lost my baby all due to the physical and mental stress. All officials of the district education department, whom I had approached, are responsible for my miscarriage,"" said Vaneeta.

The teacher and her husband have also submitted a complaint with the teacher union and Navchetana Bal Bhalai Committee, an organisation of local government teachers. The organisation has further taken up the complaint with the education minister.

Vaneeta's husband Harbhajan Singh, a farmer, said, ""All officials used to keep us waiting for hours at offices. Their behaviour was so inhuman towards my wife. We want action against them.""

Education minister Aruna Chaudhary said, ""The matter has come to my notice and I am personally looking into it."""

On Tuesday, students of the school were allegedly forced to clean toilets by teachers.

The incident came to light after a student, Parsuram Khuntia of Class VI, informed his parents that teachers in the school were making him and other students clean the toilets. Parsuram also refused to attend classes over the issue.Students should not be engaged in any work other than studies in schools. Asking the children to clean toilets is unlawful and an act of infringement on child rights, said Ward member Subash Mohanty.

Parsuram's father Khetramohan is a leprosy patient and mother Satyabhama is suffering from cancer. They are unable to take care of the kid. Taking advantage of the situation, the school headmaster and other teachers engaged Parsuram and other poor students to clean toilets and school floor on a daily basis, Mohanty alleged. As many as 64 students are enrolled in Tulang Project UP School. Headmistress Suajata Nayak said, ""As there are no sweeper and peon, we asked the students to clean toilets and school premises. It is routine affair.""

After being informed by their son about his plight in school, Khetramohan and Satyabhama took up the matter with Collector Yamini Sarangi. The Collector directed District Education Officer (DEO) Prativa Manjari Das to conduct an inquiry into the allegations.Das said on the direction of the Collector, Tirtol Block Education Officer has been asked to conduct an inquiry into the allegation. ""If any teacher is found guilty, stern action will be taken,"" she added.

This is not the first case of teachers forcing students to clean school toilets in the district. Earlier in 2014, headmaster and a teacher of Karilo Primary school in Kujang block had engaged Dalit kids to clean toilets. In 2015, students of Olara UP School in Erasama block were found colouring the building and kitchen rooms. Last year, teachers had allegedly made students clean the toilets of Nehru Memorial UP School at Jota village in Salijanga panchayat of Jagatsinghpur block."

The basic facts are these: On 8 March, 10 students of the Kamala Girls School said they were forced to sign a ""confession letter"" admitting they were lesbians. The angry parents claimed the girls were arm-twisted into signing the letter. They said that if two persons hold hands or put their arms around each other, it does not mean they are lesbians. The acting headmistress Sikha Sarkar said some students had complained about other students engaging in ""such behaviour"". So she called them in and considering ""the sensitive nature of the issue"", she asked them to admit it in writing and then called in their guardians to discuss the matter, ""so we can bring these girls on the right course"".

Whatever might have been demonstrated in this whole sorry episode, it's certainly not sensitivity. ""Sadly our teachers are being trained to teach different subjects,"" says Paro Anand, award-winning author of books for young adults. ""But they are not taught to handle issues that confront young people.""

Stigmatising sexuality or the suggestion of it is treading into dangerous territory. Representational image from Reuters

First off, why does anyone have to ""confess"", and that too in writing, to being a lesbian? In an official statement, the Indian Psychiatric Society has declared there is ""no evidence to substantiate the belief that homosexuality is a mental illness or a disease."" ""Are students in co-ed schools asked to write a confession about their heterosexuality when they are seen spending time together?"" wonders Malobika, co-founder of Sappho for Equality -- The Activist Forum for Lesbian, Bisexual Woman and Transman Rights, in a report by Indian Express.

And what is the ""right course"" anyway? It's one thing for a school not to promote homosexuality, or even approve of it, it's another thing to extract letters of confession.

The parents are right in saying two girls holding hands does not mean they are lesbians. But even if they are, does it mean the school can make them sign a ""confession""? ""In this kind of public name-and-shame game, what space do we leave for honesty?"" wonders Anand.

The issue is not whether some girls in Kamala Girls School are lesbians or have romantic crushes on each other, or play pranks. The issue is that schools and authorities seem to have no idea about how to deal with the sexuality of young people. ""Adolescent sexuality is a problem for schools and parents,"" says YA author Himanjali Sankar. She points to the Delhi Public School scandal from some years ago where two students recorded a sexual act which someone tried to sell on baazee.com (now acquired by eBay). ""The discourse is particularly skewed when it comes to homosexuality. One doesn't need video recordings. Just the suggestion of homosexuality is condemnation enough,"" she says.

Sankar is the author of Talking of Muskaan, a book which deals with a 15-year-old girl and homosexuality, among other things. Talking of Muskaan, along with Payal Dhar's Slightly Burnt where a teenaged girl grapples with the knowledge that her friend is gay, is one of the few YA books that deals with the subject in an Indian context. Sankar says her previous books about the Superdog Rousseau resulted in many interactions at schools. But when Talking of Muskaan came out, her publisher found that schools were reluctant to invite her. ""Some got back saying they liked the book but are afraid parents will complain if they have a session around it,"" she says.

""Through my work with over 3 lakh young people and their guardians, I have discovered that we as a people are less queasy about violence than about sex and sexualities,"" says Anand. ""So we can watch, read and witness violent acts, but an act of affection, between opposite, or worse, same-sex people, is too 'hot to handle'.""

But not wanting to talk about it can backfire, as the incident at Kamala Girls School shows. The state's education minister Partha Chatterjee says the government does not approve of the fact that the school extracted ""the statement under duress"" and has not handled the matter with maturity. But Chatterjee also tells The Quint he does not approve of inculcating the idea of lesbianism in schools because it ""can influence others"" and that this ""is not the culture of Bengal"".

Adolescent sexuality can be confusing and complicated enough, without dragging the ""culture of Bengal"" into it. Schools obviously have to maintain discipline and they are well within their rights to reprimand, rebuke and even punish students who violate their rules. But stigmatising sexuality or the suggestion of it is treading into dangerous territory.

The students say they were told to write they had put their hands in their friend's blouses and tickled them under their skirts. They were asked why they held hands. Whether minister Chatterjee or the school headmistress likes it or not, teenagers are curious about sex and sexuality. But the very idea of homosexuality lays bare an ""underlying outrage"" says Sankar. An overt exhibition of heterosexual romance could also draw rebukes, but in that case, the more likely outcome is of a student being counseled about how this is not the ""right age"" and that their studies must not suffer. But even a mention of lesbianism brings forward threats of transfer certificates and signed statements.

What is tragic is that in its effort to bring girls on the ""right course"", school authorities miss how vulnerable homosexual children are in a school. A school is a place where fitting in is all-important and a child who seems different from her peers risks bullying, or worse. They are called names, teased, and ostracised. A survey by Mental Health America says LGBT youth are four times more likely to commit suicide and two-and-half times more likely to harm themselves with each instance of verbal or physical harassment. The fact that we do not conduct such studies in India does not mean we do not face these issues.

In Talking of Muskaan, Muskaan is comfortable with her sexuality but some of those around her are not, and she attempts to kill herself. That's fiction. But in real life, by stigmatising even the suggestion of lesbianism, a school sends out a terrible message. Students will often bully a student who seems different, who seems gay. That is sad, but not unusual. It is much more disheartening when the school itself comes across as the bully.

The minister, claiming that ""lesbianism is against our culture"", said the school was free to take any action it deemed fit. ""We believe we should maintain our culture. If the school found it was indecent, it is free to take action against those students,"" he said.

He further said that he had learnt that the students were lesbians through media reports and has asked his department to investigate this issue. ""We have sought a report form the school,"" he said.

The minister's remarks came despite the Kamala Girls' School rubbishing the allegations that 10 girls were summoned to the office of the headmistress on March 8 and were made to sign such statements in the school's bid to ""discipline students who were up to mischief"". Parents of the girls reportedly stormed into the headmistress's chamber on Monday and confronted her for the act.

Speaking to News18 on Wednesday, the acting headmistress Sikha Sarkar said, ""No such incident happened in our school. There were some disciplinary issues and some miscommunication with parents and it was resolved in a meeting with the students and their parents.""

""I have strong objection to the word 'lesbian' used by a section of the media. While running a school we face several issues related to student's future and discipline. It's our duty to guide them towards right direction. I don't know from where the issue of lesbianism came into the picture,"" she added.

Asked about the so-called 'confession letter' she said: ""We have not asked anyone to write such a letter. I would like to request you, not to sensationalize the matter. I think it was blown out of proportion.""

The acting headmistress, however, admitted that the girls were made to write a statement saying they indulged in ""mischief"", but refused to explain what that word meant.

Parents, however, alleged that the school authorities were using the incident to shift focus from the alleged molestation of a student by a non-teaching staff of the school on February 9. The accused staff, Malay Barua, was later arrested.

Talking to News18, father of one of the students who was allegedly forced to write the so-called ""confessional letter"" said: ""There were three eyewitnesses to the molestation and all four girls involved in the previous incident were among the 10 girls who were forced to sign the statement on March 8. The incident was even videographed by school authorities.""

He asserted that nothing has been sorted out between the school authorities and the parents as claimed by the acting headmistress.

President of West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE), Dr. Kalyanmoy Ganguly, refused to comment on the matter on grounds that he was busy with the Board exams.

Dr. Saumitra Mohan, Commissioner of School Education, also denied knowledge about the incident."

It does not have facilities like toilets, drinking water and even faces dearth of classrooms since a portion of its building collapsed two years ago during rainy season.

If anyone wants to gauge the government's sanitation programme success rate, a visit to Government Urdu School No 5 will give them a good understanding. According to the staff members of the school, when the portion of the school collapsed, only a portion of the toilet was damaged. Students, especially girls, continued to utilise them. It was demolished 15 days ago, they added. The staff said that elder girl students, when they go home for lunch during break time, they utilise their toilets at home and return. They said that most of the students reside close to the school.

But the students of the school had a different story to tell. They have been urinating in an open gutter near a railway track since the building collapsed. Few temporary mobile toilets were brought to the school premises but they were not fitted and so remain unused, they alleged. One of the school staff members, on condition of anonymity, said, ""Our misery cannot be explained in words. Students are forced to relieve themselves in the open. But the situation of older school girls especially during menstruation and even lady teachers is worse.""

This school has a total of 595 students and among them, 399 are girls. After the building collapse incident, it has been facing dearth of classrooms. The madrassa just beside the school provided its community hall premises, which is being utilised as classrooms. The huge open and deep gutter, which is utilised as toilets by students, may prove life threatening to them, if they accidentally fall into it. The school does not have a compound wall, due to which several students jump over the gutter and cross the railway track to reach their homes, which is again dangerous. These issues have been persisting for a long time but they are not being looked into by authorities concerned despite being brought to light several times, alleged parents of a few students. They said that they themselves had met a few authorities and even local public representative."

One of the UK's leading state-funded schools which had hit the headlines as one of the first to impose a ban on the hijab for girls under eight has been forced to reverse its decision after widespread criticism. St Stephen's School in Newham, east London, had been planning to extend the ban to girls under 11 later this year but has chosen to withdraw the plans.

""The school's uniform policy is based on the health, safety and welfare of our children. The school has taken the decision to make changes to this policy with immediate effect and this follows on from conversations with our school community,"" the school said in a statement. ""We will work with our school community to continue to review this policy going forward in the best interests of our children,"" it adds.

Arif Qawi, the chair of governors of the school who had recently called on the UK government to take a firm stand on young children wearing the hijab and fasting during Ramadan, resigned from his post on Friday. According to 'The Sunday Times', the resignation followed offensive messages posted on social media against him and the school's Indian-origin principal Neena Lall.

""Now the head-teacher needs to go. Kick her out and force her to wear hijab. Let her see what forcing means,"" one of the messages against Lall reads. Under the UK's Department for Education guidelines, uniform policy is a matter for individual head-teachers and their governing bodies.

The school, with a majority of pupils from Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds, had urged the UK government to issue clear guidelines on the issue of hijab-wearing and religious fasting relating to very young pupils to prevent a backlash from parents. ""The department should step up and take it out of our hands and tell every school this is how it [fasting] should be... The same for the hijab, it should not be our decision. It is unfair to teachers and very unfair to governors. We are unpaid. Why should we get the backlash,"" Qawi had said.

Amina Lone, co-founder of the UK's Social Action and Research Foundation who has campaigned for young girls not to have to wear the hijab, warned that after his resignation other schools in the country would find themselves under pressure if the Department for Education did not issue clear guidelines. ""These issues are not going away,"" she said.

The Department for Education said it is a matter for individual schools to decide how to ""accommodate children observing Ramadan, and to set uniform policies"".

""But we would expect them to consider the needs of their pupils, and to listen to the views of local parents,"" a spokesperson said.
