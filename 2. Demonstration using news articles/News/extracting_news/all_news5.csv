"6380","","Coimbatore: The Good Shepherd High School at Fort, Town Hall, is just a year short of turning 100. The bad news, according to a section of former students and teachers, is that the management is planning to shut it down owing to poor strength. The issue was discussed on Sunday as the students of the 1994 batch gathered to felicitate their teachers.

The school management, however, denied the reports and said they were looking to improve the school's condition.

Set up in 1919 as an elementary school, it was upgraded to a middle school in 1927 and a high school in 1947. This government-aided school was once the choice of many from Town Hall, Ukkadam and Sungam areas.

Recalling the good old days, P Muthamilan, 62, a former Tamil teacher of the school, said the school had around 650 students at its peak. ""Lots of SC/ST students and children of sanitary workers who studied in the school have later made their mark in various fields,"" he said. ""Though the pass percentage was around 47% before i joined the school, after principal Philomin Maria Joseph took over, it rose drastically due to his efforts. In 1993 and 1994, the school saw 100% results,"" Muthamilan added.

Former teachers of the school said the management had stopped admission to Class VI four years ago and made the students, who cleared Class V, join a matriculation school nearby, a sister concern of the management. ""The management systematically closed admissions to Class VI and made the students join the matriculation school. That's why the student strength has come down,"" said a former teacher.

When contacted, Fr Andrew, correspondent of the school, said the management had not decided to close down the school. ""We have not stopped admissions either. But parents don't prefer the school as it doesn't have Class XI & XII,"" he said. Pointing out that the school teachers were on evaluation duty, he said, ""Once they come back, we will discuss ways to improve the school.""

Former students said in their days the school was the most sought-after in the area. ""There was hardly any vacant seat in the school,"" said K Mahendran, 39, who completed Class X from the school in 1994. ""Now, it is sad hear that the school is about to be closed down for want of student strength,"" he said.","At 99, Good Shepherd High School at Fort is on the verge of shut down, say alumni - Times of India","859230888","2018-04-29","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/at-99-good-shepherd-high-school-at-fort-is-on-the-verge-of-shut-down-say-alumni/articleshow/63965366.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

Parents of 11 children, studying in a private school under the Economically Weaker Section/ Disadvantaged Group (EWS/DG) category in north Delhi, have been running pillar to post for the past few days. The reason: the school has asked them to seek admission elsewhere as it was shutting down.

The children were studying at Sant Parmanand Public School, Majlis Park, in north Delhi. The school is recognised by the Directorate of Education (DoE) and runs up to Class VIII.

School principal, Anita, said the school administration had informed all children that it would close in February. However, parents claimed that they were informed verbally about the decision only on March 31.

""The school building is old and we are shutting it for renovation. We had informed the children in February. The other (general category) students have been admitted to the two-three schools nearby. We had also informed the education department about the children under the 25% reserved category,"" said Anita. She did not reply whether the decision had been communicated in writing.

Section 46 of the The Delhi School Education Rules, 1973, states that no managing committee shall close down a recognised school, not being an unaided minority school, or an existing class in such school, without giving full justification and without prior approval of the director, who shall, before giving such an approval, consult the Advisory Board.

According to education department officials, the school, which has about 100 students, had applied for closure and has not conducted admissions this year. An inspection of the school was carried out but a final decision on closure is ye to be taken.

DoE Director Saumya Gupta said many schools submit applications, but it takes time for them to reach the headquarters. ""The application reaches the district office, and then me. I will have to check about this school,"" she said.

Parents, meanwhile, are clueless about the future of their children. They said they tried to meet Education Minister Manish Sisodia and other education department officials, claiming that the children have been home for almost two weeks. ""No notice was given to us. Had they informed us earlier, we would have applied to other schools. But now the new academic session has started. Why did they not put up the information on the notice board?"" said Pradeep Kumar, whose son is in Class I.

"6395","","MUMBAI: Who built the Taj Mahal? What's Mumbai's weather today? How's the traffic at this hour? These are some of the questions students from a Marathi medium civic school pose to a mannequin every day. The mannequin is fitted with a virtual assistant, Alexa, which answers the questions, posed in English.

A few months ago, Pooja Sankhe, a teacher at Ramkrishna Aramhence Marg Muncipal Marathi School, brought her virtual assistant for students to explore. She fit it in a mannequin bought online. ""The children were very excited and asked basic questions like: what's your name, or age? That's when I thought it could be used to enhance their English speaking skills. Alexa won't answer until they ask the question in correct English. They started preparing questions at home. This way the students could make mistakes and not be judged,"" said Sankhe.

The mannequin has been placed in a Class VI room, but all students rush to it when they have a doubt. ""Be it a mathematical problem or news, the mannequin is the go-to for students of all classes. I was glad I could put an everyday device to educational use,"" Sankhe said. Noting the method's success in her own school, she is building similar models for other schools nearby. ""Everyone is excited about the opportunity this gives students to improve their English speaking skills. We have reached out to garment stores to give us mannequins they would normally throw away. This will bring down costs,"" she said.

The mannequin was part of 50 innovations displayed at the state's Shikshanachi Vaari programme held in the city recently. Several government and aided schools have been making small interventions to improve the quality of education and keep children in civic or government schools.

The school has suspended the teacher and has also set up an inquiry committee.

The parents of the boy, Prasanna Patil, have claimed that he suffered a mild paralytic attack as a result of the alleged beating. Doctors treating Prasanna told TOI that he has developed temporary facial muscle weakness.

Prasanna is a boarder and class 6 student at the AISSMS' Shri Shivaji Preparatory Military School (SSPMS) and hails from Jamb village in Indapur.

Inspector Pramod Waghmare of the Shivajinagar police station said an offence has been registered under section 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Juvenile Justice Act. ""We have detained the teacher, Sandip Gade. Our probe is on,"" he told TOI.

Prasanna's parents brought him to Pune for medical tests on Monday. The treating pediatric neurologist here, Umesh Kalane, told TOI, ""The boy has developed Bell's palsy that causes temporary facial muscle weakness. We cannot categorically ascertain that this was caused by physical beating. He has weakness in the muscles on one side of the face.""

Prasanna's father, Shailendra Patil, told TOI that he had come to the school on November 3 to take the boy home for the Diwali vacations. ""I had then noticed that the right side of his face was swollen. I had asked him about the swelling but he did not say anything,"" Patil, a farmer by profession, said.

Patil said that during the Diwali festival, he again noticed that Prasanna could not talk properly and had even lost the ability to move the muscles on the right side of his face.

The head and a teacher of the Government Girls School, Village Kundal, Fazilka, have been suspended on the directives of Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, over the alleged stripping of girls following the discovery of a sanitary pad in the school toilet.

The orders were issued late on Monday night after he received the inquiry report, which found the incident to be a case of gross negligence, indifference and insensitivity on the part of the teachers of the school.

The Chief Minister has issued strict instructions to show no laxity in the matter as the respect and dignity of the girl students could not be allowed to be compromised at any cost. He has reiterated his government's commitment to providing a favourable environment for the education and empowerment of girls.

The Chief Minister had on Friday ordered a probe into the allegations of stripping made by some of the students and their parents. The Chief Minister had also directed Secretary Education Krishan Kumar to complete the investigation by Monday and take further action as necessary.

The incident was brought to the notice of Captain Amarinder after a video showed girl students crying and complaining that they had been stripped by the teachers in the school premises. The teachers were reportedly trying to find out which of the girls was wearing a sanitary pad, after one was found in the school toilet.

The inquiry report said the students were checked twice on the directions, and with the full knowledge of, the school head Kuldeep Kaur and teacher Jyoti. The girls were checked with their clothes on the first time, and then the two women got them checked again by senior girl students of Class VIII with their clothes taken off, as per the SDM Abohar, at whose office the statements of Kuldeep and Jyoti were recorded on Monday.

During the first checking, which was undertaken in the mid-day meal kitchen, Kuldeep Kaur was standing outside all through the process, the inquiry committee members, DEO Fazilka Kulwant Singh, SHO Sadar Abohar Angrej Singh and District Child Protection Officer Fazilka Ritu, have stated in their report.

The committee unanimously agreed to the indifference and insensitivity towards women's physical dignity expressed by the school staff. The report further said that though there may not have been any intent of physical/sexual assault, the teachers, at the outset, were found to be negligent and careless.

A chargesheet will be issued under Rule 8 of the Conduct Rules against the Kuldeep and Joyti, who have already been placed under suspension, according to the Fazilka.

Police also announced a fourth arrest in the case on Friday. The fourth accused, Rajeev's driver Deepak, was arrested for helping Angel contact the two contract killers.

Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini), Rajneesh Gupta, said, ""Shashi Prabha alias Angel Gupta had struck a deal for Rs 10 lakh with the two hired killers and had paid them ₹2.5 lakh in two instalments.""

On Monday morning, Sunita, a teacher of a government school in Sonepat in Haryana, was found murdered on the streets of Bawana. She had sustained three bullet wounds.

On Thursday, police had claimed to have solved the murder with the arrest of Sunita's husband, Manjeet Sehrawat (38), and his alleged partner, Angel Gupta, and her foster father Rajeev. Police maintained that the woman had plotted the murder because she was in a relationship with Manjeet and wanted to eliminate Sunita.

A police officer said that while Manjeet and Rajeev were also involved in the murder conspiracy, it was Angel who had planned it and paid the killers. The officer said the three had hatched the plan over the last six months after Sunita's brother went to Angel's house in Delhi's RK Puram and asked her to stay away from Manjeet.

Police said the two gunmen had initially demanded ₹18 lakh but settled for ₹10 lakh. Police said the two gunmen have been identified. ""We are conducting raids to nab them. Everyone had a specific role in the murder conspiracy. The final planning was done on October 23 when all of them met. Angel assigned everyone their specific task before flying to Mumbai, where she was at the time of the crime. While Manjeet's role was to tell the others of his wife's routine, Rajeev and Deepak did a recee of the roads Sunita took,"" the officer said.

DCP Gupta said Sunita's personal diary helped them unravel the murder plot. ""Sunita used to pen down her feelings whenever she felt depressed because of her husband's affair. She had written that her husband was threatening to kill her if she refused to divorce him,"" said Gupta.

Sunita's children and her other family members also confirmed that her husband was in an extramarital affair with the model since 2012. They contacted her and asked her to join probe.

""Manjeet disclosed that the model had been asking him to marry her. He had asked his wife to divorce him but when she refused, he started threatening to kill her,"" said another officer.

The boy told the police that the teacher had allegedly sexually assaulted him on four occasions and one of the incidents had taken place in the PE room in April,"" said assistant inspector Kiran Londhe.

The officer further said that three other boys were allegedly sexually assaulted on two to three occasions at the teacher's house and at their respective homes between February and October. ""The boys did not complain because the teacher had threatened to ruin their career. During questioning, the teacher has refuted the allegations,"" Londhe added.

A special court on Tuesday remanded the suspect in police custody till November 1.

Earlier, Londhe had filed a report to seek custodial remand of the teacher for five days. Additional public prosecutor Makarand Aurangabadkar submitted that custodial interrogation of the suspect was essential. He pleaded that sufficient time be given to the police to find out whether the teacher had committed similar offence in the past.

The prosecution argued that the suspect's interrogation was also essential to find out whether other schoolteachers and staff members were aware of the alleged acts committed by the suspect.

Opposing the prosecution's plea, defence lawyer Narendra Jadhav argued that the custodial interrogation of the suspect was not essential because there was nothing to be recovered from him. He submitted that to conduct investigations at the school, the detention of the suspect in police custody was unwarranted.

Earlier, around 150 parents launched an agitation outside the school and met the principal demanding that the authorities take measures to ensure the safety of students and to resolve their problems.

"6432","","Dimapur, Oct. 30 (EMN):The Khaghaboto Area Students' Union (Kasu) has demanded teachers from the education authorities, particularly for the science subject, for the government high school (GHS) of Khaghaboto. Examinations for the students are scheduled for November, the union stated.

The union issued on Tuesday a copy of a letter addressed to the director of the School Education department. The group cautioned that failure to send teachers within seven days would force the students to agitate.

The copy read: 'The government high school, Khaghaboto is the only high school which caters the educational needs of 17 villages under its jurisdiction. However, it is dismal to note that the GHS, Khaghaboto has been functioning without adequate teachers for the past so many months.'

The school has been left with only one mathematics teacher ""due to retire by January 2019"" after the mathematics teacher was transferred to Chumukedima village without any replacement, the union stated.

'The school is left without science teacher after the sole science teacher under RMSA qualified in the state teacher examination and was transferred to Thenyizu on 25th September,2018. The school is also functioning with only one Hindi teacher.'

The organisation has asked the authorities to provide two permanent teachers for each subject and to deploy a science teacher immediately.

The union added: 'Given that the final examination for class 8 and 9 is scheduled on November 20 and 26 respectively, the union urges the department kindly to make immediate arrangements especially for the science teacher within 7 days from the date of this press release failing which we will have no other option but to register our protest by boycotting the science exam for which the department will be held solely responsible.'","Khaghaboto school: Where one Hindi teacher is all the teachers","982393493","2018-10-30","http://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/khaghaboto-school-where-one-hindi-teacher-is-all-the-teachers/","Eastern Mirror",FALSE
"6433","","TAIZ, Yemen (Reuters) - Outside the home of Yemeni teacher Adel al-Shorbagy the queue of children lining up for education keeps getting longer.

Almost 700 come daily to his house which he converted into a school in the government-held city of Taiz, which has been at the center of a three-and-a-half-year civil war that has left millions on the brink of famine.

Both the Iranian-aligned armed Houthi movement and Yemen's internationally recognized government have deployed forces in various districts of the southwestern city, Yemen's third largest.

Al-Shorbagy opened the school following the outbreak of war saying he had nowhere to send his own children. However, 500 boys and girls aged between six and 15 signed up for lessons in that first year.

""All the schools closed down and we had a problem that our kids were on the street,"" Al-Shorbagy told Reuters.

""We opened this building as a community initiative. It was my national and humanitarian duty towards my neighborhood.""

Inside the house, facilities are basic, with exposed brick walls and big gaps where windows should be. Ripped curtains are used to divide up space for classrooms.

Undeterred, the eager children find any space they can on the floor, with barely any room to move, let alone write. They share donated books and follow what one of the 16 volunteer teachers writes on a broken white board.

Classes include math, science and English, with Al-Shorbagy saying he follows the pre-war Yemeni curriculum.

Despite the ramshackle setting and lack of facilities, the school is oversubscribed in a country where education has been decimated and accessible, free school options are limited.

Some 2,500 schools have been damaged or destroyed since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government, a UNICEF report said in March.

Two million children are out of school in Yemen, including Shehab Mohamed Hazzaa, whose mother was trying to enroll him at Al-Shorbagy's school.

""I came here to register... in the school and the principal told me that it is too crowded and rejected him,"" said the mother, who declined to be named.

The only other option in the city are private schools but they cost up to 100,000 Yemeni riyal ($400) per year, putting them out of reach for many in the impoverished Arab country.","Yemeni teacher turns his home into school for 700 students","982233393","2018-10-30","https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/yemeni-teacher-turns-his-home-into-school-for-700-students-1665925","investing.com",FALSE

Following orders issued by the department of public instruction deputing the school's in-charge headmistress Prathibha to another taluk, nearly 290 students staged a protest demanding that she remain at DB Kuppe.

The deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru on Friday issued an order cancelling Prathibha's deputation. The students, who received support from the members of the School Development Monitoring Committee (SDMC), locked classrooms and staged a dharna in front of the school. Prompted by these unforeseen developments, senior officials from the education department visited the school, where they found the students refusing to budge.

Forced to relent in the face of the protest by students, the department cancelled the deputation of the teacher in question. Prathibha has been working at the school for more than a decade, and has developed a good rapport with both the students and their parents. On learning of her deputation, the students and the villagers decided to protest the decision.

Nawab Khan has been a Sanskrit teacher all his life but now also teaches science and maths. He juggles different text books, some of which he has not even seen before, to teach the lessons in them to students. ""I am a Sanskrit teacher and last year, I was deputed to this school. There were four other teachers at the beginning and we managed. However, over the past 10 months, the other teachers got transferred and I'm the only one left now,"" he said.

I don't know much of science or maths but somehow manage to teach the basics. Several times, I have requested the education department to look into this issue but it has simply turned a deaf ear,"" he said, adding, ""There are books which I am going through for the first time and I am not proficient in English.""

Khan also complained that he was doing much more than just teaching. ""My job is to teach but in this school, I'm forced to look into other issues such as transfers, school leaving and all administrative work. So, studies are compromised on many occasions,"" he said. Also, going for a vacation has been a major issue for him. ""I find it hard to take leave for even a day. I usually inform the education department if I absolutely have to and they send a teacher from some other school,"" said Khan.

However, the education department claimed that the problem would be resolved by next week.

"6456","","Dimapur, Oct. 21: When boys of his age were engaged in recreational activities and playing cricket in the narrow lanes during leisure, nine-year-old Babar Ali would sit under a guava tree at the backyard of his house, teaching underprivileged children of his neighbourhood how to read and write.

Babar, now 25, has taught more than 3000 children in the last 16 years, in a school he started in 2002 when he was only nine and in fifth standard. He started his school at the backyard of his family's small house under a guava tree at Gangpur village in Murshidabad district, West Bengal.

Speaking to Eastern Mirror over telephone, Babar shared his inspiring story of how things unfolded at a tender age. Born in 1993 at Gangpur village, Babar started his schooling at Bhabta Rasidiya Primary School in 1998 and was there till class 4. The school was two kilometres from his house.

In 2002, when he was nine years old, his father Nasiruddin, a jute trader with a small income, got him admitted to Beldanga CRGS High School, about ten kilometres away. He used walk two kilometres daily to catch a bus to the school. That walk actually changed his destiny.

""While returning from school I used to see kids my age working in fields, grazing cattle, and picking rags and scraps instead of attending school,"" Babar recalled. ""When I came to know that they were not attending school because their parents were too poor to afford school fees, it touched my heart and I decided to teach them every day after I return from school.""

It was the same year (2002) that Babar started teaching eight children (aged between five and nine), including his younger sister Amina Khatun, under a guava tree at his parents' backyard. He was the only teacher of his school when it first started.

""I used to teach children of my age from 4 pm to 6 pm after returning from school. I taught my students whatever I learned in school, and they learned it happily,"" Babar reminisced.

In 2003, when Babar was in class 6, he approached the retired principal of Beldanga SRF College, Sanath Kar, who was a close friend of his father, to inaugurate his school, to which the latter obliged and in March 2003, the school was named Ananda Shiksha Niketan (House of Joyful Learning).

Babar has been an ardent advocate of Swami Vivekananda's teachings. He used to visit the ashram of Ramakrishna Mission, located three kilometres from his house, regularly when he was five or six years old.

""I hardly knew about the mission and its teachings. However, I was gradually inspired by the teachings of Vivekananda and his selfless service to humanity. I still go there whenever I get time,"" Babar said.

He said that in March 2003, when he visited the ashram the priest gave him a book and advised him to read for at least five minutes every day. ""It was in that book that I found a quote, 'Service to man is service to God,' which inspired me to continue with my mission till today,"" Babar asserted.

Ananda Shiksha Niketan was recognised (unaided) by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education in 2012 and now offers education from class 1 to 8. It also offers a course for classes 9 and 10 as well, though not recognised yet.

Babar said that after the media reported his work and school, the villagers who were initially sceptical about sending their children to his school changed their mind, and the number of students swelled over time.

Babar shifted his school to Shankarpara village, in 2015, three kilometres away from the previous location. The plot for the new school was donated by Almitra Patel, an NRI, in 2013.

""We already have 300 students including 200 girls, fewer than at our previous address (location) where we had 800 students. We are trying to bring some of those students here by school buses,"" he said.

Babar's biography has been included in the Central Board of Secondary Education syllabus for Class 10, and Karnataka government has included the same in the Class 12 English textbook.

Babar, who completed English honours from Krishnath College, Berhampore in 2013 and Master's degree in history from Kalyani University (distance learning) in 2015, was named ""youngest headmaster in the world"" by the BBC in October 2009 when he was just 16. He has received several awards, including NDTV 'Indian of the Year' and CNN IBN Real Heroes, in 2009, and also featured in 'Forbes Asia 2016 30 under 30 Asia list in Social Entrepreneurs category.

At present, the school has 10 staff, including eight teachers out of which six are its alumni.

""My dream is to teach children till my last breath. I want to see each and every child (in the country) educated,"" Barbar shared.","Life-changing walk to school: Inspiring tale of a 'child teacher'","975834761","2018-10-22","http://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/life-changing-walk-to-school-inspiring-tale-of-a-child-teacher/","Eastern Mirror",FALSE

"6458","","Mangaldoi (Assam): A retired school teacher has allegedly committed suicide here apparently as his name did not appear in the updated draft National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, a senior police official said on Monday.

This was the third such incident since the publication of the complete draft of the NRC on July 30.

Mangaldoi district is about 100 km from state capital Guwahati.

Nirod Kumar Das, who used to practise as a lawyer after retirement, was found hanging by the neck in his room by family members after he had returned from his morning walk on Sunday, Superintendent of Police Sreejith T said.

In a note allegedly left behind, 74-year-old Das stated that he was taking the extreme step to ""escape the humiliation of being marked as a foreigner after the NRC process,"" the family members said.

A local police official confirmed the cause of the death as hanging.

All his family members, including his wife, three daughters, their husbands and children, as well as most of his relatives were enlisted in the NRC, they said.

Das was under distress since the exclusion of his name from the complete draft of the NRC, and more so, when the local NRC processing centre gave him a document, about two months back, stating that his name was put on hold as he had been marked as a foreigner, his family members said.

In his note, Das blamed nobody and listed five people whom he owed Rs 1,200 and asked his family members to return the money, the family and police said.

The agitated family members and locals had refused to let police take Das' body for postmortem Sunday, demanding that action be taken against the NRC processing centre for marking him a ""foreigner"".

They relented only after the district deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police went to the lawyer's house and assured them of a probe to find out why Das' name was excluded and how he was marked as a ""foreigner"".

After retiring at the end of his 34-year career as a teacher in a government school, Das had studied law and was practising in the district court at Mangaldoi near Kharupetia, his family members said.

Meanwhile, the Bengali Students Federation has called a day-long Kharupetia bandh Monday to protest against the exclusion of Das' name from the complete draft of the NRC.

Markets, shops, educational institutions, private offices and banks remained closed, while vehicles were off the roads during the bandh, officials said.","Excluded from Assam NRC, Retired School Teacher Ends Life to 'Escape Humiliation'","975453692","2018-10-22","https://www.news18.com/news/india/being-excluded-from-assam-nrc-retired-school-teacher-ends-life-to-escape-humiliation-1916147.html","News18",FALSE

"6878","","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as the High Court ordered that the transfer of higher secondary school teachers should be implemented based on seniority rather than priority and compassionate grounds, a section of teachers are still divided over the verdict.

Last month, the HC upheld that seniority of the teachers should be the criteria for allotment of schools of their choice in accordance with the option exercised. The court also held that compassionate vacancies should not exceed 10 per cent of the district-wise vacancies, and teachers who have completed 5 years shall be treated as an open vacancy. The court has also directed the Department of Higher Secondary Education (DHSE) to publish a new list based on the verdict.

The court order was based on an appeal filed by the government challenging the Kerala Administrative Tribunal's (KAT) verdict in staying the transfer proceedings till August 31.However, the verdict resulted in a difference among teachers who were included in the previous list and others who want to work in their home districts.

""Again, the transfer proceedings have been sabotaged. This is a clear ploy by a section of teachers to scuttle the transfer process as they want to be in their hometown. This is highly unfortunate,"" said an HSS teacher whose name was included in the previous list.

Earlier, there were allegations that the transfer was not based on seniority and the DHSE proceeded with priority and compassionate grounds such as physically handicapped, widows of armed forces' personnel, spouse postings and even NRI postings. Interestingly, many 'ineligible' teachers allegedly found a place in the list and have managed to reap the benefits of priority and compassionate posting for getting posted in their home or nearby districts.

According to Manoj Kumar (name changed), a higher secondary teacher, the court order was welcoming as the senior teachers who opted for home districts and those who are thrown out from home districts will get an opportunity to exercise the option to be in the districts and schools of their choice.

""With the HC nullifying the previous transfer list, many senior teachers can work from their home district itself,"" said Manoj Kumar.The KAT order had said the HSE Department should stick to the limit of reservation in compassionate and priority posting at 30 per cent.","Higher secondary school teachers divided over Kerala High Court's transfer verdict","951378791","2018-09-21","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/2018/sep/21/higher-secondary-school-teachers-divided-over-kerala-high-courts-transfer-verdict-1874962.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

The PSEB had earlier announced the results of Class 12 board examinations on its official website pseb.ac.in but soon deactivated the results link, which led to utter confusion among anxious students.

The board even changed the earlier message of ""Senior Secondary (10+2) Examination Provisional Result March 2018 NOW AVAILABLE"" to ""Senior Secondary (10+2) Examination Provisional Result March 2018 WILL BE AVAILABLE SOON"".

Issuing a clarification later, the PSEB said, ''Earlier released on the website was withdrawn due to some technical reason. Now it is available on the website.''

Several users had taken to social media to question this. ""It is removed by PSEB or some technical error?"" wrote one person on Twitter (handle: @harmanjeetpreet)

The examinations for Class 12 were held between February 28 to March 24. The results were declared after a long delay owing to the board conducting the tests of a few subjects which were held from April 17 to April 20.

This year, a total of 327,159 students appeared in the Class 12 exams.

Last year, the passing percentage for Class 12 students was 65.33.

Pointing out that former Prime Minister late AB Vajpayee launched Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, which helped to reach education to every section of the society, he said the 'digital board' project would enhance the reach of education to a greater extent.

The digital board will make it possible to teach a single concept through various angles. It will be easier for students to participate in a discussion on the topic in presence of expert teachers, thereby enhancing the quality of education.

"6895","","The Supaul incident highlights the decline of the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya -- an education scheme that has waited in vain for a long-term policy to guide its progress.

Supaul, where several girls were recently brutally thrashed while playing in their school compound, claims its heritage from Sita. This did not hold much meaning for the boys and their parents involved in the incident. The official website of this border district of Bihar presents an impressive list of measures taken by the police to ensure security and peace. These measures didn't suffice to help the 10 to 14 year-old girls who protested against the lewd messages conveyed on their hostel walls.

The school where the girls reside carries the name of Kasturba Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi's wife. Residential schools like this one were set up all over India under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). This national flagship programme started when the Vajpayee-led NDA government pushed enrollment and retention rates in elementary classes to levels few could have imagined and many still refuse to believe. The Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) scheme forms a glorious chapter of SSA. The purpose of setting up these schools was to give rural girls who had dropped out of school before ending the primary stage a second chance. Instead of asking them to go through the primary stage again, Kasturba schools offer a full-time residential opportunity to start at grade 6 level and finish grade 8 when everyone else does.

This goal seems tough and unrealistic when you hear about it for the first time. Only when you visit a Kasturba school do you realise what astonishing success this scheme has had. Despite extremely modest financial support, KGBVs have been doing remarkably well, in terms of retaining the girls they admit from marginalised sections, including the Schedule Castes, Scheduled Tribes, the minorities and upper castes below the poverty line. The government has announced expanding the scheme to class 8. Let us see whether this move brings substantial funds to improve teacher emoluments and living conditions for the students.

The Supaul incident raises some familiar questions once again, but it also asks us to worry about the tedious sluggishness in policy making. Press reports of the incident suggest that the girls were attacked because they resisted lewd remarks. The boys who had threatened to harm them and then carried out the threat, were from the same village where the KGBV is located. For them and their parents, who assisted them, the name Kasturba Gandhi apparently meant little. That the awful attack occurred barely a week after the fanfare of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi had started reveals how tough the task of reviving Gandhi's message of practising non-violence through self-restraint might prove in the current social climate. This climate is characterised by hostility towards girls. The mix of backgrounds among the girls who got badly injured makes us forget the common element in their lives -- poverty. Their parents prefer to let them stay at a poorly funded hostel because conditions at home are worse.

This is not the first time that a KGBV has faced a security breach. Housed in rudimentary buildings, many KGBVs are, in fact, quite insecure. The parents who send their daughters to study in these rural residential schools value the opportunity which they cannot otherwise afford. As it happens in all schemes meant for the poorest sections of society, the infrastructure and services are also minimal. The Supaul KGBV is attached to an existing junior school. Until a few years ago, the state government ran some of the KGBVs with help from the Mahila Samakhya, a reputed programme of women's empowerment. The Mahila Samakhya leadership imparted both efficiency and institutional capacity to the KGBVs under its care.

Sadly, that era is now over and KGBVs have lost their special status. The larger umbrella of SSA has been shrinking, both financially and spirit-wise. Lack of motivation and adequate funds to keep up with inflation cannot be compensated by the supply of smart boards and digital devices announced recently. Compromised provision for basic needs like food, healthcare and security has restrained the progress of many KGBVs, especially in northern India. Poorly trained staff and vulnerability of employment have also enfeebled the scheme. In the Supaul incident, the staff's role and response are being probed, and this will not be easy, given the political volatility of rural Bihar.

For years, the KGBV scheme has been waiting for a long-term policy to guide its progress. I recall the debate held more than a decade ago about the future of these schools. The question was whether they should multiply as stand-alone institutions or gradually merge into the larger system. The question derives its importance from the Right to Education (RTE) Act. If RTE is fully implemented, there will be no ""drop-outs"", hence there shall be no need for KGBVs. It is clear by now that RTE will continue to face chronic inadequacy of funds. It is also facing sloth and apathy of the old directorates of education in many states. That means KGBVs will remain in demand, and if that is the case, they will need a longer-term plan and infrastructure. Temporary arrangements will not do.

All over northern India, the structures created under SSA, including KGBVs, carry a ramshackle look. You don't need to be told that they serve the poor. Their role in improving gender parity is submerged in coping with poverty and its numerous consequences. In her book, Education, Poverty and Gender: Schooling Muslim Girls in India, Latika Gupta has examined the varied effects of poverty on girls' educational experience. Her analysis demonstrates that for schooling to make a dent on the effects of poverty, financial and pedagogic inputs will have to be radically enhanced.

A correspondent of the BBC's Hindi service spoke to one of the girls who became unconscious when she was assaulted and had to be admitted to a hospital. She recounted that the attackers had come armed with sticks. Her description invokes an ethos one can hardly associate with education. The authorities probing the attack on Supaul's KGBV should also worry about the education of boys enrolled in the nearby school.

According to sources in the Department of Primary and Secondary Education, the Central government had to allocate '1,679 crore (total project cost per year), but it has cleared only '1,007 crore. An official source from SSA said, ""Out of '1,007 crore sanctioned for Karnataka, the Centre has been giving only '577 crore which comes up to 57 per cent of the amount. This sharing of the total budget is based on a 60:40 ratio (Central and state).""

This year, the Centre has released only '266 crore which is not sufficient for the activities to be carried out throughout the state, said an official. Due to the shortage of funds, several activities under SSA were being taken up at the end of the academic year, said officials.

More than 12,000 teachers recruited under SSA have not been paid salaries for six months for which the department is blaming the Centre of not releasing funds.Department officials said '1,000 crore is needed to pay the salaries of the teachers, but the Centre has released only '320 crore and asked Karnataka to manage the rest with the state funds.

Even Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy mentioned about this during a public event recently. He said, ""Several people appointed under SSA at taluk and district levels have been asked to leave as no funds have been allocated and salaries not paid. If this is the situation, why do we have to partner with Central schemes.""

New integrated scheme

The Central government is also in the process of merging two of its projects -- SSA and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan -- with a new scheme -- Samagra Shiksha. It didn't even add Abhiyan to the new scheme, as if they include it, it will be difficult to withdraw the scheme whenever it wants. According to sources, now the plan is to shift the 25,000 teachers recruited under SSA to the state government, retain some of the popular and successful programmes and shut the rest which are in need of funds.","Karnataka government may shut down Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan","941803749","2018-09-08","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2018/sep/08/karnataka-government-may-shut-down-sarva-shiksha-abhiyan-1869084.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

"6903","","Snapshot

Integrating three old schemes and giving it a new name for the sake of rationalising resources is no path breaking move and definitely not something the HRD Minister should take pride in.

The Minister of Human Resource Development Prakash Javadekar is undoubtedly the most reformist minister in the history of independent India when it comes to higher education. The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Autonomy Bill, the initiative to provide graded autonomy to higher education institutions, the initiative to develop 20 institutes of eminence, mainstreaming of Study Webs of Active -Learning for Young Aspiring Minds(SWAYAM) etc. have won him his place in history books already.

Given all this, it is perplexing that his interventions in the school education department have been feeble, centralising and devoid of the spirit of deep reform. Make no mistake, the Department of School Education has done some excellent work in teacher education reforms, instituting National Assessment Survey etc. But the fundamental recasting of school education that has been crying for reforms has been met with the new Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan(SMSA).

The SMSA integrates the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) that is targeted at primary schooling (Class 1-8), Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyan (RMSA) that is targeted at secondary schooling (Class 9-12) and Teacher Education (TE). A new Centrally sponsored scheme, a bureaucratic behemoth, is thus created. The budget allocated for SSA and RMSA is about Rs. 30,000 crores for the fiscal year (FY) 2018.

The rationale for the integration of the new schemes, as explained by the government, is that there is a need to rationalise resources. It contends that upto school level there are personnel who deal exclusively with SSA or RMSA. New initiatives such as more allocation for Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya(KGBV), the allocation for Khelo India etc. have also been made, though these initiatives could have been carried out independent of the integration.

If the government wanted to undertake path-breaking reform and leave footprints in the sands of time, the last thing for it to do was to let the zealous bureaucracy do a rejig of bureaucratic programs to solve the problems created by the very same bureaucracy in the first place and then rechristen it with a similar name. This gives way to usual opposition jibes on the government of doing namesake reforms. If the government intends to leave an imprint in the school education system it could have looked at it as-is, at the interventions that are required, at the opportunities for liberalisation that could lead to accountability and efficiency, look for silo-breaking opportunities with the work of other ministries etc. Reforming the right to education(RTE) act, erecting a sane regulatory structure for low-cost private schools, though beyond the scope of the SSA rejig, remain pipe dreams.

The old SSA has been successful in erecting educational infrastructure in every nook and corner of the country. For primary schools, the enrolment has been close to 100 per cent. The focus now is on learning outcomes that have been exposed by the NAS and Pratham's ASER. This would have been an excellent opportunity to decentralise and place lower primary education (classes 1 to 5) in the hands of the state governments. An integration with the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) run by the Ministry of Women and Child development would have provided a seamless graduation of the child from anganwadis to primary schools. By placing the onus of lower primary schools on the states, accountability could have been fixed. The State Council Educational Research and Training (SCERTs) and District Institute of Education and Training (DIETs) would have been rejuvenated naturally to cater to the needs of primary schools, instead of the belaboured top-down approach recommended under the new SMSA. These institutes would have been tasked with creating curriculum and offering lessons in local languages. The feet of the Chief Minister and the State Education minister would have been held to the fire for outcomes. Remember, till the 1976 constitutional amendment, education in its entirety was on the state list of the constitution.

The central government could have squarely focussed on the higher primary and secondary segments, basically from class 6 to 12. Bringing together programs from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Sports and the Ministry of Skill Development would have provided a platform for issues relevant to adolescents to be looked at in a holistic fashion. A good high school education pretty much would imbibe in a child all the skills and competencies required for it to make a decent living. College education would be for further specialisation.

The enrolment ratio of upper primary school is at 91 per cent and secondary school is at 78 per cent. The infrastructure in labs and pedagogy is still evolving. This should have been the exclusive focus of the Department of School Education under MHRD. It should have re-engineered the RMSA into incorporating exciting new advancements in technology, pedagogy and remodelled it into a flagship program destined to take our young minds into the new era. Concepts like the NITI Aayog pioneered Atal Tinkering Labs, vocational education, a remodelled curriculum on our history and culture would have been welcome.

Now under the new SMSA, both the centre and states can blame each other for underperformance. It is also strange that the ideas put forth in the forward-looking India Action Plan of 2016-19 created by the Niti Aayog are not applied in spirit.

The Congress, although, has no moral authority to criticise the new SMSA, for this would never come up if not for the mess it created. And about Arjun Singh and Kapil Sibal as HRD ministers, the less said, the better. The left-liberal intelligentsia that loves centralisation and sarkari control would have no qualms with the new RMSA, at least philosophically. This government alone could have done it.

We may have to wait for at least six years for structural reforms in school education because post-2019, neither will the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-III want to touch it again nor will the United Progressive Alliance (UPA-) IV have the stomach for it.","Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan Is Just Old Wine In A New Bottle","861323513","2018-05-03","https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/samagra-shiksha-abhiyan-is-just-old-wine-in-a-new-bottle","swarajyamag.com",FALSE

The scheme envisages free and equitable secondary education with effective learning outcomes, irrespective of gender disparities, and vocational training for weaker sections, including persons with disabilities, by 2020. It has been approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs for the period from April 1, 2018, to March 31, 2020.

SSA project director A P Kuttykrishnan said the new scheme will enhance the quality of education by introducing smart classrooms and attractive syllabi for the mental growth of students. He said the new scheme will also help to concentrate the development of students from the pre-primary to secondary levels.

""SSA has been upgraded to Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, which is the advanced version in which all the school levels can be covered. The process is underway and a final decision in this regard is expected to be taken at a high-level meeting to be held in New Delhi in May,"" he said.

""Unlike SSA, the new scheme helps students to improve their skills in academics. For instance, there will be special subjects such as Ganithavijayam to help students perform well in mathematics. Besides, special libraries and UGC-level syllabi will elevate our school education to international standards. IIT Kharagpur authorities have expressed interest in imparting training to students in summer camps from the next academic year.""

Vocational training will be introduced as an integral part of general education at the secondary and senior levels. Under the programme, there is a provision for arranging hands-on training in an industrial set-up and on-job training may be provided during vacations for 80 hours.However, the Centre has no plans to sanction a separate cadre of teachers for the project, sources said.

Against the estimate of 20.78 crore children in the 6-13 age group as per Census, 2011, 19.67 crore children are enrolled at elementary level as per Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), 2015-16.

Universal enrolment at elementary level is the primary goal of SSA. It has provided 2.04 lakh primary and 1.59 lakh upper primary schools for ensuring universal provisioning of schooling facilities. Preference for opening of school is given to tribal areas, and areas with high concentration of Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and minority population. Under the SSA, the districts with high concentration of population of SCs, STs and Muslims have been identified as Special Focus Districts (SFDs). The criteria for identifying the SFDs in case of SCs and STs is a population of 25% and above, while for Muslims, it is 20% and above population.

Through the interventions made under SSA in SFDs, at the national level the enrolment share of SC children at elementary level is 19.78% as per UDISE, 2015-16, whereas their share in population is 16.6% (as per Census 2011). Similarly, the enrolment share of ST children at elementary level as per UDISE 2015-16, is 10.35%, whereas their share in population is 8.6% (as per Census 2011).

Besides, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs), which are upper primary residential schools for girls belonging predominantly to the SC, ST, Other Backward Caste and minorities, have played an important role in furthering the goal of girls' education in educationally backward blocks of the country. Under the SSA, provisions have also been made for residential schools/hostels for children living in sparsely populated areas, children living in areas where schools cannot be opened due to unavailability of land and children in need of care and protection.

"6914","","Approves bill to tackle Benami transactions, dedicated Special Security Force for Governor

In a decision aimed at streamlining the teaching cadre in Jammu Kashmir, the State Administrative Council (SAC) under the chairmanship of Governor Satya Pal Malik approved the action pan recommended by the committee constituted vide G O No 1263-GAD of 2018 dated 13 August 2018.

The committee was mandated to devise a comprehensive strategy to review the issues of all school teachers in the School Education department including those funded under the on-going Government of India-sponsored Scheme 'Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan' (SSA) and suggest possible solutions.

Over the years, School Education department has been facing immense difficulties due to multiple cadres of teachers, requirement of additional funds to meet out salary of both SSA and RMSA teaching faculty and a host of other related issues, which were directly or indirectly impacting upon the quality of education in Government-run schools and leading to avoidable chaos and confusion among the teaching fraternity.

To address the issue in its right perspective and humanely, the State government constituted a committee vide G O No 1263-GAD of 2018, Dated 13 August 2018.

The committee submitted its recommendations in the form of an action plan to the government.

The SAC considered the departmental proposal based on the recommendations of the committee and broadly accepted the action plan proposed by the committee.

The SAC approved the creation of a separate cadre of teachers who would get the pay scale of Rs 29200-92300 (L-5) 7th Pay Commission from September 1, 2018 in the School Education department.

These posts shall be filled up 100 percent by selection out of regularized Rehbar-e-Taleem 'Teachers (RReTs) with qualification 'graduate from any recognised university'.

This cadre of teachers is created exclusively for the purpose of adjusting RReTs and would gradually get extinguished or abolished over a period of time.

The School Education department would amend the Jammu Kashmir School Education (Subordinate) Service Recruitment Rules, 2008 as may be required to give effect to this decision.

RReTs will transition into teachers as procedure laid down in the Action Plan.

The action plan envisages formal merger of 526 posts of headmasters and 3132 posts of subject-specific masters created under RMSA with headmasters and masters in the School Education department, conversion, up-gradation of existing 4522 direct quota vacant non-teaching posts in different categories as teachers, creation of 28,363 supernumerary posts of teachers with the stipulation that these supernumerary posts shall subsist till completion of appointment, transition of eligible RReTs as regular teachers, and thereafter shall cease to exist on the adjustment if these supernumerary posts against normally arising vacancies.

The School Education department has been authorised as a one-time exception to fill certain vacant posts of lecturers by promotion of eligible PG teachers and masters in the relevant disciplines to enable utilization of the resultant vacancies of teachers for appointment and transition of RReTs as teachers.

This initiative is being taken in the larger interest of the teaching community and purely as a welfare measure.

The School Education department has been granted one-time exemption for making regularization, confirmation, and promotion of the officers (backlog and fresh) in respect of each gazetted category without referring the cases to the JKPSC and DPC.

The 4522 posts of non-teaching staff shall be restored to their original position as and when they become available after adjusting and subsuming all the supernumerary posts.

The School Education department would encourage such RReTs as do not possess the requisite qualification to acquire the same within a specific timeframe so as to up-scale them as regular teachers.

Further, all vacancies of lecturers and teachers referred to PSC and SSB where advertisement notices have not been issued or selection process has not been initiated or written test has not been conducted as on 07.12.2018, shall stand withdrawn.

However, this would not apply to the posts for which selection lists have been published or where document verification is in process.

The SAC directed that a Committee of Officers under the Administrative Secretary, School Education department with Director, School Education Kashmir and Jammu, representatives of General Administration and Finance Department not below the rank of Additional Secretary to Government or equivalent level would oversee the entire process of appointment and transition of RReTs as teachers.

The School Education department would nominate a nodal officer to maintain a complete record of the vacancies of the lecturers and teachers or in the non-teaching category to ensure proper accounting of the posts created, converted, reverted, supernumerary posts, their adjustment against regular posts, vacancies arising from time to time.

The action plan also envisages creation of a Human Resource Management (HRM) Branch in the School Education department, civil secretariat to deal with Human Resource Management (HRM).

The Committee of Officers constituted vide Government Order No 1263-GAD of 2018 dated 13 August 2018 will also examine the cases of 7706 under-graduate teachers who do not possess the qualification as 'Graduate' for their appointment and transition as regular teachers.

The committee would submit its report to the government within a period of one month.

The landmark decision will enable streamlining the cadre of RReTs by transitioning them in the regular cadre of teachers and meeting the salary deficit of SSA and RMSA teachers, which is over Rs 1400 crore per annum, out of the State budget.

Thus all teachers will henceforth get regular monthly salary on time consequent to the assimilation of various cadres of teachers into one regular teaching cadre.

This will result in greater accountability, discipline and capacity building of teachers and improve the quality of education in the State.

Meanwhile, to fast track recruitment and bring in more transparency in the overall selection process, the SAC approved the proposal of dispensing with oral test for selection against the newly created posts of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons.

The recruitment to these posts will now be done on the basis of written tests only.

The SAC in its meeting held on 12 September 2018 had accorded sanction to the creation of 400 posts of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in the Animal & Sheep Husbandry Department for selection through JKPSC in a phased manner.

The SAC had further asked the Animal & Sheep Husbandry Department to examine as to whether the recruitment against these newly created posts can be conducted on the basis of written tests only.

The fast-track and transparent recruitment to these posts will fulfil the long pending demand for regularization of Animal & Sheep Husbandry trial centres besides infusing fresh professional talent in the Department for maintaining health and welfare of animals, thereby, enhancing mutton, milk and poultry production in the State.

The SAC also approved the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Bill- 2018.

The Bill seeks to introduce such provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure, Samvat, 1977 which will help in the disposal of cases in a time-bound manner.

These provisions relate to fixing time-frame for filing a written statement and forfeiture of right of defendant to file written statements after the prescribed period.

Besides provision regarding costs have been attuned and a new provision of case hearing management is being introduced.

These modifications are aimed at speedy disposal of civil cases in courts which tend to linger on unnecessarily. Litigants will save time and costs.

The SAC also approved the 'Jammu and Kashmir Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Bill, 2018'.

The Bill is a comprehensive law aimed at tackling Benami transactions in the State. The Bill provides for creation of the requisite administrative structure for enforcement of the law and empowers the Designated Authorities to attach and confiscate any property which is held to be Benami.

Panel provisions incorporated in the Act provide for imprisonment of persons found guilty of offence of Benami transactions which shall not be less than one year extendable to seven years, besides fine equivalent to 25% of the market value of the property can also be imposed.

The SAC also approved the 'Jammu and Kashmir Governor's Special Security Force Bill, 2018''.

The Bill contains provisions related to the constitution and regulation of a separate security force in the State of Jammu and Kashmir for providing proximate security to the Governor, members of his immediate family and matters connected therewith.

The legal framework related to constitution and regulation of a separate security force in the State of Jammu and Kashmir for providing proximate security to the Chief Minister, members of his immediate family and other connected matters, is contained in the Jammu and Kashmir Special Security Group Act, 2000. There is no provision contained in the said Act related to matters, for providing proximate security to the Governor of State and his immediate family members. A need has been felt to have an effective mechanism in place for constitution and regulation of a separate security force in the State of Jammu and Kashmir for providing proximate security to the Governor and his family members.","SAC announces bonanza for SSA teachers, veterinarians","1014347563","2018-12-09","http://risingkashmir.com/news/sac-announces-bonanza-for-ssa-teachers-veterinarians","RisingKashmir",FALSE
"6915","","TURA: With Christmas festivities just round the corner, teachers under the banner of the All Garo Hills SSA School Teachers' Association (AGHSSASTA) have resumed their demand for release of their pending salaries and arrears.

In their memorandum to Education Minister, Lahkmen Rymbui, the teachers demanded the release of their pending salaries from the month of September to November including December 2018 with immediate effect.

Besides pending salaries, the teachers are yet to receive their pending arrears for the years 2016-17 as per PAB. Reminding that repeated petitions have already been submitted to concerned authorities, the teachers sought that both their pending salaries and arrears are released before December 13 this year.

According to the teachers, the State Project Director (SPD) during a meeting recently assured them that their pending dues would be cleared before Christmas. The teachers urged the Education Minister to follow up the matter to ensure that the assurance is kept. The teachers also threatened to launch a democratic protest all over Garo Hills if their demand is not fulfilled.","SSA teachers request clearance of pending dues before Christmas","1010949760","2018-12-05","http://www.theshillongtimes.com/2018/12/05/ssa-teachers-request-clearance-of-pending-dues-before-christmas/","theshillongtimes.com",FALSE
"6916","","TURA, Dec 04: Teachers of the Dadenggre sub division, under the aegis of the SSA School Teachers Association (West Zone), have expressed their displeasure at the non release of 2 months salaries to the SSA 4th teachers.

The teachers are yet to be paid salaries for the months of June and July which allegedly have been withheld by the SDSEO or Joint DMC while all other 4th teachers have already been paid. The money was apparently released by the state on July 24.

""Teachers for the same district (West Garo Hills) in places like Tura, Rongram, Dalu etc had already got their salaries in the last week of July 2018,"" said joint secretary of the association, Sungra D Sangma.

""We deeply express our anger on the matter and want to know why we are always getting late release of 4th teachers' salaries by the SDSEO/Jt DMC for the sub division while the money is being released by the state's education department,"" he added.

"6917","","Official promises, written orders, verbal assurances, committee formations, reports and other things but the miseries and agonies of SSA teachers are yet to culminate.The incumbent governor, his advisors and the other higher ranked officials have taken us on a ride again.

The month long hunger strike at Jammu and Srinagar had awakened a ray of hope when the teacher leadership was called to Rajbhawan by the governor administration and it was officially ordered by the incumbent governor that September Salary would be released as per 7th pay commission recommendations.Nothing substantial happened.SSA teachers have been waiting since then.Almost two months have passed but their fate didn't change.

Today, I won't write about the contribution, merit, genuineness and legitimacy of their case rather would like to highlight the failure of administration to deliver justice in their case.

Is it official callousness or administrative failure? Who shall be held responsible? Whom to blame? According to reliable sources, the incumbent governor administration had tried its level best to deprive the SSA teachers from the benefits of 7th pay commission and other service privileges but the genuineness and legitimacy of the case didn't allow them to succeed in their designs.

Now, when the genuineness and legitimacy is proven, when there is no doubt about the legitimacy of being a part of state establishment but still then, the resolution of the issue seems to be a distant dream though it has been promised by the people at the helm of affairs.

Treacherous approach of authorities has diminished the hopes of teachers which had risen in September 2018.

How can masses and authorities expect the best from these teachers who have been starving? Whose children and parents are craving for different necessities of life?

I wonder, if authorities consider these teachers as human beings! They are not angels. They do have needs like you and other people. Their children feel the pangs of cold in this chilly winter. Their parents too need medicine.They too have to visit their relatives for different purposes like marriages, mournings etc.

The harshest season of the year has already caught us all tightly.Who knows not the necessary extra expenses of winter? Woollen garments, fuel and some other necessary stuff can't be compromised with but these teachers are cursing their fates for being employees. Piled up miseries have put this community of teachers in virtual trauma.

I won't beg before authorities on behalf of these teachers but I would call it an administrative failure to complicate the issue through deceptive means.

World is making big strides in development, progress and prosperity because these advanced nations have developed and advanced educational systems where teacher is at the top of the hierarchy but our case is totally different and contrasting.

Our people at the helm of affairs too wish to change the system rather brag to make exemplary changes in the system, but ironically, always look for cheap and treacherous means to deny teachers their hard-earned salaries.

Appreciation, acknowledgement and perks for our teachers are not in syllabi of our system. If there is anything for them, it is denial and deprivation.

Our teacher is still 'poor master'. Our public and official perception is still outmoded about our teacher, then how can we expect him to be an European or American teacher who is the virtual king of the country.

Our teacher's American and European counterpart is 24 hour teacher with all the comforts under his feet.He spends his time in the library, equipping himself with the latest trends in academics but our teacher is forced to look for a part time job to provide his family mouthful of meals.

Everyone is cursing the teacher for the messy situation in our educational system but no one dares to look into the reasons that have left the system in the dilapidated conditions.

Let people at the helm of affairs change their attitude towards teachers, I promise miraculous changes in the system but you are playing delaying tactics with your teachers which is sure to spoil the system. Trade union leaders have once again decided to switch over to confrontation path.

Will it yield authorities anything? No, not at all.It will only hit the already poor academic standards of the downtrodden children of our society.Is it a conspiracy against our poor children or is it your callousness towards the teachers of our society.

People at the helm of affairs have adopted silence over this burning issue.It can lead us nowhere as a nation.Strikes and sit-in protests will surely halt our academic progress which is sure to leave us crippled and lame as a nation.

Governor and his team was believed to break the ice because they don't need any vote bank politics to score political mileage but this delaying tactic has dejected the teachers to the extent that they are looking for alternate jobs to feed their children and families.

Is it an achievement to celebrate or a blot to be ashamed off.Yes, it is undoubtedly an ugly blot on our collective conscience because the most respectable working class has been left at the mercy of God to starve. Isn't it the violation of labour rights?

A labourer who works sincerely should be paid in time.Even religious scriptures have laid emphasis on it to pay off a laborer before his sweat dries up.

I pity our administrators who can spend hefty amounts on unimportant things but can't pay their servants.

Now, the onus is on the people at the helm of affairs.Given the legitimacy of the issue, it must be resolved once for all so that our teachers can concentrate on their job without resorting to the path of confrontation.Any further delay can turn things uglier.

Administration must care for its own credibility. Governor's word is equal to a thousand orders but our people are probably made up of cheap stuff who neither respect their own promises nor the words of others.

Hope is life and we live in hope, and let us hope the issue is resolved very soon to give this big community of teachers the much needed relief.

Believe me, official insensitivity and delaying policy in the case has put these teachers to enormous humiliation and anxiety.

Wish our advisors and other higher rung officers would act like true statesmen to solve the grave issue.","How long shall SSA teachers suffer?","1007536903","2018-11-30","http://risingkashmir.com/news/how-long-shall-ssa-teachers-suffer","RisingKashmir",FALSE

Interestingly, the organisation disclosed that the 'sanctioned salary bill' for three months had been at the directorate of School Education since October 27 2018.

The group issued a press release on Thursday stating that it was 'patiently waiting' for a solution from the government of Nagaland.

The statement read: 'The Nagaland Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Teachers' Association (NSSATA) 2010 and 2013 batch, as per the agreement made with the government of Nagaland in the presence of the Naga Students' Federation and the Eastern Naga Students' Federation, on the 12th of June 2018 is patiently waiting for a positive and a permanent solution to end the grievances which the teachers have been facing since the time of appointment.'

According to the organisation, the agreement included finding a mechanism 'for timely release of salaries.' Besides, it stated, the association had assisted the directorate for 24 days on the request of the department, 'right after discharging our school duties on weekdays as well as relinquishing our holidays on non working days to speed up the process for the implementation of 7th ROP and timely release of the salaries.'

In spite of all these, the press release stated, the teachers have not been paid for five months i.e., June to October 2018.

'Therefore, the NSSATA appeals to the government of Nagaland to release the five months pending salary at the earliest. The teachers have been discharging their duties sincerely even though salaries are not being paid and the inability of the government to release the salaries on time is relieving the teachers of their justified entitlement.'

The organisation disclosed that the 'sanctioned salary bill' for three months had been at the directorate of School Education.

'The sanctioned salary bill for three months i.e., June to August 2018 has been at the directorate of School Education since 27th of October 2018,' the press release stated. The association has requested the department to release the salaries at the earliest 'for the sake of the teachers.'

That said, the NSSATA 'acknowledged' the government of Nagaland for taking the decision to bring the SSA and RMSA teachers of 2010 and 2013 ""into the mainstream of the School Education cadre.""

Principal Secretary, Finance, Navin K Choudhary on Tuesday chaired a meeting of State Committee set up to address the issues of Sarva Shikhsha Abhiyan (SSA) teachers working in different areas of J&K.

During the meeting, Secretary, School Education, Ajit Sahu made a presentation on the roadmap being worked out by the School Education Department for addressing the issues of the Education Department teachers, including regularization of existing General Line Teachers and SSA teachers, and their promotions.

Sahu briefed the Finance Secretary about the measures taken by the School Education Department, including a proposal for changing recruitment rules, stopping fresh recruitment and promotions of ReTs in a way that it doesn't impact the career prospects of General Line teachers.

Based on the presentation, the resource gap was identified by the Committee in the existing funding for paying the salaries of the SSA teachers and several options were examined to fund the gap.

The Committee recommended that the School Education Department is in a position to pay one-month salary of the SSA teachers which may be approved by the Chief Secretary.

The Finance Secretary said the State Government will take all measures required to fulfill the genuine demands of the SSA teachers while calling for a further discussion on the issue in Jammu after Darbar move.

Among others, Commissioner Secretary, Higher Education, Sarita Chouhan, Director Budget, Imtiyaz Ahmad Wani, State Project Director, Samagra Shiksha, Tufail Mattoo and Director, School Education, G N Itoo, also attended the meeting.","Genuine demands of SSA teachers to be addressed soon: Govt","976735812","2018-10-23","http://risingkashmir.com/news/genuine-demands-of-ssa-teachers-to-be-addressed-soon-govt","RisingKashmir",FALSE
"6930","","VIJAYAWADA: 'Badi Runam Theerchukundam', the much-touted project launched by Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), has failed to yield expected results due to lack of awareness among people. The SSA launched the programme in 2016 with an intention to encourage individuals and old students of government schools to come forward and donate for the development of their alma mater. Till now the SSA has been able to collect only around Rs 70 lakh from donors. Officials say that this nothing compared to Rs 69.6 crore worth of material and other donations they received in kind for development of schools.

There are 45,000 government schools in the State and officials hope greater awareness will fetch more donations. Though the officials are working closely with district coordination teams for creating awareness among public, not many are aware of the initiative.

The officials are actively working on social media platforms to create awareness and seeking donations from non-resident Telugus (NRTs). Speaking to TNIE, G Srinivas, State Project Director of SSA, says, ""It is indeed a great opportunity for the people who are in good position after studying in government schools to develop their alma maters for the future generations. This is the starting point of development, as these schools would be transformed according to the wishes of the donors.

We are conducting various awareness programmes across the State and many people are responding positively. NRTs are also coming forward and offering donations. We are also giving income tax exemption under 80C for a l l donations."" Apart from the donations to the schools, people have been asked to write letters and spread inspirational message among students. As of now, hundreds of letters have been sent to various schools by former students.

Officials and students are also writing to old students urging them to come forward and take part in the initiative. Under the scheme, the donors can specify what the donation is meant for. The names of the persons who has donated the amount or material will be posted on the SSA website. ""The programme is a really good one as it provides a great opportunity for the people who wanted to develop their old school as per their dreams.

Many people might have a dream to establish a school for the poor with best facilities, but they might find it hard in achieving it alone. With this initiative, they can donate to the school and develop them as per their wish. We are expecting good development in the schools with best infrastructure, libraries,"" said N Bhaskar Rao, principal of a government school.","SSA's Badi Runam Theerchukundam fails to attract donations","967561678","2018-10-12","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra-pradesh/2018/oct/12/ssas-badi-runam-theerchukundam-fails-to-attract-donations-1884475.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

"6934","","KOCHI: The government's 'salary challenge', asking its employees to donate their one month salary to the Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF), has now drawn flak from the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) staff too. As per an order forwarded to them on WhatsApp by the respective District Programme Officers, every staff will have to contribute a month's salary towards CMDRF.

""It says the salary has to be deposited over 10 months,"" said a cluster resource coordinator (CRC) not wishing to be named. ""How can the government ask those on contract and even daily wage workers to give their one month salary from the pittance they are paid?"" the CRC wondered. Even the period for which they are employed doesn't tally with the time mentioned in the order.

""Questions are also being raised about the validity of the order that has been passed on to the staff by the district programme officers via WhatsApp. The order is not written in a letter format that is countersigned by the respective head,"" said another CRC. The CRCs alleged the officers concerned have threatened them with dire consequences if they do not go along with the diktat.

""The government has asked those not in favour of giving the money to send a letter to the officers concerned. But we are being threatened our contracts might not be renewed or we might be transferred to some other place if we refrain from 'contributing' ,"" the CRC said. ""So, who in their right mind will go against the 'order'?"" the CRC asked.

However, the SSA state programme officer of SSA refuted the allegations. ""I just sent the government order which I received. In no way is any pressure being exerted on the staff,"" he said. Another SSA officer said only permanent staff had the obligation.""Only those willing to contribute have been asked to notify it.

"6935","","KOZHIKODE: You may have heard about night duty for emergency staff such as healthcare workers and police personnel. But what about night duty for school teachers? Scores of school teachers - on 'work arrangement' with the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) - are currently undergoing a 'night duty' of sorts. After eight hours of work during the day in schools, these teachers - a majority of them women - have to undergo 'review sessions' which may extend up to midnight.

As part of 'Malayala Thilakkam' project of the SSA, the teachers, now re-christened as Cluster Resource Coordinators (CRCs), are undergoing a six-day residential training programme across the state. The teachers had come under the SSA after they lost their posts in their respective schools due to staff fixation.

What bothers the women teachers more is not the workload, but the lack of security or official monitoring in the accommodation provided to them. Take, for instance, the SSA training programme in Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta districts. The teachers, numbering over 40 from both districts, have been accommodated in a lodge-like facility with no security.

""It's hard to convince our families about the peculiar timing of the training programme,"" a woman teacher told Express. ""We do not have an answer to their query as to why the programme extends to such odd hours. There have been instances where some trainers have misbehaved with the women staff during late hours. Most of us are afraid to complain for fear of disciplinary action,"" she said.

SSA officials maintain a residential programme with daily review meetings is necessary to ensure the success of the 'Malayala Thilakkam' programme which aims to improve proficiency in the mother tongue among students.

""Many of the participants will not be able to report on time or do the necessary follow-up if this is carried out as a regular programme. That's why a residential programme has been insisted,"" said Siddique A, SSA district project officer, Alappuzha.

Teachers' unions are planning to petition the Education Minister on the matter. ""Instead of conducting this day-and-night affair, the training programme can very well be extended over a 10-day period where practical sessions can be followed by review the next day. In such a case, women teachers can avoid staying in unsafe places during odd hours,"" said a teachers' union leader.","Teachers cry foul over 'night duty', SSA blames it on 'adjustment' pangs","955690021","2018-09-27","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2018/sep/27/teachers-cry-foul-over-night-duty-ssa-blames-it-on-adjustment-pangs-1877648.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"6936","","Advisor to Governor, Khurshid Ahmed Ganai Wednesday announced that government is going to sanction implementation of 7th Pay Commission in favour of Sarva Shikha Abiyan (SSA) teachers on the directions of the Governor Satya Pal Malik.

Addressing the gathering of protesting teachers here at Pratap Park, the Advisor Khurshid Ahmed Ganai said that Governor Satya Pal Malik had a detailed meeting with the teacher representatives, where the demands of protesting teachers were discussed threadbare.

He said ever since the Governor-led administration took over, a committee headed by Financial Commissioner was formulated to sort out the matter.

"6939","","SHILLONG: The state government has decided to create a corpus fund of over Rs 78 crore to maintain uninterrupted flow of money.

The decision comes in the wake of the Centre's delay in releasing the fund for salary of SSA teachers.

Replying to a cut motion jointly moved by Congress members Mayralborn Syiem and Kimfa Marbaniang, Education Minister Lahkmen Rymbui said the state government took this bold step due to the chronic financial debacle and prolonged delay in the release of fund, especially for the payment of teachers of both Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) schools.

He said the state government could not release the salary of teachers from April this year and every year, the same financial constraints are being repeated leading to recurring liabilities towards teachers' salary.

Earlier, replying to a call attention motion moved by P T Sawkmie of the Congress on the problems being faced by SSA teachers, Rymbui said the process was on to disburse Rs 132.28 crore sanctioned by the Centre on September 14.

Rymbui said after the delay in releasing the fund, he and the Chief Minister had written to the Centre.

Sawkmie highlighted the plight of an SSA teacher who did not have money to treat his ailing son.

Rymbui said every year, the Project Approval Board (PAB) of the HRD Ministry approves the budget in February but for 2018-19, the PAB approved the budget only on May 25 resulting in the delay. He also informed that after the Union Budget 2018-19 restructured school education scheme into integrated scheme for School Education and Teacher Education, the new name is known as Samagra Shikhsa Abhiyan - a holistic approach to education from pre-nursery to Class XII.

Rymbui said Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan subsumes three schemes, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan and Teacher Education, which fall under the central support scheme.","State to create over Rs 78 cr corpus fund for SSA teachers","954857529","2018-09-26","http://www.theshillongtimes.com/2018/09/26/state-to-create-over-rs-78-cr-corpus-fund-for-ssa-teachers/","theshillongtimes.com",FALSE
"6940","","SHILLONG, Sep 25: Seeking the seamless implementation of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) programme with emphasis on the payment of salaries of the teachers in the state, the Meghalaya Democratic Alliance (MDA) government is mooting the creation of a corpus fund of Rs 78.07 crore towards this goal.

Replying in the Assembly here on Tuesday, education minister Lahkmen Rymbui said, ""In order to mitigate this chronic financial debacle, the state government is taking this bold initiative to create a corpus fund of Rs 78.07 crore so as to maintain the uninterrupted flow of fund due to delay in receiving funds from government of India specially with regards to payment of salary to teachers.""

He informed that the department has been implementing the Central sponsored SSA and RMSA (Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan) in the best of its capacity.

""However due to the delay of fund release by the Central government, the State government could not release the salary of teachers from April this year onwards. Similarly every year, the same financial constrains are being repeated leading to recurring liabilities towards teachers' salary,"" Rymbui said.

A total of 2,907 lower primary and 2,232 upper primary schools have been opened under SSA in Meghalaya and the monthly salary for each SSA teacher of lower primary schools is Rs 19,044 and Rs 20,493 for each SSA teacher of upper primary schools.

The state had last week received around Rs 132 crore from the centre under SSA scheme which include various components including salary.

Rymbui said that with the implementation of SSA programmes and RMSA, the state has made steady progress for the benefit of both students and teachers.

Altogether a total of 12,451 Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) teachers are yet to be paid for the past five months.

Earlier, more than two hundred aggrieved teachers boycotted the Teacher's Day celebration by staging a sit-in-demonstration in the state capital to express their resentment over the delay in releasing their salary.

After the meeting, AMSSASTA president Lasforious Marngar said that the Governor has expressed shock to know that the teachers have been without salary for many months.

""He has assured us that he would immediately take up the matter with both the Centre and state governments with a direction to release the salary at the earliest possible,"" Marngar said.

Earlier, the state's education minister, Lahkmen Rymbui had expressed concern on the problem faced by the state government due to the present financial crisis as it would require an additional amount of Rs 34.10 crore to pay the salary of SSA teachers at the existing rate.

This was after the Project Approval Board (PAB) had approved only Rs 10465.2 lakh for 5814 lower primary teachers (contractual) at Rs 15,000 per month per teacher and Rs 16144.8 lakh for 6727 upper primary teachers at Rs 20,000 per month per teacher.

On Teachers Day, police foiled protest march of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) teachers towards SKICC Srinagar as they were demanding the implementation of 7th pay commission in their favour.

The protesting SSA teachers who observed the Teacgers day as 'Black Day' tried to march towards SKICC Srinagar but by police swung into action and used batons and coloured water to stop them from marching towards Sheri Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC) where Directorate of School Education was celebrating Teachers Day 2018. Police also detained scores of the protesting teachers after they tried to block the Residency Road.

The protesters assembled here in Sher-e-Kashmir Park and started shouting slogans against the government for not fulfilling their demands saying that every time government compels them to hit the streets.

Bashir Ahmad Parray, an SSA teacher at a Government School in Central Kashmir's Budgam district said, ""I also want to celebrate this day with my students but due to this 7th pay commission issue I am suffering from mental trauma.""

Hailing from Ratnipora village of Budgam district, Parray is a teacher at Government Girls Middle School, Kulbugh.

45-year-old Parray said there are many SSA teachers also who are yet to be regularised especially those who have completed a contractual term of five years.

He said there are hundreds of teachers who are not being regularised despite the fact that after completion of five years as Rehbar-e-Taleem, they are as good as general line teachers; and there is a proper order issued by the Government in this regard.

Another protesting teacher said, ""Time bound departmental promotions to the teachers have been also stopped. As per the guidelines, it is the right of a teacher to get such promotion after completing nine years in the education department.""

He further said all this is being done so that the department does not give us 7th pay commission benefits and the irony is that a Class IV employee recruited just 2-3 years ago is getting the pay commission benefits and we are the only ones left out.","On Teachers Day, police 'gifts' batons to protesting SSA teachers ","939956639","2018-09-05","http://risingkashmir.com/news/on-teachers-day-police-gifts-batons-to-protesting-ssa-teachers-","RisingKashmir",FALSE

Advisor to Governor, Khurshid Ahmad Ganai, on Wednesday said Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) teachers have raised genuine demands under 7th Pay Commission and they deserve highest consideration by the government.

""I must tell the SSA teachers who are on strike on the eve of Teachers Day that government is concerned for them regarding their legitimate right and their demand of 7th pay commission deserves the highest consideration and therefore government should review this issue immediately,"" Ganai said.

He said this while addressing teachers and officials of education department here at Sher-e-Kashmir International Conference Centre (SKICC) during a function organized by Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) to celebrate Teachers Day.

Congratulating the teachers on teacher's day, Ganai said that the committee constituted has been asked to expedite the report so that the government will take immediate steps.

He also said that he had already appealed to SSA teachers not to take extreme steps and have assured them that government is concerned for them.

""We were getting a specific amount from the central government for the SSA teachers and masters and the funds were financially helping a lot to the state government but since they have reduced the payment by more than 50 percent, a financial crunch has emerged in the state,"" Ganai said.

He further stated that on the basis of 6th pay commission, the government is paying over one thousand crore rupees and if the government will start paying as per 7th pay commission, then the government have to pay more than 1500 crore rupees as a salary to SSA teachers.

Citing an example of a female who has to travel to Kupwara from Pantha Chowk every day, Ganai while lamenting on the issue said the education department has a transfer issue which needs to sort out at earliest.

He said that the teachers attached in Chief Educational Offices (CEO's) and Zonal Education Offices (ZEO's) must go immediately and if there

""All those who are attached to these offices must go and we have directed the concerned directors to relive them and if there is any need to keep a teacher, there needs to be a proper order,"" Ganai said.

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary School Education, Rigzin Sampheal referred teachers as the ""custodians and conscious keepers of a nation,"" and said teaching is an art of grooming leaders.

The Secretary stressed the need of nudging the students to dream big. Giving an example of former President of India and a scientist APJ Kalam, Sampheal said APJ Kalam used to reiterate the importance of thinking big.

""APJ Kalam used to say ""thinking small is a sin,"" said Sampheal.

The Secretary expressed his optimism that the future of students is in the bright hands of teachers who are serving the State's education department.

Kashmiris are peace loving people: Chaya

Srinagar, Aug 28: As the Annual Amarnath Yatra came to an end on Sunday with nearly three Lakh yatries paying their obeisance at holy cave, all the rumours and propaganda that was broadcasted from various News Channels regarding its possible disruption proved hoax and ""fake"".

The civil Society of Kashmir while expressing happiness over the culmination of Yatra peacefully said that Kashmiris would never harm neither tourists nor yatries.

Speaking to KNS, Senior Civil Society member Shakeel Qalander said that the Amarnath Yatra has been going on since ages and Kashmiris would always lend support and help to the Amarnath pilgrims. Mr. Qalander said that the Kashmiris would spend money from their own pockets to facilitate the pilgrimage of Sadhus and other pilgrims, he however regretted that the yatra has unfortunately now been politicized with an aim to malign Kashmiris. Qalander added the Yatra did not even need the security.

Chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Hoteliers Club Mushtaq Ahmad Chaya said that despite negative perception and propaganda the yatra ended peacefully which is testimony to the fact that Kashmiri people are peace loving and have a special ability of hospitality.

Talking to Kashmir News Service (KNS), Chaya said that this is also a message to not only to the people of India but to the entire world that Kashmiris are peace loving and have a great tendency of hospitality. He urged the civil societies across the country to encourage people to prefer Kashmir as their first choice tourist destination and added that people to people contact remove the misconception and always bridge the gaps.

Muzaffar Shah, member of one of civil society said that the panelists and others who participated in the debates and discussions had spread poison through the news channels and portrayed bad image of Kashmir.

He, however said that as the Amarnath Yatra 2018 concluded peacefully, the people of Kashmir through the entire period not only exhibited the brotherhood and communal harmony but sent a clear message to the world that people of Kashmir are peace loving.

He said that those who portrayed wrong image of Kashmir through news channels should open their eyes to see the support, communal harmony and brotherhood of Kashmiris.

The civil Society of Kashmir while congratulating the Kashmiri Muslims for facilitating the smooth Yatra said that this was an eye opener for all those so called ""Nationalist Propagandist TV anchors"" who have been hell bent to create a communal divide in the country and use Kashmir as a tool for their own TRPs. But according to Civil Society members, these channels were doing a huge disservice to their own Nation by bringing the communities at logger heads.

Rain and floods have left a trail of destruction in their wake in the State. Along with houses and establishments, schools too have not been spared of nature's fury.

In Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Malappuram, and Idukki districts, schools are full of mud and waste, and reptiles such as snakes and centipedes have likely taken shelter inside buildings.

Wells are polluted, and facilities for cooking the noon-meal is in a shambles. Benches and desks too have been damaged. That is not all. With water entering houses, students' study material too has been damaged or destroyed.

Schools reopening after the Onam holidays to such a picture of destruction does not bode well for students and learning, especially since schools in many districts have not had the requisite number of working days this term.

Against this backdrop, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) in the State is using its vast machinery to put the schools right before classes resume post-Onam.

Officials from the State level to the cluster resource coordinator level are leading efforts to restore the affected schools to their previous state in a week by working in association with parents' committees. SSA officials and other education workers have been deployed for this purpose.

As many as 78 schools in Pathanamthitta, 128 in Ernakulam, 72 in Thrissur, 49 in Kottayam, 51 in Malappuram, 11 in Idukki, and 302 in Alappuzha are estimated to have been affected by the flooding.

As it is likely to take time for water to drain out from schools under the Veliyanad, Mankombu, and Thalavadi block resource centres (BRCs), activities in Alappuzha will be undertaken in two phases. First the SSA people will clean out the classsrooms, and then health workers will clean up wells and school premises.

Awareness sessions will be held for parents on how to help get schools back on their feet and extend support to their wards.

Equipment necessary for cleaning up classrooms should be purchased, while generator and pumps for pumping out water should be taken on rent if needed.

They may also seek local help for procuring various products.

People's representatives, PTAs or school management committees, voluntary organisations and other stakeholders should be involved in the planning process.

Besides schools, SSA district offices and BRCs too will be cleaned.

The severely affected districts will also have help from other districts in the clean-up.

District project officers will lead the clean-ups in the districts.","SSA undertakes clean-up of schools","933296144","2018-08-27","https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ssa-undertakes-clean-up-of-schools/article24795798.ece","The Hindu",FALSE
"6977","","SHILLONG, Aug 26: The president of the Meghalaya SSA School Association, has requested the state government to look into the delay in the release of 12541 elementary teachers working under budget head of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan now known as Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.

In a press communiqué, MSSASA president, Aristotle C Rymbai said, ""The salary of the 12,541 Elementary Teachers working under budget head of SSA in over 5000 Lower and Upper Primary SSA supported School across the State, is yet to be paid for five months for the period of April to August 2018"".

Touching upon the Teachers day celebration, Rymbai said that the state Government will observe the contributions of the teachers to the society for imparting quality education and that it is also the duty of the State Government to ensure that the teachers who are entrusted with the task of delivering this quality education are taking care of.

On September 5, Schools and Colleges across the country will celebrate Teachers' Day. It is the time when teachers' contribution to society is celebrated. However in the State of Meghalaya

He also pointed out that the promising career prospects, which is quite a motivation booster, is almost nil for the SSA Teachers in the state and the teachers were not entitled any leaves and others benefits enjoyed by a regular teachers expect 15 days Casual Leave annually.

"6978","","Stop the time bomb before it explodes. If it explodes, the cost and the consequences can be very serious and uncontrollable. What oxygen is to lungs, welfare politics is to general public!

Jammu Kashmir lags behind in giving gainful employment to the educated youth because the state lacks a handsome and healthy private sector which could employ the youth and as such play a role as an employment agency.

The state's colleges and universities end up in producing an army of educated youth with degrees in academic subjects.

In the absence of an advanced private sector, the state employs the academic degree holders in majority in its Department of Education. This trend has increased post 1990s and predominantly after 2000 AD.

In keeping with that trend, about sixty thousand teachers were recruited at school level since year 2000 on the pattern of Rehaber-e-Taleem (ReT). These Ret teachers were categorized as Normal Rets (N-ReT) and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Rets (SSA-ReTs). Both the categories of ReTs were recruited through the similar codal norms set by the successive elected governments.

As per the norms, the two categories of ReT teachers were engaged for a monthly honorarium of RS 1500 to 3000 for five years and after the five year period were regularized as General Line Teachers in the then pay scale of school teachers.

For proof, the appointment orders, issued by the Directorates of School Education, can be examined.

Interestingly, the N-ReT category included 80 percent candidates who had passed the matric or the 12th standard and had given up further education. They were doing some other work.

However, the ReT type recruitment drive (done purely at the village/habitation level) made them Ret teachers. In the department, these ReTs went on achieving academic degrees and today they are degree holders. In a way, the Department of Education helped them get these degrees.

Among SSA Rets, seventy percent candidates were having high degrees such as B.Ed/M.ed and post-graduation at the time of their engagement as ReTs. They could have looked for highly paid jobs but the need of a means of livelihood forced them to accept the low paid ReT job. This job promised them job security and a life of happiness and dignity.

After their regularization as General Line Teachers, both the categories of Ret teachers have been given different incentives, allowances, annual increments and their service records have been well maintained like that of the other employees of the state.

However, the irony is that the SSA category of Rets has been excluded from the benefits of the 7th pay commission applied to all state employees, including the N-ReT teachers in April this year.

Neither a formal order has been issued to deny the pay commission benefits to the SSA- ReT teachers nor has an order been issued to give such benefits to them.

Such a situation has forced these 41 thousand SSA teachers to protest. But no response comes from the authorities.

As such, SSA teachers feel discriminated and marginalized. What pains them the most is that their non-SSA colleagues get more salaries than them although all of them work at the same schools for the same students for the same amount of time.

Besides, no 7th pay commission benefits have deprived the SSA-ReTs of the annual increment benefits and will exclude them of the other incentives as well. The pay anomaly will keep on rising with each passing six months.

The situation has created psychological trauma for SSA ReTs. They are state employees and SSA simply is a funding agency to the state. However, their salaries even as per the previous pay scale are not released for three to five months. It seems that these teachers are punished for somebody's political adventurism.

These teachers do not want confrontation with the state for their grave problems if the state gives them the commission benefits and releases their salaries each month.

The state should come clean on the future of SSA category of teachers. Wasting time has served no purpose.

If the state cannot treat them at par with the other employees of the state, then it should give back the crucial years of life to these teachers and compensate for the loss that these teachers had to suffer during their service to the state.

Besides, the state needs to explain the rationale behind keeping these teachers in dark at the time of their recruitment and also explain the present rationale of only depriving them of the service benefits.

Ignoring the plight of these teachers can prove costly. Who knows we may be sitting on a time bomb?","SSA Teachers: Politics and punishment","932002114","2018-08-25","http://risingkashmir.com/news/ssa-teachers-politics-and-punishment","RisingKashmir",FALSE

Some protestors were bundled into Police vans after they tried to march on Residency Road, bringing the traffic to grinding halt for nearly twenty minutes. After stepping out of the Park, Police equipped with riot gear, stopped the protestors near General Post office and used water cannon and baton-charged the agitators to disperse them.

Earlier, under the banner of EJAC, a large number of employees from different districts assembled at Sher-e-Kashmir Park in Srinagar and held demonstration. They were holding placards inscribed with demands for delinking of their salaries from the Central Fund and implementation of 7th Pay Commission.

President EJAC, Qayoom Wani addressed the gathering and said that depriving 40,000 SSA teachers from the benefit of 7th Pay Commission was unjust. He further said that because of delay in de-linking their salary from the Central source of funding, these SSA teachers were not getting regular salary with the result that these employees were facing difficulty even to feed their families and deposit school fees of their wards.

Qayoom Wani threatened to hit roads along with five lack employees under the banner of EJAC, if authorities fail to fulfill their demands.

In Jammu, J&K ReT Teachers' Forum held a strong protest demonstration near Press Club Jammu, under the leadership of State president Vinod Sharma.

Holding placards in their hands and shouting slogans in favour of their demands, the protesting ReTs tried to take out a march towards Governor House but a large number of police personnel deployed there foiled the attempt. In the process, a few ReTs received minor injuries and some of them were even temporarily detained.

ReTs, who were detained, included Nazam Jafri, Sukhdev Singh Sumbria, Gulzabir Daing, Naresh Sharma, Rajesh Jamwal, Sham Sharma, Raj Kumar Dubey, Sukesh Khajuria, Mahesh Kumar, Arvind Sharma, Rinku Sharma, Sajad Malik, Lekh Raj Parihar and others.

Earlier, addressing the gathering, Vinod Sharma flayed the Government for its dilly delaying tactics to resolve the issues of SSA Teachers and Masters. He lamented that families of thousands of these teachers were suffering badly because of irregular salary.

""We have projected these issues from bottom to top and even many peaceful protests have been held in Jammu as well as Kashmir province but still these issues are unresolved, thereby forcing us to come on roads "" he said adding that they had no such attention to leave their schools and come on roads but callous approach of the Government was forcing them for such steps.

A similar but peaceful protest demonstration was held in the premises of Divisional Commissioner Jammu, under the banner of Employees Joint Action Committee, (EJAC) to draw the attention of Governor towards the plights of Regularized ReTs under the flagship schemes of SSA and RMSA.

The speakers highlighted the issues of ReTs and raised slogans in support of their demand for 7th Pay Commission benefits to the SSA teachers and delinking their salary from Central fund.

After the protest demonstration, Ganesh Khajuria, general secretary JKTF, a constituent of EJAS, along with Amrik Singh, N S Jamwal, Jagdish Sharma, Surinder Radotra, Janak Raj Choudhary, Lalit Pandita and Kuldeep Sharma of EJAC submitted a memorandum to the Governor through Divisional Commissioner Jammu urging him to intervene and streamline the salary issue by delinking it from the MHRD budget besides extending the benefits of 7th Pay Commission in their favour.","Demonstrations held for benefits of 7th Pay panel to SSA teachers, de-linking of salary","922384018","2018-08-09","http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/demonstrations-held-for-benefits-of-7th-pay-panel-to-ssa-teachers-de-linking-of-salary/","Jammu Kashmir Latest News | Tourism | Breaking News J&K",FALSE

It paid only Rs 4,200, while the rest was being paid by the state,"" he said. ""Since the state government stands by its belief in providing quality education even if bound by financial constraints, it has decided to allocate Rs 7,000 other than the Rs 2,800 it contributes as its share towards the Central fund.

The District Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has launched a scheme to provide on-site support by a team of trainers to schools.

Usually, one or two trainers from the block resource centres would visit schools to provide them various kinds of support.

To make this initiative more effective, the district SSA has formed entire groups called Team On-Site Support (OSS) to support schools in academic and other activities.

These teams of 10 to 12 members will visit one school in each panchayat and interact with school authorities and students over a couple of days to understand the functioning of the schools so as to make effective interventions, be it in studies, or functioning of class libraries and biodiversity parks. Once the needs are identified, the team will draw up plans on the activities to be taken up and help teachers to implement them. The panchayat education committee will be briefed on the activities taken up in schools, said District SSA Project Officer B. Sreekumaran.

The teams will be led by the block programme officer and comprise trainers and special coordinators.

The teams will later be split into two to cover more panchayats. Starting this month, the District SSA plans to cover one school in each panchayat by the middle of September, before starting the next round to reach out to more schools, he said.

Camps

The District SSA is also conducting camps for differently abled children to identify the equipment they need. Children from Classes 1 to 12 are attending the camps. Children whose equipment has run into trouble are also being covered.

After the camps conclude, a count will be taken of the total equipment needed in the district - be it the number of wheelchairs, or hearing aids, spectacles, or artificial leg. After this, e-tendering will be done to purchase the equipment. The district purchase committee will open the e-tenders and award the work.","SSA support teams to guide schools","910075498","2018-07-21","https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ssa-support-teams-to-guide-schools/article24485104.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

A statement from the association on Saturday stated that the SSA teachers of the 2010 and 2013 batches were appointed as regular state employees, based on advertisements and by open recruitment.

""The appointment order clearly mentioned that the teachers will be endowed with a scale pay and 'with all other allowances/rates prescribed by the government of Nagaland from time to time with effect from the date of joining,'"" it stated.

The association cited an RTI reply from the state government in which the latter reportedly stated that 'the post creation is not done by SSA, it is a government of Nagaland undertaking. Hence, teachers are appointed on regular basis and their service is not co-terminus with SSA project.'

""Therefore, the agitation is in demand of what is rightfully ours basing on the appointment terms, with all service benefits deemed right for a state regular government employee. In regard to pay and related allowances, we have been enjoying all other benefits as that of the regular state employees since the date of appointment and along with it, deduction of 10% NPS of the total emolument, GIS and professional tax are also made regularly.

""Therefore, connecting the NSSATA matter with irregularities of a centrally sponsored flagship programme will not solve the mounting problem,"" it stated.

According to the NSSATA, it was 'very much aware that the solution to our demands require certain formalities and we have been informed of the same since 2016 and that directives have been issued to the department for examination.'

""On the basis of the assurances given by the government, we have cooperated patiently trusting that the department would work out a solution. Despite the failure on the part of the government to fulfil the assurance given by them, we are still not demanding for a 'magic formula' to solve our issues.

""The government admitting that there has been a mistake while making appointments does not amount to any defects in the nature of our appointment.

Our Correspondent

Kohima, June 8 (EMN): The Nagaland government has admitted to committing mistakes in appointing teachers, even as the 2010 and 2013 batches of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan teachers are currently on protest. The 2010 and 2013 batch teachers are protesting under the aegis the Nagaland State Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Teachers Association (NASSATA). The sit-in protest entered its third day on Friday in Kohima.

The SSA teachers were recruited for a centrally sponsored scheme, a flagship programme of the union Ministry of Human Resource Development, and are bound by terms and conditions of the programme where their services are to be terminated with the closure of the programme.

During a press conference that was held on Friday afternoon, Chief Secretary Temjen Toy said, ""I must admit that there have been shortcomings on the part of the government, because they were supposed to be appointed against the programme and with the terms and conditions. But then, at that particular point of time, out of oversight or out of whatever reasons the appointments that were given to them were given in the form of any regular appointment. That is one shortcoming we have to admit and call 'spade a spade'. That is the mistake the government made.""

The administrator likened the government's position to being trapped 'between the devil and the deep blue sea.' According to him although the appointments were intended in accordance with the programme's guidelines, the manner in which they were made were not 'proper.'

""So now, we are struggling with that and the Finance department and the School Education department have been struggling to find a solution,"" Toy admitted. He asserted that 'some solution' must have to be arrived at to settle the matter. He said that once the 'initial mess' concerning the appointments is sorted out, 'everything will come into place.'

While acknowledging the problems faced by the SSA teachers, Toy also pointed that on several occasions the government, despite its 'tight resource position,' had 'advanced salaries just to tide over their immediate difficulties.'

On the demand of the association for 7th ROP, Toy reiterated that the government has agreed in principle to revise their salaries. He reminded that the government has to follow certain procedures; clearances have to be obtained and calculations have to be made which is why it is going to take time for implementation. Stating 'full commitment' to finding solutions to whatever problems 'we' are facing in any of the sectors, specifically the SSA, the officer said that the association has to give time to the government to examine the matter.

'Know your place'

All said, Toy bluntly termed the second demand of the association -- transferring their salaries from Plan to Non-Plan -- 'infantile and none of their business to tell the government that our salaries should come from this or that.'

Justifying his use of the language, he said 'Today the term 'Plan and Non-Plan' doesn't exist in government. We don't use those terms anymore. So it is not for any association or group to tell the government that we want our salaries from this and that.'

Toy asserted that 'so far as the government is concerned their salaries come from the flagship programme, but because of the problems in their appointments, some way out has to be found out.'

The SSA teachers have refused to accept their salaries from January-March that have been released already. The association is demanding that it should be released with the 7th ROP entitlement.

Toy maintained that the first demand need to be sorted out. He pointed out that the government was not flush with money. Even if it were so, he said such things take time and requires 'calculated steps to be taken by the government.'

Appeal to call off agitation

The government has appealed to the teachers to end their protest. Pointing out that the future of the children was being held to ransom, Toy expressed regret that 'a group of enlightened and educated persons are behaving in this way.'

""I regret that such demands are being made by the association comprising of qualified education providers, one doesn't expect their maturity to be of this level,"" Toy stated. ""I am sounding harsh but we know our business. We cannot compromise the education of our children.""

The officer maintained that the government will be the first to admit shortcomings on its part and take corrective measures. However, he reminded that just because a section of the government employees would have demands does not mean every demand is justified.

Toy strongly asserted that ""even if they go agitating, the stand of the government is not going to change. We have made our commitment and our commitment stands. It is only a matter a time as there are certain preparations that have to be made and the exercise is going on.""

Reminding the teachers about their responsibilities over students, he assured that the government had been looking into their grievances 'despite the agitation and not because of the agitation.'

Beyond this, he maintained firmly, the government cannot do anything 'agitation or no agitation.' However, he cautioned that if the association still insists on agitating then the government will have to take action according to stipulated procedures and existing laws as the government cannot afford to compromise with the future of the students.

Another officer, Principal Secretary Menukhol John, observed a 'trust deficit' between the government and the association. He has asked the association to give the government time to work on the issue.

Meanwhile, the president of the NASSATA, Penthungo Yanthan, has informed that the teachers will continue with their sit-in protest on June 11 at the Secretariat. He said that while the group 'understands' the problems of the government, the teachers want a written assurance as they were ready to give time to the government to resolve the issue.","SSA teachers' agitation: Government concedes mistakes were made while appointing teachers","883771060","2018-06-08","http://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/ssa-teachers-agitation-government-concedes-mistakes-were-made-while-appointing-teachers/","Eastern Mirror",FALSE

One of most important obligations on the part of any Government is to to ensure that all the employees under its control must be paid accurate, Adequate and on time salaries but it is very unfortunate that the same is not applicable to Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) teachers of Jammu and Kashmir. In this State, more than forty thousand teachers who are working under SSA are very often compelled to protest and agitate against irregularities in their Salaries. It is not first time that conflict between Government and SSA teachers in J&K has come into limelight, infact, more or less it is a routine phenomenon since last many years but successive State Governments have given only empty assurances on the name of finding an everlasting solution of this problem.

It is pertinent to mention that these forty thousand plus SSA teachers who constitutes the bulk of teaching fraternity of School Education Department in J&K have played a very crucial role in reviving and rebuilding educational infrastructure which was badly affected during last two decades due to unrest and tumultuous atmosphere in the state. It is well known to everyone that these SSA teachers, majority among them highly qualified were initially appointed on pattern of Rehbar-e-Taleem who served in the department for first five years merely on a very meager salary of Rs 1500 and Rs 3000 on the assurance of the Government that they will get a handful salary regularly after regularisation of their services but it is again an irony that after completion of five years, situation turned worse due to inconsistent and irregular release of SSA salaries. Now it has become a trend that SSA teachers in our State remain without salaries for months together and only after protests, agitations and lockouts their salaries of merely a month or two are credited into their accounts while for several other months remains liability which creates sense of insecurity among the SSA teachers and it is a fact that feeling of insecurity is always inimical to sense of wellbeing, as it causes anxiety and stress which in return harms physical and mental health of these thousands of SSA teachers.

Irregularities and delay in the salary of SSA teachers is not a matter of concern only for themselves, more importantly it is adversely affecting their status as they find it difficult to even satisfy their day to day domestic and social responsibilities due to unavailability of sufficient financial resources. In the absence of salaries they are finding it hard to fulfill very basic needs of their families. Many old and ailing parents of these SSA teachers helplessly wait for the release of salaries of their offsprings so that they may have access to proper treatment for their ailments. Not only this in this era of high inflation SSA teachers face difficulties in satisfying basic needs of their Children due to dry pockets. There is no wrong in saying that prevailing situation has made thousands of SSA teachers and their family members in Jammu and Kashmir so helpless that they find themselves almost on the verge of starvation.

It is matter of serious concern why thousands of SSA teachers who are performing their duties with full dedication and honesty even in remotest areas are not getting their salaries on time ? Although apart from teaching assignments these SSA Teachers are also performing various other duties of National and State interest every now and then. State Government is also using them for different special duties including election duties, census duties, survey duties and many a time even to make Flagship programs like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan successful and popular but in spite of all these neither State nor union Government has taken cognizance of their genuine grievance related to irregularities in disbursement of their salaries.

It is only due to apathetic approach of the Government that these SSA teachers have to very often protested from streets to Secretariat for getting their hard earned money and in this process many a time these teachers had to face harsh treatments like lathicharge and from police in response to peaceful protests in favour of their salary issue. Although peaceful protests and agitations are part and parcel of a democratic set up but it is duty of Government to timely address the issues raised thereof and solve the same in order to avoid their reoccurrence. But in case of salary issue of SSA teachers in Jammu and Kashmir everytime Government has only tried to pacify the SSA teachers rather than working out a permanent solution of the problem.

Now time has come that Government should alter its approach, amd it is need of the hour to workout a constructive mechanism to abolish irregularities in paying salaries to more than forty thousand SSA Teachers in Jammu and Kashmir. It is very much expected that the State Government will now take appropriate action to solve this long pending but very genuine SSA salary issue once for all and once for ever.

Last but not the least one and only panacea of this whole problem lies in streamlining of SSA teachers salary by de-linking it from Central source of funding and release of the same from State budget. It is firmly believed that once salary of these teachers is credited into their Bank Accounts without any delay. This in return will boost the confidence of teachers and they will work with extra amount of zeal and zest which is beneficial not only for more than forty thousand SSA teachers but also for lacs of students studying in Government schools of Jammu and Kashmir.

A press release from the MTLT vice-president and convener of grievances cell, demanded the state government to resolve the issue at the earliest, stating that the ongoing agitation is affecting the careers of the students and the quality of education in the Naga society.

The union is anxious as almost all the government primary and middle schools in Mokokchung town and other parts of the state are not functioning properly for many months.

The students' body has pointed out that the classes has been affected starting from the Nagaland general election process where hundreds of teachers were deputed for election duties then followed by pen-down strike and the ongoing class boycott by the SSA teachers and the reported phase III SSA teachers agitation to begin from Wednesday.

According to the union, a rough survey shows that this academic year for the innocent students studying in government schools has been severely affected. It was stated that the first terminal examination has not been conducted till now.

The MTLT questioned the state government, particularly the department of School Education 'whether their conscious allows them to gamble with the lives and educational careers of the thousands of students studying in the government schools.'

The union pointed out that government schools remain the only hope for education for thousands of students in Nagaland.

With the appointment of 'well-qualified' teachers through the SSA (centrally sponsored scheme), the quality of education had witnessed a steady improvement, under Mokokchung town area, the union stated.

The union said the agitations in the education department are seriously undermining the academic careers of the students.

In a statement issued here, president of the association, Aristotle C Rymbai said the demand is for teachers working under budget head of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) in the State as per provision of Maternity Benefits Act 1961 - Right to Payment of Maternity Benefits and Maternity Benefits (Amendment) Act, 2017.

Rymbai informed that since the beginning of implementation of SSA Flagship Programme in Meghalaya till date, the contractual teachers working under SSA were not entitled to avail the benefits of Maternity Leave as enjoyed by other categories of teachers.

""The Teachers' Union last year have submitted several representations to the State Government through the State Project Director SEMAM-SSA office but the erstwhile government failed to address the issue despite the letter sent by State Project Director SEMAM-SSA Ambrose Ch Marak to the State Government on October 9 last year requesting the Government to examine the demand of the Union in respect of granting of Maternity Leave to female SSA Teachers of SSA supported Schools"", Rymbai asserted.

Rymbai also stated, the Union Ministry of Labour & Employment in its clarification issued on April 12, 2017 to all States and UTs Government clearly mentioned in Section 2 of the Maternity Benefits Act, the Act is applicable to all women who are employed in mines, agricultural, shops and any institutions or otherwise could be either in organized sector or unorganized sector either on contractual or as consultant, but unfortunately in Meghalaya till date the benefit of Maternity Leave has not given to teachers working under SSA.

He argued that SSA teachers in Assam were entitled to avail leave as Special Annual Leave, Medical Leave, Study Leave besides Maternity Leave.

SRINAGAR, May 14: Police today resorted to baton charge and used water cannon against Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) teachers who were protesting for delinking of their salaries from the Central Fund.

Under the banner of Jammu and Kashmir Rehbar-e-Taleem Teachers Forum (ReTTF) hundreds of teachers from different districts of State staged a protest at Pratap Park here today. They were holding placards inscribed with demands for the delinking of their salaries from the central fund. They said over 40,000 teachers are not receiving their salaries regularly as the Government has failed to streamline their salaries.

They said that SSA teachers have not received salary for the past three-four months. ""Government is playing with the future of thousands of SSA teachers who are without any salary for last three months. This delay has badly affected our families"", a protester said.

Several protesters were bundled into police vans near Pratap Park here after they tried to march towards Residency Road, bringing the traffic to grinding halt for nearly half an hour. After stepping out of the park the police, equipped with riot gear, stopped the protestors outside the Press Enclave here, used water cannon and baton-charged the agitators to disperse them. Scenes of teachers being hit with batons and high-velocity water from water cannons were also witnessed.

Participants of the rally, who gathered outside the Pratap Park, alleged police of using force against the protestors. ""We were protesting peacefully but the police used force and did not allow us to hold a peaceful march"", a protester said.

The protesters said that they have been demanding to streamline their salaries for last several years but to no avail. ""The tall claims of the Government to regulate the SSA salaries have fallen flat as teachers have to wait for months for the release of their salaries,"" Fayaz Ahmad, a teacher from Baramulla said.

They said that there were nearly 50, 000 SSA teachers working with the Education Department. ""Almost 50% of the staff of Primary and Middle Schools is working under SSA. If the Government wants that schools should function properly it should streamline our salaries, ""Syed Muzamil, a teacher from Budgam said.

The teachers said their protest would continue until their demands are met. ""If the release of SSA salary is not streamlined soon we will intensify protest,"" a protester said.","Police thrash, detain SSA teachers in Srinagar","868151680","2018-05-14","http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/police-thrash-detain-ssa-teachers-in-srinagar/","Jammu Kashmir Latest News | Tourism | Breaking News J&K",FALSE
"7109","","A petition filed by Swapnil Tripathi, a final year student studying at the National Law University, Jodhpur, prompted the Supreme Court to allow live streaming of the opaque proceedings within.

A norm challenged by a 22-year-old law student resulted in the Supreme Court invoking the axiom 'sun is the best disinfectant' as it turned its gaze inward to make the judiciary more transparent.

A petition filed by Swapnil Tripathi, a final year student studying for an BBA LLB at the National Law University, Jodhpur, and clubbed with a batch of pleas by a few others prompted the apex court to allow live streaming of the opaque proceedings within.

Tripathi, who hails from Kanpur and has a keen interest in Constitutional law, wanted to challenge the denial of access to interns to Supreme Court proceedings on Mondays and Fridays, days marked for fresh filings.

When he was interning with Supreme Court advocate Rishabh Sancheti during his third year of college, he felt that live streaming would give interns critical lessons in courtroom practices as well as make trials more transparent for litigants and the public at large.

""During the course of my internship, I worked on a lot of important matters which were listed on Mondays and Fridays. As interns we have plenty of theory in law schools but we can only see for ourselves the practical aspect of how arguments are made,"" he says.

When he suggested to Sancheti that the existing rule was against the interest of interns, the advocate advised him to contest it since he felt so strongly about it.

Last December, Tripathi filed a petition after thinking about the idea for a year.

Besides Tripathi, four other law students joined the cause with applications this year. The petitions included those filed by senior advocate Indira Jaising and an NGO, the Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change.

On September 26, a bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra (now retired) and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud ruled that initially a pilot project may be started by live streaming cases that are of constitutional and national importance, and excluding those involving juveniles, marital and sexual assault cases to protect identities.

According to the Constitution, courts are supposed to be open to the public. But Tripathi, left, says, that hasn't translated to actual experience for many litigants.

""I experienced it because when the case was on I had to travel from Jodhpur to Delhi each time, and I used to find out three days before the next date of hearing and had to make travel arrangements immediately.""

At times he couldn't reach or had to rely on seniors to inform him about the progress in the courtroom. He also met people who travelled from across the country but were unaware of what transpired in cases involving them.

""Live streaming allows people to see what happens when they can't physically be present in courts. People won't be misled, as sometimes even reporting can go wrong.""

The Bar Council of India requires interns to work with lawyers who practise in the Supreme Court and high courts. In his petition, Tripathi argued that the prohibition violated the fundamental right of learning for interns.

""I understand courts are extremely crowded with lots of lawyers, and constrained. So one of my prayers was that if you are not allowing interns inside the court, get a live streaming room within the premises.""

He also cited the example of the US, where the Supreme Court uploads the transcripts of all oral arguments of entire proceedings on its Web site.

A month later Jaising also petitioned for live streaming of all cases.

Article 145 of the Constitution allows the apex court to frame its own rules. Once it does so and paves the way for live streaming of cases, Tripathi feels, the Supreme Court is hinting at extending the practice to the lower judiciary depending on the success of the pilot.","The law student who made Supreme Court history","976063176","2018-10-23","http://www.rediff.com/news/special/the-law-student-who-made-supreme-court-history/20181023.htm","Rediff",FALSE

"7112","","The Delhi Police on Wednesday claimed to have arrested a 20-year-old Delhi University student, who had, along with his accomplices, allegedly shot dead two brothers in Haryana last month. The police said he wanted to avenge an assault on him last year that had made him ""a laughing stock in his village"".

Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said the arrested accused, Anshu, a resident of Haryana's Sonepat, was arrested from Delhi's Najafgarh on Tuesday, when he had come to meet his relatives. A pistol and two cartridges were recovered from his possession, the police said.

Alphonse said, ""Anshu was wanted in a double murder case that was registered at a police station in Haryana's Sonepat on September 24. His five accomplices had already been arrested by Sonepat police.""

During questioning, the DCP said, Anshu disclosed that he is a first-year (BA) student at Swami Shraddhanand College and took to crime after falling in bad company.

""Anshu had a rivalry with one Aashish alias Ashu from Haryana's Halalpur. Last year, he got into a fight with Aashish during a wedding. Aashish allegedly thrashed Anshu, who, as a result, became a laughing stock in his village,"" DCP Alphonse said, adding that Aashish had allegedly started throwing his weight around after the incident, threatening others by saying that he would beat them up the way he assaulted Anshu.

Police said Anshu has confessed that he decided to kill Aashish since he was enraged by his boastful nature. Hence, he roped in his friends Sandeep, Rohit, Mannu, Arun and Kartik, all residents of Narela, to help him kill Aashish.

On the day of the crime, the six waylaid Aashish and opened fire at him. When Aashish's brother Himanshu rushed to his rescue, the attackers shot him as well. They then fled the crime scene. The two brothers were admitted to a nearby hospital, where they succumbed to the bullet injuries during treatment.

Police said the murder case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the family members of the dead brothers. During probe, police identified the attackers and arrested five of them. Anshu, however, fled the city and was hiding at various places in Haryana till he was caught by the Delhi Police on Tuesday, police said.","DU student arrested for killing brothers who had made him 'a laughing stock in village'","961052969","2018-10-04","https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-student-arrested-for-killing-brothers-who-had-made-him-a-laughing-stock-in-village/story-Hypnbg0gxZPIfOQ9QrWOPP.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

As per reports by Daily Mail, the 29-year-old physics teacher named Ellie Wilson from Dursley Gloucestershire grew fond of this boy in an outdoor camping holiday to Africa. It is said while they were returning from Africa in a flight they had sex. It began from the seats of the plane wherein the teacher is said to have 'performed a sex act on the boy', and then she led him to the toilet of the flight wherein they had proper intercourse. Since the toilet was excessively small like how most flights have, the teacher 'perched on one leg in the cramped toilet.'

Reports also have it that Wilson later told the boy that she was pregnant and that she was going to opt for abortion. However, it didn't stop there they kept meeting and went on dates. As per reports, they went to Nando's and a park. The boy also got her flowers and chocolates as he believed that they were in a relationship.

However, all this would have carried on if the friends of the boy wouldn't have gotten jealous of him.

Kumar, born as Abhas Kumar Ganguly into a Bengali family in adjoining Khandwa district, did his high schooling from his hometown before moving to Indore for further studies.

He left his college education midway to land in Mumbai (then Bombay), where he went on to become not only a great singer, but also earned fame as an actor, lyricist, composer, producer, director and screenwriter.

""A copy of his marksheet was found in a dusty file in the ICC's record room. We searched for it as it is related to memories connected with the great artist's school life,"" ICC history department professor Swaroop Vajpayee told.

He said Kumar's father, Kunjilal Ganguly, admitted his son to the ICC to do intermediate after he matriculated in 1946 from Khandwa.

Vajpayee said Kumar had cleared high school exam conducted by the then Nagpur-based Board of High School Education of Central Provinces and Berar in 1946 in Hindi medium, and his roll number was 4197.

His marksheet, issued in July 1946, shows he secured 69 marks out of 175 in English and a subject taught along with it, 9 out of 25 in general knowledge, 64 out of 150 in chemistry and physics, 64 out of 150 in geography & elementary history, 67 out of 150 in Hindi and 53 out of 150 marks in drawing.

It was the only thing I could see as the difference between having to work an endless series of part-time retail jobs in a small town (which wasn't something I wanted) and having a successful career - even if I couldn't yet see what that would look like. College was the golden ticket to a life where I had the freedom to choose how I lived.

It didn't help that I grew up with a somewhat negative relationship with money. My dad worked multiple jobs while I was a kid, and I could feel the ripples of stress that coursed through our house when money was in short supply. So, knowing from countless hours of research that four years in college could cost upwards of $200,000, I stressed about paying for it all throughout high school.

As time went on, and I saw all the hidden expenses associated with going to college, I also worried about paying for flights home, food outside the dining hall, occasional nights out with friends, and the opportunities that the rich kids never had to think twice about, like getting to a job interview downtown and looking the part.

Taking out student loans didn't seem like a choice to me - It was imperative, a fact of life. I always knew I'd have to make sacrifices and work hard for my education. And I thought the debt would ultimately be justified.Excluding my first semester, I always worked at least two part-time jobs alongside a full course load to be able to afford my new life in Boston. Of course, my close-to-minimum-wage jobs couldn't cover everything. So I ended up racking up a few thousand dollars in credit card debt over those four years, in addition to my loans. But I was just so grateful to be there.

Going to college gave me the space I needed to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, to get internships, and to make connections that enabled me to get paying gigs later on.

I may not have ever put my ""Intro to Archaeology"" knowledge to practical use, but I was able to eliminate ""archaeologist/Indiana Jones"" from my list of dream careers. And I value the fact that I was able to make a list that had room for careers as audacious as that.

If I hadn't have gone to college, I may have eventually been able to figure out that I wanted to be a writer. But I don't think I'd be where I am now, or even close to it.

That doesn't mean my career is going perfectly, or that my student loan payments have gone off without a hitch. I got laid off from my first post-grad job a week before last Thanksgiving, and it's taken almost six months to gain any real traction as a freelance journalist. But I work in an industry where that kind of instability is common. And after covering student loans as a journalist, I'm fortunate to know how to navigate my debt with confidence, even when money is tight.

Student loans can be an oppressive force, one that can prevent you from doing what you want to do and living how you want to live. And predicting the amount of debt you'll graduate with can be a difficult task. (Based on my freshman year aid package, I thought I'd graduate with about $35,000 in loans and ended up with nearly double that.) But I can't say I agree with people who insist it's better to skip college altogether than to graduate with debt.

I don't regret my student loans. And I don't think it's fair to tell people like me, those who would be the first in their family to go to college and don't come from money, that this opportunity - which has long been touted as a surefire path to upward mobility - isn't an good option.","I took out student loans and it was the best decision I made - here's why","908969976","2018-07-19","https://www.businessinsider.in/i-took-out-student-loans-and-it-was-the-best-decision-i-made-heres-why/articleshow/65061693.cms","businessinsider.in",FALSE
"7121","","Biswajit Mondal said he was beaten up when he objected to money collection by a TMC affiliated union

A case of ragging has been reported from Kolkata's St. Paul's Cathedral Mission Engineering College.

Biswajit Mondal, a junior and Student's Welfare Secretary, along with some other students had objected to the money collection by a TMC affiliated union in the college.

The incident happened on May 17 when Biswajit has taken shelter in the college's union room due to heavy rain. Biswajit demanded that the account details of the Student Aid being collected by the TMC affiliated union be shown. Instead, Biswajit was harassed and beaten up. His clothes were ripped off and a nude video was also shot.

The video was then shared among the students.

Biswajit Mondal filed an FIR against three people -- the union president Arnab Ghosh, a college staff member Ananta Pramanik, who was in a drunken state and an external party member SK Inamul Haque alias 'Apu'.

In his letter to the Officer-in-Charge of the Amherst Street Biswajit Mondal wrote, ""They tortured me physically and mentally, also they took an objectional video of me. The other people present there were Abhijit Dolui and he was also in a drunken state. On being asked about the aid fund, they made the video viral"".

No action has been taken in this regard by the police or the college authorities.

Admissions had recently begun and donations were being collected by the TMC affiliated union in the college. The Student Union (TMC union) and 2nd year students of St. Paul's Engineering were also been collecting a Student Aid Fund from the month of May from the juniors.","College student accuses seniors of ragging, says they made objectionable video","880165964","2018-06-03","https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/college-student-accuses-seniors-of-ragging-says-they-made-objectionable-video-1249559-2018-06-03","India Today",FALSE
"7122","","Kelly and his brother, Mark, had always been mediocre students, but Mark improved his grades years before Kelly - and had some advice.

Scott Kelly didn't always know that he was going to be an astronaut. In fact, he wasn't even a particularly good student.

""As a student, it's just really hard, especially at first, when you don't have the habit-patterns to study and pay attention,"" Kelly told Business Insider for our podcast ""Success! How I Did It."" ""But once I got over that, I was able to go from a kid at 18 years old that was always like a very average, underperforming student and then fast forward almost to the day 18 years later, I flew in space for the first time. It was a pretty remarkable comeback, I think.""

Kelly remained an average student until he went to college, where he stumbled across Tom Wolfe's book, ""The Right Stuff.""""I read this book, and I could relate to a lot of the characteristics these guys had, with regards to their personalities, their risk-taking, their leadership abilities, ability to work as a team. That made me think,"" Kelly said.

""I related to a lot of those characteristics with one exception, and that is I wasn't a good student, especially in science and math,"" he continued. Kelly said he then thought, ""Wow, you know, if I could fix just that thing, then I could maybe be like these guys.""

""At the time I was thinking you've got to be really smart to be an engineer or scientist. What I realized is really what it takes is just hard work, and it's not any particular gift you might have.""

He continued: ""It was the spark I needed to motivate me to do more with my life than I was currently doing.""

You can subscribe to the podcast and listen to the episode below:

""The Right Stuff"" inspired Kelly, but it was a phone call from his brother that showed him what hard work really looks like.

According to Kelly, his twin brother Mark, who also became a NASA astronaut, was also a mediocre students - but Mark turned things around in high school, while Scott kept skating by. Mark pinpoints his turnaround to an event Scott doesn't remember.

""I was this kid that could not pay attention. Was not a good student,"" Kelly said. ""Always wondering how in the ninth grade my brother went from being like me to getting straight A's - I never knew how that happened.""

""I, on the other hand, had no recollection whatsoever of this conversation,"" Kelly said. ""Probably only because there was like a squirrel running outside the window and I was like, 'Squirrel!' Otherwise, I probably would have been a straight-A student, too.""

In his memoir ""Endurance,"" Kelly wrote that his mind began to wander and he lost focus as a student at the State University of New York Maritime College.

His grades had risen above average and he was studying for his first calculus exam. Having decided to take a break, Kelly planned to attend a big party at Rutgers. When Mark found out about his brother's attempt to forgo more studying for a party, he scolded Kelly over the phone.

""Are you out of your goddamn mind?"" Kelly remembered Mark telling him. ""You're in school. You need to absolutely ace this exam, and everything else, if you want to get caught up.""Scott Kelly buckled down, became a NASA astronaut, and has been to space four times.","Astronaut Scott Kelly was a mediocre student who made a complete transformation thanks to a book he found by accident and a call from his twin brother","868000800","2018-05-14","https://www.businessinsider.in/Astronaut-Scott-Kelly-was-a-mediocre-student-who-made-a-complete-transformation-thanks-to-a-book-he-found-by-accident-and-a-call-from-his-twin-brother/articleshow/64031307.cms","businessinsider.in",FALSE

Naur Gopal Maloo (21), a Chemistry student at IIT-Delhi, committed suicide in his hostel room on Friday, police said. Maloo was found hanging from a fan in his room on the fourth floor of Nilgiri Hall of Residence, at 7.15 am. A first-year MSc student, he hailed from West Bengal's Hoogli, police said. According to DCP (southwest) Milind Mahadeo Dumbere, Maloo had tried to commit suicide by consuming sleeping pills on April 10 as well. ""He was admitted to Safdarjung Hospital and was discharged. His brother, Bachoo Ram, stayed with him and he was also counselled. The reason for the suicide is being looked into,"" the DCP said.

The youngest of three brothers, Maloo was described by his friends as a bright student, and a ""simple and sober"" person. ""He told me he had got an internship with a big company in Kolkata for two months and would be going there in May. He was also preparing for GRE as he wanted to do his PhD from Germany,"" said Shamlu, a PhD student at IIT-D and Maloo's senior from Kolkata's Presidency College.

Ram, who lives in Hauz Khas Village, said, ""Had his friends been in the room yesterday, this would have not happened. I had spoken to him last night and told him to come to my place later. He had said he would."" Maloo shared his room with two others. Shamlu suggested Maloo came from a humble background. ""Being a Scheduled Caste student, he got scholarship of Rs 12,500 per month. On Sunday, when I last met him, he had shaved and was excitedly going for a farewell function,"" he said.

IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao said Maloo was being treated for depression. ""He was under medication. He had also been recently admitted to a hospital for drug overdose and was discharged only yesterday. His brother was with him throughout; he left last night. Today morning, the student decided to end his life. We are yet to ascertain the reason behind the step. Going by his academic records, it doesn't seem like he had any academic-related issues,"" he said.

"7124","","By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Published: March 30, 2018 2:15 am The victim Ayush Nautiyal. Delhi University (DU) recruitment: Search on for Assistants, Librarians and other posts, apply at cvs.edu.inNSUI comes back from the cold in DUDU college becomes first to get air quality monitoring station

Delhi Police has arrested a 25-year-old man for allegedly abducting and killing a 21-year-old Delhi University student in southwest Delhi's Palam village. While police had been looking for the boy from the time he was abducted, they found his body on Wednesday night and arrested the accused on Thursday afternoon. Enraged by police inaction initially, the victim's family has alleged lapses in the investigation and claimed that ""police only acted on the complaint they had filed after recovering the body"".

Joint CP (New Delhi) Ajay Chaudhary said, ""The accused, Ishtiaq Ali. has been arrested. Ali and the victim, Ayush Nautiyal, a student of DU's Ram Lal Anand College, met 10 days ago via a social networking site. Over the last 10 days, they met thrice. Ali bludgeoned him to death with a hammer after an argument.""

Chaudhary said the accused works as a sampling manager for various export houses and is a former student of a fashion institute. ""He confessed to the killing and admitted that he did it after an altercation. He also admitted to making ransom calls to Nautiyal's parents to divert their attention so that he could dispose of the body,"" he said.

Police said Nautiyal went missing on March 21. ""He told his mother that he was going to a college fest. In the evening, his father Dinesh Nautiyal received a WhatsApp message from Ayush's phone. The message had a photo of Ayush tied up, with his mouth covered and an injury on his head. The sender demanded Rs 50 lakh ransom. The father approached police and an FIR was registered,"" police said.

""The kidnapper first asked the family to meet him in Najafgarh on March 25. But when they reached the spot, they received a message which asked them to come to Dwarka. When they reached Dwarka, he asked them to come to Mohan Garden in Uttam Nagar. On March 26, the family was asked to come to Munirka, where they were asked to put the ransom amount inside a dustbin. But soon after, he asked them to meet him the next day. On March 27, the kidnapper did not communicate with the family. On March 28, Ayush's body was found inside a drain,"" a police officer said.

Speaking on the investigation, Chaudhary said they had formed 13 teams to crack the case after the FIR was lodged. He said they tried to locate the victim based on technical surveillance and other inputs from friends and family. ""Ayush's phone was switched off and the abductor was only using WhatsApp. We questioned several people and scanned CCTV footage,"" he added.

During investigation, police found that the victim had been meeting strangers he met on social media. ""Based on the input and technical surveillance, we identified Ali, a resident of Uttam Nagar.""

During questioning, the accused confessed to killing Ayush the day he met him and disposing of his body a day after.

Following police's direction, the victim's father negotiated with the kidnapper, who was communicating with them over WhatsApp messages and calls. They finally struck a deal for Rs 10 lakh and Dinesh took loan from his relatives to arrange for the ransom amount.

Claiming carelessness on part of police, Ayush's cousin Nikhil Singh said, ""Police were not investigating the matter seriously. We requested them to involve the Crime Branch repeatedly but they kept ignoring us.""

Replying to the allegations, DCP (southwest) Milind Dumbere said, ""We were communicating with them from day one and put in all efforts to find him. It is a debatable issue if the family says they were dissatisfied with the investigation."" Dumbere, however, did not reply on why no other specialised unit was roped in to help with the probe.

"7125","","Does India actually have a job crisis? Or is it a non-existent problem cooked-up by opposition parties to tarnish the Narendra Modi administration? Forget the politics of it, if you are a serious observer and are tired looking for missing government data, or are tired of surveys on employment/unemployment trends, you should probably look at what's happened in Mumbai, which suffered local train chaos earlier in the day.

Police were caning students, who, in retaliation, were throwing stones at policemen, and were shouting slogans demanding a meeting with Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal. They are seeking an assurance on jobs. There is no better example to understand and assess how serious the jobs problem is in the country. Hundreds of youngsters thronging streets seeking jobs and livelihood assurance is something one typically observes in countries ravaged by war, terrorism or racial madness or, let's say, failing economies. Which of these problems is India facing at this juncture?

Students protesting on railway tracks in Mumbai on Tuesday. Image procured by Sanjay Sawant

If one looks closer at the issue, what happened in Mumbai earlier today isn't unique to Mumbai but is present elsewhere in the country. According to reports, this round of protest is being carried out by activists of the All India Act Apprentice Association (AAAAA), demanding scrapping of the 20 percent quota, and jobs for all local candidates who clear the All India Railway Act Apprentice Exams. The protesters claim that they had taken up their demands with the Railway Minister Goyal, who met them. But there has been no progress in the matter.

But there is a larger issue here, as this Economic Times report shows, the Indian railways alone has received 1.5 crore applications this year for 90,000 railway jobs, which also includes 63,000 jobs in the Group D, a category that is reserved for gangmen. What does it tell us? Had India's private sector companies, start-ups, SMEs or MSMEs done their part in absorbing the new workforce, we wouldn't have seen such a large number of students desperately thronging for government jobs, including group D jobs. This is nothing but fact. India's unemployment problem isn't a non-existent one. It is present and real. As columnist Vivek Kaul points out in his piece, citing a recent estimate made by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, in 2017, two million jobs were created for 11.5 million Indians who joined the labour force during the year.

One of the biggest concerns for any observer looking at the economy is to not have enough data on what's happening on the ground. When you talk about jobs, that fear may be coming true for India. The last time the labour bureau released job data, it showed that unemployment rose to a five-year high of five percent in 2015-16. This rate was actually 4.9 percent in 2013-14. In 2015-16, the unemployment figure stood at 8.7 percent for women as compared to 4.3 percent for men, 5.1 percent in the rural sector and 4.9 percent in the urban sector. According to this report in the DNA, which cites a recent reply by Minister of State for Labour and Employment (independent charge) Santosh Kumar Gangwar in Parliament, the Labour Bureau under the ministry has not conducted any survey to find out the actual data of employment in the country since 2016.

India's unemployment rate in % under the usual principal status (UPS) approach Year In % Male Female Rural Urban 2009-10 9.3 2011-12 3.8 2.9 6.9 3.4 5.0 2012-13 4.7 4.0 7.2 4.4 5.7 2013-14 4.9 4.1 7.7 4.7 5.5 2015-16 5.0 4.0 8.7 5.1 4.9 Note: Labour Bureau did not bring out any such report for 2014-15. Source: Fifth annual employment-unemployment survey 2015-2016 at all-India level

If this is indeed the case, the government doesn't even have an account of the job situation on the ground. But there are important signals coming in, like what happened earlier today in Mumbai's suburbs. The bigger danger is when unemployment becomes the subject matter of protests; it easily connects with the unemployed youth across state boundaries. There is no caste, religion or demographic divide when it comes to a fight for jobs. Protests can spread like wildfire. A bigger problem is in the making then. Particularly, in the context of the Mumbai student protests, there have been cases of suicides in connection with the job issue. This is evident from what the protesters said. ""There has been no recruitment since last four years. We are struggling from pillars to post. Over 10 students have committed suicide. We cannot let such things happen,"" one of the protesting students has been quoted as saying.

If one looks at the job scenario in the country today, one can safely say that Narendra Modi's biggest opponent in the 2019 general elections will not be Rahul Gandhi, or a united Opposition that the Congress vice-president has been talking about -- it will be the lack of jobs for youth in India. In August, 2017, An India Today-Karvy Insights Mood of the Nation poll, conducted among a sample of 12,178 people across the country, provided some warning signals to Modi. It said 53 percent of the voters polled believe that the grim jobs scenario signals a deeper economic crisis. The scepticism on jobs is 17 percent higher than a similar survey by the same surveyor six months ago. Failure to give jobs could turn the 133 million first-time voters Modi is targeting in 2019 against him. The signals of this are already evident.

This means if this government fails to generate sufficient jobs (which is largely the case so far), the biggest challenge Modi and his campaigners will have to face will be the possibility of the same 133 million - the new workforce - turning against the government. The warning signals were present all along.

The 2016-17 Economic Survey authored by Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian said, ""Employment in India poses a great challenge in terms of its structure which is dominated by informal, unorganized and seasonal workers, and is characterised by high levels of under employment, skill shortages, with the labour markets impacted by rigid labour laws, and the emergence of contract labour."" In four years of Modi rule, the unemployment rate in India has actually gone up, going by the available data so far. The government has attempted to counter this problem through various schemes such as Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAYNULM) and Mudra loans, but what these have achieved is too little compared to the targets facing the government. The regime should first acknowledge the problem at hand, else a crisis is in the making.

The school has 255 students from Class 1-5 with eight teachers, two of them being male. ""We don't have a permanent sweeper. The temporary sweeper comes in the morning. We do encourage kids to flush water inside the loos to maintain cleanliness,"" said Shobha.

Later in the month of August, the girl said, that she was expelled for an entire semester for ""professional misconduct"" and ""academic indiscipline"" during the production of an academic project. She was also barred from working on her diploma film, and from sending her projects for film festivals.

In her letter, the complainant asserted that her expulsion had ""confirmed her fears"", that Kainthola was targeting her for having raised her voice against sexual harassment incidents.

Kainthola, rejecting allegations against him, termed the complaint as ""wild and imaginary"".

Reacting on the accusation, Kainthola told ANI that action was taken as the girl was found guilty of professional misconduct by the inquiry committee.

""The one-sided statement is highly misleading and entirely at variance with the facts,"" he said.

Kainthola added that the three-member inquiry committee was constituted to probe the case, which later found out that the girl, along with another student, allegedly conspired and made an ""unsuccessful, unethical attempt to replace the sound mix of a film by an unauthorized sound work.""

He further added that the action against the girl was taken after the inquiry committee termed the case a ""serious breach of trust, lack of respect, breaking of norms, severe disregard for general and academic discipline.""

Kainthola said that allegations of the girl are an ""attempt to cover up her act of professional fraud for which she was found guilty by the inquiry committee.""

"7130","","Kainthola has refuted that the disciplinary action has nothing to do with the sexual harassment complaint, which was dealt with due process.While the 2016 direction department scholar has accused director Bhupendra Kainthola of meting out unnecessarily harsh punishment, the latter has countered that she is trying to obfuscate matters by mixing two unrelated issues.

A suspended student from the direction department of Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) belonging to the 2016 batch, has linked the action taken against her with a sexual harassment complaint she had lodged with the Internal Complaint Committee, in an open letter to the committee and the Union ministry of information and broadcasting. She has accused the institute's director Bhupendra Kainthola of creating a hostile work environment for her and inflicting an undeserved harsh punishment. Kainthola has refuted that the disciplinary action has nothing to do with the sexual harassment complaint, which was dealt with due process.

The 30-year-old woman was notified in the first week of August that she will be suspended for the whole sixth semester. She was asked to vacate her hostel accommodation at the close of the fifth semester. ""It also informed me that I will not be allowed to make my diploma film, none of my films will be sent to any festival, nor will I get any scholarship or be eligible for any foreign exchange programme,"" she informed. While the action was ascribed to an issue with her dialogue film exercise, she is convinced that this has more to do with her filing a sexual harassment complaint against a classmate and also for supporting another complainant on similar charges against a former faculty member (who she said was known to be close to Kainthola).

Accusing Kainthola of intimidation and obstructing her work on campus, she pointed out in the letter, ""Since the harassment is being perpetrated by the highest authority at the institute, I am forced to address the I&B ministry and the chairperson of the ICC.""

In his rebuttal, Kainthola observed, ""It is unfortunate that ICC is getting dragged into a purely academic issue, wherein action was taken against the student after she was found guilty of academic misconduct by an inquiry committee. Her statement is highly misleading and entirely at variance with the facts.""

He pointed out that a three-member inquiry committee was set up after it was found the she had conspired with another student from the sound department to replace the sound mix of a film, made as part of the dialogue exercise, with an unauthorised sound work. ""The committee found that she had attempted to bypass the norms and discipline of the dialogue film exercise,"" he recounted.

The committee saw this as a serious breach of trust, complete disregard for general and academic discipline and display of scant respect for her department and particularly the department mentor guiding her on this exercise, he added. Kainthola reiterated that the action taken against her was at the behest of the inquiry committee, including her expulsion for a specific period and denying her participation in the dialogue and other subsequent exercises, in film festivals and exchange programmes.

Kainthola also underscored that her complaint of sexual harassment against the classmate was dealt with by ICC. The woman has also accepted in her letter that the boy was suspended for a while. In the other case too, the faculty has been removed from the campus, her letter pointed out. The director took the opportunity to stress that due process is followed in every complaint of sexual harassment.

Against this backdrop, the director dismissed the woman's accusations against him as merely 'wild and imaginary'. ""It begs credibility. This is an attempt to cover up her act of professional fraud that she was found guilty of by the inquiry committee. She has tried to obfuscate matters by mixing up two unconnected issues involving her,"" he stated.

Betraying her own desperation, the direction student pleaded, ""This is my last chance to complain against the injustice meted out to me. It is my right to complete my diploma film. If students with criminal cases against them have been allowed to complete their diploma film. The order issued by FTII is too harsh for a matter that was sorted in the presence of six faculty members.""

"7131","","A final-year student of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) has accused institute Director Bhupendra Kainthola of ""creating a hostile work environment for her"", ""intimidating her"" and ""obstructing her work at FTII"", and trying to ""destroy her film career"" because she consistently raised her voice against sexual harassment at the institute. Kainthola has described the allegations as ""wild and imaginary"".

In a four-page complaint letter sent to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the 2016-batch student has said her harassment started after she testified against a faculty member who was accused of sexual harassment by three women students in September last year. In April this year, the girl had approached the internal complaints committee (ICC) of FTII with her own complaint of sexual misconduct by a male batchmate, who, she alleged, had assaulted her by entering her hotel room in the dead of the night when a group of students was visiting Aurangabad along with a faculty member in April 2018.

The senior faculty member in question has since been removed, while the male student was suspended from the hostel for three months and asked to attend ""therapy sessions"". However, in August this year, the complainant herself was punished with expulsion for an entire semester for ""professional misconduct"" and ""academic indiscipline"" during the production of an academic project.

The FTII administration had also barred her from working on her diploma film, and from sending her projects for film festivals. In her letter to the ministry, the complainant said the punishment given to her was ""unheard of in the history of FTII"". and came despite the fact that the issue had been ""settled after detailed deliberations held by faculty members of the concerned departments"".

She has written that this action against her had ""confirmed her fears"" that Kainthola had been targeting her for having raised her voice against sexual harassment consistently. ""The order (of her expulsion and other punishments) clearly was meant to destroy my career and I immediately sought legal advice on how to appeal against this. I was told that the appellate authority in this was Kainthola. But when I called him,

he harassed me further. He made accusations against me and refused to inform me the details of the inquiry that was obstructing my work. 'You don't have to know that', he said when it is my right to know these details about the inquiry,"" she wrote in her complaint to the ministry.

Kainthola said there was no truth in the allegations. ""It begs credibility. This is an attempt to cover up her act of professional fraud for which she was found guilty by the inquiry committee,"" Kainthola said in a written response to questions sent by The Indian Express.

He claimed that there was ""no connection whatsoever"" between the girl's complaint against her batchmate and the action against her when it was discovered that she had taken ""unauthorised external assistance"" while completing her academic project.

He said the three-member inquiry committee had concluded that there was a ""serious breach of trust, lack of respect, breaking of norms, and severe disregard for general and academic indiscipline"" by the girl student. ""Her one-sided statement is highly misleading and entirely at variance with the facts,"" Kainthola said.

The girl maintained that the action against her had come because of her complaint of sexual harassment and the fact that she had testified against a ""close friend (the senior faculty member)"" of the director. She has requested the ministry to ensure that the director is asked to step down from his ""position of power"" in order to facilitate a fair inquiry into her complaints.","FTII student says being punished for speaking up against sexual harassment","976902168","2018-10-23","https://indianexpress.com/article/education/ftii-student-says-being-punished-for-speaking-up-against-sexual-harassment-5415340/","The Indian Express",FALSE

An order was passed by the bench which dismissed the appeal by a teacher whose absence was treated by authorities as 'dies non.' The term 'dies non' implies a day which is not treated as a day on duty. The period while qualifying as service for increments or pension benefits, is not constituted as a break in service.

"7138","","A teacher of a government boys' school was assaulted with an iron rod, allegedly by a student, on Saturday morning, after he pulled him up for irregular attendance and bad behaviour.

Police said the 53-year-old teacher sustained injuries to his head and was taken to a nearby private hospital for first-aid, following which he was referred to the AIIMS trauma centre.

The incident took place around 8.30 am at a south Delhi school.

Police received a PCR call at 9.35 am informing them that a teacher had been attacked by a student inside the class. Police said they have registered a case under IPC Section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) and teams have been formed to look for the student.

""The student who carried out the assault had very poor attendance; neither he nor his guardians attended the parent-teacher meeting held last week, during which report cards were given. After taking attendance, the teacher asked the boy why his attendance was so poor and why he didn't attend the PTM. He then handed over his report card to him. The boy tore the report card and flung it at him. This angered the teacher, and he said he would call the boy's guardians. He asked the boy to open his bag to check if he brought his books.

Following the incident, the school was visited by officials from the Directorate of Education and teachers' associations. An official from the DoE confirmed that though the boy allegedly tried to hit some students while running away, none of them were injured.

According to teachers, the incident has left both students and teachers scared.

"7163","","A 40-year-old para-teacher, Kanchan Das, died during a night-long sit-in outside the house of Jharkhand Welfare Minister Louise Marandi in Dumka, with protestors claiming that he died due to cold.

The contractual teacher was declared dead by doctors on Sunday, 16 December, and other protesters claimed that he had died of cold on Saturday night, an official told PTI.

Dumka Civil Surgeon AK Jha, on the other hand, said they had information that one para-teacher had died in the course of agitation on Saturday, 15 December.

The para-teachers across the state have been agitating for the last three months over regularisation of their services along with other demands.

They had been staging indefinite rotation dharnas outside Marandi's house since 25 November.

Das, who along with six others, had joined the dharna on Saturday, spent the night outside the minister's house and did not wake up on Sunday morning, other members of the agitation said.

He was rushed to a hospital where the doctors declared him dead.

Asked about the cause of death, AK Jha said, ""We are waiting for the post-mortem examination report. Then only we can confirm the exact cause of death.""

The post-mortem was conducted by a medical board comprising a forensic expert, constituted by the district administration. Dumka Superintendent of Police YS Ramesh said the sit-in agitation ended on Sunday afternoon.

Meanwhile, the minister condoled the para-teacher's death and talked to Dumka Deputy Commissioner Mukesh Kumar in this regard.

Referring to the problem of the para-teachers, Marandi said Chief Minister Raghubar Das was abroad presently and she would discuss the matter with him once he was back.

""We want to have a constructive discussion on the problems of the para-teachers,"" she said.

"7164","","A 35-year-old para-teacher, who was staging a sit-in protest along with six others, reportedly died due to cold in front Jharkhand state social welfare minister Louis Marandi's residence in Jharkhand's Dumka on Sunday, police said.

The teacher was identified as Kanchan Kumar Das, a resident of Nonihat village under Hasdiha police station in Dumka district. He had been a para-teacher at the Upgraded Middle School in Chinadangaal under Ramgarh block since 2005.

""A postmortem of the body has been performed at Sadar hospital. We are waiting for the report to know the exact cause of the death,"" Dumka superintendent of police Y Ramesh said.

""Chill effect in the weather could be a reason for death. But, it cannot be established until postmortem report comes,"" Ramesh said.

Over 45,000 para teachers across the state are on an indefinite strike since November 16 forcing over 12,000 schools to shut. They are demanding the regularisation of their services after their counterparts in Chhattisgarh, who have served for eight years, have been regularised as assistant teachers.

They launched 'Ghera Dalo, Dera Dalo' programme at residences of BJP ministers, parliamentarians and legislators to push for their demand from November 25.

As part of the programme, Das and other para-teachers were protesting before Marandi's house on Saturday night in Dumka, around 300-km northeast from capital Ranchi.

""After participating in a protest rally in Dumka market in the afternoon, we reached the sit-in venue before the minister's house in the evening. Kanchan was already there in our makeshift tent,"" one of Das' companion Yudhir Mandal said.

Mandal said they went to bed at around 8pm but Das went to the market. He returned around 10pm and they chatted for a while before sleeping.

""We woke up around 5.45am on Sunday and was preparing tea. Around 6.30am, we called Kanchan but he did not give any response and his body shrank in cold. We immediately called an ambulance and took him to Sadar Hospital Dumka. But, the doctors declared him brought dead,"" he said.

Dr Dilip Kumar Bhagat, who examined Das, said his body was brought late. ""He had already died. So, it was hard to find out the exact cause of his death,"" he said.

Das' father Akhilesh Das, 60, said his son had no serious health complications. ""My son died due to cold. It is the state government, who is responsible for his death. The government has killed my son,"" Akhilesh said.

Kanchan was unmarried and lived with his father. His elder brother works in Kolkata.

Opposition parties also held the government responsible for the teacher's demise. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has demanded centre's interference in para-teachers' issue.

""The current BJP government in Jharkhand has lost its sensitivity and humanity. A teacher dying before a minister's house is very shameful. A case of murder should be lodged against the minister,"" said JMM spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya.

Meanwhile, Ekikrit Para Sikshak Sangharsh Morcha (EPSSM), an umbrella body of different para teachers' associations, has threatened to intensify the agitation.

""The government is not ready for any dialogue over the teachers' issue. We do not know if chief minister has made it a personal ego. We have a simple demand to regularise us on the line of Chhattisgarh,"" said EPSSM state member Vinod Tiwary.

Marandi, who was in Ranchi on Monday, expressed grief over the teacher's death. ""I will talk to the chief minister Raghubar Das and education minister Neera Yadav to sort out the para teachers' issue at the earliest,"" she said.

Marandi said that the government was serious about their issues and agreed to concede demands to some extent.

Local MLA P M Narasimhan was also contacted by the Parents and Teachers' Association (PTA), seeking his help to cancel the transfer order. ""Narasimhan seems to have convinced PTA members about the necessity of this transfer. I told Bhagawan that he can regain this trust and affection from his new school too,"" Aravindan said.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Bhagawan said his colleague who got transferred had left before him. ""I was stopped by students when I stepped out of the office. They took away my scooter key first. Then they snatched my bag, crying and shouting loudly. Then they literally dragged me to the classroom. I earned not only my salary but their love and affection too,"" Bhagawan said.

Bhagawan, who hails from a town 10 km away, had chosen his new posting location through teachers' transfer counselling. ""I have to go, but this experience taught me a great lesson and instills hope in my profession,"" he said.","Tamil Nadu: Students protest teacher transfer, govt delays process","891783553","2018-06-22","https://indianexpress.com/article/india/tamil-nadu-students-protest-teacher-transfer-govt-delays-process/","The Indian Express",FALSE
"7181","","Emotions ran amok with tears falling down the faces of students at a government school in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday.

An English teacher at Government High School in Velliagaram, Thiruvallur, had to end his tenure at the school leaving a batch of students emotionally stirred.

Heartbroken, the students clung to their teacher G Bhagawan who was definitely adored by them.

It was quick for the emotions to get the better of the situation when the students protested at the school upon learning the news of Bhagawan's transfer.

They locked the gates. They hugged him. They cried even more in their endeavours to stop him. The students were seen begging him to not leave.

""I was posted here in 2014 and I have surpassed my tenure here. I got my transfer letter and as I was leaving the school yesterday when the students surrounded me. I felt a sudden gush of emotions and indeed I will miss them all. I had to move on to another school according to the rules. I attended the government counseling and chose Arungulam,"" G Bhagawan said.

Bhagawan taught from Class 6 to 10.

His investment in his students was much more than the subjects he taught. Apart from syllabus and lessons, life lessons too formed an integral part of his teachings.

With English, he even took interest in teaching them general knowledge and social sciences.

""He had interactive sessions with us using the projector, narrating stories and singing songs. I want to go and study in the school where he is now being transferred to. Wish he could have stayed with us,"" Class 10 student Ranjith said.

When the wailing students and their parents united to request Bhagawan and school authorities to let him continue taking classes at the same school, the government and school administration took note of it and for now, his transfer is temporarily on hold.

Bhagawan has been given 10 days to teach at Velliagaram Government High School and the authorities are yet to take a decision regarding Bhagawan's transfer.","To sir with love: Tamil Nadu students protest transfer of their favourite English teacher","891631069","2018-06-21","https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/tamil-nadu-velliagaram-thiruvallur-school-teacher-transfer-students-protest-1266632-2018-06-21","India Today",FALSE
"7182","","CHENNAI: As 28-year-old Bhagawan tried to exit the gates of the government high school in Velliagaram on Wednesday, he was engulfed in hugs and tears while his students held on to his arms. Their stance was clear - their beloved English teacher could not be transferred out.

Demonstrating a kind of love and admiration that is rare to witness in schools today, students of the school in Tiruvallur district staged protests soon after they received the news of their teacher's transfer. Bolstered by the support of their parents, students even decided not to go to the school on Tuesday to show that the government's decision of transferring their teacher was not agreeable.

""We don't want him to be transferred. He has been one of the most supportive staff members and has been like a brother to many of us,"" said Nithya, a student. Not every teacher can boast of such love from students. ""But then, not all teachers are Bhagawan Sir,"" say his students. In a matter of four years, the teacher has formed long-lasting friendships with his students, comforting the teens as brother, ally and guide.

""Many of us were not comfortable with English but with his encouragement, we were able to improve. He was always available to clear doubts at any time of the day and we could call him even late in the evenings after the special classes,"" said Tamilarasan, a student.

Instead of merely focusing on syllabus, students said he gave them information on GK, social service, developing skills and prepare for competitive exams and focused on employment-oriented education.

Principal A Aravind said that he had submitted a representation to officials of the education department based on the requests by parents and students. ""We have requested the department if there is a possibility of retaining the teacher. He is one of the best teachers we have, completely involving himself in teaching students. During special classes that would go beyond school hours, he would help in arranging food for students and had been overall very friendly,"" he said. ""The students too are very affectionate by nature, something I find more common in rural schools. It is usually difficult for them to let go of their teachers but this time even parents got emotional,"" he added.

Meanwhile, education department officials said the transfer is part of the usual deployment and based on teaching hierarchy. They have to carry it out as per the requirement.","This teacher is 'Bhagawan' for students as they protest his transfer out of school - Times of India","891112995","2018-06-21","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/this-teacher-is-bhagawan-for-students-as-they-protest-his-transfer-out-of-school/articleshow/64672067.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

The Alwar police on Wednesday booked a school teacher for sending obscene messages to a Class 9 student.

Two FIRs have also been registered against the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal members for creating ruckus at the private school on Tuesday night.

""On the complaint of the student's father, we have registered a case against the teacher under various sections of the IPC and POCSO Act. We are investigating the matter,"" said Sheesh Ram Meena, the station house officer of Aravali Vihar police station. The accused is absconding.

A clip of his speech has gone viral. He can be heard saying, ""I am a teacher of a college where 80 percent of the students are girls and of that, the majority are Muslims. These girls are not wearing dresses as per the religious tradition. They are not covering their chests with hijab.

Students took out a 'Watermelon march' and sought action against the professor. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), RSS' student wing, smashed watermelons in front of the college.

According to CA Jawahar, principal of Farook Training College, Jouhar made the statements during a speech delivered at a counselling session. ""The speech is from three months ago that the teacher made elsewhere and not on our campus. So, we have no responsibility in that. He regularly holds talks and motivational speeches for families on holidays.

"7186","","Kerala professor's remark that Muslim girls were not wearing the hijab properly and deliberately exposing their chests like ""sliced watermelon"" has triggered widespread protests across the state

A remark by a professor of a teachers' training college in Kerala's Kozhikode that Muslim girls were not wearing the hijab properly and deliberately exposing their chests like ""sliced watermelon"" has triggered widespread protests across the state by students with some women posting nude photographs.

Many student organisations protested outside Farook Training College, where Jouhar Munavvir T teaches, seeking action against him.

They said they will send slices of watermelons to the teacher just like the 'Pink Chaddi' campaign in response to the attack on women in a pub in Mangaluru in 2009 by activists of rightwing fringe group Sri Ram Sene.

""We will flood him with watermelons,"" student activist P Ajitha said.

A few women students supporting the teacher also took out a rally on the campus whipping up tension in the college.

Students in other colleges also protested carrying sliced watermelons and sought strict action against Munavvir.

Some women even took to social media to post bare-breasted photos, which were removed by Facebook.

Television channel NDTV reported that 25-year-old Arathy SA was among those, who posted a nude picture, and that and her husband too shared the photo.

""I am upset with hypersexualisation of breasts by people. Whether it be professors in college or social media users seeing a model breastfeed and pose for a magazine. So I and my husband posted pictures of me nude,"" Arathy was quoted as saying by the news channel.

""Just because people may find my breasts attractive, doesn't mean they are entitled to violate me or my body,"" Arathy added.

Activist Diya Sana from Kochi also posted the picture of one of her activist friends, using watermelons to suggestively cover her breasts and face.

Munavvir made the controversial remark while speaking at a religious seminar in Kozhikode in north Kerala recently.

""I am a teacher of a college where 80% of students are girls and a majority of them are Muslims. Though they wear the hijab, they expose some part of their chest defeating the very purpose of wearing them. They expose, you know like how we cut a slice of melon to see whether it is ripe or not,"" Munavvir said.

He said parents and religious leaders should take note of such trends as they were un-Islamic and against the very tenets of the religion.

""You should see how they wear hijab. They cover their heads with a scarf. They wear hijab in a way their chest is not covered. We all know a woman's bosom is one of the body parts that attract man most. But our girls expose their chest giving an impression that the rest of their body is like the exposed part,"" he said.

The speech was later uploaded to social media sites and netizens started criticising the teacher for his ""Taliban-like comments.""

However, principal of Farook College CA Jawahar said the teacher made the statement during a counselling session three months ago outside the college and it was unfair to whip it up now.

""He goes regularly for religious discourses. We have nothing to do with it and no student has filed a complaint in this regard,"" he defended the teacher, saying only a portion of his speech was circulated.

Munavvir, a social science teacher, has been working with the college for the last six years.","Kerala teacher's sexist remarks trigger 'watermelon' protest, women post nude photos","834883846","2018-03-20","https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-teacher-s-sexist-remarks-trigger-watermelon-protest-women-post-nude-photos/story-JB6cbCAXjfmb2gnVA7yJeM.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"7187","","A teacher of the Carmel Primary School in Kolkata has been arrested for allegedly molesting a minor, on Friday, after angry parents surrounded the school and demanded access to the accused, several media reports said.

Representational image. Reuters

According to a report in India Today, a Class 2 student was molested by her dance teacher at the school in Rashbehari Avenue near Deshapriya Park. . CNN-News18 said that the teacher had been harassing the child for months now, and had threatened to bury her alive if she complained. The child reported the incident to her parents, who in turn, informed their relatives and other parents. The angry parents then surrounded the school and demanded that the accused teacher be handed over to them.

One of the agitating parents alleged that the school authorities tried to downplay the matter when they were informed about it. ""It was then we decided to stage a protest outside the school,"" he said.

Kolkata Police rushed to the spot to contain the situation and took the accused teacher in custody. The police also managed to safely escort him away from the angry parents and an investigation has been launched.

The India Today report also said that a policeman was reportedly injured while trying to shield the accused from the beatings of the angry parents.

Another report in Zee news said that the molestation was going on for almost a year. The parents also alleged that the school was trying to shield the accused and had not made enough security arrangements, including CCTV cameras on the campus.

Police officials, who reached the spot to control the agitators, were also heckled. ""We have taken the teacher with us to the police station,"" a senior police officer said, adding the parents assaulted the accused when he was being taken away.

The incident comes almost two months after the GD Birla sexual harassment case, in which two school teachers were arrested for allegedly trying to rape a 4-year-old child. The police have arrested the two physical training teachers in connection with the incident and have also formed a special committee to look into the allegations of negligence and false representation on part of the school. The incident also led to the dismissal of the school principal, who refused to take responsibility for the lack of CCTV cameras in the school.

As the guardians stood demonstrating outside the Carmel Primary School the scene was eerily similar to the disquiet outside GD Birla Centre for Education in posh south Kolkata locality, where angry parents had camped outside the school for hours, leaving the principal and staff stuck inside the school.

The same educational incident was also at the centre of another similar incident in 2014. According to The Indian Express, a six-year-old girl was molested on her way to the washroom by the driver and the helper of a Volvo bus, hired by the school to ferry the students to a cultural event.

""When the girl returned home, she was bleeding profusely and had to be treated at a private hospital. Her parents met the school authorities with a medical report of the child the next day, but the school allegedly tried to hush up the incident on the grounds that it might tarnish the school's reputation and also affect the child's future,"" the report said.

"7190","","The exercise is aimed at exposing the lack of regulation on teachers' absenteeism from government schools. Parents have, for some time been, citing teachers' long absence from schools as on of the major reasons for the poor results of government schools.

The Gujarat education department has ordered all districts to collect information on government school teachers who have been on leave for more than one year.

The exercise is aimed at exposing the lack of regulation on teachers' absenteeism from government schools. Parents have, for some time been, citing teachers' long absence from schools as on of the major reasons for the poor results of government schools.

The matter of teachers' long absence was first raised by Gujarat Primary Teachers' Association during the executive committee meeting of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) held on November 29 in Gandhinagar.

Following this, the Director Primary Education M I Joshi November 30 issued a circular to all District Primary Education Officers (DPEOs) and administrative officers (AO) seeking information from across the state before December 6.

Advertising ExplainedWhy transparency push in transfers did not help govt

For years, many teaching posts in remote districts of Kutch, Panchmahal and Banaskantha have remained vacant. To tackle the issue of vacant teaching posts, the Gujarat government, in the past, had made online applications for transfers mandatory in order to ward off ""pressures"" for preferred locations. The system sought to introduce transparency. However, the government was flooded with applicants seeking postings to their home districts. In spite of resorting to biometric attendance system for teachers, the state Education Department struggles to check the alarming absenteeism of teachers. While the government announces one scheme after another to improve education standards and check drop-out rates, this is one area where the government needs to act.

""It has been brought to the notice that teachers in several districts have remained absent for a long time. Because of this, it has adverse effects on students' education as the position cannot be filled by either a transfer or new appointment. This is a very serious issue. So, compile the information of all those teachers in your district who are absent for more than a year before December 6,"" the circular stated.

As per the rules, a new teacher cannot be appointed or the teacher cannot be transferred till the teacher is on leave, as in the teacher's absence the post is not vacant.

""There are teachers, around 10 in Jamnagar alone like one in Lalpur taluka and the other in Jamnagar, where teachers have been absent for the last three to four years. It has been a long time since they left for abroad,"" said Digvijaysinh Jadeja, president of Gujarat Primary Teachers' Association, who had raised the issue at the meeting.

Notices have been served to some of the teachers whose absence was brought to the notice of their respective district education officers.

According to rules, a notice seeking an explanation for the absence of a teacher is served thrice before passing an order of either his suspension or dismissal.

This is the first time that such a data collection drive is taking place in the state.

""There is no preliminary data of such teachers since we have never collected one before. This is the first time. We want to verify the claims made by the association regarding teachers' long absence,"" director of Primary Education M I Joshi said.

There are around 1.90 lakh government primary school teachers in the state, constituting a 60:40 ratio of female and male teachers.

With a larger proportion of women teachers, their male counterparts have been complaining of teaching hours being affected as female teachers also avail long maternity leaves. This was also reflected in the draft National Education

Policy (NEP) report which was prepared by the state education department in 2015 and submitted to the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD).

"7191","","BENGALURU: To prevent child marriages, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has come out with an initiative involving the school teacher. If the child remains absent for a considerable number of days on the trot without prior intimation, the teachers concerned will have to inform the local Child Welfare Committee (CWC). The principal concerned will be held responsible if the teachers fail to inform the CWC about students staying away from school for long.

A senior official from the Department of Public Instruction said that in many cases, teachers and headmasters know about a child getting married, but do not inform the officials concerned -- either due to negligence or out of helplessness. ""By making them accountable, we hope they will inform the CWC and try to prevent child marriages,'' the official said.

A memo issued by Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan planning director, which is available with The New Indian Express, says the CWC gets many cases related to child marriages as well as missing children complaints.

In Karnataka, there has been a decrease in girl child's attendance. The school management probes the absence of the girl children but drops it after not making any headway. And by the time it reaches the CWC, it is too late.

With the latest initiative, children can be tracked in time. Apart from CWC officials, teachers will also have to report the cases of children staying away from schools for many consecutive days to the Block Education Officer and District Deputy Director (administration).

Vasudeva Sharma, former CWC member and director of Child Rights Trust, said that although child marriage is rampant in Karnataka, most of the cases go unreported. ""Usually, if a child is getting married, parents stop sending the child to school 10-15 days before the wedding day. In such cases, teachers should find out the whereabouts of the child. If they are unable to trace the child and smell something wrong, they can approach the CWC,'' he said.

In 2017, Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) had released a statement saying that the state accounts for 23.2 per cent of child marriages in India. The practice is prevalent in almost all the districts of the state, especially North Karnataka districts, including Yadgir, Belagavi, Bagalkote, Ballari and Kalaburagi.","Students absent for long?

The NGO named various schools and their missing teachers who were allegedly neglecting their duty to students.

""According to residents of various localities, these teachers never attend school and this has been affecting the students even as their annual exams approach. We are alarmed at the development and seriously concerned about the fate of the school-going children,"" said president of the unit, Greneth Sangma.

The NGO condemned the neglect while also seeking legal action against the said teacher for depriving the poor and innocent villagers and earning their wages without attending their official duties.

The NGO named one teacher of Gara Samka who allegedly attended school only 3 times a year. ""As of last year he completely failed to attend his official duties - no class-work activities, and exams were never conducted,"" added Greneth.

They further asserted that only 3 schools were actively and properly functioning, i.e. Balkal A'sim Govt. LP School, Gara Songgital Govt. LP School and Mindikgre Govt. LP School.

""Teachers of those schools are highly appreciated by the community of the region"" added the GSU president.

They further named few more teachers who were guilty of the same neglect in the Chokpot region.

""They are earning handsome salaries and sending their own children for good education in urban areas, while on the other hand, depriving the children of the poor and innocent of their good education,"" he added while further condemning them along with government authorities who support them.

""As per sources, these school authorities never inspect nor examine the functioning of rural schools. It shows the incapability of the authority in appointing such incompetent school teachers,"" alleged Greneth.

The NGO demanded the DSEL to immediately terminate the services of those teachers after an investigation into their acts of neglect.

""A temporary termination or holding up pay is not a solution in front of the cries of those communities. We strongly demand justice and fair action from the authority,"" he stated asking for authorities to undertake surprise inspection of all government LP schools.

The NGO also condemned the SDSEOs, school inspectors, CRC, and head-cum-secretary of each Govt. LP Schools for not fulfilling the standard of the education.

""They take the excuse of law and order and are not attending their official duties properly as required by the norms. Many officers are not inspecting the functioning of the schools. They never inquire or visit the remote rural schools of how they are managing and operating,"" the NGO asserted.

Further on the issue of head-cum-secretary post holders in their respective schools and circles, the NGO alleged that they were mostly neglecting their duties in many parts of the Garo Hills.

"7194","","Rajasthan rebel MLA Ghanshyam Tiwari writes to Shah: 'Sack Raje in public interest'

Buckling under pressure, the Rajasthan government has scrapped orders by two district administrations telling teachers they will lose pay if they do not attend a Teachers' Day function in Jaipur which will be addressed by Chief Minister Vasundhra Raje.

The orders had also forbid them from wearing black belts, shoes, t-shirts and socks. After drawing widespread criticism from the opposition and the teaching fraternity, these restrictions were removed in a fresh order.

Director Secondary Education Department Nathmal Didel said the orders were not issued by the directorate and action would be taken against the District Education Officers (DEOs) in Bharatpur and Hanumangarh districts who released the orders on August 29 and 30 ""arbitrarily"".

He said the orders were withdrawn and fresh orders issued in which the salary deduction clause was removed.

He said those who have disabilities or are suffering from diseases or have any other emergency can take permission for leave from respective authorities.

He said revised orders were issued for attending the state-level Teachers' Day celebration in Jaipur in ""specified clothes"", he said.

He did not elaborate what he meant by specified clothes.

The old orders made it compulsory for all government teachers, who were appointed after December 13, 2013, to attend the state-level Teachers' Day celebration in Jaipur on September 5. In case they were absent, they would suffer a loss of one-day salary, they said.

Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje had taken oath on December 13, 2013 and this cut-off date ensured that teachers, who were appointed after the BJP government came to power, attended the programme.

The old order also prohibited teachers from wearing black belt, shoes, T-shirt, socks during the celebration.

The opposition had slammed the move, saying there seemed no logic in making it compulsory for teachers to attend the celebration and it was merely an attempt to gather a crowd in rallies.

State Congress president Sachin Pilot claimed it was a desperate attempt of the BJP government to gather crowd.

""How can the government differentiate between teachers who got jobs during the Congress regime or the BJP's earlier regimes,"" he asked.

President of All Rajasthan School Teachers' Union, Ramkrishna Agarwal said the clauses of salary deduction and of forbidding teachers from wearing black were akin to an ""undeclared emergency"".

Nearly 63,000 teachers were newly appointed in the state under the BJP government and nearly 50,000 teachers were expected to take part in the celebrations.

President of Berozgar Shikshak Sangathan, Upen Yadav said the government would pay Rs 8.51 crore as allowance to teachers to take part in the celebration but had the government spent these funds judiciously in the last four years, many teachers could have been appointed.","Raj govt buckles, scraps orders about teachers losing pay if absent from Teachers' Day celebrations","936348211","2018-08-31","https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/raj-govt-buckles-scraps-orders-about-teachers-losing-pay-if-absent-from-teachers-day-celebrations-118083100896_1.html","Business Standard",FALSE

An organisation of primary school teachers has termed the order, issued by Basic Education Officer (BSA), as a violation of Right to Education (RTE) Act, which does not allow using services of teachers for any non-academic purposes.

Government school teachers in UP's Sultanpur district were asked by education authorities to make preparations for the state government's ambitious 'mass marriages' scheme.

Sultanpur's Basic Education Officer (BSA), issued an order (copy is with TOI) on February 22 directing education officers to send five teachers, male and female, from four education blocks - Dubeypur, Bhadaiyan, Kurwar, and Kuremar - to participate in the mass wedding on Saturday.

When questioned, BSA Sultanpur Kaustubh Kumar Singh told TOI, ""There were no orders from the government to engage teachers in mass wedding. We deployed teachers to guide the couples tying the knot.""

"7199","","BHUBANESWAR: Student groups are divided over teachers' election in the Utkal University campus. One student group demands for teachers' election in the campus, while the other group opposes it vehemently.

There is a dispute between two teacher groups regarding teachers' association elections. Students have also started taking sides of their teachers. The problem came to the fore after some students along with non-students ran away with the nomination box of the teachers on Wednesday. Later the teacher groups had altercation in a meeting in front of vice chancellor Soumendra Mohan Patnaik.

The first group led by Mahesh Prasad on Saturday staged dharna in front of the administrative block of the university demanding teachers' elections. They shouted slogans like 'Save Democracy in Vani Vihar' by flaunting placards. ""The vice chancellor should take action against the people who ran away with the nomination box. Democracy should prevail in the university,"" he added.

He further said the peaceful atmosphere of the campus is getting affected due to the issue. ""If this problem continues in the university, it will affect teaching and research programmes. Let the teachers allow to hold their elections freely without any external pressure,"" he added.

However, the second group led by Nitish Kumar Bhola urged the vice chancellor not to allow teachers' election in the campus. ""If the universities authorities did not allow Students' Union election in the campus, why it allows the teachers association election? The decision should be taken in a fair and balanced manner,"" he added.

Bhola said teachers should not involve themselves in petty politics inside the campus instead of concentrating in teaching and research works.

"7200","","The BJP has slowed down implementation of the programme ahead of polls, but may go full speed ahead if it retains power.

For school teachers in Madhya Pradesh, there is a lot riding on the Assembly elections on Wednesday.

In January, the state's Bharatiya Janata Party government announced its ""one campus-one school"" programme to merge all schools of varying levels functioning within 150 metres of each other - an exercise that would bring down the number of schools across 224 development blocks from 34,997 to 15,961. The government claims the mergers will enable efficient use of teaching and other resources.

But for teachers of lower classes, this has meant narrowing prospects for promotions, lax supervision, and having to teach higher classes as well. In addition, thousands of headmasters of merged schools have effectively been demoted to regular teachers.

This has also affected the schools, say teachers. In the absence of headmasters, monitoring of teachers has weakened, said Rajendra Singh Jadaun, a teacher in a secondary school (Classes 9 and 10) in Sheopur district that has merged with a higher secondary school (Classes 11 and 12). According to a member of the education administration, who did not want to be identified, those primary teachers who are graduates have already been made subject teachers in senior classes. Yet, the overall teacher shortage - more than 70,000 across the state - persists.

In September, the state government issued guidelines on the mergers. But beyond a common timetable for merged schools and redeployment of teachers, there has been little progress on the administrative merger of schools, including their bank accounts and management committees.

""Right now, there is little progress and everyone is keeping quiet about it so that there is no protest,"" said Jagdish Mishra of the Madhya Pradesh Shikshak Congress, a teachers' union affiliated to the Congress. ""Right after the election ends, if the BJP wins, they will merge schools very fast.""

The merger of schools, under the charge of district education officers, is in various stages of implementation across Madhya Pradesh. In Guna district, for instance, most merged schools have already merged their finances and their heads have been given classes to teach, said Kishan Rajak, a teacher.

Teachers are particularly unhappy with this reduction in the ""headmaster cadre"". ""Since 2011, when the Right to Education Act, 2009, was implemented in Madhya Pradesh, every primary school with 150 children and every middle school with at least 100 children would have a headmaster - now that is gone,"" said Rajak.

Mishra added that this will impact the careers and promotion prospects of all teachers.

At the same time, it may not improve the quality of teaching in both primary and higher classes.

Rajak pointed out that the mergers did not resolve the problem of 41,000 vacant posts of primary teachers in the state.

In addition, the administration official pointed out that while many primary and middle school teachers are graduates and are now teaching higher classes, the primary classes continue to be ignored. ""The primary level is foundational but gets very little attention from the school leadership, which focuses only on higher classes,"" the official said. The challenging task of teaching the primary classes has been left to guest teachers appointed at a monthly salary of Rs 2,500, he explained, adding that there has been no regular appointment in five years.

This year, the state government advertised 17,000 teaching posts but all for higher secondary classes.

The senior classes may not benefit from the extra help either. ""Experience is important and these primary school teachers may have earned postgraduate degrees but they have not taught their subjects in years,"" explained Rajak.

Lax supervision of teachers in schools that have lost their headmasters to the mergers is another cause for concern, according to Jadaun. Teachers now report to the head of the ""main school"" - the school with the highest level of classes into which all the other schools are merged, according to the guidelines - but still teach in their old schools. ""Once we sign in, there is no one to check if we are actually reporting to our classes to teach because the principal in the main school does not emerge from his room,"" said Jadaun.

That some permanent teachers have been made to report to former shiksha karmis - administration-appointed temporary teachers who were later organised into a separate cadre called ""adhyapak samvarg"" with lower salaries in 2008 - has also cause friction.

The state's merger programme may have upset teachers but it has made little difference to how the schools run, apart from having the main school draw up the timetable. Many merged schools continue to struggle with the same lack of resources as before.

At Rajak's school in Guna, for instance, space is still short. The school with Classes 1 to 8 merged into a higher secondary school and the resultant institution now has classes up till 12. However, the primary and middle sections still run in shifts for want of space. Similarly, another school in Guna with 141 students in Classes 1 to 5 works in two shifts after the merger.

Rajak fears that with the merging of the schools' finances, junior classes may become poorer than they are. ""The funds of statutory bodies such as the school management committees are also being merged,"" he said. School management committees, including school staff, parents and community members, are statutory bodies under the Right to Education Act and are responsible for the development of schools.

This is not the first time Madhya Pradesh has merged schools. According to the official, who is a former teacher activist, the state has been merging schools with low enrolment - starting with those with an enrolment of less than 10 - since 2013.

One reason for declining enrolment in schools is families leaving their villages because of failing agriculture and lack of employment. ""People's MGNREGA cards have been empty for years together,"" said activist Sandesh Bansal, referring to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act that guarantees rural households 100 days of employment in a year.

In addition, the official pointed out, the state government has undermined its own schools by pushing the implementation of Section 12(1)(c) of the Right to Education Act, which directs private schools to reserve 25% of their seats in Classes 1 to 8 for children from economically weaker or other disadvantaged backgrounds. The cost of educating these children is to be reimbursed by the government. This has resulted in a proliferation of private schools and parents pulling their children out of government schools, he said. ""Politicians are not interested because their own children go to private schools,"" he added. ""Government schools are there only for securing government jobs.""","Jittery over school mergers, teachers in Madhya Pradesh are waiting for the election results","1003585285","2018-11-26","https://scroll.in/article/903393/jittery-over-school-mergers-teachers-in-madhya-pradesh-anxiously-wait-for-the-election-results","Scroll.in",FALSE

""The caste of a certain candidate has been mentioned as SC in the interview call list, while the same candidate is listed under MBC under the final list,"" he said.

It should be noted that the registration fees for Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates is half that of the sum for Most Backward Caste (MBC) candidates.

He alleged that another candidate, who was called for interview under a caste reservation was selected under the widow category. ""She was not listed as widow in the interview call list,"" he said.

Candidates who took their exams in Tamil and pursued their education and other exams in Tamil were given a 20 per cent consideration.

Express had already reported on another allegation that many candidates who scored better, were not on the Tamil priority list. They were allegedly asked to produce 'Tamil Medium' certificate for technical exams (including practical work such as stitching and drawing), which cannot be taken in a language, according to an official.

A TRB official said two candidates were called for interview for every vacant position.

""The discrepancy in credentials between the first and second list came from the wrong inputs submitted by candidates in the online applications. We may reconsider certain candidates only if there is a government order in their favour,"" the official said.","172 names missing in final list of Teachers Recruitment Board, claims association","992774020","2018-11-12","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/nov/12/172-names-missing-in-final-list-of-teachers-recruitment-board-claims-association-1896993.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

Days after arrest warrants were issued against three teachers from Navsari district for remaining absent from Election Commission's electoral roll revision duty, it has come to light that 18 other booth-level officers (BLOs) faced similar action. A majority of these 18 BLOs are school teachers.

Following a report by The Indian Express on September 19 on the action taken against the three teachers from Navsari, the Election Commission of India (ECI) had sought a reply from Gujarat Chief Electoral Officer (CEO).

Arrest warrants were issued against three teachers from Navsari district for failing to turn up for their assigned jobs in the three-day electoral roll revision drive taken up by the ECI for the upcoming general election. Police teams were sent to pick up the three teachers and they were brought to the mamlatdar's office, on last Tuesday.

Confirming the action taken against 18 BLOs, Gujarat CEO Dr S Murali Krishna said, ""A report was sought on September 19 after the Election Commission of India learnt about such an action taken against the BLOs in Navsari district. The office submitted its report to the ECI on the same day. Necessary instructions have been issued to collectors and district election officers (DEOs) to ensure that action against such BLOs is consistent with the Conduct and Discipline Rules framed for Government Employees and only after proper study of legal provision.""

Through the report, it came to light that similar arrest warrants were issued by concerned district administrative officials in five districts -- Gir Somnath, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar, Dahod and Navsari.

Among these, the highest number of warrants were issued in Khambhaliya constituency of Devbhoomi Dwarka district, where a total of nine warrants were issued against BLOs by the electoral registration officers (ERO) and assistant electoral registration officers (AEROs).

Six warrants were issued from Jamnagar North constituency in Jamnagar district, two from Limkheda in Dahod and one in Somnath from Gir Somnath, all for alleged 'negligence of duty'.

An official statement issued on September 19 by Gujarat CEO Dr S Murali Krishna stated, ""Some BLOs were absent at their respective polling station on 16.9.2018 declared as special campaign day and they were also absent from the training programme for BLOs given by EROs through SATCOM. As such, concerned EROs/AEROs have taken disciplinary actions against such BLOs for negligence of their duty.""

Apart from September 16, September 30 and October 14 are the dates for the special campaign to enrol first-time voters who have completed 18 years of age, and those who want to make corrections in their registered details.

""It has come to the notice of this office that in some cases warrants have been issued against BLOs who were absent. Forthcoming General Elections will be held using electoral roll prepared on the basis of ongoing Electoral Roll Summary Revision Programme. For preparation of updated and error free electoral roll, sincerity of BLOs is necessary. Under these circumstances, action has been taken against BLOs for negligence to their duties with respect to work related to special campaign programme which is of national importance,"" the statement read.

However, the CEO maintained that the action was not consistent with the law. ""Action (issuing warrants) taken by EROs/AEROs is not consistent with the provision of law framed for Government Employees,"" the statement said. Navsari district's Gandevi taluka Mamlatdar (Taluka Chief officer) had issued arrest warrants against three female teachers and instructed police to arrest them immediately.

Police arrested one of the teachers, Nidhi Bharat Patel, as she was taking a class in Antaliya village of the taluka.

Another police team reached Gadat Primary school in search of teacher Geetaben Patel. However, Geetaben, along with another teacher Manisha Raman Patel from Undach Primary School, had gone to participate in a science fair at Vadsarang village.

At the fair, Gandevi BJP MLA Naresh Patel, stopped police from arresting the teachers. The teachers were asked to visit the mamlatdar office in the evening the same day.

"7210","","Five girls, students of a South Mumbai school, have gone missing, the police said on Saturday.

The girls who are studying in Class 8 at a private school did not return to their respective homes from the school on Friday afternoon, after which their parents approached the police, an official said.

Mid-term exam results were declared on Saturday and these girls had failed in two or three subjects each, according to their teachers.

After the parents lodged complaints, the police used a drone camera to look for them in the surrounding area, but it did not yield any results.

CCTV footage showed that all five were at Marine Drive in South Mumbai till 2.40 PM, but thereafter they seemed to have disappeared, the police officer said.

Probe was on, he added.

"7211","","New Delhi: Thanks to the final draft of National Register of Citizens (NRC), 40 lakh people are on the verge of becoming stateless. Among those who were found to be ineligible to be Indian citizens are government employees, legislators, teachers and even former president Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed's family members.

For Ataur Rahman Mazarbhuiya, a former All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) MLA for Katigorah, the news of his exclusion was perplexing. ""My family's name is there in the list, and so was mine in the first list. But what happened in the second draft beats me. Surely, this is a conspiracy and negligence of some officer,"" he alleged.

""I talked to the district magistrate who assured me that all my papers were correct, and that he would investigate and check where the lapse took place,"" he added.

Ananta Kumar Malo, the current MLA from Abhayapur South constituency, was also left out of the list. However, the AIUDF leader remained confident the error would be rectified. ""A lot of people didn't figure in the list. It will happen... it will surely happen (the name included in the list),"" he said.

But not everybody was as hopeful.

Sixty-three year old Chitrolekha Das, a retired Joint Director of Public Health in Assam, was also declared a 'foreigner' as her name found no mention in the complete draft National Register of Citizens (NRC).

""I don't understand,"" she said. ""My husband's name is there in the list and so is my sister's and brother's. If this is as vital a document, how did this mistake happen?""

A surprised Das isn't quite sure about what to do next. ""They say I have to file a form. My husband wants me to take legal measures. I don't know what to do,"" she said.

Mohammed Nurul Islam is a government school teacher who was entrusted with weeding out illegal migrants as an National Register of Citizens (NRC) investigation officer. Ironically, even his name was absent from the list -- all because he carries a Doubtful-voter (D-voter) tag.

Fifty five-year-old Islam is among 1,25,333 such persons who are stuck in the family tree verification, a vital part of the updating of the 1951 National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Bhabatosh Chakraborty, a member of SUCI(C) -- a communist party -- too couldn't find his name in the NRC draft. He too was puzzled about how he and his wife were left out of the list while his mother and son figured on it.

Shanta Bhattacharjee, a high school teacher and sister-in-law of former vice chancellor of Assam University,Tapadhir Bhattacharjee felt that the redressal mechanism for those excluded from the list was inadequate.

""It's like a trend. A lot many people in my neighbourhood have one of their family member's name missing from the list. How is this human error justifiable and why there wasn't any provision (in the NRC list) of rectifying such an error?"" he asked.

Another notable miss was that of the family members of India's former President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. The family of Fakhruddin's brother Lt. Ekramuddin Ali Ahmed, who hails from Rangia in Kamrup district of Assam, was shocked to find that they were not on the NRC list.

""Since my father's name is not in the list, we are a little worried about it. Now I need to talk with the elders in my family,"" said Ziauddin, son of Ekramuddin, adding that he would try to find documents to make it to the NRC list.

Azad Alam, the Vice Chairman of Municipality Board in Sivasagar was also left out despite completing all formalities.

""My father joined the ONGC in 1964. I have submitted all the documents. I am from here only. My sister's name is also there. My name will surely appear.""

In Sivasagar, the constituency he is from, a total of 12,350 people's name has not been mentioned in the list.

Those people whose names didn't figure in the final draft could file for claims and objections in prescribed forms in their respective Sewa Kendra from August 30 to September 28.","Names Missing From NRC List, Bewildered Public Officials, Politicians, Doctors and Teachers Ask What Next","916331545","2018-07-31","https://www.news18.com/news/india/names-missing-from-nrc-list-bewildered-public-officials-politicians-doctors-and-teachers-ask-what-next-1829595.html","News18",FALSE
"7212","","Stormy scenes were witnessed during the meeting of Delhi University's highest decision-making body- Executive Council - on Tuesday when several teachers entered the well of the house in protest against the agenda set by the administration. The council members claimed they were not consulted before drafting the agenda and hence several ""important issues"" were being missed.

Among the proposals tabled for approval before the EC members were several building projects with their estimated cost like Rs 3 crore for the renovation of old viceregal lodge's kitchen, that houses Vice-Chancellor's office, and creating a new statutory authority, namely Director North Campus. ""Several pressing issues like absorption of adhoc teachers, self-finance courses and the e-procurement procedure for any work, did not get even a mention on the agenda list,"" said Rajesh Jha, an EC member and a professor at Rajdhani College. Jha was among the teachers who demanded these issues to be included in the agenda.

""It has become really difficult for colleges across the university to go ahead with any development work after the e-procurement procedure was introduced in 2016. We demand the implementation of simple General Financial Rules (GFR) as it was before,"" Jha added. In 2016, DU had made it mandatory for all colleges to follow e-procurement for any work with a budget of than Rs 15,000.

The council members also raised the issue of DU's School of Journalism. ""The school of journalism is working with two contractual teachers for 128 students. How will they do justice to their jobs?"" asked another member while raising the issue at the meeting, including Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi.

The members also questioned the rationale behind creating the new post of Director North Campus. ""The university could not even fill all the sanctioned posts from long. They even failed to appoint a full-time pro Vice-Chancellor in the last two years,"" said AK Bhagi, another EC member and an assistant professor at Dyal Singh College.

Meanwhile, the long-pending appointments of 126 assistant professors in DU's law faculty were announced during the meeting.

"7213","","Dimapur, July 4 (EMN): The agitating ad hoc teachers have suspended their hunger strike, but any 'agreement' in regard to their demand for regularisation of their service, has yet to be. The 2015 batch of the All Nagaland Ad-hoc Teacher's Group (ANATG) issued a press release on Wednesday informing about the development.

The group asserted that it had considered what it claimed to be ""sympathetic concerns"" from various other groups based on which the agitators had resolved to temporarily suspend the indefinite hunger strike and ""all other democratic acts of resentment"" from July 1 until further notice.

The handout from the group stated: 'The ANATG-2018 batch on 30th June by considering sympathetic concerns from the All Nagaland School Teachers' Association (Ansta), the Naga Students' Federation, and the Eastern Naga Students' Federation, has resolved to temporarily suspend the indefinite hunger strike and all other democratic acts of resentment from 01-07-2018 until further notice. It is also to be noted that a final agreement is yet to be finalized with the government/department along with the Ansta/NSF/ENSF and the ANATG-2015 batch likely on 5th June 2018 (sic).'

The group stated that it had launched its indefinite hunger from June 29 and was to pursue it further. However, owing to the appeal by students and teachers' groups, the agitators 'acknowledged the kind concerns and gestures' temporarily suspended the strike.

The press release mentioned that according to the ""official legal statement"" made by K Sema, senior additional advocate general, 'the regularization of ANATG-2015 batch cannot be processed till any of the two legal options are being enforced i.e., till writ petition no. 145 (k) / 2017 is disposed off or till any order is passed by the court modifying the interim order dated 28-07-2017 favouring the ANATG-2015 batch.'

In view of the aforementioned legal options 'from the government,' the irregular teachers of said batch ""was compelled to opt for the second legal option i.e., urging the government / department to immediately file the Interlocutory Application before the court to avail any order that modifies the interim order dated 28-07-2017 which favours the ANATG-2015 batch, and redress our genuine aggrieved matter at the earliest.'

The group also sought to clarify that 'it was only due to the recruitment policy of the government of Nagaland that the present aggrieved grade-III ad hoc teachers had to occupy the vacant state sanctioned post on ad hoc basis.'

""Had the government conducted recruitment test before the appointment, the present aggrieved teachers could had followed the recruitment policy in order to occupy the sanctioned post on regular basis,"" the press release claimed.

""But the present aggrieved grade-III teachers had to complete a minimum of three years of service and appear the suitability test of which all the present 1166 grade-III ad hoc teachers have successfully cleared the departmental suitability test, spot verification of documents (sic) on 20th May 2017, with all other necessary clearances from the esteemed P&AR department.""","Teachers suspend hunger strike, agreement with govt. not yet","899380589","2018-07-04","http://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/teachers-suspend-hunger-strike-agreement-with-govt-not-yet/","Eastern Mirror",FALSE
"7214","","CBSE Students The Board had declared Class 10 and Class 12 results in the last week of May

After multiple cases of miscalculation of marks being reported during the re-evaluation process of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class X and XII exam papers, the board has served notices to several schools across Delhi and asked them to suspend five teachers.

The board has received thousands of applications from the aggrieved students for the re-evaluation of marks. According to officials at the CBSE, similar action is likely to be ordered by regional offices against schools where evaluation errors have been found. ""The re-evaluation saw some students in the Delhi region getting 50-55 marks more than what they had initially got when the results were declared in May this year. In one case, a student, who had initially failed in Urdu, passed after re-evaluation. A detailed report is being prepared in the matter,"" a senior official at the CBSE said.

The notices have been sent to three government and two private schools. ""Five teachers from the Delhi region; three from government schools and two from private schools are supposed to be suspended. Schools concerned have been asked to take the prescribed action,"" the official said.

The board, however, claimed to have witnessed lesser number of mistakes in calculations this time around. ""Last year, as many as 20,162 students from the Delhi region had applied for the re-evaluation and mistakes were found in only 5 per cent cases. However, this year, of 11,000 re-evaluation requests, marks were changed in 3.26 per cent of the cases,"" said the official.

The CBSE started the process of re-evaluation for those who had appeared for Class X and XII board examinations on June 1. The board had declared both the Class X and XII results in the last week of May. However, candidates who were unsatisfied with the marks they were awarded were able to apply for the re-evaluation process.","CBSE asks schools to suspend five teachers from Delhi for miscalculation of marks","895967438","2018-06-28","http://www.dnaindia.com/delhi/report-cbse-asks-schools-to-suspend-five-teachers-from-delhi-for-miscalculation-of-marks-2630766","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE
"7215","","The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is likely to serve more notices to schools over calculation mistakes found during re-evaluation of board examination papers, a senior board official said. So far, five teachers from the Delhi region -- three from government schools and two from private schools -- have been suspended after anomalies of up to 50-55 marks were found during the re-evaluation of Class 10 and 12 examination papers.

Maintaining that the most glaring examples of miscalculations in the Delhi region have already been reported, CBSE officials said a detailed report regarding the matter is being prepared. The re-evaluation saw some students in the Delhi region getting 50-55 marks more than what they had initially got when the results were declared in May this year. In one case, a student, who had initially failed in Urdu, passed after re-evaluation.

The Class 12 marks are especially crucial as Delhi University conducts admissions based on the board examination results. While such cases of miscalculations have been reported in the past too, this is the first time that such action has been initiated.

The CBSE, however, maintained that the percentage of mistakes have come down. For instance, in 2017, a total of 20,162 students from the Delhi region applied for re-evaluation, and in 4.97% cases, the marks were increased after re-evaluation. This year, 11,083 students from the Delhi region applied for re-evaluation, and marks were increased in 3.26% of the cases.

The CBSE had, on June 1, started the process of re-evaluation process for those who had appeared for the class 10 and 12 board examinations this year. The CBSE had declared both the class 10 and class 12 results in the last week of May. However, candidates who were unsatisfied with the marks they were awarded were able to apply for the re-evaluation process.

In 2017, the CBSE had decided to abolish the re-evaluation process but had to reintroduce it on a 'first-come, first-serve' basis after some students approached the Delhi High Court and the court intervened. The board had, last year, also set up two committees to look into the problems related to the evaluation process after receiving complaints from students and parents.

While the first committee was responsible for all looking into the evaluation and post-examination processes to identify and analyse discrepancies and suggest corrective measures to strengthen the process, the second committee was responsible for studying, analysing and suggesting systemic improvements in the evaluation process to make the system robust.A source said the first committee was also responsible for fixing responsibility by finding out the teachers/evaluators responsible for the evaluation errors.

According to the CBSE, the percentage of students applying for verification of marks in 2014, 2015 and 2016 were 2.31, 2.09 and 2.53 respectively.","CBSE tells schools to suspend five Delhi teachers for miscalculation in board exams","895373955","2018-06-28","https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-suspends-five-delhi-teachers-after-miscalculations-up-to-55-marks-in-board-exams/story-8NUIWw4gfDH8DImsTgQ0SI.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

Informing this to Eastern Mirror, ANATG spokesperson Bendang Ozukum said the assurance came after a meeting with the director and other officials which lasted more than two hours.

ANATG had earlier appealed to the government and the department for redress to file an interlocutory application (IA) before the court immediately for modification of court's interim order to regularise the 1166 grade-III ad hoc teachers.

Besides the assurance to file an interlocutory application, Ozukum said the department has also offered to enhance the scale of pay of the agitating teachers. However, he said the members have not decided anything on the offer of scale of pay offered by the department.

In the light of this development, he said the members have decided to suspend its proposed hunger strike which was to begin on June 27. At the same time, he acknowledged the move made by the director.

Meanwhile, Ozukum also informed that it has called for a meeting with the general members of the group wherein a final decison on whether its sit-in protest will continue besides other agendas will be arrived at.

The delegation has felt encouraged by the promise made by the parliamentarians to raise the matter in Parliament and also outside, they said.

The JNUTA also informed the MPs that 37 teachers have approached the Delhi High Court on the MCQ-based computerised online JNU entrance examination.

The body said they have sought the attention and intervention of the MPs in protecting a public university that has acquired excellence in research and teaching nationally and internationally.

""We provided the MPs a comprehensive document that exposes the vice chancellor's role in destroying the teaching and learning process in JNU.

""The delegation pointed out to the MPs about the vice chancellor's violations of the JNU Act, statutes and ordinances by constant misuse of his power of authority,"" the JNUTA said.

The MPs were also informed about ""the drastic cut in the academic expenditure"" in the university, including alleged fund cut for the JNU library and for e-journals, it said.

Issues of harassment of teachers, penalising members of the faculty and denying them their legitimate dues and undermining students' safety and welfare were also raised, the body said.

"7224","","New Delhi, Dec 21 (PTI) Delegations from the Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers' Association and students' union Friday met MPs from across political parties who promised to raise issues related to the varsity in Parliament, the JNUTA said.

The delegation has felt encouraged by the promise made by the parliamentarians to raise the matter in Parliament and also outside, they said.

The JNUTA also informed the MPs that 37 teachers have approached the Delhi High Court on the MCQ-based computerised online JNU entrance examination.

The body said they have sought the attention and intervention of the MPs in protecting a public university that has acquired excellence in research and teaching nationally and internationally.

""We provided the MPs a comprehensive document that exposes the vice chancellor's role in destroying the teaching and learning process in JNU.

""The delegation pointed out to the MPs about the vice chancellor's violations of the JNU Act, statutes and ordinances by constant misuse of his power of authority,"" the JNUTA said.

The MPs were also informed about ""the drastic cut in the academic expenditure"" in the university, including alleged fund cut for the JNU library and for e-journals, it said.

Issues of harassment of teachers, penalising members of the faculty and denying them their legitimate dues and undermining students' safety and welfare were also raised, the body said.

The JNUTA claimed that the Delhi High Court has said no disciplinary actions can be initiated against teachers for criticising the online entrance exams.

"7225","","The Jawaharlal Nehru University administration on Sunday accused the teachers association and students union of running a misinformation campaign and making allegations ""without credible evidence"" against it.

The administration urged the JNU community to refrain from believing ""politically motivated statements"".

JNUTA has been violating the established rules and regulations of the university and issuing press releases with false information, said JNU Registrar Pramod Kumar.

The teachers association and the administration have been at loggerheads as JNUTA members are not in agreement with implementation of compulsory attendance. JNUTA has claimed that teachers are being denied leaves.

""Implementation of attendance rules is challenged by invoking emotions against the administration. Most of the leaves of faculty members are sanctioned by chairpersons and deans and only duty leave applications for foreign travel and leave applied by deans need the approval of the vice chancellor/rector,"" Kumar said.

He said the agitators against the attendance rule staging protests at legally prohibited areas on the campus and not at the designated place for demonstration Sabarmathi Ground.

He also said allegations are being made without credible evidence. ""Accusations against the administration for alleged massive cut in the library budget are a glaring example.""

The JNU students' union protested on Wednesday against the library fund cuts and closing of one of the reading halls of the library. The union has accused the administration of cutting down library funds from Rs 8 crore to Rs 1.7 crore.

Jawaharlal Nehru University Student's Union (JNUSU) and Jawaharlal Nehru University Teacher's Association (JNUTA) have questioned the institute's Executive Council's decision to install a life-sized statue of Swami Vivekananda in the campus, Indian Express has reported.

Sources who spoke to PTI informed that the statue will be installed towards the right side of the administration block. It will be placed opposite the statue of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.

The Executive Council had explained its position in a statement to Indian Express. ""For a more pleasing look, it has been decided by the competent authority that a statue of suitable height and size of a historically important person like Swami Vivekananda -- whose contribution to the nation building is universally acknowledged -- may be erected with proper elevated platform, stone pathways, benches, lights and interconnected works, including public utilities, etc,"" the council said.

JNUSU and JNUTA have argued that the university does not have money for library funds and disbursal of the merit-cum-means scholarship to students. They have criticised the proposal to have a statue in this scenario.","Swami Vivekananda At JNU: Students' Union, Teachers Up In Arms, Question Source Of Funding For Proposed Statue","1007033316","2018-11-30","https://swarajyamag.com/insta/swami-vivekananda-at-jnu-students-union-teachers-up-in-arms-question-source-of-funding-for-proposed-statue","swarajyamag.com",FALSE
"7227","","Newly elected JNUTA announces strike on Nov 24 and mass leave on Nov 28

The newly elected JNU Teachers' Association in its first General Body Meeting condemned the ""ongoing efforts of the JNU administration to destroy the teaching and learning culture at the university and decided not to take the assault on the university lying down"".

The teachers decided on Tuesday that they would go on a 24-hour hunger strike on November 24 and go on mass leave on November 28 as issues raised by them were neither tabled or discussed by the Executive Committee meeting.

""Such indignity meted out to the collective wisdom of the teachers has anguished the teaching community of JNU,"" said the JNUTA.

The JNUTA alleged that in a circular dated November 13, the administration had announced that proposals for seminar participation, conference travel, project meetings, prestigious fellowships, including those scheduled during vacations will be allowed if teachers comply with the ""diktats"" of the university.

The teachers said that the circular goes on to say that they will be allowed to teach, conduct research and reimburse medical bills only if they ""fall in line"" and not question the ""diktats"" of the ""competent authority"", and that they condemn in strongest possible terms the punitive ways of enforcing these arbitrary decisions on teachers.

The JNUTA also passed a resolution at its GBM to oppose the announcement by the administration that JNU may now have a satellite campus for which private funding will be sought in which all policies of affirmative action and reservation can be flouted and allow for differential rates of remuneration for visiting faculty.

The JNUTA said that such announcements flow from specific clauses of the UGC regulations on graded autonomy that it rejects as it is a step towards privatisation.

The teachers said the administration has remained adamant on conducting an online entrance examination. It said that it was against JNU's unique interdisciplinary character that requires an entrance exam that is designed not just to test the domain knowledge across disciplines but also to test analytical capability through a combination of techniques. ""This pattern, and the fact that the entrance examination is conducted in 72 centres spread across 54 cities, through pen-paper mode and often answered in several regional languages, has ensured that the university has been able to fulfil the regional diversity and social representation mandated by the JNU Act,"" the teachers said.

They added that computer-based online tests at computer terminals in cities with poor power supply and erratic and unstable Internet connections will not only restrict access to students from remote areas and marginal sections of society but also prove as a great deterrent.

The JNUTA added that administration had also failed to explain satisfactorily the need to outsource the conduct of the test to a third party.","Teachers' union slams JNU administration","999353320","2018-11-20","https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/teachers-union-slams-jnu-administration/article25552624.ece","The Hindu",FALSE
"7229","","The Delhi University absorption/regularisation union has asked for increment and other health facilities, provided to ad-hoc teachers of Delhi University, as the Delhi University is in process to adopt University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines, the policies would allow promotion of about three thousand teachers who have been long waiting for their promotion. The teachers would be entitled to increment. The increment would be calculated after including their work as ad-hoc as well.

However, the union has now raised their objection stating that if the tenure as ad-hoc can be added to calculated to increment, then the ad-hoc must also be entitled to increments and other health facilities.

""Ad-hoc teachers of the University feel that University administration is discriminatory in extending the benefit of the new UGC guidelines to the ad-hoc teachers. We demand that our past ad-hoc services should be counted for the purpose of annual increments like permanent teachers,"" asked Assistant professor Manoj Kumar in a statement.

The teachers claim that before 2007 the ad-hoc teachers were also provided increment, but after that the increment has been stopped, however 29 teachers are still getting the increment.

""Before 2007, Ad-hoc teachers were provided increment and still their are 29 teachers who get that, the teachers appointed after 2007 are not entitled to increment,"" added Kumar.

With about 50 percent of teachers in DU still working on ad-hoc basis, their payments are made at entry level pay scale from past several years without any other service benefits.

The teacher claim that since they are equally qualified as a permanent teacher, they must also get equal pay. ""We are as qualified as a permanent teacher and share equal duties and responsibilities.

Addressing the Teachers' Day function organised by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation here today, he exhorted the teachers to help mould the young minds as able and responsible citizens.

Dr Jitendra Singh said the birth anniversary of Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan is an occasion for us to introspect whether we have sincerely followed the education policy charted out by the former philosopher-President. He said the teacher deserves the appropriate respect due to him/her.

Dr Jitendra Singh said 70% of India's population is upto 40 years of age and thus it is important to provide the right education to the children and youth.

"7240","","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The former leader of Mexico's influential teachers union made a combative comeback to public life on Monday after being let off corruption charges, by attacking the outgoing government in a speech and claiming its education reform had failed.

Long accused by critics of corruption, Elba Esther Gordillo was a powerful force in Mexican politics before her arrest in 2013, a day after President Enrique Pena Nieto signed into law a major education reform that she had opposed.

Earlier this month, a judge dismissed charges of money laundering and organized crime against Gordillo.

In a defiant speech to a hall packed with supporters, Gordillo described herself as the innocent victim of a political witch-hunt, and blasted Pena Nieto's attempt to shake up the education system.

""I have won my freedom again, and the education reform has been brought down,"" Gordillo told the news conference.

Pena Nieto faced resistance from teachers in implementing the reform, and his successor, President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, pledged to scrap the legislation in the campaign leading up to his landslide victory on July 1.

Gordillo's grandson, Rene Fujiwara, left the teachers' union's PANAL political party early this year to support Lopez Obrador's bid for the presidency.

Making her first public appearance since her arrest, Gordillo said she had been the target of ""political persecution"" that was used to tarnish the union.

At a news conference with Lopez Obrador later on Monday, Pena Nieto dismissed the notion Gordillo had been targeted for political ends.

Lopez Obrador, who following her arrest in 2013 had called Gordillo and Pena Nieto ""equally corrupt"", said little on her case save that the judge's decision should be respected.

Repeating his promise to ""cancel"" the education reform, Lopez Obrador said the 73-year-old Gordillo would not serve in his government.

Hundreds of members of the National Union of Education Workers (SNTE), one of the largest in Latin America with over 1.5 million members, crowded into one of the salons of the hotel in Mexico City where Gordillo delivered her speech.

""My loyalty and my place has always been, and always will be, alongside the teachers of Mexico, and the defense of public education,"" Gordillo said.

Gordillo led the teachers union for years and belonged to Pena Nieto's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, until breaking with the party over a decade ago.

"7241","","Coimbatore: The Association of University Teachers (AUT) on Sunday ratified its decision to remove its president J Gandhiraj from the post and also from his primary membership, citing 'anti-association activities'. The move came at its general council meeting held in the city.

A release from AUT said Gandhiraj was expelled for his 'unilateral decision' to support the 'illegal cause' of its Trichy zone secretary A Pasupathy, who was charged with sexual harassment of a fellow teacher. The decision to expel him was first taken at the AUT's central executive committee meeting held on July 1, the release said.

N Shettu, general secretary of AUT, told TOI that Pasupathy was removed from his post and the primary membership of the association on May 2, after sexual harassment charges against him were proved. ""As the association's president has been expelled, we have appointed an election officer, who would schedule the election to choose a new president,"" he said.

The association also urged the Centre not to replace the existing University Grants Commission (UGC) with the newly-proposed Higher Education Commission of India. Shettu said the decision would bring in problems in grants for educational institutions.

AUT said any attempt to replace UGC with a bureaucratic setup was a retrograde move. The association, meanwhile, thanked the state for implementing the seventh UGC scales of pay for college and university teachers and urged the government to release the benefits immediately.

It also expressed its gratitude to the state governmrnt for declaring 41 constituent colleges as government colleges.","Univ teachers' association expels prez for 'anti-union activities' - Times of India","906130951","2018-07-15","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/univ-teachers-association-expels-prez-for-anti-union-activities/articleshow/65001854.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

Two Right to Information (RTI) applications have found holes in Union Minister of Human Resource and Development (HRD) Prakash Javadekar's claims that thousands of bogus teachers have been detected.

At the release of All India Survey on Higher Education 2016-17 report in New Delhi on January 5, 2018, Javadekar had claimed that 80,000 fake teachers have been found through use of Aadhar.

However, replying to an RTI filed on January 10, HRD ministry's Department of Higher Education has said that it does not have the details of the bogus teachers.

The RTI had asked for information on state-wise break up of bogus teachers, their names and the colleges or universities these teachers were employed in.

The department's reply was vague. ""As per gurujan (gurujan.gov.in) portal, 85,708 Aadhar numbers are found to be either duplicate or invalid"" the department said without providing the details that the applicant had sought.

In another RTI, an applicant wanted to know if any inquiry committee had been set up and if any disciplinary action was taken.

The higher education department's reply was terse: ""...the information sought as per your RTI application is not available with division.""

The 1.7-million-member national union notified the San Francisco-based Wells Fargo on Thursday (local time) that it is dropping the bank as a recommended mortgage lender.

In a letter to Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan, president of the AFT Randi Weingarten, wrote, ""We can only assume that, in light of your silence ... you have decided that the NRA business is more valuable to you than students and their teachers are."" reported the Hill.

""We know that our efforts will fetch only partial results. It is difficult to convince even BPL families about the utility of government schools. The thought that their children will be educated in a better way in English medium schools is ingrained in their minds,"" a teacher of Tiruverumbur Panchayat Union said. Another important objective behind the door-to-door campaign is more pragmatic.

Irrespective of the number of students on rolls, a primary school is sanctioned two teachers including headmaster. On an average, one teacher is sanctioned for 30 students.

In their desperation to retain existing students, teachers of some schools pool in money to engage extra hands through parent-teacher organisations. Some undertake the cost of transporting students back to their homes. Losing teachers due to inadequate student strength complicates matters. It becomes a herculean task to reverse the sanction even after a hike in numbers in subsequent years, another headmaster said.

The National Education Union (NEU), which is debating the issue at a meeting in Brighton over the weekend, criticised the country's schools watchdog for interfering in the matter.

The chief of the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) Amanda Spielman has spoken out about her concerns over Muslim girls as young as five wearing the headscarf and suggested that school inspectors explore why they are doing so.

""I think it is a problem that Amanda Spielman, Her Majesty's chief inspector [of schools], speaks out on this in a way which I think is frankly very political,"" said Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the NEU, at the opening of the NEU's annual conference on Friday.

"7256","","In over four years at Jawaharlal Nehru University, the present crisis regarding compulsory attendance is the first instance I have seen when students -- cutting across party affiliations -- have come together as one. Students have normally always been divided between the binary of Left and Right even on relatively neutral issues like hostel availability, fellowships and seat cuts. This is the first time that the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), All India Students Association (AISA), Students Federation of India (SFI), Democratic Students Front (DSF), National Students Union of India (NSUI) and other groups have come together to oppose the administration.

File image of JNU campus. Image courtesy: www.jnu.ac.in

What is at stake can be gauged from the fact that JNU Teachers Association (JNUTA), JNU Students Union (JNUSU) and all other organisations on campus are unanimous in opposing the decision of the administration to make attendance compulsory. For someone who has never been to JNU, all this fuss will certainly be somewhat strange. Regular academic courses are supposed to be taught through classrooms and hence, mandatory attendance is a logical consequence. Also guidelines provided to the universities by the UGC clearly lay down a minimum requirement of 75 percent attendance in classroom programs. At a first glance, it seems bizarre to even oppose the JNU administration.

Here, one should understand that attendance registers were never used at JNU. Since its inception and until this year, there has been no system of marking the attendance of a student in any course. That said, during my stay at the university, I have never met any student missing class without any reason. Students attend class not out of fear, but for the high quality of lectures on offer and the interesting structure of courses. It is a pity for the Indian education system that rather than following the successful model of JNU, which kept its high ranking over the years, UGC has always had to force attendance on students. This, even though forced attendance has given us nothing but a deteriorating higher education system. For instance, Aligarh Muslim University, Banaras Hindu University, Allahabad University and others have seen a steady decline in academic quality after this attendance system came into place.

The news caught the attention of the national media last week when students marched to the administrative block and held a protest rally. The administrative block or 'Freedom Square' has been the site of many protests before the administration banned any protests within a 100-metre radius of the block. Even though the JNUSU, JNUTA and other outfits called this ban an attack on political freedom on campus, for over a year, nobody dared to violate the order.

It was the almost non-existent NSUI that held a 'Pakoda Protest' last week within the 100-metre radius, to protest against the Narendra Modi government's policies and the attendance issue. The Left-led students union as well as the ABVP went into a crisis of legitimacy. NSUI with a handful of cadres dared to challenge the administration, while the bigger outfits paid lip service. As four members of the NSUI were slapped with huge fines, all the parties decided to launch a civil disobedience movement to show that they too could challenge the administration.

This internal political battle of JNU has again made it a hot topic of debate in the country, but it took us away from the real issue.

While debate should be around the legitimacy of forcing adult students in general, JNUSU and JNUTA are making it a battle between the BJP/RSS and JNU. Slogans that are being raised in the campus and the articles being produced in the media reek of elitism. JNU students and teachers seem to believe that their university deserves special treatment. Compulsory attendance is a feature of UGC guidelines to the universities. It should have been pointed out by national outfits like ABVP, NSUI, AISA, SFI etc that forcing students to attend the classes serves no purpose.

A working model of JNU shows that interesting course structure and good teachers can attract 100 percent attendance to classes. What is happening is that in various articles, pamphlets and slogans, they are pointing out that JNU is different from other universities and students here are special. It is another way of imposing a Brahminical class system. They want to keep their privilege of free environment to themselves, while being silent on the lack of freedom in other universities. Hence, maintaining inequality at the institutional level among the various institutions.

Many professors from JNU have rightly pointed out that research through field work surveys will suffer if student has to visit the centre everyday to sign the attendance sheet. Their movement would have been more credible had they raised the issue at the pan-India level. Why do they think students at Jamia Millia Islamia, AMU, BHU etc do not face these problems? Why do they think they are special? They are special because the model they are trying to save for themselves is not being implemented in other institutions.

Moreover, JNUSU leaders are equating this diktat as a Hindutva attack on a 'secular liberal institution'. They are calling classroom with forced attendance a shakha. For the sake of general knowledge, compulsory attendance is a feature of UGC guidelines that has never been opposed by any government. Taking shot at the past of the vice-chancellor Jagadesh Kumar (particularly, his stint at IIT-Delhi), students can be heard raising the slogans ""JNU ko IIT nahi banne denge (We won't let JNU turn into IIT)"". Any person with a basic reading of mass movements knows the importance of language to form public opinion. Do these students leaders really believe that Indian public will support them for not transforming into an IIT? Not going into the details, IIT remains an epitome of quality education in India.

It is high time that rather than showing their elitist narrow pride in JNU culture, these students leaders try to form a pan-Indian public opinion against compulsory attendance. After all, the people who are eligible to elect their government are responsible enough to decide on if they want to attend a class or not.

Excerpts from an interview with Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar

Q. Shiksha Mitras held huge protests in UP recently...

A. A large number of teachers were appointed under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and RTE. It's impossible to confirm all of them at one go. Since education is a state subject, every state has its own rules. However, the Centre had mandated TET as a qualification. The appointment of those who did not clear TET has now been reversed in UP. The government has organized a second TET exam. After RTE, teachers were given the option of getting a diploma in education. Some 4-5 lakh teachers did, but another 15 lakh did not. Now they have been given another chance, till 2019.

Q. Last December, you told Parliament there were close to nine lakh primary school teacher vacancies.

A. That is not true. The student teacher ratio should be 30, so there are enough teachers. The problem is in their deployment. No one wants to go to rural areas, so the shortage seems starker there. That is why we have instructed all states to ensure proper deployment.

Q. What concrete steps is the Centre taking on primary education? Is the RTE being reviewed?

A. We are not reviewing RTE, we are in fact strengthening it. We have defined learning outcomes. On the basis of these, a National Assessment Survey was done on November 13, which will henceforth be an annual exercise.

Q. The states complain that they do not have enough funds for primary education.

A. That is not so. In 2014, states used to get Rs 3 lakh crore, which has gone up to Rs 6 lakh crore now. The 14th Finance Commission had recommended that allocation for education be increased 10 per cent every year. States that aren't doing so are the ones now complaining.","Teachers do not want to work in rural areas: Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar","792046335","2018-01-11","https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/opinion/saumitra-chaudhuri/story/19700101-null-1097220-2017-11-30","India Today",FALSE
"7258","","Ludhiana: After facing outrage by teachers' unions, the district education department has reinstated the head teacher and class teacher of Government Elementary School, Baba Sri Chand Colony, Mundiya Kalan. However, the teachers are in no mood to give up the issue.

On Monday, several teachers under different teachers' unions gathered outside the office of the deputy commissioner and staged a protest. The teacher demanded action against the local political leader for misbehaving with teachers and also for backing out than taking responsibility to clean the school campus. They also demanded safai karamcharis under MC to do the job.

The teachers unions, following a protest, met deputy commissioner Pradeep Agarwal and submitted their memorandum to him.

The teachers have demanded action against him for barging into school, misbehaving with the teachers and defaming them.

Besides this, the teachers have demanded funds to hire safai karamcharis or to ask safai karamcharis under MC to clean the school campus. Teacher Sukhdhir Sekhon said, ""The teachers have been reinstated. However, the issue is not over yet. The problem of cleaning schools will not be resolved until we get safai karamcharis. There is no post of sweepers in primary schools and therefore we have placed our demands for safai karamcharis under MC to clean school campus. We have submitted our demand to DC, who has assured us that he will pursue the matter.""

Another teacher Satvir Singh Rohni said, ""We have demanded action against the local leader who had misbehaved with our teachers, videographed them and uploaded the video on social medial to defame them. We want him to be booked under criminal charges.""

He added, ""If action is not taken against him in 15 days, the teachers will take to the roads and protest.""

In the meantime, Agarwal said, ""The demands of the teachers would be taken up with the concerned officials.""

On Monday, the district education office has issued orders to all block primary education officers in the district to ensure that no student is sent outside campus during school hours.

Talking about the absence of safai karamcharis in schools, DEO Jaspreet Kaur said, ""The problem is there in the entire state. But the issue can be resolved if teachers make some efforts. In different areas, some schools have managed to get sweepers with the help of councillors, sarpanches and school management committee.

Bahuguna told the Chief Minister she had worked in a remote region for the last 25 years and wanted an easier posting.

She said her request was dismissed by the chief minister. She then started arguing and demanding to know why.

""I lost my husband in 2015 and my children stay here (Dehradun). I can't leave my children here. I spoke to the Chief Minister but he did nothing. I asked him the reason. He suddenly raised his hand and said you are a teacher, behave yourself,"" Bahuguna told news agency ANI today, weeping.

Condemning the arrest of the teacher, former chief minister Harish Rawat on Friday demanded a revoke on her suspension.

""Our system has become so insensitive that a widowed teacher remained posted in a remote area for 25 years and no one listened to her.

The incident invited criticism against the Manipur Government. Reacting to the incident, Chief Minister N Biren Singh assured stringent action against those involved.

The arrested students and teachers of the varsity, including Prof. S. Dorendrajit, were later released on Tuesday after signing a MoU between the agitators and Manipur Government.

Soon after his release, Dorendrajit termed the episode distasteful and de-humanising. ""I find the treatment given to me by the jail authority not dignified for a teacher,"" he added.","Jail staff, head warden suspended for 'cuffing' Manipur University teacher during medical checkup","972830267","2018-10-18","https://indianexpress.com/article/north-east-india/manipur/jail-staff-head-warden-suspended-for-cuffing-manipur-university-teacher-during-medical-checkup-5408108/","The Indian Express",FALSE
"7280","","Miller has been identified as the driving force behind the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy that separated immigrant children from their families at the US-Mexico border.

A teacher who claimed that Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump's senior policy adviser and an immigration hardliner, ate glue as a kid has reportedly been suspended from her job.

Teacher Nikki Fiske told The Hollywood Reporter this week that, as a child, Miller would ""pour the glue on his arm, let it dry, peel it off, and then eat it. He was a strange dude.""

""I remember being concerned about him - not academically. He was OK with that, though I could never read his handwriting. But he had such strange personal habits. He was a loner and isolated and off by himself all the time,"" she said.

She said that she had a lot of ""concerns"" about Miller, so the school's principal ""took some white-out and blanked out all my comments.""

""Of course, Stephen wasn't political then - it wasn't until later that he started to make waves,"" Fiske wrote.

Now, the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District has placed her on ""home assignment"" while it decides what to do, if anything, about Fiske's comments, the Los Angeles Times reported.

A school district spokesperson told the Times that they were concerned about ""her release of student information.""

Miller has been a rising star on the far right for years, often making headlines because of his polarizing demeanor and statements.

Miller is reportedly sometimes too extreme even for President Trump. His uncle criticized him in an op-ed for Politico in August, who wrote that Millier's policies today would have made his families journey from Eastern Europe to a series of successful family businesses in the US impossible.","Stephen Miller's third grade teacher who said he ate glue as a kid has been suspended","967861280","2018-10-12","https://www.businessinsider.in/stephen-millers-third-grade-teacher-who-said-he-ate-glue-as-a-kid-has-been-suspended/articleshow/66181981.cms","businessinsider.in",FALSE

The teacher in charge of a North Delhi Municipal Corporation primary boys school in Wazirabad has been

suspended for segregating Hindu and Muslim students into different sections.

The Indian Express reported on Wednesday that the section-wise break-up of students showed segregation on religious lines. The teacher, C B Singh Sehrawat, had denied deliberate segregation, but said it ""was a management decision to try and do the best we can to see that there is peace, discipline and a good learning environment in the school"".

According to sources, a preliminary investigation found Sehrawat guilty of segregating the students. ""It was found that this segregation started in August, after the person took charge in July. He undertook this action without any kind of direction or guidance from any official from the education department. We received no information or complaint regarding this earlier. We were shocked when we heard about this,"" said a senior official of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation's education department.

According to a PTI report, the Union HRD Ministry has asked for a report. ""We haven't received any complaint yet but have read about it in media reports. I have asked for a report,"" HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar was quoted as saying.

"7300","","Pune, July 21 (IANS) In a shocking incident, a schoolteacher here has been suspended for snipping off a student's hair in front of the entire class, officials said.

The 'barberic' incident happened on July 17 at the Vishrantwadi Pune International School, shocking the academic community and parents in Maharashtra's educational hub.

A Class 6 student, Aryan Amit Waghmare, 10, was allegedly meted out the strange 'punishment' by his teacher Shweta Gupta, as the entire classroom looked.

According to the student's mother, Aditi Waghmare, the teacher grabbed a pair of scissors and snipped off Aryan's hair from the front and the sides, spoiling his hairstyle and looks.

""No reason was given to us for such a penalty... This is the second time such an incident has happened with my son. Earlier, in the third week of June, his hair was similarly cut off, but we did not take it too seriously,"" a distraught Waghmare told IANS.

This time, the Waghmares went to the Vishrantwadi Police Station and complained about the incident following which the school authorities were summoned.

""What happened was wrong... We warned the school management that such things should not be repeated. The school authorities informed us that the concerned teacher had been suspended,"" said Vishrantwadi Police Station Inspector Sangita D. Patil.

However, Patil added that the parents have not lodged a formal complaint, so the police have yet to register an offence against the school or the teacher.

When contacted by IANS, school Vice Principal Jaishree Kadam confirmed that the teacher Shweta Gupta had been suspended, but declined to comment further.

Not satisfied, the Waghmare plan to initiate legal action against the schoolteacher for ""causing severe trauma to the child, who is now scared of attending school"".

This is the second major incident which has rocked Pune's educational fraternity in the past fortnight.

Earlier this month, the MIT Vishwashanti Gurukul School, Kothrud had created a furore after it mandated that all girl students must sport only ""white or beige coloured underwear"" below their uniform white skirts.

The bizarre order was hastily revoked on July 5 after direct intervention of Education Minister Vinod Tawde and a probe by the regional education department.

And now, she has received a call from the makers of Bigg Boss 12 to be a part of the show.

The woman has now got a call from the makers of Bigg Boss. However, she has refused to participate.","Bigg Boss 12 Makers Approach School Teacher Suspended By Uttarakhand CM For Arguing With Him","899159328","2018-07-04","https://www.indiatimes.com/entertainment/celebs/bigg-boss-12-makers-approach-school-teacher-suspended-by-uttarakhand-cm-for-arguing-with-him-348696.html","indiatimes.com",FALSE
"7306","","The system treats those who are not politically well connected heartlessly.

It was like a durbar scene from the middle ages. A woman, advanced in years, pleads with the all-powerful ruler sitting on a raised platform meters away to help her. The ruler incensed that she has the temerity to raise her voice in front of him decrees: ""Suspend her! Take her into custody, now!""

The woman was Uttara Bahuguna, a 57-year-old primary school teacher. The all-powerful ruler was TS Rawat, the chief minister of Uttarakhand. The incident took place on June 28, during a public hearing that the chief minister was presiding over. The state police, following Rawat's decree, arrested Bahuguna on charges of ""disrupting an important gathering"". She was later released on bail.

Bahuguna, who has worked as a teacher for 25 years, has been posted at a school in a remote part of the hill state for most of her career. Having lost her husband three years ago, and with just a few years left to retire, she had asked to be posted to the state capital Dehradun, where her son lives.

When Bahuguna raised her transfer request, Rawat asked her if she had not read the rules before she signed up for the job. Bahuguna retorted that she had not signed up for a life of exile. It was this sharp statement that riled Rawat whose wife, Sunita Rawat, also a government primary school teacher, has been posted at one school in Dehradun, the state capital, for the past 22 years.

Using the Uttarakhand government's own classification, Sunita Rawat has had a sugam or desirable posting for 22 years and Bahuguna has had a durgam or undesirable posting for 17 years of the 25 years she has been a teacher. Under the terms of the state's transfer rules, Sunita Rawat's is a fit case for transfer to a durgam location and Bahuguna's to a sugam one.

Political interference

Undesirable postings are usually to those parts of the country that are in most need of attention. Their inaccessibility is often the major reason for their underdevelopment, and their underdevelopment is the major reason most people who choose to work in government do not want to work there. This is as true for teachers - some of who turn down promotions for fear of an undesirable posting - as it is for doctors and administrators.

Uttarakhand, for example, offered medical students a fee discount if they signed a bond that required them to work in the state's hilly districts for at least two years after they graduated. In 2014, of 331 doctors appointed on this basis and posted to rural health centres, only 66 turned up for work. That the government had to resort to a bond to get doctors to work in the state's hilly districts is a reflection of the general disinclination of government doctors to accept postings to these areas.

Governments in India have not found a workable solution to ensure that the remote, underdeveloped, undesirable corners of India are properly served.

Political interference is at the root of the problem. State governments have rules, laws and now computer-aided systems to try and make transfers and postings transparent. But all their systems are all too easily subverted by politicians for whom postings and transfers are a source of enormous power. Those who are politically well-connected can expect to receive a transfer or posting request as a favour. The rest may have to pay. A civil servant, who has worked in a state education department said: ""it is informally called the transfer industry...MLAs and education ministers make money on teacher transfers"". Teachers say, so do some bureaucrats.

Students suffer

Uttara Bahuguna's case has focused attention on the insouciance of politicians who live in glass houses and on the heartlessness with which the system treats those who are not active Union members and not politically well connected.

But it also highlights what this system means for the communities that are supposed to be served. In the last 17 years, Bahuguna has been on leave for long periods - longer than a year at a time. She said this was because of her late husband's poor health. At present, she has been on leave since August. This means that the school she is posted at, which likely has only a total of two or three teachers, has been short of a teacher, an experienced one at that.

This system works neither for Bahuguna, nor for her young students.","Political meddling is to blame for bad deal suspended Uttarakhand teacher and her students have got","899027292","2018-07-04","https://scroll.in/article/885031/political-meddling-is-to-blame-for-bad-deal-suspended-uttarakhand-teacher-and-her-students-have-got","Scroll.in",FALSE

"7315","","Dehradun: The 57-year-old school principal who was suspended for an altercation with chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat during a junta durbar here recently has decided to approach the Uttarakhand high court seeking justice.

Talking to TOI on Saturday, Uttara Pant Bahuguna, who is posted as the principal of a primary school in Uttarkashi at present, said that she has been running from pillar to post seeking transfer to Dehradun considering her age and service in remote locations for decades. She added that she would also submit before the court that the CM's wife, Sunita Rawat, has been posted in Dehradun for 22 years without any transfer while scores of other teachers have not been permitted to be transferred to the plains even after serving in remote locations for several decades.

Bahuguna said, ""Even though I was denied justice and publicly humiliated in the janta durbar, I have full faith in our judiciary. I will approach the high court and present my grievances."" She also claimed that her salary had been stopped several months back. ""The allegations that I had been drawing salary and not reporting to work are baseless.

Meanwhile, her family is overwhelmed by the emotional support pouring out from all parts of the country through social media platforms.

""I received a phone call from the education minister Arvind Pandey. He assured me that he would meet me on July 3 and would find a solution to my problem. He apologised when I told him of the injustice meted out to me by the department,"" said Bahuguna.

Rawat had ordered the arrest and suspension of the school principal for allegedly using ""abusive language"" in front of him.

Defending the teacher, her son claimed that the video footage doing the rounds does not show the full picture. ""The video being circulated is incomplete. If you look at the entire footage, you will see how the CM spoke to my mother. It is his fault that he instigated her. They're saying a teacher shouldn't speak like that but a CM should also not speak like that,"" he said.

The incident happened on Thursday at the 'Janata Darbar' of the CM here when the principal of a government school in the Nagaon area of Uttarkashi district made a transfer request.

According to a government release, principal Uttara Bahuguna ""showed disrespect and used abusive language during the Janata Darbar. She was told to put forward her request in a decent manner but she kept on misbehaving.""

Bahuguna had requested the CM that she be transferred from the remote location. She claimed that she has been posted to remote locations for the last 25 years and now wanted to live with her children.

The woman said that her husband had died and she did not want to leave her children as ""orphans in Dehradun"". ""My condition is such that neither can I leave my children alone nor my job,"" Bahuguna said.

The back-and-forth grew heated as Ms Bahuguna insisted that the CM give her justice.

""I never signed up for exile all my life,"" Ms Bahuguna said. Annoyed, the CM asked her to ""mind her language"" and then shouted, ""Suspend karo ise abhi (Suspend her immediately). Arrest her.""

In a video clip, the teacher is seen screaming at the CM and shouting ""thief, cheats"" as she is led out of the meeting.

Uttara Bahuguna was arrested on charges of ""disrupting an important gathering"". She was let off in the evening.

After the incident, Rawat said that request for transfers must not be brought to a platform meant for hearing public grievances. ""All transfers of government employees will be done under the state's Transfer Act,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Uttarakhand Rajya Prathamik Shikshak Sangh Secretary General Digvijay Singh Chauhan said he would speak to the authorities and request them not to take any harsh action against her.

On Thursday, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat directed the police to take Bahuguna into custody for allegedly protesting at his Janata Darbar session in Dehradun.

The Chief Minister also ordered her suspension, after Uttara Bahuguna allegedly used abusive language and showed indecency, while seeking a transfer from a remote location.

Later on Friday, School Education Secretary Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh said Uttara Bahuguna has been suspended as she ""violated the decorum"".

However, the teacher's son Shubham Bahugana has claimed that it was the Chief Minister's fault and he is the one who should apologise.

""After watching the full video, people can now see that it's completely CM's fault. He provoked my mother to behave the way she did. I don't think my mother has said anything wrong. Is this the way CM should talk during a public hearing? He should apologise,"" Shubham said.

And that they are expected to do certain things 'secretly' for a very senior official of the Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) to which the college is affiliated.

In return for their cooperation Nirmala Devi tells them, ""On the academic side, I can take the four of you to a big level, I can assure you that. He is that big an official. I will make sure that your marks are not affected. You will get financial support and academic support also. I don't know if you will tell your parents or not.

KV-1 principal and staff faced commotion from parents on January 29 on school premises after girls of Class IX and XI had complained against the Biology teacher Snehlata Shankhwar for making objectionable remarks on the girls who were outgoing in nature, who wore lipstick and revealing clothes.

The girls had secretly recorded several audios as proof and shared them with their parents. The girls told parents that they had sent a written complaint to the principal but no action was taken while they were continuously subjected to embarrassment and humiliation before other boys in the classroom.

Talking to TOI, Bhagwandas Ahire, principal KV-1 said, ""Based on written complaint submitted by parents, I formed an inquiry committee and personally monitored it. Within 24 hours of complaint, the committee had submitted report based on preliminary investigation, to deputy commissioner of KV who issued suspension of the teacher.""

He added that suspension was done on Wednesday evening with immediate effect and the teacher has been asked for temporary deputation at KV-2 till further orders. A high-level inquiry would now be conducted against teacher by the higher authorities of KV in Delhi.

The teacher was suspended after the claims made by parents and girls were found to be true in the initial probe.

Clarifying on not taking action upon complaint made by the students, the principal said that he had received an anonymous letter which could have been a mischief. Also, two days after the letter was received was holiday.

During the lectures, the teacher used to warn girls against wearing jeans and lipstick, saying, ""Girls expose their body only when they don't have beautiful faces.

The student, Ganhoti Nagaraju, was arrested and had to spend five days in prison for the ""misdemeanor"".

Gopa Kumar signed the suspension order on Friday, and pro-vice-chancellor K Jayaprasad circulated it on WhatsApp groups and to the media, without serving it to Pannian. He is yet to get the order.

An assistant professor in history, Narender was placed under suspension by the department of higher education on February 9, 2017. He was also chargesheeted under the Haryana Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules in July 2017.

The main allegations against Narender were that he had approached the local police against then principal of the college Ved Prakash Sheoran for corruption charges and registered an FIR without waiting the response from the department.

He was also accused of tarnishing the image of the department as well as the then principal.

Narender has already submitted his detailed reply against the charges.

In December 2016, Haryana police had registered an FIR against Sheoran for cheating, forgery and related charges on Narender's complaint.

Narender had made several complaints to the directorate of higher education regarding the alleged irregularities committed by Sheoran during his tenure as principal. However, when the department failed to take any action for a considerably long period, he had submitted complaint to the police.

Incidentally, statehood activists too have supported the employees' demand. They have also objected to the CM's wife, Sunita, serving as a teacher in Ajabpur Kalan (Dehradun), an accessible area for the last 22 years at a stretch.

Be that as it may, the ugly spat between Rawat and Uttara Pant Bahuguna followed after she requested him for a transfer to Dehradun from Jeyestwari, a remote area in Uttarkashi where she is currently posted.

The 57-year-old requested for transfer on the ground that she has served in remote hill areas regularly for the past 25 years and being a widow needed to shift to Dehradun look after her children.

In the video of the Janata Darbar which went viral in social media she is seen making her request politely citing those three grounds.

Rawat too is also seen light-heartedly asking her if she had also cited those grounds at the time of applying for the job.

At this the principal got agitated and shot back saying she had not given a written undertaking to serve in the remote area during her entire service.

Rawat also lost his temper and asked the principal to mind her language and warned her that she would be suspended.

On Friday, she was served a suspension order and education secretary Bhupinder Kuar Aulakh said at a press conference that an inquiry has been ordered into the entire episode.

She said Bahuguna has been absent from her place of work without obtaining permission from her bosses since 19 August 2017 and had also been suspended in the past for dereliction of duty.

She also hinted that the primary school principal can't be transferred to Dehradun as she originally belongs to the Uttarkashi cadre.

Rawat's decision to suspend Bahuguna though has drawn a trenchant criticism from a number of employee organisations who have demanded that he ""immediately withdraw"" his directive.

They, however, admitted that both he and Bahuguna should have maintained restraint.

""The chief minister should have maintained restraint and the teacher too shouldn't have used the foul language against him,"" said Manohar Mishra, the president of the Uttaranchal parvatiya Karmachari Shikshak Sangathan, an organisation of state employees posted in hilly areas.

""However, the chief minister should immediately withdraw his suspension order against the principal concerned as it was issued without evaluating the merits and demerits of the case,"" he said.

Mishra pooh-poohed the ""government's stand"" that Bahuguna can't be transferred outside Uttarkashi owing to the cadre related binding.

""I can cite a number of examples where employees related to influential people were transferred outside their original district and mandal cadres in brazen violation of rules,"" he said.

Rajiv Lochan Shah, a statehood activist cited the case of the CM's wife who, he said ""has been posted as a teacher in Dehradun for the past 22 years during which she also got promotions"".

Another statehood activist Sarita Negi said the chief minister's wife being posted at an accessible place for 22 years is also an open violation of the Transfer Act recently enforced by the state government.

Digvijay Singh Chauhan, president of the Primary Teachers' Association, said the suspension order against Bahuguna should be withdrawn because it was issued without conducting an inquiry.

""Similarly"", added Negi, ""there is a government order, which permits employees nearing retirement to be transferred to the places of their choice.""

The chief minister's media advisor Ramesh Bhatt clarified that there was nothing illegal about his (CM) wife not being transferred outside Dehradun district.

""She got her cadre changed from Pauri to Dehradun in 1996. Besides forgoing her promotions, she was also transferred to several places in the district,"" he said.","Teacher suspension evokes anger among employees and statehood activists","897075162","2018-06-30","https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/teacher-suspension-evokes-anger-among-employees-and-statehood-activists/story-Snxzmf5zQVtPRTFldSN7zL.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

A day after entering into a feud with Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat, suspension orders were issued against the government school principal who on Thursday had allegedly used abusive language for Rawat while she was seeking her transfer from a remote location to Dehradun.

On Friday, the Uttarkashi district's education department ordered that Uttara Bahuguna (57), serving as principal of the government primary school in Uttarkashi district's Naugaon area, be ""immediately suspended"" for violating the rules by ""attending Chief Minister's Janata Darbar without the required permission from the (education) department, and for showing disrespect (to the Chief Minister)"".

On Thursday, following Rawat's orders, Bahuguna was taken into police custody but was released by the evening. On the same day, Rawat had also ordered that Bahuguna be immediately suspended for misbehaving with him.

Addressing the media, on Friday, secretary (school education) Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh said, ""A preliminary enquiry has been ordered in Uttara Bahuguna's case. She (Bahuguna) will be allowed to present her case during the enquiry.""

After her husband's death in August, last year, Bahuguna did not join the school where she is posted as the principal. ""She has not joined the school since 19 August, last year, that too without taking any permission from the department. Between August 5, 2015 and April 10, 2017 too, she has been absent from service,"" Aulakh said, adding that Bahuguna had faced suspension twice in the past -- in 2008 and in 2011 - for not fulfilling her responsibilities at work.

On Thursday, Bahuguna had told Rawat that she had been serving in the remote locations for 25 years, and that she needed to be transferred to Dehradun since she needed to be with her children after her husband's death.

""On Chief Minister's orders it will be seen as to what can be done for her (Bahuguna) based on the provisions of the Transfer Act,"" Aulakh said.

However, Aulakh said that since Bahuguna was of Uttarkashi district cadre, she could be transferred only within Uttarkashi district, and not to Dehradun.

""In the list of people who will be transferred out of remote locations, she (Bahuguna) is on the 59th number, and currently there are only 12 vacancies in accessible locations of Uttarkashi district,"" Aulakh said.

However, Uttarakhand Congress leaders, including former Chief Minister Harish Rawat, condemned the Chief Minister's ""disgraceful behaviour"" with the school principal. On Friday, Harish Rawat took to Facebook where he mentioned in a post that while the school principal's behaviour must not be defended, Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat should have had the patience to listen to the lady's problems.

After the suspension orders, the state Congress demanded that the suspension be recalled, ""else we will protest against the BJP government's tyranny"", Uttarakhand Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Pritam Singh said.","Suspension orders issued against teacher who argued with Uttarakhand CM; probe initiated","896498535","2018-06-29","https://indianexpress.com/article/india/uttarakhand-teacher-uttara-bahuguna-suspended-cm-trivendra-rawat-transfer-5239189/","The Indian Express",FALSE
"7337","","A controversy erupted after Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat ordered the arrest and suspension of a primary school principal following the latter's angry outburst at the chief minister's Janata Darbar (people's court).

The incident happened on Thursday at the 'Janata Darbar' of the chief minister in Dehradun when the principal of a government school in Nagaon area of Uttarkashi district made a transfer request.

According to a government release, principal Uttara Bahuguna ""showed disrespect and used abusive language"" during the Janata Darbar. She was told to put forward her request in a decent manner but she kept on misbehaving.

Bahuguna had requested the chief minister that she be transferred from the remote location to Dehradun. Her claim was that she has been posted at the remote locations for the last 25 years and she now wanted to live with her children.

On being asked by Rawat if she had given any undertaking while securing the job, Bahuguna shot back that she had not stated ""she will live in a forest throughout her life"". On this, the chief minister lost his cool and asked her to put forward her request in a decent manner but she kept on ""showing disrespect"", the release said.

The woman said that her husband had died and she did not want to leave her children as ""orphans in Dehradun"".

""My condition is such that neither can I leave my children alone nor my job,"" Bahuguna said. The school principal also reportedly hurled abuses at the chief minister going on to call him corrupt and a chor (thief), after which she was forcefully removed by women police officers. Government sources said that the principal was briefly detained and later suspended.

After the incident, Rawat said that request for transfers must not be brought to a platform meant for hearing public grievances. ""All transfers of government employees will be done under the state's Transfer Act,"" he said.

Meanwhile, after the incident snowballed into a controversy, the state's school education secretary Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh said that any further action on the transfer request will only be taken in accordance with the rules. She also said that the suspension order was for the interim and the future course of action will be decided after hearing her side.

She also said that Bahuguna was 59th in the list of transfer requests. ""More than 58 people are posted in remote areas for longer duration than her. Her number is only 59th. The transfer is done only turn-wise. She can be transferred only within the district. Her demand that she be transferred to Dehradun falls under inter-dist transfers which, as of now, isn't allowed by the rule,"" Aulakh said.

However, Bahuguna said that she has served as a disciplined employee of the government and she only retorted after the chief minister ordered for her to be removed. ""Ise le jao, ise le jao, kyu vo is tarah se mujhe bol rhe the, kya mera koi puchne vala nahi. Main ek mahila shikshika hu,"" Bahuguna broke down while narrating her ordeal.

Speaking to The Print, Bahuguna also alleged irregularities in transfers and appointments in the state. She said she was transferred from her earlier posting at Jogath after the school fell vacant. She, however, alleged that another person was appointed at the school, who continued to draw a salary for two years, to run an empty school. The posting was only cancelled after much hue and cry. Bahuguna said she will compile the data regarding those principals who have been transferred despite signing the same government bond, which she did. The bond warrants a state government teachers to be posted in schools in remote hill-stations till the government sees fit to transfer them.

A high-voltage drama unfolded during a 'Janata Darbar' session that was held in Dehradun, on Thursday, where Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat instructed the police to 'immediately' arrest a female school teacher, and ordered her suspension after the woman allegedly showed 'indecency' and used abusive language with Rawat while seeking a transfer from the remote location after being posted in such locations for 25 years.

"7351","","Coimbatore: After a period of four years, the school education department has decided to conduct general counselling for transfer of block resource teacher educators (BRTEs) in the state.

Following promotion counselling for block resource teacher educators in February this year, the department released a communication on Tuesday asking chief education officers to receive applications from block resource teacher educators for transfer counselling.

The communication said block resource teacher educators should produce the proof of their pirority when they apply for the counselling. The chief educational officers have been asked to appoint two officers to verify and receive the applications. ""The transfer applications should be verified and uploaded to www.tndse.com. Two printouts of the uploaded application should be taken and verified with the concerned block resource teacher educator,"" said the communication. It said the process should be completed by Friday. However, it did not mention the counselling date.

N Velkumar, district secretary of Block Resource Teacher Educators Development Association, said there were 3,894 block resource teacher educators in the state and 182 in Coimbatore, Pollachi and Tirupur educational districts.

""We have been asking for transfer counselling for four years. Only now the order has come,"" he said.

"7352","","HYDERABAD:m The Hyderabad High Court on Monday gave clearance to Telangana to go ahead with its teacher transfer policy that governs 1.25 lakh teachers in the state. A Bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice J Uma Devi pronounced this order after hearing elaborate arguments made by advocates representing scores of teachers, who challenged as many as 15 aspects of the transfer policy and the state's version defending each of the decisions.

The Bench, however, struck down Rule 4 of the policy that made the district education officers (DEOs) of the erstwhile 10 districts of the state as competent authorities for making the transfers under Presidential Order. This is because the 10 districts are now expanded into 31 and there are 31 DEOs. There is no post of DEO existing as of now that covers the erstwhile districts exclusively.

As Presidential Order does not make it compulsory for the state to identify a competent authority, the Bench left it to the state to go ahead without naming the competent authority. Telangana additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao's statement that the state would ask its regional joint director of school education to issue transfer and posting orders on the basis of the erstwhile district as a unit was recorded in the judgment. The Bench framed several questions based on arguments of petitioners and answered them separately.

The petitioners contended that after the new districts were formed, the state got the Presidential Order amended in June 2017 integrating panchayat raj teachers and government teachers. However, upon a challenge to the same, the High Court ordered thaat status quo be maintained. The current transfers violated this status quo order. The transfer rules themselves are contrary to this HC order, they said.

Answering this question in favour of the state, the bench said that ""since the order of status quo disables both teachers working in local body schools and teachers working in government schools to be treated as an integrated cadre, it is only if teachers presently working in local body schools are transferred to government schools and viceversa, can the order of status quo be said to have been violated"". Admittedly, no such action has been taken by the state government. The bench also rejected the contention that status quo order would eclipse the amendment to the Presidential Order.","Teacher transfer policy of Telangana gets court nod - Times of India","898539194","2018-07-03","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/teacher-transfer-policy-of-telangana-gets-court-nod/articleshow/64838823.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"7353","","NEW DELHI: A 57-year-old teacher's trip to Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat's Janta Darbar for requesting a transfer landed her in jail after the chief minister lost his temper and ordered her immediate arrest. Uttara Bahuguna was held on charges of disrupting an important gathering and was later let off on bail.

A video of the incident, which has gone viral on social media shows the woman requesting Rawat for a transfer saying that she had worked in a remote area for long and now wanted to live with her children. ""I do not want my children to be orphans in Dehradun and I cannot leave my job,"" she is heard telling the chief minister in the video.

The chief minister, in response to her query, is seen asking her if she had signed any guarantee when she got the job to which Bahuguna said that she had not vowed to live her life in the forest. This reply annoyed Rawat, who shouted, ""Suspend her immediately. Take her into police custody.""

The video clip also shows Bahuguna screaming at the chief minister and shouting 'cheats, thief' as she is led out of the meeting. ""I lost my husband in 2015. I spoke to the Chief Minister but he did nothing. I asked him the reason. He suddenly raised his hand and said you are a teacher, behave yourself,"" Bahuguna said.

Rawat, however, said requests for transfers should not be brought to a public transform while Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh, the school education secretary said transfers cannot be awarded out of turn.

"7354","","New Delhi:

A teacher who asked for a transfer to Dehradun after 25 years to be with her children was turned away by Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat, suspended and even arrested on charges of shouting and misbehaving at a public meeting. Turns out, Mr Rawat's wife, also a teacher, managed a transfer from a tough region within four years and has been in Dehradun without a shift for 22 years.

An RTI or Right to Information query has revealed that Sunita Rawat started working at a primary school in Paudi Gadhwal in 1992. In 1996, she was transferred to Dehradun and has since never been transferred, even after a promotion in 2008.

Uttara Bahuguna, the 57-year-old teacher who paid heavily for her argument with the Chief Minister at his public interaction on Thursday, has been working at a school in Uttarkashi for 25 years and is desperate to shift to Dehradun to be with her children after her husband's death.

But an official said she can't get an out-of-turn transfer.

""More than 58 people are posted in remote areas for longer duration than her. Her number is only 59th. The transfer is done only turn-wise,"" said Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh, School Education Secretary of the state.

Ms Bahuguna had met with the Chief Minister once before. Yesterday, she told him after so many years at what she felt was a remote outpost, she wanted to live with her children. ""I don't want my children to be orphans in Dehradun. My situation is such that I can't leave my children or the job,"" she told him.

The back-and-forth grew heated as Ms Bahuguna insisted that the Chief Minister give her justice.

""I never signed up for exile all my life,"" Ms Bahuguna said. Annoyed, the Chief Minister asked her to ""mind her language"" and then shouted, ""Suspend karo ise abhi (Suspend her immediately). Arrest her.""

In a video clip, the teacher is seen screaming at the Chief Minister and shouting ""thief, cheats"" as she is led out of the meeting.

Uttara Bahuguna was arrested on charges of ""disrupting an important gathering"". She was let off in the evening.

""I lost my husband in 2015 and my children stay here (Dehradun). I can't leave my children here,"" Ms Bahuguna said today, breaking down.

""You can see in the video. He got angry when I demanded justice. I feel helpless. Is this what I get for working honestly and diligently for years? So I called them thieves. I will tell the truth even if god comes before me.","Teacher Arrested Over Transfer; What RTI Reveals On Chief Minister's Wife","896479079","2018-06-29","https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/teacher-arrested-over-transfer-what-rti-reveals-on-chief-ministers-wife-1875522","NDTV",FALSE

The reason being -- pictures of students from the school crying and pleading their English teacher to not leave had gone viral. The videos and pictures also caught the attention of celebrities like Hrithik Roshan and AR Rahman who retweeted media reports.

An English teacher named G Bhagawan was transferred by the government due to which the students of the school were left heartbroken.

Taking stock of the situation, the government authorities have now revoked the transfer order after the video surfaced which showed the popularity of Bhagwan among school students, reported NDTV.

Bhagwan has been responsible for introducing new and innovative teaching methods to students in the last four years that he has been there.

Overwhelmed by the love, Bhagawan says, ""I treated them like a friend, mingled with them. They can approach me anytime even after school hours. This bonding became a success.

"7361","","Readers' comments on TN teacher transfer: Teaching does not get the respect it deserves in India To sir with love

The people who write such eloquent articles are highlighting concerns that are intellectual and unconnected with the news that was reported (""Viral photo of students weeping at TN teacher's transfer shows what's wrong with education in India""). The problem is that masters of the languages do not wish to teach. They are not bothered about the students. Our best guide is someone who may not be a an expert, but is a real teacher, dedicating to holistic teaching. When a lot of restrictions are imposed on the teacher by the government and the judiciary, It is only his dedication and sincerity that matters. One should not write lofty articles without first experiencing the difficulties of poor students or the lack of proper infrastructure in small schools. -V Mohan Rao

***

While in school I was influenced by teachers who were lenient towards students. I liked them and so did most other students. If the teachers are not demanding, it gives room to learn at your own pace. The teacher not only teaches a subject but also keeps the flock on the right path. When children are young, news of good teacher leaving can make the heart ache, but leaving people behind is a part of growing up. This is not an issue of the teaching skills or the state of education in our country but how children behave while growing up. - Karthik G

***

Senior teachers are transferred if they don't have political, muscle or money power. We need more such articles on the present education scenario. This will create public awareness and more people could join hands to save the system. - Prasanta Chakraborty

***

In a typical school or college run by a state government or university, most of the students come from marginalised communities. They will be overwhelmed in attending a class conducted by a suave and sophisticated subject expert. Absenteeism and dropouts follow. They need someone they can connect with, that is more important. As they build trust in the system and confidence, then an expert can be introduced. A teacher like him is an asset to any school. - Sreeram

***

To produce such sensitive teachers, we must develop an environment where teachers and the teaching profession are given adequate respect. Currently, they do not enjoy the reputation they deserve. - Pradeep

At a crossroads

Congratulations to Shivam Shankar Singh for his bold and thoughtful message to the nation and the struggle to correct the path being followed by the ruling dispensation (""Why I am resigning from the BJP: A Narendra Modi supporter and party campaign analyst explains""). The leaders who focus only on getting more power tend to ignite sycophancy and build a mutually beneficial relationship with their constituency. Alas, the citizen wakes up too late to learn that his constitutional power, his vote, has gone in vain. Course correction can be sought by voting in someone else. But even when the government changes, these patterns stay the same.

Independent social media and social movements are critical to sustaining the the spirit of democracy. With policies anchored in unbridled capitalism, the fourth pillar of democracy has become the handmaiden of the government - most media are owned and controlled by the very people who pose a threat to constitutional bodies. Hence, the power of the common man evaporates.

I chose to join fifth pillar, a movement to fight corruption. Are we able to see, even at some distance, the light at the end of the tunnel? All constitutional bodies are made to toe the official line. The Congress has not learnt from its past. It's people like this author who can challenge the rulers with inside knowledge, which carries added weight. - UR Kaliappan

***

This is an unbiased and correct analysis. The author has gone into great detail and I agree with every word. Modi twists facts and talks too much. He is blind to the problems in the country. He wastes the taxpayer's money for his own benefits and spends a lot of time on foreign tours. He made false promises and defamed the Congress to win the election in 2014. The way he is troubling Kejriwal and ignoring the burning problems of New Delhi or keeping quiet about rising fuel prices, murders of journalists and worsening law and order situation is wrong. - Krishnarao Ukey

***

The article by Shivam Shankar Singh was excellent. Spreading false news is detrimental to the nation's health and every person or agency must refrain doing so. The government of the day, if it really cares about the nation's repute and pride, should bring in appropriate legal measures including severe punishments to ward off those unethical, unscrupulous tendencies. - Aarkay

***

Shivam Singh's analysis of Modi and Shah should be an eye opener for all about the danger the country will face if the BJP is elected for second term. - Sanjeev Doddi

Delhi row

We are all talking based on assumptions (""AAP vs IAS: It is the Delhi lieutenant governor's duty and obligation to end the impasse""). No one till now knows what the real facts are. Without that, all are going by what Arvind Kejriwal is saying. Are we to understand that the prime minister routinely picks up the phone and talks to the lieutenant governor? The author mentions that it is the LG's responsibility to sort out impasse. Likewise, it is chief minister's duty to be friendly with the prime minister and get the work done, not for the prime minister to come and do the chief minister's job.

Kejriwal made a mistake and should apologise first, as he was a bureaucrat first and would have faced similar issues with politicians. Instead of blaming others, he should have been taken the initiative to sort out the issue. Setting up camp in the LG's house is not acceptable, no matter the reason he gives. Surely, it is the chief minister's job to sort out this impasse. The prime minister has nothing to do with it. - Manohar Rajan

***

Kejriwal is a former Joint Income Tax Commissioner and hence was a bureaucrat of almost the same level as the author. The crux of the matter is, if you have an elected government in Delhi, but all final decisions are taken by the LG, then why have an elected government in the first place? - R Joseph

West Bengal politics

It is unfortunate that the organisation mentioned in the article seems to have failed to grasp that in today's times, the manifestation of regional pride needs to go beyond tokenisms such as the increased use of the most spoken local language on signboards and forever harking back to the glorious past (""Bangla pride vs 'Hindi-Hindu-Hindustani': In West Bengal, a new Trinamool front to counter the BJP?"").

This outfit could do itself as well as West Bengal a big favour by shifting its major focus away from symbolism towards playing a part in addressing the biggest problem that the state faces, namely, the limited growth opportunities for its youth.

Helping create an entrepreneurial mindset among the Bengali youth, as majority of whom have always viewed entrepreneurship as a consolation prize for failing to land permanent employment, could be a good first step in this regard. - Sumali Moitra

***

This is the right platform to establish Bengali identity in the state because l have seen lot of Bengalis do not get proper posts in employment, education and the like, whereas non-Bengalis get all the posts because the ruling party supports them. As a result, people are migrating to the state and native Bengalis are migrating to South Indian states. l request all political parties in Bengal to address this problem immediately to ensure our people get due respect and don't migrate to other states. - M Appa Rao

***

I really appreciate Garga Chatterjee's efforts and this noble cause. It is now or never for West Bengal. But until the people understand the facts that liebetween politics and other hypothetical issues, no larger change can be effected. We need strong communication and a healthy movement that can restore the Bangla identity. - Sumon Banerjee

***

From what I have read about this party, it seems to be just a branch of the ruling Trinamool Congress. It will act in favour of the ruling party during the Parliamentary elections next year. So instead, they should stop the drama and merge with the political party. - Sandip Mukherjee

***

Bengal is not a separate nation. This kind of move has cost Bengal enormously in the past, leading to the flight of brain and capital from the state and perpetuating under-development. It is high time that we rise above parochialism and work for the development of the people. In the name of federalism we are encouraging anarchy and compromising national security. - Manoranjan Dutta

Trash talk

Sometimes a person may litter unintentionally. The gentleman may have thrown out that piece of plastic in the spur of the moment, perhaps distractedly (""Mumbai man who littered versus Anushka Sharma who shamed him: It's a feud now. Watch""). Also, Anushka Sharma perhaps chose the wrong place and time to admonish him. But again, no one can claim that their mind always works the way it should. Virat Kohli could have restrained himself from posting the video of the incident on social media. I am inclined to believe that none of them behaved in the right way under the circumstances. However I see in this an opportunity for them to be friends if they comes in contact again, away from the media glare. - Dilip Kumar Bordoloi

***

If Anushka Sharma did not abuse the person who threw the garbage and only pulled him up, she did the right thing. We should all be able to stand up to these anti-social people who have no civic sense. - Shaha Ghosh

***

As a celebrity herself and the wife of a public figure, Anushka Sharma should have maintained her dignity instead of scolding the youth. The road is public property with all kinds of people passing by. We can't afford to keep paying attention to these trifles. Is this the first time she saw someone littering, that she is retaliating in this manner? - Rupa Chowdhury

***

People need to give them a break and appreciate Anushka Sharma's effort. They don't need any cheap publicity. They behaved like responsible citizens by telling someone not to litter. We need more like her. Indians are indifferent to the environment. - Manju Rangra

***

Why are we Indians so defensive? Why can we never show grace in face of a fault and own up to the mistake? I read Arhhan Singh's post. Do you think he would have had the same reaction if he was pulled over by someone who was not famous? According to him, he should be exempt from criticism because the plastic he threw out of his car was so small that it would not have caused much damage to the already half-dead environment. What else can you conclude from his argument?

Isn't this what we always say - what difference will it make - before taking one more bribe, breaking one more signal, or in general generally closing our eyes to wrongdoing? Add to that the fact that his mother also came to his rescue.

When his mother Singh called out Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli for causing mental duress to her son, what she actually did was successfully prove once more that we Indians do not deserve outspoken celebrities like Meryl Streep and others. Because much as we expect them to, when our celebrities actually speak for any sort of cause we troll them on social media or worse. - Surbhi Bhati

***

Anushka Sharma wasn't ranting or yelling at all. And why has the youth's mother jumped in? I'm sure he can defend himself. He should have gracefully accepted the mistake and kept his mouth shut. Moreover, do Sharma and Virat Kohli need attention? Kudos to the power couple. We need more like them. - Shital

***

This is a just a way for the couple to publicise themselves. Instead of posting the video, they could have just described the incident in a message. They are not the only celebrities advocating the protection of the environment. A number of other actors also support the cause without making noise about it. - Gurpreet Kaur Bhamrah

Eligibility test

Why is there so much confusion over these announcements? That makes it seem like a gimmick (""CBSE to continue conducting national teacher test in 20 languages, clarifies Prakash Javadekar""). It is evident that the central government is trying to impose Hindi in the country, but this will disadvantage candidates from southern states. The state should assess the GDP, income generation and tax revenue from southern states and compare it to the budgetary allocation to these areas to see the major disparity. Rulers in the central government should change their attitude and consider all factors in all Indian states before taking any major decisions. - S Janardhan

World Cup fever

It was very nice to read the article on Pele ahead off the Brazil vs Switzerland match (""Neymar only needs to look towards Pele to learn how to deal with man-marking at the World Cup""). I was in England during the 1966 and the 1970 World Cups and could see Brazil in action on TV. The author's description of Brazil's exit in 1966 is accurate. Simply, Pele was not allowed to show his genius and was physically tortured. His other talented compatriot, Garincha, was also not spared from attack. In 1970, Pele and the Brazil team displayed unforgettable football skill to win the Cup. It was sheer joy to watch. Owing to old age, I am not watching the late night matches this year. Hope Brazil can rediscover its skill, led by the talented Neymar. - Amitava Bose

Interpreting 'Kaala'

I am aware of the Dravidian and Dalit idea of seeing Ravana as an innocent man vanquished unjustly by Brahmanical forces (""Pa Ranjith's 'Kaala' turns the Ramayana on its head - by making Raavana the hero""). But there is hardly any historical or even textual basis to justify this belief. The usual Periyarist rationalism falls flat when it comes to believing in such fringe theories. Chief among the translators or retellers of the Ramayana, poet Kambar, goes only so far as portraying Ravana as a tragic figure who despite all his good qualities is blind to the willful sin he committed by abducting Sita.

Compared to the Mahabharata, the Ramayana is pretty much a straightforward story. It's not about your ideology or your gods versus mine. The Ramayana war results from a woman getting kidnapped against her wishes. There is no scope for Aryan vs Dravidian struggle there. For that matter, Ravana could have been an ethnic Sinhala and Puranas consider him a son of a Brahmin and hence a Brahmin king by extension. In the original version Rama eats meat and drinks wine, shares his food with a boatman, embraces him and considers him a brother - all these make him anti-Brahmanical to the core.

There has never been a ethnographic retelling of the Ramayana until mid 20th century and it has been the non-professionals that have taken it up to see that the neo-Ramayana fits their narrative. Besides it is just mythology. You can't call Rama an element of fiction and keep looking for historicity in him.

It would have been better if the movie focussed more on how the Ramayana has been appropriated by Sangh forces to peddle their deviant ideology. I understand the Dalit indignation against Hinduism but assuming things without a rational basis is no different than what they oppose in the first place. - Ananth Harihar

Dog's world

The six-month target in Uttarakhand could lead to large-scale cruelty towards stray dogs (""Uttarakhand High Court asks state to get rid of all stray dogs in six months""). Do we need more in today's India? The government should seriously consider Animal Birth Control. Mumbai is practicing it for the last 25 years based on a (humane) directive of Bombay High Court. Strays are picked up from the road and neutered. They are put back into the same locality. This is very effective in population control. I hope local NGOs will take up this issue. The option given by Uttarakhand court is either adoption or to send dogs to a shelter. It is anybody's guess what would happen to the animal in the shelter, given the already strained resources of our cities. - Aparna Vedula

Lakes on fire

A foaming lake is a clear indication of the failure of authorities to monitor inflow of non-biodegradable detergents (""'The largest septic tank of the city': Bengaluru's Bellandur lake froths again""). Let us cut the blame game and hit the nail on the head. Bengaluru is a major hub of the garment industry, where large amount of detergents are used. Many may be manufacturing cheap detergents to boost the bottom line. There is no point in beating around the bush. Increased detergent level in sewage is detrimental to biodegradation capacity of water sewage treatment capacity. The effluents, rich in detergent and organic matter, turn into a cauldron of foam filled with methane which can catch fire if anyone ignites it. Ask authorities the right questions. Do they have a laboratory to check the sewage ? Do they have the ability to check all the parameters of raw water for natural lakes? It is major governance disaster. - Sunil Kokrady","Readers' comments on TN teacher transfer: Teaching does not get the respect it deserves in India","893249036","2018-06-24","https://scroll.in/article/883400/readers-comments-on-tn-teacher-transfer-teaching-does-not-get-the-respect-it-deserves-in-india","Scroll.in",FALSE

A heart touching visual of a Tamil Nadu teacher breaking down, and students hugging, crying, trying to prevent his transfer went viral last week. G Bhagwan, the English teacher from Veliagaram Government high school, and one of his colleagues were transferred to another school in Tiruttani, as a part of Tamil Nadu government redeployment plan to maintain a teacher-student ratio of 1:30 in schools. The Veliagaram school had 265 students and 18 teachers (including the two transferred).

The Indian Express reports that Kavya, a 14-year-old who wants to become a tehsildar, Karthick and Anu Ezhumalai, whose mother wants her to be a doctor or a teacher - were amongst the students who wailed, hugged and held on to G Bhagwan, refusing to let him go. Karthick, who is now in class 8, a son of a mason, called Bhagwan their ""best teacher"". ""He made English my favourite subject. He used to introduce new books to us. Everyone in the class passed English in Class 7,"" he added. While Kavya said that Bhagawan was ""a father figure, an elder brother"". ""When I told him I want to become a tehsildar, he told me to write this down on a paper every day. He promised I will achieve it. He made us write a diary. English is very important for jobs and interviews, and he is the one who taught us the language,"" IE quoted her as saying. Interrupting Kavya, Anu said, ""Why should they transfer Sir now? He has to be here forever.""

For these three along with many other students of Veliagaram Government school, G Bhagwan, their English teacher was the only man who was supposed to show them the path leading to their dreams and aspirations, from their village in the border of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The 28-year-old teacher was transferred to another school in Tiruttani, about 40 km away from Veliagaram.

Most of the students in the school, that has classes up to 10th, belong to the OBC Vanniyar community and the rest are Dalits. Parents of the students, who are mostly illiterates, even approached the local MLA to try and stop the transfer. Even singer AR Rahman tweeted about the news, which was retweeted for nearly 5000 times, even MDMK leader Vaiko reached out to Bhagawan ""to console and wish him the best"", reported The Indian Express.

For a rural school, Veliagaram had an impressive pass percentage of 82 in the Class 10 SSLC exam last year. The nearest town of the school is 40 kms away, and the students who come by bus from far away have to walk for 3kms to reach the school. Academic activities were disrupted in the school for two days after the incident went viral. A colleague of Bhagwan told IE that the 28-year-old is very emotional. ""For the students, he was everything,"" added the teacher, who was reluctant to identify himself after all the publicity the school attracted.

The unique protest staged by the students of Government High School in Veliagaram, Thiruvallur recently to stop the transfer of their favourite English teacher G Bhagawan yielded result, even though on a temporary basis.

The authorities have postponed his transfer for a few days after witnessing the love and affection for Bhagawan, who is literally a ""god"" for the youngsters. The emotional appeal by the students moved Bhagawan to tears and the protest of the students made headlines across the state.

Bhagawan was teaching English for students from class 6 to class 10 and the students simply loved the way he was helping them with their lessons.

""This is my first ever job in a school. I was appointed as a graduate teacher in Government High School, Veliagaram in 2014. Actually, if you look at the teacher-student ratio I was a surplus staff. So they decided to put me in another school that was short staffed and I got transferred to Tiruttani,"" Bhagawan told The News Minute.

""They were hugging and crying and clutching my foot refusing to let me go. Watching them, I broke down. Then I took them to the hall and consoled them saying that I'll be back in a few days,"" he added.

The protest by the youngsters was the result of a special bond they shared with Bhagawan who was always ""supportive"".

""We don't want him to be transferred. He has been one of the most supportive staff members and has been like a brother to many of us,"" Nithya, a student, told The Times of India.

A final decision regarding 28-year-old Bhagawan's transfer will be taken soon by the education department.

Parents also requested the Tiruvallur Education Department to cancel his transfer.

A senior official of the Education Department said the English teacher's transfer had been put on hold for a week. The department plans to speak to the parents and students of the school to find an amicable solution.

""Normally, teachers are a role model for students and we understand the respect shown to the English teacher. However, other students in the rural areas should also benefit from such teachers,"" the Education Department official said.

"7369","","The state government, which approved the policy on March 7, has been keen to implement it from the current academic session, but had to put that on hold due to the teachers' protest. (HT File )

Faced with stiff opposition from the school teachers' unions, the Punjab government is contemplating to amend its Teachers Transfer Policy 2018 to drop the clause that puts a seven-year cap on stay in a school.

The policy, which was approved by the state council of ministers headed by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh three months ago, mandated that every teacher will be compulsorily transferred after completing seven years in a school, and no teacher will be allowed to seek transfer before completion of three years in a school. The school teachers' unions were up in arms against the two clauses from the word go and launched a stir under the banner of Sanjha Adhyapak Morcha to press for their withdrawal.

Balkar Singh Valtoha, one of five conveners of the Morcha, said the government has agreed ""in principle"" to amend the policy to accommodate their demands on these two clauses. ""An assurance has been given to us by the top brass of the school education department in a meeting last week. While they have promised to do away with the seven-year clause altogether, the minimum period after which a teacher will be able to seek transfer is also being brought down from three years to one,"" Valtoha told HT.

A senior education department official also said the government is willing to take a relook at the clauses. ""These clauses were brought to provide a level playing field and end complacency among teachers. The aim of the policy is to bring greater transparency in transfers. We will not let these small issues affect the overall objective,"" he said, requesting anonymity. School education minister OP Soni is holding a meeting with the department officials on Wednesday to discuss these demands.

The official said the final decision would be taken in the meetings of the heads of teachers' unions with the chief minister on June 19. The Morcha is also demanding regularisation of contractual teachers, full pay scale for teachers on 'equal work-equal pay' principle, changes in teacher-taught ratio for secondary and senior secondary classes, and amendments in the rationalisation policy. The state government, which approved the policy on March 7, has been keen to implement from the current academic session, but had to put that on hold due to the teachers' protest.

The policy has a number of significant initiatives aimed at improving the quality of education, and gives preference to teachers who have delivered good results and those who send their children to government-run schools. In a first, transfers will be carried out online once a year, except in cases of administrative exigency such as adverse pupil-teacher ratio and disciplinary issues, on a point system. Teachers will be awarded points out of 200 on age, length of service, performance, special categories, among other criteria. The teacher earning highest points will be entitled to be transferred against a particular vacancy as per his/her preference. Special category teachers such as women, widows, differently abled, or those with ailments, will get additional points. The state has about 19,000 schools with over 1 lakh teachers.","Punjab govt to amend teacher transfer policy, may drop clause on 7-year cap","886256275","2018-06-13","https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/punjab-govt-to-amend-teacher-transfer-policy-may-drop-clause-on-7-year-cap/story-aHeUQnW4h7yO57hFkOjrBJ.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

"7372","","Coimbatore: Several postgraduate-level teaching posts have fallen vacant as teachers in the posts had been promoted during the counselling to fill vacant headmaster posts in government high schools.

Out of the 1,172 vacant headmaster posts in government schools across the state, 1,167 posts were filled through the counselling. Of these, 1,040 posts were filled with postgraduate teachers, said V M Michaelraj, state information and communication secretary of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers' Association.

""Already, there were around 2,000 postgraduate teacher vacancies in the state. After the headmaster promotion counselling, it has gone up to 3,000 vacancies. The state government should fill the vacancies soon taking into account the welfare of Class XI and Class XII students.""

A section of school teachers said the vacancies should be filled by deputing surplus teachers from high schools. ""Earlier, vacant posts were filled by deputing qualified graduate teachers. The school education department should think of filing these vacant posts too in the same way,"" said a government school teacher, who didn't want to be named.

However, another section of teaches said if graduate teachers were already burdened with work as they handle Classes VI-IX, postgraduate teachers could be deputed. T Arulanandam, Coimbatore district president of Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers' Association, said postgraduate teachers with lesser work allotment could be deputed to nearby schools, where there are vacancies.

Promotion counselling could be a better solution, opined teachers. ""A promotion counselling should be held to fill the vacant postgraduate teacher vacancies, as there is a danger of an acute shortage of such teachers across the state to handle Classes XI and XII,"" Arulanandam said.

When contacted, Pradeep Yadav, principal secretary to the school department of school education, said the department had not yet decided on holding a counselling. ""But we will take measures to fill the vacant postgraduate teacher posts in government schools immediately.""

After six years, the school education department had on July 2 conducted counselling to fill vacant headmaster posts in government high school across the state. Counselling was stopped for a long time as a petition seeking a direction to the state government to include postgraduate teachers as eligible candidates for headmaster posts was pending before the Madras high court.

"7375","","BENGALURU: The state government has commenced the exercise of revising the curriculum for state board schools from the 2019-20 academic year on par with the National Council for Education Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus. For this purpose, the state government has constituted a legislature committee consisting of members of all the three major political parties -Congress, BJP and JD(S).

The committee, headed by MLC Arun Shahpur, has been given the task of studying the existing state syllabus textbooks and compare it with NCERT textbooks and submit a report.

This comes in the wake of a recent NCERT report criticising the content and quality of state board textbooks. The report highlighted that the textbooks introduced by the state government lacked activities that could help develop critical thinking in children. The NCERT team also observed that though attempts were made to connect with day-to-day experiences of children, it needed to be made more extensive.

The state government adopted NCERT textbooks for Class 9 from 2017 and PU courses from the 2016 academic year. However, Primary and Secondary Education Minister Tanveer Sait said NCERT textbooks (for English and Science) have been adopted for Class 6, 7 and 8 from the 2018-19 academic year. ""The Department of State Education Research and Training has already completed the translation work and even the print orders have been given as per tender for Classes 6, 7 and 8,"" he said. ""By the time the NCERT report reached the state, the textbooks revised by Prof Baraguru

Ramachandrappa were already implemented... a lot of objections were raised over the content and factual errors. Even the NCERT highlighted several such issues. But the state was unable to make changes and hence this committee has been constituted,"" Arun Shahpur told Express.According to the committee members, they have to study the state syllabus textbooks of all subjects from Classes 1 to 10 and compare it with NCERT textbooks. ""We need to recommend which part can be retained and which part should be taken from NCERT,"" he said.Meanwhile, this legislature committee has the power to constitute a sub-committee consisting of academicians.

According to sources, the panel headed by Dr Kasturirangan constituted to draft the New Education Policy is expected to submit its report in April/May 2018.

Owner Amit Bhati has claimed that he had rented out the plot for ₹10,000 per month in March 2017, and that K.M. Public School was run by principal Sanjeev Jha and vice-principal Raghvender Solnaki. The principal was arrested earlier.

Two students died while three others were critically injured after the boundary wall of the unauthorised school in Sector 45 here collapsed on them around 9.30 a.m. on Monday. The students were writing an exam at the time the incident.

The police said the construction material used to build the boundary walls was of poor quality. The trigger for the collapse was construction in an adjacent plot. It is alleged that as the backhoe loader and excavator being used at the adjacent site reached the school's boundary wall it collapsed on the students.

The parents of the deceased students accused the school administration for the accident and demanded strict action against the management. They said the school had claimed it was affiliated to recognised boards. The parents had protested on a road in front of Sector 49 police station, leading to a jam.

"7377","","KASARGOD: What the law could not, the people's movement did. An unrecognised school lost two entire batches when parents pulled out their children from classes 8 and 9, and admitted them in government schools.

The private unrecognised school in Kayyur-Cheemeni gram panchayat is reduced to up to class 7 this academic year, said panchayat president K Sakunthala, who led the campaign. In the run-up the admission season this year, the CPM-controlled panchayat had launched a sustained 'people's movement' against unrecognised private schools.

""Our target was to bring at least half of the students in unrecognised schools back to government-run schools,"" she said. ""There was a perception that private schools are better. We showed the facts. This particular private school does not even have a playground,"" she said.

Ahead of the campaign, the panchayat conducted a survey and found that 354 students from Kayyur-Cheemeni were studying in unrecognised schools. ""We managed to get 132 of them to government-run schools this academic year,"" she said. The president said the panchayat was not wrapping up the campaign. ""It is an ongoing conversation with the parents to convince them that government schools are better than unrecognised schools,"" she said.

The panchayat has set itself a target of 2020 to bring all the students in unrecognised schools to government-aided or run schools, and stop new enrolment in such schools. There are two unrecognised schools in the panchayat.

""In the second school, only 50% of its UKG students joined its class I,"" said K M Anil Kumar, a school teacher and convenor of the Panchayat Public education Protection Committee, formed to steer the campaign. He said Government Higher Secondary School in Cheemeni attracted 35 of the 132 students who left unrecognised schools. ""It is the highest,"" he said.

The private schools which lost two batches had 26 students in class 7 and nine students in class 8.

""Instead of joining the next level, all the 33 students took their TC and joined neighbouring schools,"" said Anil Kumar.

In all, 77 students joined government schools in Kayyur-Cheemeni and 55 students joined schools in neighbouring Pilocode. Kelappaji Memorial High School at Kodakkad in Pilocode got 20 students because of the campaign.GUPS, Padikeen enrolled 19 students, Government Welfare UP School, Kodakkad, got 15 students, and GUPS, Nalilkkandam, got 13 students from unrecognised schools.

The panchayat said it had conducted Education Gram Sabhas in all wards and door-to-door campaigns to persuade the parents to exit unrecognised schools. It said it was planning to conduct special tuition classes for students weak in mathematics, English and science.

""It was a demand that came from parents during gram sabha meetings urging the panchayat to make an intervention,"" said the convenor.

A school without recognition since 2014, its van ferrying children for the last four years without registration or permit, a driver without the requisite experience and an unmanned level crossing -- these are the many administrative failures that the police say led to Thursday's tragedy in Kushinagar that killed 13 students.

A team of officers from the district administration, basic education department, as well as police, began a detailed inquiry Friday.

The manager and principal of Divine Mission School, K J Khan, where the students studied, was arrested and sent to jail on Friday. Amongst the charges slapped against him are IPC sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (endangering life of others), 304 (culpable homicide) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy).

""The fact that he was running an unrecognised school and allowed van without proper documentation to ferry students saw the charge of criminal conspiracy against him,"" said Bishunpur police station house officer (SHO) Sanjay Kumar Singh.

Without recognition, it was allegedly a neighbouring school that gave transfer certificates to students of Divine Mission School.

District Inspector of Schools, Kushinagar, Uday Mishra said, ""As per the information given to me, the school had classes till grade VIII and the Seth Bansi Dhar School was giving certificates to students of this school but a detailed inquiry would reveal further facts.""

The Basic Education Department issued a fresh reminder on Friday to all the District Basic Education officers to check unrecognised schools in their respective regions and take action.

""We have regularly conducted drives against unrecognised schools and have taken action against those we have detected,"" said Sarvendra Vikram Singh, Director, Basic Education Department. When asked if they had any information on Divine Mission School during previous drives, Singh said he had no knowledge of it.

Meanwhile, he said, the driver Niyaz Ansari had got his driving licence just over a month ago. ""The Supreme Court had ruled that only drivers with at least five years of experience to drive school vehicles,"" he added. Ansari's age is also being questioned. While police were told he was 22 years old, this would also be looked into during the detailed inquiry, SHO Singh said.

Out of the four students admitted at BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur soon after the accident, two were reported to be out of danger Friday. The other two are still unconscious, while the driver Niyaz Ansari remains critical.

"7379","","In a major policy move, a large number of children who are enrolled at unregistered Madrasas and Vedic schools may be declared ""out of school"".

In a bid to map ""out of school"" children (those who are not attending school according to government) and bring them back to mainstream education system, the Ministry of Human Resource Development is going to conduct a survey and all those enrolled at such unrecognised institutions such as madrasas, gompas (Buddhist schools) and Vedic pathshalas, will be tagged under this category.

There are a large number of unrecognised madrasas, which are attached to religious institutions in the country and so are Vedic pathshalas, which impart basic knowledge on chanting mantras and teach Sanskrit texts.

This was one of the major suggestions that emerged in the report of the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) sub-committee, which was submitted to the ministry recently. CABE is the largest decision making body on all matters related to education. The report, a copy of which is with DNA read, ""There are a large number of children attending unrecognised schools/institutions. These schools/ institutions may or may not provide regular, mainstream education. Children attending all such institutions are to be treated as 'out of school', even if they provide regular education.""

""It is very important that at the time of mapping these unrecognised institutions, madrasas, vedic pathshalas, gompas, and other form of non-formal education centres are mapped and children enrolled there are counted as 'out of school',"" it added.

Apart from this, the ministry is also considering having a standardised definition of ""out of school"" children, which will be included in all government data bases.

The committee also suggested steps to mainstream children and once they are brought into the mainstream, their status should be changed to ""in school"" child in the database.","DNA Exclusive | Students of unrecognised madrasas, vedic schools maybe considered 'out of school'","843585211","2018-04-04","http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-dna-exclusive-students-of-unrecognised-madrasas-vedic-schools-maybe-considered-out-of-school-2600799","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE
