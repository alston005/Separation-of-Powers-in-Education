D. Shashi Kumar, General Secretary of the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, stated that schools had not even received the first instalment of the reimbursements that were due in September. It was difficult for private schools to pay salaries of their teaching and non-teaching staff, and meet the day-to-day expenditure. ""Some schools, in fact, had appealed to rectify the reimbursements of last year, which the department us yet to address,"" he said, adding that several low-cost budget schools are finding it difficult to sustain their operations.

He warned that many schools would refuse admissions for students admitted under the quota next year, as the delay in reimbursements is an annual problem.

Department officials acknowledged the delay, and stated that they are trying to simplify the process. They added that they would extend the date for filing for reimbursements by 10 days."
