Nature is everything for them. The tribals, who migrated to this place from the erstwhile south Bihar and now Jharkhand decades ago, care and worship the forests, hills and ever-flowing narrow streams descending from the hills.

These tribals love, protect and preserve the forest as they believe they can only survive in the lap of woods. However, they do not lead a normal life as they have been deprived of basic infrastructure like road, electricity, water, educational institutes, primary health centres and transportation facilities. In the 21st century, they still live like jungle men and women -- ignorant of another world that claims itself to be civilised and modern.

What has held back the development activities is inaccessibility. One has to trek miles to reach these villages. All efforts to build roads and electricity infrastructure have fallen flat due to lack of coordination between forest and revenue departments. The forest department, as for Forest Conservation Act, 1980, considers residents of these villages illegal occupants. This has stood in the way of the villages getting the ""revenue village"" tag.

Non-recognition of the human habitations as revenue villages prevents the education department to build schools and the health department to establish hospitals. There are about 10,000 people living in 61 villages of Simlipal forests.

""We have no primary and high schools here. The only Anganwadi centre has no government teacher. It is managed by Centre for Youth and Social Development, a development organisation. Since we have no hospital here, people are left to fend for themselves. Last year, we lost two children and a pregnant woman died this year as we could not take them to the hospital which is 12 km from here. We carry the patients on slings and cots and walk down to hospitals,"" said Sadhu Makhud of Jharjhari village under Thakurmunda block.

Early-age marriage is seen to be continuing in these villages. This has resulted in both mother and children suffering from malnourishment and other health complications.

Birasingha Ugrasandhi, a resident of Bhaliadal village, said despite repeated requests to the Mayurbhanj district administration, there are no activities related to infrastructure development.

""Besides roads, schools and hospitals, we also fight to get drinking water. Our village does not have tubewells or dug wells. The narrow streams flowing down from the nearby hills shrink in the summer and get contaminated because of overdependence on them by human beings, domestic animals and wildlife. Villagers often get sick after drinking contaminated water,"" says Birasingha.

Lack of education has forced the people to continue with their primitive living style - herding goats and collecting firewood to cook their food, besides undertaking poultry activities.

Agriculture has been confined to growing paddy and vegetables, which is at the mercy of rain god.

""Since we have no government mandi or procurement centre here, we are forced to sell our paddy between '1,100 and '1,200 per quintal as against '1,750 minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the Union government,"" says Jagabandhu Ho of Bhaliadal.

The villagers are yet to see a television set. For them, radio is the only source of information and entertainment.

Today, the villagers are living a little better life as Oxfam, an international development organisation, in association with Regional Center for Development Cooperation, a Bhubaneswar-based non-governmental organisation, is intervening in those villages. Erection of solar-lighting and solar-irrigation systems has brought about significant changes in their lives.

People are now able to charge their mobile phones with solar battery. They can now irrigate their land with solar water pumps.

With the help of development organisations, the area is coordinating with the district administration. As a result, some villagers have got Individual Forest Rights (IFR) and Community Forest Rights (CFR). This has enabled them to undertake cultivation. Grant of CFR has helped them procure forest produces without hassles, process them and sell them to various government and agencies, including state government's Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society (ORMAS). Such activities are slowly improving the local economy.

Dillip Subudhi, a leading researcher who spent over 17 years in villages situated in Similipal and forests in other parts of the state, feels there will be remarkable improvement in the life of forest dwellers once their habitations are recognised as revenue villages and they are given IFR and CFR over their claimed lands as per the Forest Rights Act, 2006.

""Though the Odisha government has a good track record in settling IFR and CFR claims, a lot of activities remain to be done. In villages, people have got IFR and CFR titles over their claimed lands. However, many of them still cannot make productive use of these lands as the lands granted to them are yet to be demarcated by revenue officials,"" says Mr Subudhi.

Speaking to this newspaper, state ST & SC development minister Ramesh Chandra Majhi said the government had asked the district administrations to complete the titles of the IFR and CFR claims by March 2019.

""We have asked the collectors of all tribal-dominated districts to settle the IFR and CFR claims by March 2019. Once this process is complete, you will see significant change in the life of forest dwellers,"" the minister said.

Of the 4.19 crore population of Odisha, nearly 23 per cent (22.85 per cent, according to 2011 census) is tribal.

In almost all the tribal-dominated districts, the conditions of those living in forests are almost identical, say social activists who have been working among the marginalised sections of society."

She died over 15 years ago. Yet, even as animals, including monkeys and dogs, continue to be cloned successfully, a human being is yet to be cloned in real life. A case in point is that of Sinogene, a Chinese biotech company, that cloned a gene-edited beagle May 2017, and announced this December that it had cloned ""Juice"" -- a one-foot tall stray mongrel.

While human cloning, which may or may not eventually happen, is bound to raise a lot of alarm bells given the moral implications surrounding the issue, the fact is that human genomes, or genes, are being routinely edited in a bid to find solutions for what are today considered to be incurable genetically inherited diseases.

There is, for instance, no cure for those who have to live with beta (ß)-hemoglobin or ß-thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia type of genetic blood-related disorders. These anomalies are caused in the human body by mutations in the gene-encoding hemoglobin-ß (HBB) -- a protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen from the lungs to all other parts of the human body.

While some patients with these blood-related disorders can been treated with stem cell transplants, either from the blood or bone marrow, finding the right donor is very difficult even as transplant-associated clinical complications pose a major hurdle. Hence, researchers the world over are now experimenting with a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR-Cas9 to address this issue.

CRISPR, which stands for ""Clusters of Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats"", is a tool that allows researchers to easily alter DNA sequences and modify gene function. The protein Cas9 (CRISPR-associated, or Cas) is an enzyme that acts like a pair of molecular scissors, capable of cutting strands of DNA.

CRISPR-Cas9 is primarily known for its use in treating diseases like AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease. Researchers are now looking to extend its use to tackle famine, lend a hand in creating antibiotics, and even wipe out an entire species such as malaria-spreading mosquitoes. As an example, Yinong Yang, a researcher at Penn State University, used CRISPR-Cas9 two years ago to edit a particular gene in a white button mushroom so that it does not brown easily.

By genetically engineering a person's bone marrow cells, researchers can reprogramme their immune and circulatory systems. Some new cancer treatments are based on this. Further, looking at the DNA of the collection of microbes in your gut can help with digestive disorders, weight loss, even help understand mood changes.

Closer home, scientists at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) and the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (CSIR-IICB) are trying to correct such mutations in their laboratories using CRISPR Cas9 with encouraging preliminary results. Although, due to regulatory and ethical concerns, it may take a while before they can use this on humans.

IGIB also sells CRISPR products such as Cas9 proteins and its variants to educational institutes at reduced prices in a bid to encourage use of the technology.

On 14 February 2017, the advisory group of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine decided to support research using technologies such as CRISPR to modify human embryos for prevention of serious diseases and disabilities. Yet, CRISPR Cas9 alarmed the world when MIT Technology Review reported on 25 November that a Shenzhen-based Chinese researcher, He Jiankui, claimed that he had created the world's first genetically-edited babies by altering their DNA using CRISPR. This was despite Jiankui's claim that the genes of the twins had been edited in the hope that the children would be resistant to HIV, smallpox and cholera since he had disabled a gene (CCR5) using CRISPR-Cas9. Critics raised a valid point that CRISPR, with its power to change genetic make-ups, raises a large number of ethical issues such as whether it should be used to produce designer babies or super humans. Besides, researchers say there is insufficient data to allow them to evaluate the risks and benefits of using this technology in humans.

Even Chinese vice minister of science and technology, Xu Nanping, termed Jiankui's work illegal in an interview with China state media, Associated Press reported on 29 November. A day later, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry was updated to indicate that Jiankui's embryo editing trial has been withdrawn.

Scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, for instance, say CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can cause greater genetic damage in cells than was previously thought. These results create safety implications for gene therapies using CRISPR-Cas9 in the future as the unexpected damage could lead to dangerous changes in some cells, they said in a 16 July article published in the journal Nature Biotechnology.

On 30 October, researchers from Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin said they found widespread immunity to the Cas9 protein by studying immune responses to CRISPR-Cas9 in humans.

According to Pranav Alam, founder and CEO of a Mumbai-based DNA testing company, Genebox, ""The use of CRISPR to create genetically-modified babies is an absolutely reckless and insensitive greed for recognition. There should be more regulation and governance of these labs. The use of CRISPR should be regulated."" Alam is also a member of the biotech committee of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

In a 30 November report in Mint, senior scientist Debojyoti Chakroborty from CSIR-Institute at IGIB, cautioned that ""...creating a child with specific traits or deciding how the next generation will be could open the technology for potential misuse by those who have the tools, funds and necessary resources"".

Yet, reasonably-priced DIY-CRISPR-kits continue to sell online, fuelling the belief that anyone can hack a genome.

A case in point is that of Josiah Zayner who created quite a stir at a biotech conference, SynBioBeta 2017, in San Francisco last October when he injected his left forearm with CRISPR in a bid to grow bigger muscles. Zayner, founder and CEO of The ODIN, performed a full-body microbiome (genes of all our microbes) transplant on himself in February 2016, and successfully changed the bacteria in his gut. The ODIN is a company that says its goal is to make ""consumer synthetic biology products"".

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on its part, considers any use of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in humans to be gene therapy, and rules that the sale of DIY kits to produce gene therapies for self-administration as illegal. India, too, banned the use of stem cell therapy for commercial use last year following concerns over ""rampant malpractice"". However, the national guidelines do exempt the use of such therapy to treat certain forms of blood cancers, malignant lymphomas and tumours including sickle cell disease and thalassemia major.

According to the US National Library of Medicine (NLM), scientists are still working to determine whether genome editing is safe and effective for use in people even as it holds out promise for the treatment and prevention of complex diseases such as blood cancer, thalassemia major, sickle cell and heart disease, mental illness, and HIV infection.

Ethical concerns, according to NLM, arise when genome editing using technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 used to alter human genomes. ""Most of the changes introduced with genome editing are limited to somatic cells, which are cells other than egg and sperm cells. These changes affect only certain tissues and are not passed from one generation to the next. However, changes made to genes in egg or sperm cells (germline cells) or in the genes of an embryo could be passed to future generations,"" NLM cautions on its website.

Further, according to critics, the use of CRISPR-Cas9 hinders natural selection and evolution and gives an unfair advantage to people who are able to have access to it, thus increasing the gap in opportunities between the rich and the poor since it could be used to create designer babies with desirable physical traits and talents.

Thus, CRISPR-Cas9 is a work in progress and countries should have policies to govern its use. Simply rejecting it because of fear of misuse is akin to throwing the baby out with the bath water."

These findings illustrate how the opioid epidemic continues to evolve and harm children even as efforts to confront the crisis through treatment and limits on opioid prescribing ramp up, they said.

The study was published in JAMA Network Open.

While the high opioid overdose death rate among adults has been widely reported, it is unclear how many children die each year from prescribed and illegal opioids. To quantify the impact on young people, Yale researchers collected and analyzed mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention covering the years 1999 through 2016.

Over the 18-year period, the research team found that nearly 9,000 children died from poisonings from either prescription or illicit opioids. While a prior estimate of pediatric opioid deaths that focused only on hospitalizations put the annual death toll at approximately 30 deaths per year, the current study, which includes deaths in all settings, shows that the yearly total is closer to 500, the researchers noted. Nearly 40% of children died at home.

""While there was a decline in the death rates in 2008 and 2009 that corresponded with a decrease in prescribing trends, the rates are going up again,"" said lead author Julie Gaither. ""It's due to a rise in heroin and synthetic opioid use among teens.""

The children most at risk are older teens, who represent 88% of those who died from opioids during the period studied. But the research team found that even very young -- children under age 5 -- were not spared. About one-quarter of those deaths were due to homicides, the researchers reported, noting that further research is needed to understand what roles abuse, neglect, and parental substance abuse -- including opioid abuse -- play in these deaths.

The study also highlights how other subgroups of children are increasingly harmed by the opioid crisis. ""This is still a problem that affects whites and males mostly, but that is changing. Death rates among females, blacks, and Hispanics are rising rapidly,"" Gaither noted.

The findings show that despite efforts to contain the crisis among adults, not enough has been done to address the impact of opioids on children and families. For example, childproof packaging for prescription opioids used for addiction treatment, such as Suboxone, could go a long way toward protecting children, said Gaither. Methadone, a drug used to help adult opioid users reduce cravings, is also implicated in a disproportionate number of pediatric opioid deaths, she notes.

""As the United States is working more aggressively to treat opioid addiction, we need to consider how children and adolescents are affected by that,"" she said. ""We need to start looking at communities and families as a whole and how everything is interrelated.""

The case is related to the alleged large scale corruption and misappropriating of Rs 2.07 crore of government funds during acquisition of land for the BRBCL plant at Nabinagar in Aurangabad district.

Communal flare-up in 7 Bihar districts

Clashes broke out between two religious groups in Bihar's Munger as communal tension, triggered by violence during a procession in Bhagalpur on March 17, spread to seven districts, prompting authorities to deploy additional policemen and paramilitary troopers. More than 100 people, including policemen, were injured in the violence. Many shops and business establishments were also set on fire. More than 200 people were arrested and sent to judicial custody.

SVU search at Muzaffarpur SSP premises

Special vigilance unit (SVU) sleuths on April 16 simultaneous searched various properties of Muzaffarpur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vivek Kumar, a 2007 batch IPS officer, on charges of accumulating assets disproportionate to his known sources of income. This was the first major crackdown on a SP-rank officer this year. During the searches, SVU sleuths recovered cash and valuables worth over Rs 3.5 crore from five separate lockers. They also seized demonetized currency with a face value of Rs 40,000 from his official residence in Muzaffarpur. The SVU had on January 4 searched the house and accommodation of IAS officer Deepak Anand.

Sexual abuse at Muzaffarpur shelter home (May 31)

The Muzaffarpur police lodged an FIR against 11 people on May 31 in connection with alleged sexual exploitation of 44 girls at a government-aided shelter home at Muzaffarpur. They included prime accused Brajesh Thakur, promoter of an NGO that operated the shelter home. The FIR was lodged on the basis of a report by Koshish, a research team of Tata Institutes of Social Sciences (TISS). Officials admit that the malaise might be deeper and could involve even white-collar people. The TISS report clearly stated that ""there were few girls carrying pregnancy or having babies in the remand home"" and it required some special provisions for them. The girls were shifted to other homes in the state.

FIR against ex-minister, her husband

The Begusarai police on August 18 lodged an FIR against former JD (U) minister Manju Verma and her husband Chandeshwar Verma, after prohibited bore ammunition was recovered from their house. The CBI, probing the Muzaffarpur shelter home case, had earlier conducted massive raids at several places in Patna, Muzaffarpur, Begusarai, and East Champaran districts. During search, the CBI recovered 50 live cartridges from Verma's house. Manju Verma, an MLA from Cheria-Bariarpur constituency in Begusarai, resigned as a minister on August 8 after her husband was accused of having links with the shelter home case.

The shortlisted agencies would become 'Monument Mitras' through the innovative concept of 'Vision Bidding', which will give them the opportunity to associate their CSR activities with a heritage site if the Vision Bid is selected.

What is it? The 'Adopt a Heritage Scheme' of Ministry of Tourism was launched on World Tourism Day i.e. 27th September, 2017. This project is a key initiative of Ministry of Tourism in close collaboration with Ministry of Culture and Archeological Survey of India (ASI), to develop the heritage sites / monuments and making them tourist-friendly to enhance the tourism potential and their cultural importance in a planned and phased manner.

How it works? The project plans to entrust heritage sites/monuments and other tourist sites to private sector companies, public sector companies and individuals for the development of tourist amenities. The project aims to develop synergy among all partners.

Monument Mitras: Successful bidders selected for adopting heritage sites / monuments by the Oversight and Vision Committee shall be called as Monument Mitras. The basic and advanced amenities of the tourist destinations would be provided by them. They would also look after the operations and the maintenance of the amenities. The 'Monument Mitras' would associate pride with their CSR activities.

Adopt a Heritage project is meant to address the challenges that the Archaeological Survey of India and other government bodies are facing in operating tourism infrastructure at heritage sites. By allowing private players to build, operate and maintain ""tourist-friendly"" and ""world class amenities at these sites, the expectation is that the project will boost domestic and international tourism.

The Bill makes instant triple talaq void and illegal. It seeks to make the practice of instant triple talaq a punishable offence with imprisonment of up to three years.

The case dates back to 2016 when the Supreme Court had sought assistance from the then Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi on pleas challenging the constitutional validity of ""triple talaq"", ""nikah halala"" and ""polygamy"", to assess whether Muslim women face gender discrimination in cases of divorce.

Opposing the practice of triple talaq, the Centre told the top court that there is a need to re-look at these practices on grounds of gender equality and secularism.

The Supreme Court later announced the setting up of a five-judge constitutional bench to hear and deliberate on the challenges against the practice of 'triple talaq, nikah halala' and polygamy.

The issue gained political momentum on March 2017 when the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) told the Supreme Court that the issue of triple talaq falls outside the judiciary's realm and that these issues should not be touched by the court.

However, on August 22 this year, the Supreme Court set aside the decade-old practice of instant triple talaq saying it was violative of Article 14 and 21 of the Indian Constitution.

In September, the government had proposed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill in the Parliament and sought to make triple talaq a punishable offence under the law.

At first, the Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha but it failed to secure a majority in the Rajya Sabha. The Bill was postponed till the winter session of Parliament. Following this, an ordinance was issued by the government after the bill failed to get cleared in Rajya Sabha amid protests by the Opposition.

The Bill makes all declaration of talaq, including in written or electronic form, to be void (i.e. not enforceable in law) and illegal.

Definition: It defines talaq as talaq-e-biddat or any other similar form of talaq pronounced by a Muslim man resulting in instant and irrevocable divorce. Talaq-e-biddat refers to the practice under Muslim personal laws where pronouncement of the word 'talaq' thrice in one sitting by a Muslim man to his wife results in an instant and irrevocable divorce.

Offence and penalty: The Bill makes declaration of talaq a cognizable offence, attracting up to three years' imprisonment with a fine. (A cognizable offence is one for which a police officer may arrest an accused person without warrant.) The offence will be cognizable only if information relating to the offence is given by: (i) the married woman (against whom talaq has been declared), or (ii) any person related to her by blood or marriage.

The Bill provides that the Magistrate may grant bail to the accused. The bail may be granted only after hearing the woman (against whom talaq has been pronounced), and if the Magistrate is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for granting bail.

The offence may be compounded by the Magistrate upon the request of the woman (against whom talaq has been declared). Compounding refers to the procedure where the two sides agree to stop legal proceedings, and settle the dispute. The terms and conditions of the compounding of the offence will be determined by the Magistrate.

Allowance: A Muslim woman against whom talaq has been declared, is entitled to seek subsistence allowance from her husband for herself and for her dependent children. The amount of the allowance will be determined by the Magistrate.

Custody: A Muslim woman against whom such talaq has been declared, is entitled to seek custody of her minor children. The manner of custody will be determined by the Magistrate.

Time has come to put an end to the suffering of Muslim women who have been at the receiving end of instant talaq for several years. More than 20 Islamic countries have already banned the practice.

Mains Question: The triple talaq Bill is a classic example of executive-legislative-judicial collaboration towards ensuring social justice. Critically comment.

Context: The Centre has given an extension of six months to complete the ongoing exercise for updating the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam by June 30.

On December 6, 2013, the government issued the first notification setting a deadline of three years for completion of the entire NRC process. Since then, five extensions have been given by the government. The draft NRC was published on July 30 and included the names of 2.9 crore people of the total 3.29 crore applicants.

Officially, the NRC process will address the issue of illegal migrants, specifically from Bangladesh. The National Register of Citizens was first published in 1951 to record citizens, their houses and holdings. Updating the NRC to root out foreigners was a demand during the Assam Agitation (1979-1985).

There have been several waves of migration to Assam from Bangladesh, but the biggest was in March 1971 when the Pakistan army crackdown forced many to flee to India. The Assam Accord of 1985 that ended the six-year anti-foreigners' agitation decided upon the midnight of March 24, 1971 as the cut-off date.

The Citizenship Act of 1955 was amended after the Assam Accord for all Indian-origin people who came from Bangladesh before January 1, 1966 to be deemed as citizens. Those who came between January 1, 1966 and March 25, 1971 were eligible for citizenship after registering and living in the State for 10 years while those entering after March 25, 1971, were to be deported.

Mains Question: Throw light on the nature of migration in Assam. Examine whether the National Register of Citizens will address the issues arising thereunder?

Context: 26th National Children's Science Congress (NCSC) is being held in Odisha.

Theme: ""Science, Technology and Innovation for a Clean, Green and Healthy Nation.""

National Children's Science Congress (NCSC) is a nationwide Science Communication programme started in the year 1993. It is a programme of National Council for Science and Technology Communication (NCSTC), Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi.

It is a forum children of the age-group of 10-17 years, both from formal school system as well as from out of school, to exhibit their creativity and innovativeness and more particularly their ability to solve a societal problem experienced locally using by method of science.

About National Council for Science and Technology Communication (NCSTC):

National Investment & Manufacturing Zones (NIMZs) are one of the important instruments of National Manufacturing Policy, 2011.

NIMZs are envisaged as large areas of developed land with the requisite eco-system for promoting world class manufacturing activity.

To promote exports, while NIMZs are based on the principle of industrial growth in partnership with States and focuses on manufacturing growth and employment generation.

NIMZs are different from SEZs in terms of size, level of infrastructure planning, governance structures related to regulatory procedures, and exit policies.

For the Financial Year 2016 - 2017, Rs. 3.35 crores has been earmarked under the 'Scheme for Implementation of National Manufacturing Policy' for 'Master Planning of NIMZs' and Technology Acquisition and Development Fund (TADF).

Guidelines issued to ensure transparency in Selection of Sportspersons

The development and promotion of various disciplines of sports including selection of players for various national and international sports competitions is the responsibility of the concerned National Sports Federations (NSFs).

The NSFs work in an autonomous environment and the Government is not directly involved in their functioning, including selection of sports persons.

To ensure transparency in selection process Government has issued guidelines according to which selection of sportspersons for major international events is to be done by a Selection Committee.

Implementing Various Sports Promotional Schemes:

Under the Scheme of Assistance to National Sports Federations, the Government supports the identified sportspersons, including those from weaker sections of society/teams for intensive coaching through national coaching camps, foreign exposures/competitions etc.

Under Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), customized training is being provided to identify sportspersons at the state-of-the-art sports institutes/academies within the country and abroad.

Fifteen cronies who have known each other since school have bunched-up for a party at a beach house off the ECR road, Bala their favourite Psychonaut host, plucks at a bag of heroin, and sets forth, to cut it into lines at the table. He snorts a line of heroin and another of MDMA.

Other cronies string along with the ritual, take turns to snort and sniff the lines, getting their minds blown away to ecstatic existential realms. Simultaneously, joints get lit and passed around, while the red wine which is being sipped .moistens the throats parched by the weed.

In a jiffy, they are all as high as kites feeling floaty and nice. Life seems so freaking amazing that nothing seems to matter. They twirl around in the room, hold hands, sense unperceived compassion for another, laugh, marvel and feel goddamn lucky to be such wonderful friends.

Ten hours later, zonked out and exhausted from dancing, little by little the declining high seems to gradually give way to a grotesque melancholy - an inevitable crash stares at them, they can clearly sense the comedown, an achy, twitching sadness. Nothing now seems more urgent in this world than to claw one's way back to regain that familiar euphoric high and to clasp and cling to it like an obsessed lover.

Bala reaches out for his homebrew fermenter where the yeast cells cloned with the opium genes have been busy since several hours converting the sugar in the culture to morphine. Much of the morphine so produced has undergone acetylation to heroin, and the fermenter at the press of a button is ready to belch out the home-brewed heroin. Bala presses the button, the ritual gets repeated, the dragon gets chased all over again.

The scenario painted in the preceding stanza is not a figment of my imagination, John Dueber and his colleagues at University of California in Berkeley in 2015 succeeded in producing a genetically modified yeast which can feed on glucose and produce morphine from which heroin can be derived.

Their findings, published in Nature Chemical Biology, has opened the doors for yeast-derived ""home-brewed"" cheap and easy illegal drugs. The concept of using microscopic organisms to make drugs is not new. Insulin for people with diabetes and several pharma drugs and chemicals are under production through genetically modified E.coli and other microbe cells for decades now.

Like Bala, it would, therefore, be possible to produce coke or heroin on demand in our kitchen or garage. With synthetic biology we wouldn't need crops to grow drugs, we would be able to produce them in the labs or our homes.

There are now several commercial companies that provide DNA synthesis services, so the process can be easily outsourced: a customer can place an order for a DNA sequence on the net and synthesise a complete microorganism - using only published DNA sequence information and mail-ordered nucleotides.

Once we have the DNA sequence of a gene or group of genes for a particular drug, we will be able to synthesise the gene and clone it into microbes such as yeast, E.coli, etc. The bacteria with the cloned genes would express cocaine, heroin, morphine, pot, LSD etc.

As the cost of synthesising DNA has drastically declined over the last 20 years and is now around $US0.3 per base pair, it's now well within reach of each and everyone.

There are several advantages for drug lords to produce drugs from genetically modified microbes. Firstly, there won't be any need for cultivating thousands of acres of land to grow cocaine, LSD or pot. There would be no fear of being detected by surveillance aircraft, no fear of drug-sniffing dogs or destruction of the crop by drug enforcement agencies.

There also won't be any need to smuggle coke or heroin across borders. Lastly, the traditional methods are unreliable as well as time-consuming, as the plants can be damaged by bad weather, pests and disease.

Yeast or bacteria, on the other hand, are advantageous too as they are easy to conceal, grow and transport. Law-enforcement agencies would find it massively difficult to control the distribution and spread of an opiate-producing yeast strain. Albeit, the only drawback is that its productiveness would need to be increased a few hundred times before it becomes a popular way.

It is now technically feasible for anyone to concoct illegal drugs from the comfort of one's home with a little access to yeast cells and some knowledge of fermentation. All said and done, decentralised and localised production would almost certainly reduce the cost and increase the availability of illegal opiates - substantially worsening a worldwide problem. Globally, more than 16 million people use opiates illegally.

Analogously, in 2015, research workers at the Technical University of Dortmund released a study detailing their successes in genetically modifying a yeast cell to crank out the main active compound in ganja (Cannabis) called THC, which has been a fantasy of stoners for more than a decade.

Cannabinoids like THC are utilised in pain remedy, but present-day methods of cultivating marijuana and extracting the active compounds not only cost a pretty penny but is also toilsome rendering minuscule yields. Studies are in the pipeline at other institutes to see how fast-growing Streptomyces bacteria strains can be exploited for producing cannabinoids, insinuating a potential new method of generating the compound without cultivating marijuana.

Similarly, by deploying synthetic biology researchers at Stanford are making genetically altered yeast to scoop out a non-narcotic cough suppressant known as noscapine, which is sourced naturally from opium poppies.

Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), also known as acid, is a hallucinatory drug. LSD was first made by Albert Hofmann in 1938 from lysergic acid, from a fungus called ergot. The ergot fungi called Claviceps purpurea produces fruiting bodies which are the source of the lysergic acid.

The contemporary industrial method of lysergic acid production, in which decaying matter fuels fermentations of Claviceps is cumbersome with extremely low yields. Pharma firms, as a result, are unable to produce over and above 40,000 pounds of it every year.

But today we can pin our faith on efficient production after Matuschek et al in 2010 triumphed using an E.coli-cloned Claviceps enzyme and enzyme-free glutathione to convert the intermediate into agroclavine in vitro. Similarly, Edwin Wintermute and Pam Silver at Harvard's Department of Systems Biology are on the point of sneaking that crucial segment of Claviceps genome into baker's yeast to get it to produce LSD.

One of the greatest success stories of synthetic biology has been the synthesis of artemisinin an antimalarial drug. It was discovered in 1972 by Youyou Tu, a Chinese scientist, who was awarded half of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Medicine for her finding. Artemisinin isolated from the plant Artemisia annua, or sweet wormwood, is a herb employed in Chinese conventional medicine.

Its production was scanty and erratic owing to the whimsicalities of growing sweet wormwood. Its mass production became a possibility mainly due to the efforts of Jay Keasling and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, who transferred the artemisinin genes into a yeast cell. Prior to this, artemisinin production was tortoise-like because it took about a year for the crop of sweet wormwood to grow.

For instance, if a contractor in Africa placed an order for it took about 18 months to get the drug."" An engineered strain of yeast can now produce the drug on demand and is ""head and shoulders above the plant"" at making it, says Jack Newman, co-founder and senior adviser at Amyris, a microbial engineering company.

In order to prevent misuse of drug producing bacterial strains, developing and implementing a flexible and proportionate regulatory approach is a major challenge which will have to be addressed in our country. Laws would have to be enacted to make possession, release and distribution of drug-producing bacterial strains illegal. Efforts would also have to be taken to keep drug-producing bacterial strains in controlled environments that are licensed by regulators and make it a mandatory requirement for all such strains to contain a marker, such as a DNA watermark, that would make them identifiable to law-enforcement agencies.

At long last, I believe, that attraction of man to drugs is mostly spiritual. It stems from man's dissatisfaction with his mundane existence. The worldly existence of man is full of sorrow and suffering. There is no ecstasy, there is no real joy. It's man's search for meaning and spiritual bliss which sometimes leads him to drugs and hallucinogens.

Man does not know that the aching void inside of him is because of spiritual emptiness. What he is actually searching for is a deep spiritual connection, not drugs. He is unaware that the connection he is yearning for is possible from prayer, meditation and other spiritual practices.

It's not possible to explain meditation to such a person through words, it has to be experienced, but drugs to a certain extent help a person get a hallucinatory experience of meditation. Drugs are also capable of helping a person gain insight into themselves, their lives, and the nature of the universe, which may eventually help a person, know the taste and feel of spiritual life.

But, in the end, it's only meditation that can give one the real experience, the experience one gets from the drug is just a hallucination, a dream-like sensation which is very similar. Last, of all, meditation is hard and requires consistent and committed practice, but drugs, on the other hand, are easy but they promise only a fleeting taste of instant transient sensory cum spiritual gratification, not the actual unalloyed eternal bliss of spiritual life which meditation offers."

Using derogatory language reflects poorly on the person and the party he or she represents,"" the three-time former Chief Minister said.

He said that using slanderous language shows that a person was frustrated. Gogoi asked whether Sonowal knew he was insulting a party that had produced great leaders and freedom fighters for whose contribution Indian got independence.

Gogoi said the earlier Congress governments at the Centre and in Assam undertook most of the big projects - be it oil refineries, gas cracker projects, bridges on the Brahmaputra, and higher educational institutes.

He said that yesterday while giving a reply in the Rajya Sabha, Union Minister of State for Railways Rajen Gohain acknowledged that the survey work for the Bogibeel Bridge was initiated during the time of Indira Gandhi in 1984.

Gogoi said that the foundation stone of the bridge was also laid by then Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, who led a Congress-supported government, in 1997. A foundation ston was again laid by then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2002.

The Congress leader said Sonowal and his BJP-led government have actually deceived the people by not taking a stand against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016.

Gogoi took a swipe at Sonowal by saying the leader who had espoused regionalism, took a stand against illegal foreign migrants and started his political career in a regional party, has now forgotten about the cause he once supported the most. He said the Sonowal government was only good at publicity stunts and making announcements.

Criticising the government's much-hyped zero tolerance policy against corruption, Gogoi said the BJP, which talks of large-scale corruption during Congress rule, now has Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma in the government, despite Dr Sarma being an integral part of the Congress party in the past.

Gogoi said the government has failed in undertaking developmental activities and in providing employment, and as an outcome, youths were getting attracted towards ULFA-I.

He also alleged that illegal sand and coal syndicates were operating across the state.

Gogoi did not spare the AGP either, and termed the recent public spats in the run-up to the panchayat polls as a ""drama"" which people could understand very well."

Archery Equipment Market Revenue to Shoot Through the Roof Owing to Rising Adoption Among Children and Women

Over the years, archery has become one of the most played sports and has also found place in several international gaming events such as the Olympics. Archery as a sport has been found to develop certain mental abilities in children, making this one of the favorite sports activities that children can engage in. This factor is expected to boost the demand for various types of archery equipment, thereby increasing sales revenue in the archery equipment market. The last few years have witnessed a steadily increasing participation of women in the sport of archery. Women are taking part in large numbers in international archery competitions, thereby leading to a surge in demand and adoption of archery equipment.

The governments of several countries are encouraging archery as a sport and are implementing programs that help increase public participation in archery. This is further augmenting the demand for archery equipment, hence leading to a surge in revenue in the archery equipment market. Owing to the increasing popularity of archery across certain states in the U.S, schools are considering including archery as an integral part of school sports. This will boost the demand for archery equipment such as bows, arrows, targets, and related accessories and support equipment.

Archery Equipment Market Revenue Growth Inhibited by the Emergence of Counterfeit Products

With archery fast becoming a mainstream sport across the world, competition in the archery equipment market is intensifying by the day. To meet the steadily growing demand for archery equipment across various geographies, companies operating in the archery equipment market are introducing locally manufactured products at multiple price ranges to attract more number of customers. Some of the market players are even copying branded products to boost their sales and market share. Further, several 'direct from the factory' deals are being offered to lure customers, and these deals are mostly on counterfeit archery equipment. This kind of archery equipment is made from low quality raw materials that makes it possible to optimize the price points of such archery equipment. Proliferation of counterfeit archery equipment in the regional markets is anticipated to hamper revenue growth of the archery equipment market in the near future.

Moreover, hunting is deemed an illegal activity in several parts of the world. This is decreasing the participation of people in hunting activities for fear of violating the relevant international laws. This is bound to reduce the demand for archery equipment, thereby impacting growth in revenue of the archery equipment market in the long run.

Immense Opportunities Exist for Manufacturers in the Archery Equipment Market; Mass Merchants and Box Stores Primarily Responsible in Creating Lucrative Growth Prospects

Distributors and dealers in the archery equipment market consider box stores and mass merchants as direct competition. However, these are lucrative sales channels in the market for archery equipment and have the potential to introduce different varieties of archery equipment in the international market. Mass merchants and box stores will continue to remain leading channels for sales of archery equipment and provide lucrative growth opportunities for both established manufacturers as well as new entrants in the archery equipment market.

Media has a major role to play in inducing public participation in archery as a recreational hobby and fitness sport. Several movies and television shows showcasing archery as a great sport are motivating people to take up training in archery, thereby increasing memberships in archery training clubs and institutes across the world. This has directly impacted growth in demand for archery equipment and consumer demand is anticipated to go Northward in the coming years.

Archery Equipment Market Witnessing Significant Growth in Developed Regional Markets

Archery is one of the most common sports activities in Europe and governments in the EU have established several institutional bodies to encourage increasing public participation in the sport. This has led to a rise in the sales of archery equipment across countries in Europe. In North America, the governments in U.S and Canada are conducting several archery programs for children in schools, thereby promoting the sport throughout the continent. This is expected to lead to a rise in the demand for archery equipment across North America.
