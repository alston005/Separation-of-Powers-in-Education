Meanwhile, the state education department is getting a good response from parents and schools in Zilla Parishad and other taluka-level in the state.

Some of the highlights of SMC in rural schools include, 'A day at school', where parents along with grandparents and siblings spend the entire day at school with teachers, headmistress and the student.

There is also the 'Personalised mid-day meal', which is created by teachers and parents together as per the ingredients schools receive for the mid-day meal every month.

""By mixing, matching and twisting the ingredients, a new dish is created once or twice a week to charge the students,"" a teacher from the Nashik district school said.

Despite experts from the National Institute of Technology-Calicut (NIT-C) expressing willingness to conduct a technical study on the colonial era building on the premises of St. Joseph's Anglo-Indian Girls Higher Secondary School, the management continues to maintain its opposition to the Culture Department's bid to declare it as a protected monument.

According to sources, the proposal for the study was put forward during the course of informal talks between representatives of the management, a group of old students who are batting for the protection of the building, and heritage enthusiasts.

The effort was to find out the feasibility of retaining the building and examine the architectural parameters involved. However, the management is learnt to have backtracked on the proposal.

Meanwhile, historian M.G.S. Narayanan has written to V. Venu, Secretary, Department of Culture, pointing out the need to conserve the few heritage structures remaining in Kozhikode town. Mr. Narayanan said that though Kozhikode could boast a rich heritage, its symbols such as the Hajoor Kacheri, had been demolished.

""It is painful to know that there is a plan to demolish the historically important building connected to Mother Veronica. A native of France, she has a unique place in the history of Kozhikode as the one who set up the first school for girls in Malabar in the 19th century, when education was a dream for the female population,"" he said in the letter.

The century-old structure reflecting the grandeur of colonial architecture has a pride of place in Kozhikode. ""At a time when modern technology is being used to conserve such buildings, efforts to bring it down in the name of security are condemnable,"" Mr. Narayanan said.

Congratulating the Culture Department for proposing to declare it as a protected monument, the historian said that the demolition of the building would be a blot on the image of the Apostolic Carmel, who have rendered yeomen service to society for over a century.

Sources close to the management told The Hindu on Monday that at a time when many age-old government schools were being demolished to make way for new buildings with advanced facilities, there was no point in retaining the structure there.

The management was not taken into confidence before the Culture Department issued the gazette notification proposing to declare the building as a protected monument.

The regional town planner had submitted a report ruling out the antiquity of the building and it was not 100 years old too.

""We have filed an appeal against the Culture Department's gazette notification. The date of the hearing is yet to be intimated,"" Varun Bhaskar, PTA president, said."

The decision, taken by the university's executive council, comes amid a renaming spree where the Centre and several state governments have decided to dedicate projects to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stalwart.

While the Uttar Pradesh government, led by Yogi Adityanath, has decided to name the proposed Bundelkhand Expressway as 'Atal Path', Chhattisgarh's upcoming capital Naya Raipur will be known as Atal Nagar.

A 'ghat' on the Sabarmati River in Gujarat, the AIIMS Rishikesh auditorium and the cyber tower in Mauritius, which was set up with Vajpayee's help, will also be named after him.

Apart from these, several states have requested the Centre to allow them to rename landmarks after Vajpayee. These include proposals from Andhra Pradesh to name AIIMS Mangalagiri after the former PM, one from Himachal Pradesh to rename the Rohtang Tunnel, another from Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to change the name of the Habibganj railway station and a personal request from an Assam BJP legislator to call the Bogibeel Bridge on Brahmaputra river 'Atal Setu'.

The former prime minister's ashes were also immersed in rivers across the country, from the Gomti in Lucknow to Imphal river in Manipur, with several BJP leaders leading the processions in the states.

While the governments are of the opinion that renaming institutions, roads and welfare schemes after Vajpayee would be a fitting tribute to a man considered an astute politician and a master negotiator, not everyone is happy with the developments.

Almost a week after the former prime minister's death, his niece Karuna Shukla on Thursday raked up a controversy by alleging that the BJP was politicising Vajpayee's demise for electoral gains in the 2019 polls.

""The BJP is selfish and doing politics in the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Using his name, they are prepping for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls,"" Shukla said in an interview to News18.

She alleged that the saffron party profited from Vajpayee's name during his lifetime and was using his name after his death for political gains. ""The BJP is not at all ashamed over politicising his death,"" said Shukla, a former Lok Sabha MP who was denied a ticket by the BJP in 2014 and later resigned from the party.

The Congress, too, accused the BJP of trying to gain political mileage out of Vajpayee's death. ""The last rites are performed by family members for peace of the departed soul,"" the party tweeted. ""PM Modi and the BJP have usurped the last remains of Former PM Vajpayee and are using it for petty political gains. BJP leaders discover new lows everyday,"" Congress said on its official Twitter handle.

Vajpayee, one of India's tallest leaders and the first non-Congress Prime Minister to complete a full term in power by leading a tenuous coalition with his inclusive politics and superlative oratory, died on August 16 after a prolonged illness. He was 93."

In one months' time, 550 Supari Tank Municipal School students helped in collecting 4,500 cartons. The NGO RUR Greenlife helped the school convert the waste into desk and chairs. Explaining the process of converting cartons into useful commodities, the founder of RUR Greenlife, Monisha Narke said,

We launched this initiative in 2010, over these few years, we have set up 44 cartons collection centres within the city, stores like Sahakari Bhandar, Reliance Smart and Fresh are included in this initiative.

Monisha Narke further adds,

Through this initiative, we want to make people understand one simple motive - 'waste should not be treated as waste'. We wanted to educate people on the importance of recycling in a creative way so that they take the process ahead.

Till date, the organisation has recycled 26 lakh cartons and has saved around 5 lakh kilograms of waste from going into the landfills. Moreover, today more than 250 school and 100 gardens have been covered with recycled desks, chairs and benches in the city, proving and spreading the message that trash has value."

Not only did I graduate with a first-hand understanding of how businesses operate in different parts of the world, the cultural immersion I underwent in each of the three cities went a long way in shaping my interviews at Google. For instance, my final interviewer was based in Sydney and I was able to connect with him instantly. We spent the first 15 minutes of my interview bonding over our Sydney experiences and discussing how progressive the city is when compared to the rest of the world.

A committee, led by the additional district magistrate and comprising of chief medical officer, district inspector of schools, chief fire officer and additional regional transport officer of Gautam Budh Nagar, will probe whether the private school had flouted the safety norms issued by the Central Board Of Secondary Education (CBSE).

The committee will submit its report within 15 days, after which the district administration will initiate action based on the findings.

The probe will include inspection of school buses, fire safety system, background check of staff, food quality and hygiene.

""After reading various media reports claiming alleged rape of a girl student in a private school, we have set up a committee to probe whether the school management had all security measures in place and followed the security guidelines issued by the affiliating board.

The incident took place on Thursday morning when the child, who is enrolled in nursery, complained of acute pain in her abdomen and private parts after returning home after swimming classes in school. When her parents took her to a hospital in Delhi, a medico legal test showed that the child had suffered injuries in her private part. The parents took the child to school on Friday and asked her to identify the man who had hurt her. The child pointed at Chandi Das, a 42-year-old life guard at the school, after which he was arrested at his residence in Greater Noida on Saturday. The accused has denied charges.

The school's management refused to answer any queries regarding the district administration's decision to set up a probe against it on Sunday despite repeated calls and messages.

Earlier on Saturday, the school management issued a statement in defence of the life guard, stating that the CCTV footage does not show anything conclusive to suggest rape, and that the child ""was in good health"".

On Sunday, police said that the CCTV footage provided by the school management shows the child swimming in the pool in the presence of the life guard. Then the video shows kids lining up after the class and heading towards the washroom through the corridor. ""There was no CCTV in the corridor or near the washroom, making them the grey areas.

In order to improve the overall standard of education and functioning of the 31 ashramshalas (residential schools for tribals), the Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP), Ghodegaon, has introduced a special programme to strengthen the School Management Committees (SMCs).

We have allocated Rs 5 lakh per SMC, apart from a corpus of nearly Rs 3 crore at ITDP, which schools can use, if there is a shortage of funds,"" he added.

The SMCs have been asked to prepare a development plan to use the unspent corpus, and make fresh demands. Only work that benefits students will be taken up, said Prasad.

""The purchases will be effected by September and new constructions, if any, will be undertaken between October and December,"" he added.

In order to ensure that SMC meetings are held regularly, it has been suggested that committees in each school conduct a meeting on the 25th of every month.

Also, a calendar listing nearly 200 progarmmes has been drawn up to help students express themselves beyond academics.

Prasad said this would be the first time such a capacity-building exercise was taken up at government schools."

Further, family-managed businesses employ half the world's workforce and generate well over half of the world's GDP. With time, the contribution of family businesses has gone beyond simply paying taxes and employing people. Most of the business families face unique management challenges because of the difference in the attitude and aspiration of family members. As new generations join the business, it is an enormous challenge to keep the family and business together. And the key to this is, Pravin Dalal School for Entrepreneurship and Family Business Management.""

IÃSEG School of Management, France, is a prestigious institution which impart quality education in management, specifically, in international business. IÃSEG has triple accreditation from EQUIS, AMBA and AACSB, and has two campuses: one at Lille and another in Paris.

I was at the Lille campus, the oldest of the two, as part of the student exchange programme sponsored by my home university, Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, New Delhi, to pursue the third trimester of my MBA. I was also selected to the Grande Ãcole programme here. IÃSEG belongs to the ConfÃ©rence des Grandes Ãcoles (CGE), a French national institution, established in 1973. Conditions of entry to the CGE are strict, and the member institutions and the degrees they award are highly regarded by academia and the industry alike. It was a tremendous experience, where I got to meet budding professionals from universities in Australia, Canada Argentina, and Korea. There is also a huge community of Indian students from various institutes such as the IIMs, XLRI, SP Jain, NMIMS, and more, making it hard to feel homesick.

Pedagogic style

The skill imparting techniques used at the school were unique. There were several world-renowned faculty, including French diplomats and persons of eminence in public service, with proven ability in the field of management. The course content and syllabus were also different. Critical management problems are formed as subjects. Knowledge was imparted intensively through group work, presentation, debate and continuous assessment. Our deliberations involved many case studies from current problems happening in the world.

In between, there were also discussions about business challenges and opportunities in various countries. In this era of globalised business, the networking opportunities given to the students of this programme is a tremendous advantage. IÃSEG offers many courses in management for international students, in French and English. Knowledge in French is an advantage, but not a must. Non-French-speaking students have separate classes for French. IÃSEG offers various graduate, post-graduate and Ph.D. programmes.

In partnership with IÃSEG's Alumni Network, the school organises meetings throughout the year between its students and professionals from across business sectors. The campus recruitment team holds career fairs where students are offered internships (6 months), gap years (cÃ©sures), apprenticeship contracts, consulting projects or job offers from major brands.

Lille, the scenic city, is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region in northern France. A cultural hub and bustling university city today, it was once an important merchant centre of French Flanders, and many Flemish influences still remain. Being well connected with the Eurail system, the whole of Europe is truly just a train ride away. Exactly why students head out to neighbouring Belgium, Luxembourg or Amsterdam for weekend getaways!"

The probe report also said that at the time of the accident, the bus was travelling at a speed of 80km per hour, way above the limit, which means that the speed governor was not working.

The letter also recommended that a high level technical agency should be appointed to probe the fitness of the bus.

The bus, which was 14 years old, had received a fitness certificate for a year from the Indore RTO just a month ago. The probe had been ordered by the home minister and the DIG Indore had been directed to see that it was submitted within 24 hours."

They've unitedly decided to ignore rumours and give the school some time to take the precautionary measures .

""They are human beings and need time to implement the measures suggested by us. The assurance has come from the top authority in the school and we trust them,"" said a representative of the parents after meeting the school principal and other senior members on Saturday afternoon.

On Saturday, a group of parents reached the school around 10am and contrary to expectations of another round of protests, they agreed to hold talks with the school. The principal reciprocated by assuring them to make all amends to prevent a rerun of Friday's incident.

""Co-operate with us. We have a history of a long-standing relationship based on trust. There may have been some issues but we are doing our best to make the changes. Some of the parents today were students of this school,"" said the principal.

The representatives of the guardians urged other parents to send their children to school. ""Everything is normal. Please send your child to school on Monday. Do not believe rumours that school has been shut down. The parents have to take

the initiative to restore normalcy,"" said another guardian.

Many educationists termed it as a positive development and felt it will not only help the school and the parents to work in tandem to ensure kids' safety but also save the students from terrorising images of protesting parents and the police on a warpath.

""The parents and the school have displayed exemplary maturity in dealing with the situation on Saturday,"" said Marcus Fernandes, a former vice-principal.

""The statement by the principal suggests that the school authorities have accepted that there were some loopholes and they are willing to make amends. The response from the parents is an indicator of the fact that instead of indulging in a slugfest they want to co-operate with the school for the sake of their children. This should be an example for all parents and schools.""

Many parents also appeared worried by what was happening outside the school. Several organisations reached the school and tried to become a stakeholder in the protest. Many of them distributed pamphlets and put posters on the walls. ""We request all not to stick posters on the school's wall.

It Many organisations have been coming here to protest. They are within their rights to do so but please do not dirty the walls. Our daughters study here and we want a good atmosphere for them,"" said a parent. Another parent requested not to politicise the matter. Since Friday evening, several political parties and organisations have been agitating in front of the school and Tollygunge police station."

According to the FIR lodged by the victim's father, his daughter was slapped by her teacher Rajni Updhyaya for failing to answer a question on Tuesday. ""She fell unconscious after being hit by the teacher and we rushed her to the medical college in BHU,"" said the father, identified as Santosh.

A CT Scan was done and doctors told the girl's father that she had received a fatal head injury and that there was internal bleeding. The girl succumbed to her injuries on Wednesday.

The Superintendent of Police Ballia Anil Kumar said that an FIR has been registered at Rasra Police Station against the teacher and management of the missionary school on the complaint of the father. The erring teacher has been detained and action will be initiated against the school management after investigation, said the SP.

The school management, however, claimed that the student had a history of epilepsy and had collapsed on previous occasions. ""On Tuesday, she had a similar seizure and we immediately alerted the parents,"" a school member claimed.

Upadhyaya also denied hitting the girl. ""I did not touch her. She collapsed after her seizure. The police may verify this with other students in class,"" she said.

However, investigating officer Jagdish Yadav said that the victim was drawing in science class and when she did not stop despite being warned, was slapped.

""We have detained the teacher and are conducting an inquiry into the matter.

The boy was arrested after he allegedly pumped four bullets on the face and chest of Ritu Chhabra (46), principal of Swami Vivekananda Public School, with his father's licensed .32 bore revolver.

Police said he went to the school during a parent-teacher meeting (PTM) around 10.30am and forced his way into Chhabra's office to teach her a lesson as she used to punish him in front of his fellow students over his poor academic performance and low attendance.

Chhabra succumbed to bullet injuries at a private hospital.

The boy, who turned 18 on January 10, has been charged with murder. His father, a financier, is a resident of Yamunanagar town's Hamida locality.

Yamunanagar superintendent of police (SP) Rajesh Kalia said the boy was not good in his studies.

The police on Sunday produced the boy and his father in the district court. While the student was sent to two-day police remand, his father, who was booked under the Arms Act, was sent to two-day police custody.

The news of the boy killing his principal has left his friends and neighbours shocked.

""No doubt, he was a pampered son of a businessman, but he was affable and polite. There might be something that drove him to take this extreme step,"" said one of the family's neighbours.

""How could he murder his principal? It is unbelievable and shocking,"" said Ravi Kumar, a neighbour. ""He is a very good boy and always greeted his elders by touching their feet. He used to go to the temple everyday,"" said Vikram Pandit, another neighbour.

Kamal Kamboj, president of Swami Vivekanand Society that runs the school, said, ""There were some issues with this boy. First, he used to come on a Bullet (Royal Enfield) bike against school rules and he was scolded for this. Another was about his low attendance and also he never took his teachers and studies seriously.""

Kamboj said, ""Our staff said he never cared what the teachers would say. He was a pampered son of a rich man.""

A school staff member said, ""The principal had also warned him against bringing mobile phone to the school.""

School principal cremated

The body of school principal Ritu Chhabra was cremated by her family members on Sunday morning. Her husband Rajesh Chhabra said the incident has shaken his family, especially his sons. The family members said Ritu was teaching economics in the school for the past 17 years and was promoted as principal in June 2014.
