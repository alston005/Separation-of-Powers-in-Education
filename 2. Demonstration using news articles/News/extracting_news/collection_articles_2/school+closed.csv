The management has been found guilty of lying -- its claim that it has initially approached the police to inform about the rape of the UKg students, education department officials have not found any documentary evidence to support this claim. This is in addition to other violations cited under GOMs 1 like failure to secure campus and the entry and exit points, running school sans proper affiliation, among others

As reported in Express second notice was issued to the school management two days after it received the reply from the correspondence. The school has to send its reply within seven days giving reasons as to why the Education Department should not hold it liable for lapses and shut the school.

Despite, the alacrity with which the DEO office has handled the enquiry in the issues, a report has not been submitted to the commissioner and director of school education. Speaking to Express T Vijaya Kumar, commissioner, CDSE, said that he is still awaiting a report on the issue from the DEO. "" Once we get the report action will be taken as per the existing Acts,"" he said.

Meanwhile, an official in DEO office said that that on account of the weekend, some development in the issue can be expected on Monday. ""We will send text messages to all parents asking them to meet and raise any complaints that they might have against the school. The report will be submitted to the CDSE after this activity is done,"" the officer said."

A teacher, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed that the school was closed only due to the local temple festival, but enquiries revealed that the temple festival was held on Wednesday and the Headmaster (in-charge) secured local holiday on Thursday to enable teachers to attend the wedding of the son of the Headmistress, who was on medical leave.

After Headmaster (in-charge) Karthikeyan sought local holiday, citing temple festival and enclosing resolutions adopted at School Management Committee and Parent- Teacher Association meetings, the BEO, in his order issued on August 29 (date overwritten), permitted the Headmaster (in-charge) to declare local holiday.

The Headmaster (in-charge), in his request, sent on August 24, sought permission for announcement of local holiday in view of the village temple festival on Thursday. However, enquiries with the villagers revealed that the 'mulaipari' festival at the Kooni Amman Temple was held on Wednesday.

Consequently, the school functioned when the villagers celebrated the festival and remained shut on Thursday to enable the teachers to attend the wedding of the Headmistress' son, a villager said.

The school authorities, however, maintained that they went by what the villagers said and did not cross check the festival date. When contacted, Chief Educational Officer R. Murugan said local holiday was granted for the school following the order of the BEO. He said he would check if there was any discrepancy.

Eight teachers were working in the school, which had a student strength of about 80. The local holiday would be compensated on September 1, sources said."

Representational imageIANS

Andhra Pradesh is witnessing a statewide shutdown today, February 8, after the Left parties called for a bandh to protest against the Union Budget 2018.

The parties said that the budget, presented by finance minister Arun Jaitley, was ""injustice done to Andhra Pradesh"" and that the government also betrayed the people of the state.

Authorities have now tightened security in the state and schools and other institutions too have declared a holiday as a precautionary measure. Several people are supporting the bandh and the ruling Telugu Desam Party also called for protest in the state, reported NDTV.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu also said that he was disappointed with the budget and earlier called for a party meeting to review its ties with the BJP, an ally.

""The CM has asked the MPs to use all means possible to put pressure on the Centre and highlight our problems, including disrupting Parliament even if they face the possibility of suspension. The CM said he is committed to maintaining the coalition dharma, but the protests for justice for Andhra Pradesh should now be out in the open, rather than just sending requests and appeals,"" NDTV quoted Kambhampati Rammohan Rao, TDP Central Committee member, as saying after the meeting."
