And it's not a pretty sight for students of Gurugram, with only 55% managing to pass. The results were uploaded on the Saksham Haryana Education portal last week. The tests are conducted by the state education department to track and improve the learning ability of government school students.

Students of Mahendergarh topped with a pass percentage of 69%, with Yamunanagar bringing up the rear at 36%. English is the subject most students struggled with, especially in higher classes. Across the state, barely 35% students managed to clear it.

Satyanarayan Yadav, state secretary of Haryana School Teachers Association, said, ""Most students find it hard to learn English as they speak in Hindi. Effort is needed to ensure students improve their English scores."" In contrast, most students performed well in fine arts and music scoring overall 91% and 81%, respectively.

Of 21 districts, Gurugram was ranked 16th in the Class X Haryana Board Examination of 2017-18, with a pass percentage of 45.67%. In 2016-17, too, it was ranked 16th but with a pass percentage of 43.68%. After the low of 2016-17 board exams, Gurugram's scores in SAT too, shows signs of improvement, from 48% in July and 41% in September to 55% in November.

District elementary education officer Prem Lata Yadav said, ""From this year onwards, I'll ensure kids take their class tests seriously. I'm sure results will improve."" In the block-wise comparison of SAT scores for the district, Sohna scored 49%, Farrukhnagar 56%, Gurugram 57% and Pataudi 62%.

In Government Senior Secondary School, Khetawas, out of 18 students who appeared for the Class XII exam, only three passed. The principal said: ""As most students belong to families of migrant workers, they don't have the environment to study at home. How can they clear board exams on the basis of class teaching alone?""

The SAT results are shared with district education officers to evaluate performance of students and teachers, followed by classes under the learning enhancement programme to bridge gaps. Jyoti Chaudhary, director, SCERT, said, ""All efforts are being taken by SCERT to increase learning level of students."""

Her call evoked good response from various quarters of society on Tuesday.

Officials belonging to various departments, voluntary organisations, employees' associations, political and farmers' leaders and business establishments made a beeline to her camp office. They conveyed New Year greetings to her by giving shawls and blankets as per her request.

Divya said the request evoked an encouraging response and she was overwhelmed by the kind act of various sections of society. She said the shawls and blankets will be distributed to the poor, abandoned, destitute, orphans and roadside dwellers, who were struggling to handle the severe cold conditions prevailing in the district.

Officials working at the camp office said that quite a large number of shawls and blankets had been collected. Some employees and voluntary organisations brought dozens of winter wear responding to the request. They are sufficient to help all the needy, an official said.

The first two weeks of the drive, to begin on January 16, is for students up till the age of 15. According to a Directorate of Education (DoE) circular dated December 19, 2018, since the MR campaign is a central government policy, no consent is required from beneficiaries and their parents. A December 24 circular on the same states: ""For vaccination sessions in educational institutes/schools, teachers and parents will play a key role in ensuring that targeted students are well informed and immunised during the campaign.""

Teachers have been told to be part of the vaccination teams, along with the designated health workers, and to create awareness and sensitisation regarding the vaccine among students and parents in all government, government-aided and unaided recognised schools in Delhi. However, some teachers have expressed their discomfort about being placed at the forefront of the drive. ""I have been asked to tell parents that this vaccine is safe when I myself do not know enough about this. We are trained as teachers, not health functionaries.

Without training and knowledge, how can we tell parents that it is alright?"" said a teacher at a North MCD school. ""There is a certain level of trust that parents have in us, and we are recognisable faces in this exercise. If, by any chance, something happens, they will turn to us. They should use schools and classrooms for administering the campaign, if they must, but not us teachers,"" the teacher added. A teacher at a private school also said she was uncomfortable convincing parents about this.

""I am not convinced that this campaign is essential, and we have read many news reports of children falling ill after receiving the vaccine in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Since it is a central government scheme, there is no room for us to resist. But many students and parents have also voiced their reluctance and I am expected to placate them without information or conviction,"" she said, adding that teachers in her school had not yet received any kind of orientation about the vaccination.

Director of Education Sanjay Goel said, ""We have not received any complaint or experienced resistance from any school so far. As for orientation, one nodal officer per school -- who might be a part of the teaching or non-teaching staff -- is receiving the same as the vaccine is being administered by a health functionary."""

Besides such attempts to make this language weaker, what shocked the cultural fraternity was the assassination of veteran journalist and Rising Kashmir founder, Shujaat Bukhari- whose immense contribution is well known in cultural circles. Bukhari was not the only renowned journalist but an avid language activist -- who tried his best to save cultural identity of Kashmiris at several world forums.

The attack on our native language bought together cross-sections of people including our literati to raise their voices and organize demonstrations to get their voices heard.

Rising Kashmir gathered some of the events which surprised the Kashmiris and triggered anger among the masses.

Removal of Kashmiri translations from Bhasha Sangam

Ministry of Human Resource and Development first withdrew Kashmiri translations from its language-promoting portal -- Bhasha Sangam -- after Kashmiri Pandits objected to the version of the language it put out.

The Valley-based Kashmiri literary circle ridiculed the MHRD move to remove Kashmiri translations from its language-promoting portal -- Bhasha Sangam and called it a direct attack on ""Kashmiri identity"".

The Valley-based experts of Kashmiri language condemned and expressed displeasure over the move.

Banning Pheran

A controversy erupted in Kashmir following an order banning the use of the pheran, a key part of traditional Kashmiri attire. The order was originally meant for the state secretariat in Jammu and Kashmir.

In September, the General Administration Department of the Civil Secretariat in Srinagar asked government officials to ""be attired in proper formal dress while appearing before any court of law and while attending offices in the State of Jammu and Kashmir and strictly avoid casual or party attire"".

The decision was a security directive. However, the zonal education officer (ZEO) in Langate, following the civil secretariat directive, issued an order last week banning the pheran in educational institutions.

After facing widespread criticism, the school department, later, retracted the order.

Removal of Kashmiri programmes from Kashir channel

Scores of Srinagar based artists registered protests against what they call as ""extinction"" of Kashmiri programmes from Doordarshan's Kashir channel.

The protesting artists -- including freelance producers, directors, singers, actors and professionals associated with production and among others affiliated with the profession.

The artists, who are affiliated with Doordarshan from decades, lashed out at the government and said that there was an ""onslaught"" on Kashmir language as well as on their livelihood as Prasar Bharti wasn't producing any Kashmiri programmes for which the channel was launched.

The channel was launched in 2000 with an aim to cater to the Kashmiri population and also keeping in view the promotion of local talent.

Unfortunately, the artists have not been given an opportunity to work from a decade now.

The artists said the irony is that the channel has been turned into a ""money minting machine for Mumbai-based producers whose flop movies are run at a prime time while local artists suffer.""

They asked the authorities to restore the Kashmiri content on the DD Kashir channel.

Protest to save the dying ""mother tongue""

Scores of the people associated with Kashmiri Language Union (KLU) including students of Kashmiri language department asked the government to save the dying ""mother tongue"" of the place.

""The Kashmiri language is dying and we are losing our identity day by day,"" shouted protestors at Press Enclave Srinagar.

Besides raising slogans like ""Kashrin Henz Pehchan, Kashir Zaban Kashir Zaban (The identity of every Kashmiri is Kashmiri langue, Kashmiri language), the protestors asked governor administration to make this language compulsory at the higher secondary level in all educational institutions.

They appealed the administration including Director of School Education Ghulam Nabi Itoo to implement the order Via 333 edu of 2017 which states that mother tongue of Jammu and Kashmir (Kashmiri, Dogri and Bhudhi) should be made compulsory till higher secondary level throughout the state including Chenab valley.

Announcements in the Kashmiri language stopped at Srinagar Airport

The Airport Authority of India (AAI) stopped making important announcements in the Kashmiri language at Srinagar airport.

AAI had recently announced that the Kashmiri language would be used in their daily announcement at the airport, the move was also welcomed by locals.

As per the frequent flyers, the announcements in the Kashmiri language have been stopped for unknown reasons.

They complained that announcements are made in Urdu and English languages only and the Kashmiri language was not used.

This move has fumed many flyers, who blamed AAI for the step-motherly approach towards the Kashmiri language.

""Many travelers don't understand Urdu and English language. Why authorities have stopped making announcements in the Kashmiri language,"" said one of the passengers.

A revival of Kashmiri Music

The Kashmiri music was back on the track as it became popular among the youngsters.

In 2018, the videos of youngsters singing traditional Kashmiri songs were making rounds on the social media.

Young and professional singers reviewed traditional music by giving it a new feel. The new Sufi music, playing the traditional instruments like Rabab was trending.

The new music trends in local Folk and Sufi music helped in the restoration of the pristine glory of Kashmir language.

Besides, Kashmiri chaker, Rouf, Wanwon and Sufi lyrics also gained popularity among the masses."

She and her husband, Akash Buda, 21, also from Nepal, rushed to the BBMP maternity hospital at Tuvarekere, which was the only affordable option for the couple.

Akash had migrated to the city five years ago and works as a watchman in BTM Layout.

Less than an hour after the new year was ushered in, Lakshmi delivered a baby girl. The happiness of the couple's first child was compounded when doctors and officials informed that their child would be among the first recipients of the Pink Baby scheme this year. ""With the amount, at least our child can have a secure future,"" says Mr. Buda.

The scheme, conceived by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), will give ₹5 lakh to a girl child born in any of the civic body's 24 hospitals in the first day of the year. The money comes in the form of a long-term fixed deposit.

""The money will be put in an FD in the names of the parents. But control of the account will be with the local administrator whose permission is needed for withdrawal of funds. Money can only be withdrawn to pay for school and college fees, and will be directly transferred to the educational institution,"" says Nirmala Buggi, Chief Health Officer (clinical), BBMP.

The objective of the scheme was two-fold: increase patronage of BBMP maternity hospitals and encourage education of the girl child, she said.

Though the scheme was announced last year, it has been tweaked to include a larger number of beneficiaries.

In 2018, only the first child born in the city in a BBMP hospital was eligible. In 2019, the first girl child born in each hospital (that is, 24 hospitals in all) till March 31 will be eligible for the scheme.

On Tuesday, five girls were the beneficiaries.

Thirteen minutes after the Buda couple had their child, a girl was born to Udaykumar, a cab driver, and his wife Asha. They had rushed to the BBMP hospital at Ganganagar at midnight.

""We have been coming to the BBMP hospital as it is affordable. We didn't know about the scheme. It is a huge relief for us to know that her education will be taken care of,"" said Mr. Udaykumar."

The presumption of innocence -- a principle that one is considered innocent until proven guilty -- is a basic legal right guaranteed to people in many countries. However, in Kashmir region, there is altogether a different ""law"" in place, which stresses, ""guilty even after proven innocent.""

This illegal ""law"" is operational especially for youngsters, whose future stands hostage of a Public Safety Act (PSA) or an FIR tag. Life suddenly changes, rather comes to a halt, for juveniles, against whom a criminal case is registered.

Many juveniles over the past many years have been slapped with PSA. However, even after their PSA and detention orders were quashed, life became no better for them. Most of them still struggle to lead a normal life, as they are denied of various essential facilities, like admissions, jobs, passport, visa, license, banking and other facilities.

Criminal record of an acquit is often being produced before the inquiry team during their verification process for a government job, passport and other services.

""I have seen many cases, wherein even after juveniles are acquitted, police prepare an adverse report against them that denies them of many rights including employment. They apply for passport but they don't get that as well,"" laments Mir Urfi, advocate at Lower Court, Srinagar.

Advocate Mir Shafkat Hussain, who has represented thousands of PSA detainees in J&K High Court since early 1990s, says, when someone's detention order is quashed, it means nothing was proved against him.

""In that case, the person is entitled for everything. However, in Kashmir, people get nothing after an FIR is registered against them, be it job or admission,"" Hussain says, adding that juveniles and their parents suffer a lot even after the detention orders are quashed.

Representational Picture.

As per a Supreme Court ruling, an employee, who has been detained in preventive custody, may be considered on duty for the period of preventive confinement once his detention orders are quashed and his salary should be released for that period.

""Contrarily, it takes decades for a person to prove his innocence and a person hardly gets any benefit of the law,"" says Hussain. Recently, the advocate continues, he came across a case, wherein a person, who has now got regularised in a government department, has been asked to clear some FIR that was registered against him way back in 1995 even though he was acquitted long back. ""Now he is being dragged from pillar to post for something that happened 23 years ago,"" he says. ""Such is the situation in Kashmir.""

ALSO READ: With minors in adult prisons in Kashmir, is the new juvenile justice draft a travesty of existing Act?

Constant state surveillance is another torture for juveniles. Even after being given clean chit, they are required to report in the concerned police station on regular -- weekly, or fortnightly -- basis. Besides, they are detained for several days on the eve of Republic and Independence days of India, any VIP visit in the Valley and whenever some untoward incident takes place.

""No matter for how many days or weeks they are detained, their food and other expenses have to be borne by their parents, which drains them emotionally as well as financially,"" says Advocate Hussain.

This arbitrary detention of children in Kashmir violates Article 14(4) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which requires that ""all proceedings against juveniles shall take into account their age and the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation"". It also violates the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2013.

To understand the state's wisdom behind such a prevalent practice, I made repeated calls to DG Police Dilbag Singh. The calls went unanswered. Even ADGP Law and Order, Munir Khan, known for his 'easy' police take and talk skipped to respond. ""I will get back to you on this,"" he hung up.

Some low-rung police officers cited the official orders not to speak on record. On anonymity, however, most of them offered their own versions on the issue.

""Police is here for people, however those found taking law and order in their hand, will have to face the law,"" said a young SHO posted in south Kashmir. Regarding the regular summons and repeated arrests, another officer said, ""such steps are being taken in selective cases, keeping the security sensitivity in view.""

However, the rights activists and the legal experts term such approach problematic. ""This vicious police cycle is never-ending even after the case is disposed off. It has a negative impact on the psyche of the children as well as disrupts their social life,"" says Advocate Urfi.

Such recurrent harassment is proving to be detrimental, especially for the career and education of the juveniles apart from affecting their social behaviour.

""I want to pursue my further studies from outside India, but how can I do that? It requires proper verification, which will only go against me. I cannot apply for the passport because of the FIR registered against me,"" shares Taseer (name changed) of Lal Bazaar area of Srinagar city.

His younger brother, Haseeb (name changed), is keen to move to Dubai for his higher studies. Both the brothers, however, stand helpless. The duo was apprehended by local police in May 2016 from their home under stone pelting charges, which they claim to be false. Both of them were detained in Nowhatta Police Station. Taseer, who was barely 16 then, was later shifted to Central Jail, Kotbalwal Jammu, for two months, while his brother was released on bail.

""Even after our parents pleaded before them that we were minors and innocent, the police officials did not listen and detained us. In this process, our education suffered a great deal,"" says Haseeb.

Representational Picture.

Another juvenile, Basit (name changed) of old Srinagar city, too has been struggling hard for his passport. He was apprehended by police a couple of years back under stone pelting charges and was released three months later after his detention orders were quashed.

""My family wants to send me outside for higher education, so that I can stay away from the distressing situation in Kashmir. But then non-issuance of the passport has become a hurdle in way of my education,"" says Basit, who claims to have been detained under false charges.

Experts deem that not being able to pursue education or get a job adds to the mental trauma of the juveniles. ""Such situation is no doubt traumatic for the juveniles. Then there is a possibility that some of them may indulge in heinous crimes,"" warns Advocate Hussain.

Muhammad Sharif Bhat, General Manager, Save the Children -- a non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights -- stresses that children want a peaceful life and wish to continue with their education.

""Life after detention becomes quite difficult and challenging. Someone who stays under detention, only he can explain what effect it has. There is a stigma from society as well as police attached to it. Children suffer from a lot of trauma,"" he says.

Officials at Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), Srinagar, admit that there are still certain loopholes in the juvenile justice system ""for it is still in infancy in the state.""

""This is true that police is illegally detaining juveniles in custody because they are not sensitized enough yet, despite that we often invite the juvenile police unit to our training programmes,"" says Khairulnisa, member, JJB, Srinagar.

She maintains that the juveniles should report to the board about any hurdle they are facing. ""At present, 1,954 cases are pending before the JJBs in the state, of whom no child is facing PSA charges. However, the juveniles who are being constantly harassed by police even after their cases have been quashed should approach us so that we could help them out,"" she stresses.

Justice (R) Hasnain Masoodi, Chairperson, Selection and Oversight Committee monitoring implementation of the law in the state, explains that they can resolve the issues faced by someone only when they bring it to their notice.

""Even as some juveniles raised some issues, say trouble in getting jobs or admissions, they did not follow it for long,"" he says, adding that there is a need to conduct a survey as to how many juveniles had previously been booked under PSA so as to provide required assistance to them.

""In first place, we need to identify juveniles who were placed under preventive detention and thereafter were released after judicial intervention. We need to see how it has impacted their studies and other aspects of life,"" he says.

Under ICPS, two statutory bodies, viz., Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) are operating. CWC is meant for children who are in need of care and protection. JJB caters to only those cases that are registered through police.

""But then if we receive even an anonymous case, we still entertain them. So the children must approach us with their problems,"" says Khairunisa.

Following complaints that some transport agents engaged for delivery of rice under the scheme in Bhadrak and Keonjhar districts are diverting the food grain for purposes other than providing supplementary nutrition to school children, the State Food Commission had sought immediate intervention of the Government.

Since corrective measures were not taken promptly, as normally expected, the Food Commission moved the Finance department with a request to conduct a special audit into the allegations on a priority basis.

The special audit suggested recovery of '1,888.72 lakh from officials concerned as bulk of the amount relates to short delivery of MDM rice by two transport agents. ""The audit report clearly brings out the gross misconduct and indifference of the District Education Officer (DEO), Keonjhar and other Government employees,"" said a letter of State Food Commission Chairperson Ranglal Jamuda to School and Mass Education department.

The audit found excess consumption of MDM rice by one Manna Trust over and above the requirement. The cost of the excess rice used was estimated at '6.53 lakh.

Software is eating the world. This is an oft-repeated proclamation in Silicon Valley, originally coined by Marc Andreessen. The claim is that when you zoom into the technology space, it is neither computers nor mobile manufacturers, and not even Internet service providers that are capturing value.

The widespread existence of personal computing devices connected to the Internet means that the action now is all in the software. Software is the layer, which wills a computer or many computers connected over the Internet, including your handheld devices, to do an increasingly complex set of tasks.

This layer of software is able to replace entire value chains of traditional businesses at a very, very rapid pace. Take for example, the space of finance. In 2011, China sent almost no money over mobile payments. In 2016, its mobile money market was $5.5 trillion, 50 times that of the US.

Based on the success of its payments, Alibaba launched Yu'e Bao, which means 'leftover treasure'. The app reminds users to move change from their mobile wallets into a money market fund for higher interest. Started in 2013, in just four years, it became the world's largest money market fund.

Sceptics could argue that the act of moving money and moving bits have never been too different, so software may eat finance, but does it mean it is eating the world? One could keep listing examples from fields that are traditionally seen as non-software, but are being disrupted by software.

Take Netflix for example. Originally, in the business of shipping DVDs, Netflix today is arguably the largest channel of distribution of entertainment content in the world. It consumes 15 per cent of the global Internet bandwidth on average, and as much as 40 per cent during peak hours. It is very clear that software has 'eaten' how we consume content. Netflix chief executive officer Reed Hastings once commented that their competition isn't the movies, ""we actually compete with sleep"". ""And we're winning!"" he added.

Netflix has gone from simply distributing content to making content. Netflix's first original series was House of Cards in 2013. Fast forward to four years later, Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2017 for a total cost of $6 billion, more than any other single American network or cable channel. It was nominated for 91 Emmys, second only to HBO's 110.

Not only did Netflix start making content, it became really good at making it too in just four years. Once Netflix owned the distribution, it could figure out exactly what its users liked and disliked from their behaviour of watching millions of hours of television.

So, finance and entertainment have been eaten by software. Does that mean every industry will follow? Well, once you start bringing artificial intelligence (AI) into the fold of software, things that we thought were inherently hard for a machine become possible too -- from being a doctor to an artist. It is hard to deny that software is eating the world, and the sooner we see this as a forecast rather than a catch phrase, the sooner we can start reacting to the very real dangers of a world eaten by software -- data colonisation.

To understand data colonisation, we must ask what is it about software that makes it simultaneously great at being a bank and at being a film producer. There are three critical things.

First, software is infinitely malleable -- it can be written, rewritten, copied and deleted much more easily than any other structure built to govern a task.

Second, software tends to generate a much richer, more precise and seemingly infinite exhaust trail of user data. It lets businesses know, in the most direct manner, what their consumers do, what they like and dislike, what they are looking for and what they do when they find it.

Third, by using the data generated by its user, software companies improve their product offering to appeal to more users, who in turn generate more data, and a flywheel effect is generated. Once kick started, this data-driven machinery self-perpetuates, and is sometimes called the network effect. With AI in the mix, the improvements in the product are now dramatic, and the flywheel seems impossible to stop.

To feed this flywheel, tech companies are willing to service you sometimes even for free, as long as you kept giving them your valuable data. In a perverse way, while the product may have been 'free', the currency of exchange here really is your data. Further, they build a set of 'convenient' products around their core offering, but it only works well if you also use other products from the same company.

For example, your latest Apple product will play your customised music when you get home -- but only from your iTunes library. It isn't a coincidence that these companies are able to raise eye-popping amounts of capital, at sky-high valuations; the price premium is attributed on the near exclusive datasets that these companies have on their consumers. With a powerful mix of cheap, deep capital and large datasets, companies today are creating a barrier to entry unlike any other in history.

What is more perverse is the control of the narrative that these companies have had on their own progress thus far. Until the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, this form of rapid capture was seen as 'innovation'. Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurs were seen as missionaries out to ""change the world"". They didn't build empires, they built 'products'. Data collected on users being used as barriers against them was seen as 'core assets' or 'moats'.

Undercutting upstarts, as well as small and medium enterprise and driving them out of businesses is called, without the slightest hint of irony, ""crushing it"". Sympathisers often call the usage of the term colonisation too harsh, and prefer the more positive sounding 'disruption' instead.

Regulators, who try to implement checks and balances, are seen as 'anti-innovation' or 'regressive'. But it is precisely this control of language around the nature of business of these platforms that makes them even more dangerous. It's happening right under our noses, and they've convinced us to look away.

Truth is, when the flywheel is in full motion, no longer can individuals negotiate their rights with these platforms fairly. Competition is 'crushed' or acquired before they become a meaningful threat. When it comes to privacy, the approach offered usually is ""take it or leave it"".

Government interventions often cannot change the way they operate. Many of these companies have more free cash than the gross domestic product of the nations they are negotiating with. Many sympathisers argue that not all tech companies have been guilty of using user data against users themselves, so why should we be fear-mongering by calling it data colonisation?

Because we've heard this argument before, apologists of the empire would often point to the railways or the education system as gifts of the British Raj. But Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati pointed out, that good governance is no substitute for self-governance, and hence, swaraj. To be clear, in the context of data colonisation, we're not asking for our foreign overlords to be replaced by Indian ones. We're asking for our rights over our own data, to prevent having any masters at all.

Last year, a landmark judgement in the Supreme Court of India recognised privacy as a fundamental right. We can go further. India, not having the baggage of an existing data privacy law, can choose to recognise that user data belongs to the user, and not only to the platforms on which they are created. Recognising that ownership can lead to the affirmation of many rights that are not only necessary for protecting citizens but also empowering them to use their data for their own benefit, in a manner that they see fit.

The principle of data swaraj is not impossible nor is it too ambitious. If it sounds radical, it is because we've been lulled into believing that the only way data can be put to good use is if we let tech companies use it unabashedly and allow 'innovation' to happen.

There is no reason to believe this is true. Even the inventor of the world wide web, Tim Berners Lee, is creating a similar view of personal online data stores through his new startup, Solid.

In India, the fourth layer of the India Stack, known as the consent layer offers a way of asserting control over your data. In summary, the technology for data swaraj exists. The question we must ask ourselves is do we have the will to fight for the independence of our data?"

Mint asked top company bosses how they see disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain and 5G impacting Indian firms. Edited excerpts:

C.P. Gurnani, chief executive officer and managing director, Tech Mahindra

Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.

The IT and digital transformation industry is witnessing exponential growth in the use of cutting-edge digital technologies like Blockchain, 5G, AI, automation, robotics, cybersecurity and IoT. One can expect all these new age technologies to make greater inroads both in the Indian and global markets, in the years ahead.

As part of our TechMNxt charter, we are collaborating and co-innovating with our partner ecosystem to derive business value for our customers by leveraging these digital technologies. 2019 can very well turn out to be an inflection point for many of these technologies converting into real connected experiences.

GDPR impact on companies in India.

I believe if companies are pre-emptive in the data protection space, there will be a huge business opportunity for Indian IT players like Tech Mahindra, not just in the European markets but globally too.

Thoughts on 5G.

At Tech Mahindra, we are bullish on 5G and as part of our preparedness for 5G, we are investing in 5G training labs in partnership with global players as well as setting up a training academy.

Progress of Digital India.

The government of India has been focusing heavily on developing India into a $1 trillion digital economy by 2025. The government's focus on developing digital governance services and Smart Cities by adapting new age technologies like automation, AI, cybersecurity, blockchain and IoT has contributed to the growth of the Indian IT industry in recent times and promises to open additional avenues in the future.

Cybersecurity challenges.

While Indian enterprises are certainly susceptible to cyber threats, the scenario is gradually changing with organizations understanding the need of having a robust cyber security system. With increased focus on cybersecurity, major IT players like Tech Mahindra are also investing heavily in developing new age cyber security solutions.

Deb Deep Sengupta, managing director and president, SAP Indian Subcontinent

Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.

The world has transitioned from an era of Industrial automation to Digital transformation and Industry 4.0. We are already witnessing the next stage with the emergence of Intelligent Enterprises. At SAP, we don't look at technology in isolation. Instead we look at the outcomes it can enable when integrated seamlessly with data, people and processes.

Applications of technologies like AI are now impacting many sectors, blockchain is simplifying and optimizing erstwhile complex multi-party processes while IoT continues to push the boundaries of data exchange and consequent actions by machines and humans. As the application of these technologies mature, businesses across industries will adopt them to re-imagine their business processes.

GDPR impact on companies in India.

Data is the new ""oil"" in today's digital economy, and companies are building larger reserves every single day. SAP believes there are effective alternatives to data localization, such as encryption technologies to ensure data security. We believe GDPR has paved the future of data privacy and provides a view of what compliance will look like moving forward.

Progress of the Digital India programme.

Over the last three years, the programme has seen its share of success with a steady increase in internet and mobile users, as well as an increase in e-gov transactions. However, to achieve the goal of $1 trillion in GDP by 2025 ('India's tech opportunity': McKinsey Global Institute), the government and India Inc., will need to come together to build a robust and nurturing ecosystem that not only provides citizens with technology, but with end-to-end solutions. This requires skill building of our large human capital at scale. With this in mind, SAP has launched initiatives like Code Unnati and Bharat ERP to build skills of young India along with an increase in industry capability to leverage them.

AI impact on jobs.

Digital transformation has impacted workplaces globally. The speed of innovation will continue to increase exponentially, and application of new-age technologies is making it possible to automate routine tasks. Not only are jobs changing, the job market itself is transforming.

AI can effectively disaggregate value chains and generate the capacity to serve people at scale.

We believe this technology has the potential to augment human potential and uplift the workforce into higher value adding jobs. To help elevate the country's human capital to take on these roles, while promoting a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, SAP has signed a pact with NITI Aayog's innovation unit to adopt 100 Atal Tinkering Labs. SAP believes people are the force behind innovation and growth.

Manu Saale, managing director and chief executive officer, Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India

Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.

AI is a key technology enabler for all megatrends that are set to redefine the automotive industry. Autonomous driving, for example, relies on AI, because it is the only technology that enables reliable, real-time recognition of objects around the vehicle. AI creates numerous opportunities to reduce costs, improve operations, and generate new revenue streams. For shared-mobility services, for example, AI can help optimize pricing by predicting and matching demand and supply. Improvements realized through AI will play an important role for automotive companies in the future.

Blockchain is seen to provide new applications with connected cars, vehicle safety and data security, supply chain transparency and in the world of automotive financing. 3D printing is seen to support better parts prototyping and in several weight reduction initiatives in the automotive industry.

Automobile technology in 2019.

The automotive industry is always evolving and has, in the last few years, been going through constant disruption. At Mercedes-Benz too, a strategy termed C.A.S.E -- Connected, Autonomous, Shared and Services and Electric -- is being applied as a guiding principle for defining the future.

Will 5G affect auto tech?

The cars of the future are designed and intended to be highly connected. With their 'Always On' feature, there is a huge amount of data expected to be transferred from the car to the cloud and back. Compared to 4G, 5G is set to significantly increase the sustainable bandwidth of both data uplink as well as downlink.

Progress of the Digital India programme.

The amount of pure-play digital startups in the country that are catering to making lives easier are increasing by the day.

AI impact on jobs.

There is going to be a lot of disruption over the next 5-10 years.

While it is shown that many jobs done by humans today AI can potentially do better, there are still thousands of areas where human intervention and deployment would be necessary. It calls for better coordination between AI and humans.

Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.

While 2018 has been a good year for demonstrating use cases of 5G, next year is poised to be the year of 5G field trials in India. Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) will drive the first wave of 5G, while Massive IoT and digitalization of vertical industries will drive the next wave of 5G. The rollout of 5G will be at the heart of the proliferation of other technologies such as AI, IoT and AR-VR globally and in India. At Huawei we believe the future will be intelligent, AI-driven. The key to staying competitive in such an environment lies in data and analytics including AI, so businesses will have to become an intelligent enterprise in an intelligent world. We are exploring how existing technologies can be upgraded to 5G.

GDPR impact on companies in India.

EU's GDPR does not impact Indian companies if they are not processing data of citizens residing within EU.

Progress of the Digital India programme.

When the government rechristens its flagship National Telecom Policy as the National Digital Communications Policy 2018 (NDCP 2018), it's a clear indication of its continued commitment to the realization of its Digital India vision and enabling its citizens with a Digital way of life.

Cybersecurity challenges.

Indian enterprises are taking appropriate measures to safeguard themselves and their users, which include appointing a chief information security officer, conducting annual cybersecurity audits and improving the overall product security capability by frequent testing.

However, with the widespread adoption of technologies such as AI, they need scientists. While there will be much less demand for jobs that handle repetitive tasks in future, the focus will shift to more meaningful tasks. Technologically-advanced economies are already creating full-fledged jobs that require AI skill sets. That said, talent availability remains a concern. Huawei will be investing more than $140 million (including Huawei Cloud AI resources and AI suites) in AI talent education.

Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.

The trends that are shaping IT are a combination of all of these technologies. To experience the full value of these modern tools, integration is the only way forward. The common factor between all these technologies is data; IoT and blockchain provide a network between devices that pull out vast scores of data. Rich analytics and insights are inferred and then intelligently used to fuel solutions such as AI, robotics, and AR-VR. While each of these solutions have vast implications, it may be said that IoT will have the largest impact due to its ability to integrate.

GDPR's impact on companies in India.

The GDPR regulations pushed Indian businesses to upgrade their privacy policies for global customers and not only their clients in the EU.

Do you think there will be a visible shift to 5G next year?

5G is expected to drive emerging technologies such as IoT, AR and VR. It is going to have a big impact on segments beyond mobile broadband such as smart cities, robotics, self-driving cars, healthcare, agriculture, and education. Cisco is working with BSNL to demonstrate use cases of 5G to address challenges in areas like education, healthcare and agriculture.

Thoughts on the progress of Digital India

The Digital India initiative is a significant initiative that has helped India leapfrog in many aspects. It has transformed the way communities, citizens, states, and industries operate today. The penetration of mobile devices and services alone has created a new channel for the delivery of public services. For example, the UPI-based digital payments platform has democratized financial transactions on an unprecedented scale. Intelligent networks have become a foundation of Digital India, making most of the government's initiatives such as Make in India, Smart Cities, financial inclusion, startup India more relevant than ever.

Do you think AI will impact jobs?

There is no doubt that AI will have a profound impact on jobs, but it will be a positive one.

According to a new Cisco-IDC report, digital disruption is likely to add over 1.4 million new IT jobs by 2027 in India, primarily in areas like cybersecurity, automation, AI, networking and data analytics. AI will create new roles which never existed before like 'empathy trainer' for AI devices, or an AI 'ethics auditor.'

Security challenges.

India faces the highest number of cybersecurity threats in the Asia-Pacific region with over 500,000 alerts daily. Considering the growing threat landscape, companies and governments should consider adopting advanced security technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities to investigate and identify alerts.

Prakash Mallya, managing director (sales and marketing), Intel India

Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.

We believe data analytics and AI will have the maximum impact in India and globally. About 90% of global data was created in the last couple of years but only 1-3% of this data has been analyzed. Intel is inventing technologies and software tools that will advance the AI ecosystem, making it possible to gain insight, anticipate needs and continuously learn from data at enterprise scale.

GDPR impact on companies in India.

Regulations such as GDPR offer an opportunity for India to leverage its vast technology expertise and talent pool to address the need for privacy compliant solutions globally.

Thoughts on 5G.

In the last 18 months or so, India went from being 155th to being #1 globally in mobile data consumption, which underlines the scale of the opportunity in this market. That's set the stage for data-led transformation of our country. India is on the cusp of 5G adoption with the auction of spectrum for 5G services likely to happen in the latter half of 2019.

Progress of the Digital India programme.

India today presents a fascinating data driven transformation story. There is no other country that has digitized similar volumes of citizen data. Our future is going to be data driven and India provides a significant data science opportunity. Through our 20 years in the Indian market, we have been committed to working closely with the government, the developer community, and industry collaborators to accelerate new technology adoption and strengthen our local ecosystem to help enable a digitally empowered society.

AI impact on jobs.

Industry reports indicate that AI will actually create more jobs than it is expected to eliminate globally. India has an opportunity to tap into its existing pool of mathematicians, statisticians, and programmers and nurture this talent to leverage their skills for analytics and AI. Intel is committed to democratizing AI through deep industry, academic, and government collaborations. Last year, we committed to training 15,000 developers, students, and professors in AI. We have long surpassed our goal and have today engaged with more than 112,000 people across more than 130 corporate organizations and academia.

Cybersecurity challenges.

Today there is a need to understand that when it comes to securing data, software alone is no longer enough. Hardware-enabled security capabilities improve an organization's security posture and mitigate risk, offering safer data exchanges and secure storage and processing.

While India Inc is spending more on cybersecurity each year, there is still a lot of work to be done to increase awareness of risks and drive home the need for continuous focus and investment in end to end security.

Kulmeet Bawa, managing director, India and South Asia, Adobe Inc.

Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.

New age technologies like AI, AR-VR, and 3D Printing are today changing the way people experience the world, and can potentially disrupt the industry with new ways by which brands can delight their end-customers.

At Adobe, we are focused on leveraging the power of technologies like AI to enhance the way our customers are experiencing and benefiting from our products. With the Adobe Sensei framework, we apply AI and machine learning to solve customer problems across the various aspects of creativity (Creative Cloud), digital documents (Document Cloud), and digital experiences (Experience Cloud), where Adobe has domain expertise. Adobe Sensei is fuelled by the tens of millions of content assets to the trillions of transactions we process for customers.

AI impact on jobs.

We firmly believe technologies like AI will enhance human creativity, and not replace it. AI is already being used in our products to improve the creative process, drive efficiencies, make recommendations, and enhancing accessibility as well as ease of use.

Thoughts on the progress of Digital India and 5G.

India has leap-frogged ahead of many countries on its digital transformation journey, and this remarkable growth story has been driven by factors like its rapid adoption of data services, proliferation of mobile devices, strong millennial population, and Prime Minister Modi's digital initiatives that are playing an instrumental role in building the country into a true digital-first economy. Adobe remains committed to delivering the latest innovation for Indians and is a big supporter of the government's Digital India agenda -- our deal with the Ministry of Skill Development to give a million students access to Adobe Spark (tool for easily creating high-quality graphics, web pages, and video stories) is a case in point.

Meanwhile, while 5G will certainly be the next chapter in India's mobile-first success story, 2019 may be too early to expect an absolute shift in the marketplace.

GDPR's impact on companies in India in 2019.

In today's world, data is a company's most valuable asset, and undoubtedly, it is the responsibility of every company to be a good steward of the information entrusted to them by their customers.

While customer information is the key to delivering personalized, relevant and compelling experiences, companies must honour customer choice and be transparent on what data is being collected and how it's used.

Security challenges.

In the Indian context, technology has over the years grown to become an inherent part of boardroom discussions, and security is a clear priority for all companies looking to be successful in the marketplace.

Rajesh Janey, president and managing director (enterprise) Dell EMC India

Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.

Not just one, but a consortium of all these technologies will create a significant impact in 2019. It will not be humanely possible to analyse and make sense out of the humongous amount of data being generated by various devices and sensors. AI, ML and DL will, hence, play a critical role in deriving actionable insights from the data. We foresee AI and ML leading the largest productivity increases we've seen in the years.

GDPR impact on companies in India.

GDPR has been implemented in such a way that will change how companies conduct business. With this, one can expect privacy laws in India to be defined in the months to come, in turn impacting the prospects of companies in 2019.

Will there be a visible shift to 5G in 2019?

5G will have us living on the edge. As the first 5G devices will start making inroads in the market, this will entirely change the data game in terms of speed and accessibility. 5G's low-latency, high-bandwidth data will bring more powerful visual experiences to bear across AR, VR, gaming and mobile apps for IoT, driving an increased demand for content at the edge. Adoption of 5G will drive the need for progressive software-defined IT strategies.

Thoughts on the progress of Digital India.

In 2018, India's digital growth graph has been fantastic. The government of India's progressive digital schemes like Digital India, Smart cities, Aadhaar, etc., proved to be a turning point for the entire economy. Dell EMC has been extensively working on these key government initiatives. Majority of large banks (like SBI) use our technology.

Security challenges.

According to 'Realize 2030' a Dell Technologies report, only 48% business leaders feel they have ineffective cybersecurity measures in place today. However, a whopping 97% feel they will have effective cybersecurity defences in place by the year 2030. However, implementation has a long way to go.

Impact of AI on jobs.

Emerging technologies like AI will transform every business. As the adoption of these technologies increase, this will enable us to digitally conduct our lives and learn in-the-moment. Contrary to common perception, Dell EMC believes that this won't result in reducing number of jobs but, instead, create newer skill sets which are needed for humans and technology to work alongside seamlessly. Therefore, re-skilling of the workforce becomes important. For example, as per Vanson Bourne research Realize 2030, 54% of Indian leaders believe they will have more job satisfaction by offloading tasks we don't want to do to intelligent machines.

Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.

All these technologies hold promise in time to come. At Akamai, we're thinking ahead to 2020 in fact. In the area of blockchain for example, we entered into a partnership with MUFG, one of the world's leading financial groups, to offer a new blockchain-based online payment network enabling next-generation payment transaction scale and responsiveness. This hyper-scale payment network, powered by an innovative and newly-developed blockchain architecture, is designed to be capable of processing more than one million transactions per second at latencies of less than two seconds per transaction. The underlying blockchain architecture is expected to be extensible to 10 million transactions per second. MUFG and Akamai intend to leverage the technology, built and deployed on the Akamai Intelligent Platform, to offer a new payment network expected to be available in Japan during the first half of 2020.

GDPR's impact on companies in India in 2019.

We typically have no direct relationship with the end users whose privacy GDPR is intended to protect. Our approach to security differs from most typical cloud providers. For example, we do not have a ""primary"" and a ""backup"" datacentre that we could lock down in a traditional way. Instead, we deploy our standardized servers everywhere we can, monitor them remotely from our Network Operations Command Center (NOCC), and embed security controls in our deployments themselves and across our operations.

Thoughts on the progress of Digital India and cybersecurity.

We are anticipating huge growth in Internet-based applications on the back of government-driven citizen services and BharatNet which aims to connect 2.5 lakh gram panchayats by March 2019.

However, with multi-fold growth in the cyberattacks in India, securing readily available digital assets becomes pertinent. Akamai has been in discussions with the Digital India stakeholders and several state governments' online citizen services initiatives to secure government sites and accelerate workloads.

According to the Ponemon Report, 2018, cyberattacks cause costly application downtime, loss of customers and involvement of IT security that can result in an average cost of $1.2 million, $1.5 million and $1.1 million annually, respectively.

AI impact on jobs.

Rapid advancements in AI and ML are becoming key equalising factors. In order to identify and mitigate these threats, artificial intelligence and machine learning can help detect if a user is human. Behavioural biometrics, such as studying how you hold a device and how you tap can be used to learn what is human. Thus leveraging AI and ML to increase capabilities and capacity of the workforce becomes mandatory."

Shreyansh Patel, 23, a Mumbai-based bartender, started investing when he turned 21. ""My grandfather spoke about how he took care of a family of five, including wife and three daughters, with a salary of ₹3,000 and managed to enjoy his life with a lot of travel,"" Patel said.

""He had invested in fixed deposits (FD) and insurance policies, which are not recommended for his age group,"" said Nisreen Mamaji, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based Money Works Financial Advisors.

Initially, Patel had no clarity on where to invest, hence, his parents encouraged him to speak to a financial planner. ""None of my family members is well versed with the markets and my parents too didn't have a positive experience with shares, hence I was advised by my parents to go for a financial planner,"" said Patel.

Considering that Patel works 16 hours a day and does not find time to learn the ropes of the market, he felt a financial planner could do justice to his investments. His financial planner advised him to shift to riskier assets. ""There is a re-investment risk with FDs wherein after the maturity period you are again stuck with where to invest that lump sum amount,"" Mamaji said. ""He can invest in instruments with a higher risk reward ratio,"" she said. Mamaji advised Patel to surrender his FDs, along with his insurance policies which were endowment policies. ""Endowment policies have lower yields and very high charges."" Her logic is that even if Patel lost some money from surrendering, he can always start his investments afresh.

After meeting the planner Patel learnt about diversification into different asset classes and made his first investment in mutual funds.

His goals include travel, financial stability after marriage, buying a house five to seven years from now and retirement planning too, which Patel believes is at least three decades away. Patel's investments include fixed income and hybrid equity funds.

Starting your investment journey early helps you correct your mistakes sooner. If you are in your early 20s, you should start saving and investing and use the power of compounding to grow your wealth.

Lesson 2: In your 20s, keep an eye on retirement

It is not only the savings but also the power of compounding that can work in your favour

Did you know that if you save for your retirement from your first job, you need less money to invest to build a larger kitty? It is called the power of compounding. Also it is one of the most common mistakes that people make -- ignoring your retirement goals. However, Mumbai-based Gayle Miranda (26), a human resources professional, has already started investing for her retirement.

After completing her Master's in Business Administration (MBA), Miranda joined as a human resources professional in mid-2016. ""The first year you see this good amount of money and independence and you want to reward yourself for the effort you have put in. So in my first year I did lots of travel -- at an interval of at least two months and bought lots of home decor,"" said Miranda. During the period her parents advised her to invest money in fixed deposits (FDs) and recurring deposits (RDs). ""But when I checked with my friends, they spoke only about mutual funds and equities,"" Miranda added.

Miranda's packed schedule and low expertise on finance made her turn towards a planner. ""I was earlier apprehensive that I am late with my investments considering I was already two years into the workforce and that my future financial stability might be at stake. After I began my journey with the planner in August, I learnt I am an early starter,"" said Miranda.

""Gayle was already aware something was lacking in her earlier investments and did not want any oldschool financial instruments,"" said Deepali Sen, founder-partner of Mumbai-based Srujan Financial Advisers LLP. Gayle's goals initially included travel, contribution to sister's education and her wedding for whenever it is planned but interactions with the planner helped her to add emergency and retirement funds to it. ""The challenge with Gayle was that she had a lot of aspirations which had a misbalance with the inflows so we prioritised her goals according to the timeline,"" said Sen.

""I had thought that mostly my goals could have been achieved in the next two to three years but once my planner shared more information on long-term planning, I apportioned a good sum for a period of 10 years,"" said Miranda. Her earlier investments were almost non-existent in the form of FDs and RDs. Her planner directed her towards budgeting and goal-based investments. For example, marriage was categorised as a short term goal and retirement was put under long-term goals for her. For short-term, Miranda now invests in debt instruments and for long-term goals such as retirement, she invested in equity instruments.

Lesson 3: Take out time to manage your money

Inability to spend time on management and overlooking the details has the potential to derail the entire process

Most professionals tend to spend longer hours at their work place. In fact, an average employee in Mumbai works 3,315 hours a year, the highest in the world, according to the findings of a 2018 study by Swiss investment bank UBS. Longer work hours followed by longer commute hours can leave you with little time to handle your finance. Ameya Bhangle, 28, an MNC professional and Anuradha Hardikar, 27 an HR professional, have been facing the problem of not having enough time to manage their finance.

""Earlier we planned our own investments but as both of us began our professional journey together and assessed our goals we realised we needed to get a little prudent at our financial planning, which would require a great deal of time from us,"" said Bhangle. ""We wanted to start planning according to short-, medium- and long-term goals,"" he said.

Bhangle said the couple were caught in a plug because of transit issues between India and U.S. and a newly acquired professional life. As a lot of time was going towards building their career, they decided to hand over money management to a financial planner. The key reason to hire a professional to manage their money included the planning process for different life stages as well. According to Vishal Dhawan, founder of Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors, the couple were well aware of investment products earlier and were managing their own money well but the investments were a bit scattered in terms of the number of investments they had. ""In that regard, simplification of the investments and aligning those with the goals was required. The portfolio needed comprehensiveness and alignment with objectives,"" Dhawan said.

The financial goal of the couple included paying off their education loan, travel, retirement, contingency, health and philanthropy. The couple have invested in a mix of debt and equity funds with the debt component catering mostly towards servicing the education loan.

Lesson 4: Crashes mustn't faze you

Make use of equities to achieve your long-term goals such as retirement and child's education

If you want to run a full marathon, your physical trainer will tell you you have to exercise regularly and follow a disciplined regime. Similarly when it comes to money management, you need to be disciplined. Though you may have started investing, if you don't do it in a systematic way you may not be able to achieve your financial goal.

For instance, investors tend to panic when markets crash and withdraw their equity investment. ""Before and after I began my professional journey, I tried a combination of direct equity and mutual funds but I always ended up in early redemptions. I realised later that I was missing out on the power of compounding,"" said Noida-based Ranjan Guglani, 35, a corporate banker, who is married to Harneet Kaur, 33, a supply chain executive. Like most retail investors, Guglani too lost hope when the markets crashed.

To streamline their investments, Guglani took the help of a planner. ""It was not just the return perspective but also goal-setting that we learnt from the planner,"" he added. The couple have invested more than 90% in equity mutual funds.

""When the family had approached me, they didn't have much coverage in financial assets and had most of their funds lying in bank accounts so the change required in their portfolio was to align them according to their goals and to stay invested in market-linked products,"" said Pawan Agrawal, founder of New Delhi based Investguru.in. For short-term goals, the couple invested in ultra shortterm funds. ""For long-term goals, such as their daughter's education and marriage, we looked at growth-oriented products like balanced funds and equity funds,"" said Agrawal.

Lesson 5: Do due diligence before hiring a money manager

When you seek professional help, don't blindly believe everything. Make sure you understand the financial instruments before you opt for it

Zarine Kharas, 54, a retired restaurateur, recently inherited some stocks and shares which had earlier been left to a large investment bank where her portfolio was mismanaged, causing her great losses. This sparked the decision of going to a planner. ""Before this, when I fell into the category of a single mother, there was no planning for the future, it was more on a month-to-month expenditure pattern,"" Kharas said. ""As I am now a retired person and do not have any source of income I am completely dependent on my investments to meet my monthly and other expenses.""

Kharas said she has invested in various mutual funds that are well spread over 4-5 different asset management companies. ""My financial advisor has carefully charted my investments to ensure that I have sufficient funds to be independent till the age of 80,"" she added. ""It was definitely difficult to handle Zarine's case because she had come pretty late, so the portfolio was very risky and I had to strike the right balance between safety and growth,"" said Priya Sunder, director and co-founder at Bengaluru-based Peak Alpha Investment Services Pvt. Ltd.

""It was a situation where we could not have gone wrong and at the same time it was difficult to generate income,"" Sunder added. Kharas' financial planner had to create a portfolio that would generate additional income.

""Kharas is also going to move to Australia soon so the planning had to be done keeping that as a short term goal; then also considering her properties and investments back in India we had to analyse all situations -- if she sold them, held on to them or if markets went bad along with a backup plan,"" Sunder said. A lot of Kharas' capital had eroded on account of mismanagement by the investment bank, which was a hit she was not prepared for, said Sunder. The investment bank had invested in single stocks which were mismanaged, leading to a steep fall. ""Too much trust laid with the investment bank that solely managed her corpus can also be counted as a mistake,"" said Sunder.

""As Kharas is moving to Australia, we had to create a corpus that would support her going ahead in life, reducing dependence on her children,"" she said. Kharas' investments include ultra short-term funds for her move to Australia and a couple of equity funds for long-term investments that would help her beat inflation, Sunder added."

BY SUNEEL KOUL

At a time when large swathes of East Africa, middle east, parts of eastern Europe & parts of central Asia continue to battle acute poverty, malnutrition, lack of basic health care, primary education, communicable diseases, immigration & closed borders, UN authority & role in mitigating such sufferings & inhuman conditions is under a cloud. Looking at such plight & abject neglect by powers to be including the holy cow called UN, one can't but help laugh at the innocuous interventions by the top body on insignificant matters involving two countries.

So when a pliable officer at the highest seat of world peace & harmony refers to some sort of an investigation into a non-existent issue, the very authority, respect & sanctity of the institution comes into the cross hairs of an otherwise avoidable discussion & debate. What also becomes unpalatable & uncharitable is the unilateral, biased view & opinion about a hitherto bilateral issue at a time when the whole world is sick & tired of the shenanigans of a state that sponsors global terror. It is a different question that India has been shouting from every pedestal, every forum & every responsible platform to the outside world on the consequences of turning a blind eye to this menace that has gripped humanity in its vicious tentacles. Sad that it took a 11/9 for the world & UN to see what India has been a victim of for decades now. Pakistan's track record of using instrument of terror as its state policy is anything but an open secret

UN must be exasperated with events in Afghanistan & Pakistan as a interminable vortex of terror. So it becomes laughable & a point to ponder when an odd call or a careless reference to non-existent issues like Kashmir which at best is a bilateral issue between India & Pakistan is raised by the very authority mandated to usher in sanity & restore humanity from being vandalised by rogue forces like Pakistan. To put things in perspective, there have been innumerable dialogues, debates, bilateral & subsequent resolutions & joint statements adopted that give India a legitimate right to whole of Jammu & Kashmir. Our parliament has passed a resolution to this effect in 1996. So does the Shimla accord between two countries, the Lahore declaration as many other interjections sealed this issue for ever? UNMOGIP has lost its relevance in as far as it was only supposed to be an observer group overseeing the cease fire of 1948 post J &K's accession to India.

It is of very little significance then what a former UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein had to say of an investigation of human rights violation in Kashmir. History is not kind to those who are motivated more by personal beliefs & agendas & whose utterances can be as prejudiced as broad daylight. India very righty has termed this statement highly objectionable & an unnecessary overreach by the UN of its charter of responsibilities concerning a bilateral issue. If anything UN is under a severe & solemn duty & obligation to world at large to redirect its focus on the terror havens & sanctuaries thriving in Pakistan that has heaped unending misery to humanity perpetrated deaths & disaster across the globe including 11/9 & Afghanistan. It may also be a matter of record at UN that the worlds' most dreaded terrorist Osama Bin Laden was captured from a highly fortified military colony of Abbottabad by the US seals in a daring pre-dawn operation. UN would also be seized of the inhuman & barbaric acts of violence against women including Nobel Laureate Malala Yousuf zai, the ethnic cleansing of Hindus from Kashmir, Baluchis from Baluchistan as well as the atrocities perpetrated by militant organisations & fundamentalist forces across the globe. Every investigation, every act of terror including one on 26/11 in Mumbai have found their origin to Pakistan & its ISI in cahoots with the army.

Hopefully the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres must have reiterated all such brazen facts in his conversation with Imran Khan, the Pakistan PM, who it is said had a telephonic conversation with him recently. UN secy. general must also have sought a report on POK where persecution & discrimination on the basis of caste, religion & tribe continue to expose its dubious character. It is also expected that Guettres would have raised the issue of Mumbai terror attack & its mastermind Hafiz Saeed, a UN proscribed terrorist, accorded state patronage by Pakistan.

While we find it normal for heads of state to have a conversation with UN chief once in a while, it would be a sham, were these calls to emanate from the territory that is infested lock, stock & barrel with anti-humanity elements. Those who are hell bent upon disturbing word peace & order; A state that has abdicated its sovereign responsibility & a pledge to the UN, as a signatory to maintaining peaceful & cordial relations with all other member states & not letting its territory to be used for launching terror attacks across oceans, mountains & borders. UN would do well to rein in the behemoth, the terror factory called Pakistan if it were to look at any semblance of peace in Afghanistan & the rest of the world.

It is time India put all its cards on the table & let UN know of its deep dismay, disgust & frustration with its unsolicited, uncalled for observations that raise more questions than answers about UN & its role as a genuine watchdog & not a partisan group or a cozy club of few, or for that matter a platform which errs on the side of caution & counsel. It is also time that India either ignored such mischief mongering by Pakistan which is nothing but a part of their state doctrine to take the attention away from its own domestic rumblings, whenever it found under the debris of deceit & falsehood or go hammer & tongs in its diplomatic, economic & political isolation of the rogue country. We must not falter or tire getting the tag of a terror state to Pakistan.

It may be pertinent to mention that India has not ever found any need or desire to approach the group ever since its role & responsibility has ceased & been nullified in a sovereign country such as ours. It is only a matter a time before our government asks the UN to vacate any remnants of its physical existence on our land.

It is sheer irony that while UNMOGIP acknowledges the intrusion by Pakistani troops disguised as tribesmen into Kashmir soon after Independence as a covert operation to forcefully occupy this territory; it fails to recall its own observation of such a monstrous fact in any of its dossiers on Kashmir. As reiterated earlier, India finds UNMOGIP a colossal waste of resources & time more so in the aftermath of various bilateral accords & agreements like the one signed in Shimla in 1971 by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and then President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto stipulating that Kashmir was a bilateral issue with no role for third parties."

The test was held for Class VIII students and over 20,000 students of municipal schools in Surat appeared in the Test conducted in different schools in morning and afternoon shifts.

SMSB sources said the 50-mark exam had 20 multiple choice questions for 2 marks each and a descriptive question that asked students to name the five best works done by the central government carried 10 marks.

A copy of the question paper accessed by The Indian Express shows that students were asked questions about various schemes launched by the BJP-led government at the Centre. Some of the questions were -- To which department Jan Dhan Scheme is related, When is Shushashan Day (National Governance Day) celebrated, Udaan Scheme is related to which department, whose birthday is celebrated as Shushashan Day, what are the facilities provided by the government under Ujwala scheme, the Kumbh Mela is to be organised in which city, on which river bank Statue of Unity is built, on which date the International Yoga Day celebrated, the full form of GST, among others.

The question papers were in Gujarati and Hindi languages.

The SMSB had a few days ago issued a circular to the principals of all 313 municipal schools in the city, asking them to conduct the General Knowledge test for Class VIII students. The exams were conducted between 9 am and 10 am, and 1.00 pm and 2.00 pm. They were given 40 minutes to complete the test.

Congress member in Surat Municipal Education Board Shafi Jariwala said, ""Now the BJP is playing with the brains of students by putting questions related to different schemes started by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We will not tolerate this and will protest. If a question paper is on General Knowledge, then there are many questions that can be asked.""

Surat Municipal Administrative Officer Vimal Desai could not be contacted despite several attempts.

But, reacting to the incident, chairman of Surat Municipal Education Board Hasmukh Patel said, ""The purpose of the GK Test is that we want to check how much our students know about the central government schemes. The second reason is that in the municipal schools majority of the students come from poor backgrounds. We wanted to make them aware of the government schemes so they can avail benefits.""

""The OMR answer sheets will be checked by schools supervisors who have been supplied with answer keys. We will start a drive in schools where maximum numbers of students fail the test, and make them aware of the central government schemes. The reason for conducting the test for Class VIII is that from next year they will switch over to other schools so they should know about different government schemes.""

He added, ""We will conduct such exams for students of other standards soon and questions will be asked depending on their capabilities, even if the Congress opposes or protests."""

In Bidhnoo's Guru Ka Purwa village in Kanpur district, around 50 cows had been locked inside the school by farmers late Sunday evening as the animals had been destroying their crop.

Cattle menace is growing and as Ruby Devi, village head of Guru Ka Purwa, said, ""These animals give us sleepless nights and are destroying our crops. Many of us have fallen ill in the extremely harsh cold weather simply standing guard over farms. The district administration has not taken any action in the matter.""

The farmers refused to let the cows free and allow school to run in a desperate protest to gain administration's attention to deal with the stray cattle problem. This was the third incident reported from the region in the past few days. On December 27, cattle had replaced students in classrooms in Ghanshyampur Katra of Sachendi area in the district. The same day, villagers also locked up stray cows in a police outpost in Bharthana area of Etawah.

Devi said, ""I tried to convince the farmers but they refused to unlock the school. They said they will continue to lock the animals in government buildings -- hospitals and even police stations till authorities find a permanent solution to the menace of stray cattle.

What emerges is that systemic violence and discrimination against women, especially in rural areas, runs deep, and goes beyond just the sexual.

Bundelkhand, as of late 2018, is poor, dry and stuck in a paralysis of governance, far from the 'feel good' narratives that most state-sponsored PR and blindsided patriotism seems buoyed by. Things are not getting better here, but things are also not the same. Cheap internet connections and smartphones are aglow in villages that dot the barren ghats. Women are at work, 'lower castes' are in public spaces, changing and redefining them. Large bribes are paid so that the women of the family can be teachers and nurses, earning hefty permanent salaries, and supporting unemployed male members.

But what of the dark lining below these stories of social and economic change? What does the workplace look like for these women who are resetting centuries of gender, class and caste oppression? Can they speak truth to power as we hear women in other places speaking? Or is silence a small price for the slow-moving liberties that they have gained? What shape can #MeToo take here?

I. Rajkumari*, 25, Journalist

The editorial structure of the media here is shaped like an inverted pyramid, with the number of paid editorial staff reducing to a pinpoint as you go lower and deeper into up country or rural locations, and where advertising revenues are slim. Large media corporations may have stringers, who, since they are not on the payroll, work for multiple organisations, and double as advertising agents with revenue targets and hefty commissions. In this game of mobility, networking, insecure finances, blackmail and political and administrative power brokering, women are rarely seen or heard. The ones who are, are treated with some curiosity and a lot of lewd relish.

Her Story

He made it impossible for me to go to the administrative offices.

Everyone was under his thumb.

No one would speak to me.

I stopped reporting.

Rajkumari never finished school, and in her late teens when she had the opportunity to be trained as a professional journalist, she took it. A Dalit, her family has had few avenues of livelihood, and there were many sisters to support. Rajkumari began working as a reporter. After her marriage, her marital family wasn't supportive of her 'gallivanting about' at unpredictable hours, and so she had to leave.

Years of economic and domestic strife later, she pleaded her way back to journalism. She began to work in the Ajaygarh block of Panna district in Madhya Pradesh, a short bus ride across the border from her village in Banda. Rajkumari saw no other women reporting, as she began to establish herself in her new beat, familiarising herself with villages, panchayat level workers and local influencers. When she went to the block office to question a few relevant officials on her first lot of stories, she was accompanied by a colleague, a senior reporter. It was clear immediately that the block office was controlled by one man, Ram Milan Pande, the Block Pramukh. (The Block Pramukh is the highest level of elected official at the block level.) Panchayat elections are both overtly and implicitly political, and Pande was a longstanding Congressman, with strong influence in the region. He had ambitions of running for an MLA position, in the upcoming Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, and he saw Rajkumari, a young, confident and mobile woman in the area, as a creative tool for campaigning. ""He was pretty friendly and quite aged, must have been more than 50 years old,"" Rajkumari's colleague Rajni told us.

In the weeks after, as Rajkumari began to report independently, she was a frequent visitor to the block headquarters. This was when Pande 'started sharing things with Rajkumari to win her confidence'. Well aware that this was par for the course, she suffered Pande's overtures just to get her stories done. But then, one morning in July this year, at the block to interview Pande for a story, Rajkumari's repeated requests were ignored. There was a meeting on she was told, and many officials from the block were present. Pande dealt with the issues at hand, and slowly, the room emptied out, leaving Rajkumari alone with him. He asked her to wait, have tea, he wanted to speak to her about something. He said he would pay for her fuel costs, and she should do some campaigning for him in the block. When she backed away, he grabbed her hand and said,""Not a leaf in this area moves without me. I'll have your newspaper shut down.""

Rajkumari left the office.

In the weeks that passed, she wasn't entertained by any official in the block, none of her requests for interviews or bytes were acknowledged. She slowly stopped reporting in the area.

Within a month, citing domestic reasons, Rajkumari left work again.

II. Seema*, 25, lawyer and activist

Dalit politics in Uttar Pradesh has been a dirty, petty thing, resulting in deep and complex shifts in caste dynamics and social structures in the region over the last three decades. One important historical factor was the establishment of the Bahujan Samaj party in 1984 by Kanshiram, and its mobilisation in Uttar Pradesh. Kanshiram's successor, Mayawati, played a key role in the grassroots mobilisation and spread of an empowering Dalit politics in the state. Increasing political awareness worked alongside policies (including affirmative action for 'other backward castes') that benefited the 'lower' castes in Uttar Pradesh, significantly differently from other north Indian states. Youth in Uttar Pradesh have grown up in this atmosphere of political and social opportunism and opportunity, both frustrated and buoyed at the promises of political emancipation, as well as disappointed by the poverty and unemployment that deep-rooted gender and caste based discrimination still has them trapped in.

Her Story

If I say that I was wrong, people will say I brought it on myself, through my own actions.

I can't name people in the party (BSP) who have abused me. It will give the party a bad name. But many have. They've posted abuse on Facebook, photos and comments. If they see this Dalit girl stepping beyond her boundaries, they do everything they can to pull you down.

Seema was married at 13, in a village that was shadowed by the threat of the notorious 'Babli Kol daku' of Bundelkhand. She is Dalit, and like many Dalit parents, hers brought her up to value education above anything else. She studied even after she was married, and despite resistance from her in-laws, got a job in the labour department in Chitrakoot. Her friendship with a distant relative proved to be a lifelong trauma for Seema, as the boy, observant of her ambitions and perseverance, took photos and posted them online, in the early days of Facebook, resulting in public shame and the end of Seema's marriage. He would call her from different numbers, blackmail her, even come to her home and abuse her. Work became more and more important for Seema to survive both personal strife and economic upheaval,""When I have scars, I lie and say I fell from the roof. Even though everyone in my mohalla knows I'm being harassed and abused, everyone knows I'm being used. Now if he says something or does something, I won't stay quiet. I will fight back. If I don't fight, what hope is there for the next generation? Even though I feel that I'm so aware, I've had to bear so much.""

Meera lives in the district headquarters now, and has been studying law and running her own practice in the district court in Chitrakoot. Over the years, to cope with public and domestic abuse, she has networked with women's groups, political parties and bureaucracy, to help her along the thorny path of a Dalit woman trying to get by in the world. The more mobile and aware she is, the more the forces seem to close-in to throttle her. The district court in Karwi, Chitrakoot, is a sea of upper caste men fighting to maintain the status quo, and make a quick buck as and when they can. ""You know how it is, when you should charge 50, they charge 100; when they should charge 500, they charge a 1000,"" she says. Enter Seema, young, slight, Dalit, smart and articulate.""When I go into the courts, and see women testifying about rape, and see what questions and comments they have to face, the filthy abuse, so loud and aggressive, I understand how someone would be driven to say, it didn't happen, I wasn't raped, I've filed a false case - even if that is entirely untrue. I've seen this happen.""

Last year, her Facebook account was hacked and controversial videos and posts were circulated from it, causing her great stress and public shame.""They plant their people in cyber cafes to watch which Dalit girls are coming and what their Facebook IDs are. And then they post objectionable videos and photos from your accounts. I couldn't eat for days, I was terrified my parents would find out, and commit suicide. But if you work in an office, you have to compromise. People will say, 'Bring us tea, if we come to your home, won't you serve us tea?' And you ignore them, else, how will you feed your children?""

Even as a politically conscious and mobile young woman, Meera is not enough for the forces of gender, caste and feudal power that conspire to hold her down in the world.

III. Susheela*, 53, Auxillary Nurse Midwife

The Auxillary Nurse Midwife or ANM is a permanent or contractual government health worker located in a village level sub-centre. She is responsible for catering to the basic healthcare needs as well as childbirth for a population of 5000. The ANM is a salaried worker, and has a joint account with the village pradhan, into which she receives a fund of Rs 10,000, for various equipment or tasks. The job of an ANM is a prestigious one. It also involves being beholden to a network of village and block level officials, health department staff and politicians. The ANM is crucial to the system of maternal and community healthcare, but is also a woman embroiled in the highly corrupt and chimerical world of local politics and bureaucracy.

Her Story

I was abused.

Let me tell you the story.

It was the 25th of September.

I was at the Panchayat Bhavan.

It's been four months, but every time I think of that incident and those people I become a mess.

It was evening, most people had left. I was waiting for my son to take me home.

My husband is dead, people know I am alone.

Susheela has worked as an ANM for the past 18 years in a remote area of Bundelkhand's Banda district, surrounded by mountains and forests, and regularly visited by dacoits.""You can go to any family in this area and ask about my credentials, if I have ever had a complaint against me,"" Susheela says. She does not stop weeping throughout our interview. Through her tears, Susheela explains the topography of her area of work, through the network of men she must 'work' with -- the sarpanch, local BJP leaders, the Chief Medical Officer, doctors, police superintendent, constables, and local thugs.

As a long-term government employee of the area, she is regularly asked to pay the pradhan ""for expenses of the party, I don't even know what the party is and what they want the money for"". The money that comes into her (joint) account, recently for sanitation tasks in the health centre, is paid to the pradhan. On the fateful evening she describes, Susheela was asking the pradhan to sign in her register to acknowledge she had given him the money -- Rs 8,000.""There were many people around, but I only recognised the three of them, the pradhan, his brother, and the (BJP) treasurer. They began to abuse me loudly, beat their chests. They grabbed my register and tore it, looked at me in a way that terrified me. So many people saw, but no one said a word. Isn't this molestation?""

Susheela went into shock, but later that evening, called the local police station.""They told me I should have dialled 100. I said I wasn't feeling well. Then I spoke to the CMO. Within a day, they had arranged to get me transferred. They don't want me creating trouble."" For months, Susheela resisted this transfer away from her family, her government housing and her familiar area -- at the age of 53.""They told me to go from one official to the other, one doctor to another -- each wants a cut. How can a woman be tormented like this? People ask me to pay them money, then circulate these rumours that I extract money from people. Ask anyone whether I ever did any wrong. The SP, DIG or the Mahila Aayog hasn't heard me out."" She went into a kind of trauma, still visible in her broken, rambling speech. She hasn't been paid a salary in four months, since the incident took place. She received death threats from the pradhan and his brother, and calls from the local police station -- ""Madam, thane mei aakar FIR kar dijiye"" -- calls she recognised as barely concealed threats if she didn't 'compromise'.""Why will I file a case? I need to live in this area. I want my posting cancelled.""

As of 19 December, her transfer has been nullified. She has been reinstated to the sub-centre where she has been working for 18 years, where she slowly adjusts to living in fear.""I haven't slept in four months. I feel like I should call the BJP (party workers, media) and kill myself in front of them.""

Bengaluru: In the mid-1920s, Messrs Steel Brothers and Co, London, found themselves facing an expensive problem.

A subsidiary, the Rawalpindi-based Attock Oil Company, was having trouble drilling for crude oil, as the thick, viscous agent used to prevent the leakage of oil into the drill bit kept solidifying.

Put in charge of fixing this problem was a 31-year-old scientist, who got to work at the Panjab University in Lahore and devised a solution: The viscosity of the fluid had to be reduced. He asked Attock to add acacia gum -- also called Indian gum, obtained from the sap of the acacia tree -- into the mixture, and the rest, as they say, is history.

Steel Brothers and Co was so pleased with the young scientist, Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar, that they offered him Rs 1.5 lakh, more than a fortune at the time, to research petroleum.

Bhatnagar declined, asking the company to give the money to the university instead so they could start research on petroleum.

Afterwards, astrophysicist Meghnad Saha wrote to Bhatnagar in praise of his initiative.

""India does not lack in men earning millions, but, if a few of those millionaires were guided by the fine example set by a comparatively poor teacher like yourself, I think her scientific and moral progress would have been rapid.""

This young scientist, who passed away on 1 January 1955, is today remembered as one of the early champions of science and technology in India who helped set up crucial infrastructure in Independent India for the pursuit of these fields.

Bhatnagar was born on 21 February 1894 in Bhera, in what is today Pakistan Punjab. His father passed away before his first birthday, and Bhatnagar was sent to live with his maternal grandfather, an engineer credited with inspiring an early interest in science in the child.

Bhatnagar did his schooling at the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic High School and enrolled for graduate studies at the then newly founded Dayal Singh College, Lahore, in 1911. He then joined the Forman Christian College, where he obtained a BSc in physics in 1916, and an MSc in chemistry in 1919.

Having received a scholarship from Dayal Singh College Trust to study abroad, Bhatnagar wanted to travel to the US. However, ships embarking from England for the US at the time were filled with American soldiers returning home after World War I. So he went to University of London instead, where he earned a Doctor of Science (a higher doctorate) degree in chemistry in 1921.

On his return to India, Bhatnagar, aged all of 27, joined the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) as a professor of chemistry.

He taught there for three years before taking up a job at the University of Panjab, Lahore, as a professor of physical chemistry and director of the university's chemical laboratories.

Anthropogenic or human-caused climate change was not a known concept in the early 20th century.

Until 1958, when atmospheric carbon dioxide was finally measured and found to be increasing, fossil fuels were where physics and chemistry research was at.

And Bhatnagar was among the leading lights of the field. Best known for making wax odourless, he also discovered how to make the kerosene flame taller and larger, thus helping multitudes of Indian households.

During World War II, Bhatnagar worked on innovations for the British army and Indian troops. He created the anti-gas cloth and developed plastic from waste, besides finding a way to use petroleum extraction byproducts in the oil industry.

He was also keen on magnetic chemistry. In 1928, he and friend K.N. Mathur developed the Bhatnagar-Mathur Magnetic Interference Balance, which was at the time considered to be one of the most sensitive instruments measuring magnetism and related properties. It was even exhibited at the Royal Society Soiree in the UK in 1931.

However, Bhatnagar was not a man of science alone and loved the performing arts, especially drama and poetry. While at Dayal Singh College, Lahore, he is said to have excelled as an actor. Later, he famously wrote a prize-winning one-act play in Urdu, Karamati. When at BHU, he wrote the university's song, the Kulgeet, which is sung to this day.

In 1940, Bhatnagar was appointed the director of the newly-formed Board of Scientific and Industrial Research, modelled on the British body by the same name.

The institution had an annual budget of Rs 5 lakh, but Bhatnagar wanted research to be better funded. When the government agreed to issue an annual grant of Rs 10 lakh for five years for industrial research, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) was established as an autonomous body in 1942.

By 1943, Bhatnagar had already established five national laboratories under its banner. Today, CSIR runs 38 laboratories. The institution's prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, awarded for excellence in the sciences, is a tribute to the first director-general of CSIR, who helped shape much of research in India today.

In 1934, he became one of the earliest fellows of the Indian Academy of Sciences. He was bestowed the Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1936, and knighted in 1941 for his contributions to science. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1943.

After Independence, Bhatnagar served as secretary in the ministry of education, and educational adviser for the government. He was an ardent proponent of industrial research, and his negotiations with the oil industry led to the establishment of a number of oil refineries in India.

The first chairman of the University Grants Commission, he also had stints as the president of the Indian Chemical Society, National Institute of Sciences of India (now known as the Indian National Science Academy), and the Indian Science Congress.

He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1954. Months later, Bhatnagar passed away unexpectedly on New Year's Day, 1955, due to a cardiac arrest. He was 60."

This is a list of ten articles that were read the most on The Wire in 2018. They were on topics as diverse as the depiction of women in Bollywood, media exposés, the PM's Research Fellowship and the realities of the education system in India. And they're worth revisiting on this last day of the year: for a snapshot of 2018's most popular preoccupations.

1. 'At The End of Your Magnum Opus... I Felt Reduced to a Vagina - Only'

In an open letter to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, actor Swara Bhaskar spelled out how his movie Padmaavat glorified Jauhar and Sati, and reduced women to simply being ""walking talking vaginas"". Condoning such practices at a time when 'honour' killings and the practice of Female Genital Mutilation only aid in propelling patriarchal, misogynist and problematic ideas is a mistake, she argues.

Practices like Sati, Jauhar, FGM, Honour Killings should not be glorified because they don't merely deny women equality, they deny women personhood. They deny women humanity. They deny women the right to life. And that is wrong. One would have assumed that in 2018, this is not a point that even needs to be made; but apparently, it does. Surely, you wouldn't consider making a film glorifying FGM or Honour Killings!

The context of art, any art is the time and place when it was created and consumed. And that's why this gang-rape infested India, this rape condoning mindset, this victim blaming society is the actual context of your film, Sir. Surely in this context, you could have offered some sort of a critique of Sati and Jauhar in your film?

2. Cobrapost Sting: Big Media Houses Say Yes to Hindutva, Black Money, Paid News

Second on the list is a deep dive into the Cobrapost exposé which revealed how some of the biggest names in the Indian media agreed to business proposals by an undercover reporter seeking the promotion of the Hindutva agenda.

For the sting, an undercover journalist, Pushp Sharma, posed as ""Acharya Atal"", a man who identified himself as a representative of an unnamed ""sangathan"", or organisation, but who gave the impression that he was a member of or close to the Nagpur-based Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).

The biggest name to be stung by Cobrapost was Times Group owner and managing director Vineet Jain. In a number of videotaped conversations, Jain and the group's executive president, Sanjeev Shah, can be seen and heard discussing the proposed deal in which Acharya Atal said he would pay Rs 500 crore in exchange for advertorials and events that that would be presented as programming on Krishna and the Bhagvad Gita but which would serve as a cover for Hindutva and its political agenda.

3. Why I Am Resigning From the BJP

In an open letter to the BJP, Shivam Shankar Singh, who worked on the BJP's election campaigns in the Northeast, broke down why he could not support the BJP any more even though he had believed Narendra Modi was a ray of hope in 2014.

Hindu khatre mein hai - they've ingrained it into the minds of people that Hindus and Hinduism are in danger, and that Modi is the only option to save ourselves. In reality Hindus have been living the same lives much before this government and nothing has changed except people's mindset. Were we Hindus in danger in 2007? At least I didn't hear about it everyday and I see no improvement in the condition of Hindus, just more fear mongering and hatred.

Speak against the government and you're anti-national and more recently, anti-Hindu. Legitimate criticism of the government is shut up with this labelling. Prove your nationalism, sing Vande Mataram everywhere (even though BJP leaders don't know the words themselves, they'll force you to sing it!). I'm a proud nationalist and my nationalism won't allow me to let anyone force me to showcase it. I will sing the national anthem and national song with pride when the occasion calls for it, or when I feel like it, but I won't let anyone force me to sing it based on their whims.

4. With Ministers Like These, Every Day Must Be Science Day

There's a lot that India can do to improve the cause of science within its borders and but doesn't because of the way it thinks about the subject. Perhaps the most notable example is Science Day itself - one day reserved to celebrating science when in fact that should be every day. Its historical basis doesn't inspire much confidence either.

We're not faced with a group of ministers bungling their jobs but a group that knows exactly what it's doing: angle for what they say is the 'national interest', and force everything else to tag along. By cornering our reasons to celebrate science into the confines of a single workday, we're at risk of abetting what our ministers are doing: abdicating responsibilities towards science on other days.

... Science is an everyday endeavour; celebrate it, scrutinise it, share it, demand it on every day of the year. Just the same way marking 'Earth Hour' is doing nothing to help Earth if you're not going to have environmentally conscious daily routines, you might as well not mark 'Science Day' if you're going to mark it on just one day.

5. Why Modi Walked Out in 2007 and the BJP Now Shuns Me

In the fifth spot is an excerpt from Karan Thapar's book Devil's Advocate: The Untold Story that told the complete tale of his infamous interview with Narendra Modi in 2007 where the future prime minister ended the interview abruptly when Thapar raised questions about the 2002 Gujarat riots.

'Why can't you say that you regret the killings that happened? Why can't you say maybe the government should have done more to protect Muslims?'

'What I have to say I have said at that time, and you can find out my statements.'

'Just say it again.'

'Not necessary I have to talk about in 2007 everything you want to talk about.'

'But by not saying it again, by not letting people hear the message repeatedly, you are allowing an image that is contrary to the interest of Gujarat to continue. It's in your hands to change it.'

Right through the two or three minutes this exchange lasted, Narendra Modi's face remained expressionless. But it was also clear he wasn't happy. His eyes were cold and hard. Perhaps he was making an effort to keep his face calm and steady. But now his patience or, perhaps, his resolve snapped. He had had enough and ended the interview. With the words 'I have to rest. I need some water' he started to take the microphone off.

6. Exclusive: Punya Prasun Bajpai Reveals the Story Behind His Exit From ABP News

In an explosive exclusive in August, former ABP News anchor Punya Prasun Bajpai wrote about the circumstances of his departure from the channel and the official diktats which preceded it.

Say, a channel does not confine itself to showing the Modi regime in a positive light at all times but occasionally includes stories with a negative tone or, on the basis of facts, shows the Modi government's truth to be a lie. Immediately, BJP spokespersons are told to stop appearing on those channels; that is, they do not participate in any political discussion conducted by that channel.

This started happening on ABP News from the last week of June this year - BJP spokespersons stopped appearing on its debates. A few days later, BJP leaders stopped giving bytes to the channel. The day the truth of the Prime Minister's 'Mann ki Baat' was outed on Masterstroke, RSS ideologues too were told to stay off the channel.

7. IAS Officer Being 'Taught a Lesson' for Taking on Modi, Says Family

At the seventh position is a story by Gaurav Vivek Bhatnagar that blew the lid off the harassment faced by an IAS officer in Gujarat for having acted against Narendra Modi.

IAS officer Pradeep Sharma spent another day in Sabarmati central jail in Ahmedabad on Friday even as his son is getting married in the United States since a special anti-corruption court in Bhavnagar on March 27 denied him bail - both regular as well as temporary for a week - to view his son's wedding from India via a video link, and the high court too refused an urgent hearing in the matter.

A close relative of Sharma insisted that the family was clear in its mind that Pradeep Sharma - who has seen 10 FIRs being filed against him over the last eight years - has suffered all these years ""because of that girl"" who is at the centre of what has come to be known as the Snoopgate scandal.

8. Can't Find 'Vikas' or #AccheDin? Check Narendra Modi's Twitter Timeline

Next is Karnika Kohli's unravelling of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Twitter feed and his conspicuous silences on issues that took the country by storm.

Like Manmohan Singh, Modi the prime minister has remained conspicuously quiet about issues that make his government look bad. While he is quick to wish his foreign counterparts on their birthdays - and express condolences after minor attacks in their countries - Akhlaq's brutal lynching, people who lost their lives waiting in queues after demonetisation, cow vigilantism, the Una lynching, the brutal rapes in Kathua and Unnao and many other incidents didn't make the cut.

Predictably, the prime minister has maintained a stoic silence on the police firing in which 12 people protesting the Sterlite unit in Thoothukudi were killed on May 22. People in the coastal Tamil Nadu town have been protesting for over 100 days, claiming that the unit is polluting the environment and has resulted in illnesses.

9. One Year On, the PM's Research Fellowship Is off to a Sputtering Start

The first year of the PM's Research Fellowship, already much criticised for severe conceptual issues, didn't help its cause. The MHRD awarded only 135 scholars with the fellowship out of a promised 1,000 and didn't clarify how the money allocated for the unselected 865 would be used. Together with a host of other issues, this only strengthens the impression that the government wanted to rebut in the first place: that the PMRF has been ""designed to pile privilege on privilege"".

The 1,800 students who applied from this pool of candidates were those who had already cleared many levels of implicit selection. An analysis of the student composition of IITs shows that not all economic and social backgrounds have equal representation in these elite institutions. There is a whole chain of filters based on economic and caste status, quality of schooling, the ability to afford the coaching required to clear the various entrance exams, and the ability to pay the prohibitively expensive fees that several of these institutes charge - along with hostel fees, mess fees and peer-pressured booze and pizza fees, which introduce inequality in the opportunity available to Indian students to avail a world-class education. It is only a half-joke that the IISc is often called the ""Iyer-Iyengar Institute of Science"".

10. A Sick Society That Manufactures Failures - the True Face of Education in India

In a scathing attack on the education system in India and how it destroys young minds, Avijit Pathak defines why the idea of 'success' has failed students.

Anyone familiar with school education in India knows how parents and teachers pressurise children to opt for science/commerce even if they are not inclined to it. In fact, many of them are never given the space to look at themselves, and understand their unique traits and aptitudes. This is the beginning of alienation in the child's life. This alienation is further intensified when the societal pressure restricts their imagination, and forces them to believe that life is necessarily dark and bleak without medical science/engineering/management.

In this reckless preparation for 'success' their alienated selves find no joy, no ecstasy; coaching centres have no humour, guide books are devoid of creative imagination, 'success mantras' require war strategies, not the spirit of wonder, and the joy of learning is replaced by the neurotic urge to be a 'topper'.

However, this 'success', as I wish to argue, has its own discontents. The reason is that, for most of them, it is an immensely alienating experience. It kills one's creativity; it makes one one-dimensional; it robs one of the spirit of positive life-energy."

Is it easy to review a film? Maybe, it is -- in case you put out a tweet or write a post on Facebook. But, certainly, it is not easy to reason out properly why you don't like a film. Maybe, that's why, they say, a critic's job isn't easy.

Every year has its good and bad films, but it takes a special quality to be both good and bad at the same time. I am talking about films that were made sincerely, yet fail on every level -- and are hilarious -- as a result. Here are such films that are so bad, they are good.

Evanukku Engeyo Matcham Irukku

Yeah, we all cringe while saying that title aloud that loosely translates into ""he has a mole somewhere"". Yes, I know what are you thinking now. A few laughs here and there does not rescue this never-ending-stale-drag fest. A word of caution to filmmakers like Mukesh: don't make a f***-all movie in the name of an 'adult comedy', please!

Sei

A group of wannabe filmmakers try to find a script so that they can make a film. What do they do? They pitch in a ""Baahubali-like"" story and an ""Enthiran-like"" story to a producer. Unsatisfied, the producer wants them to think of 'a novel idea', and even suggests that they find an ""interesting character"". This aspiring woman director tracks down one such ""interesting character"" and pursues him. But hey, did that group of filmmakers finally make a film? God only knows. Sei means 'do'. Guess what? The film did nothing.

Billa Pandi

Advertising

The film revolves around the life of an avid Ajith Kumar fan who mouths loud-annoying lines like, ""Thala rasigan-na uyira kudukka dhaan theriyum, uyira eduka theriyadhu"". I wonder how the makers, first of all, chose to release Billa Pandi for Diwali -- considering the amount of toxic masculinity it had. According to the director Raj Sethupathy, a widow is a ""bad omen"". Also, there is another reference of a prospective bride being compared with ""fresh bondas"". Seriously?

Genius

Susienthiran's protagonist Dinesh Kumar (Roshan) is diagnosed with schizophrenia. And he is taken to a 'massage parlour' to 'cure' his illness. The film actually sets out to discuss the current-day education system and the adverse effects of pressurising a child to score well. Leave everything apart. I still remember how Priscilla was pronounced with a 'K' instead of a 'C'. Horrible. The film is anything but its title!

Saamy Square

Just imagine a star like Vikram saying things like, ""Naan saamy illa... bootham"" with his beefed-up muscles stretch. Again, just imagine when he accidentally brushes against a police uniform, he thinks of his father, Aaruchaamy and gets some transformative vibes. He wants to become an IAS officer but ends up a cop because of 'poorva jenma' connection and all that. I didn't visit the theaters to see 'Anniyan' in Saamy Square. Enough said.

Seemaraja

There is this line in 'Vaaren' song that goes ""Aracha maava arachaalum... adhukku venum oru thiramai"". (Even to 'recycle' things, you need talent). This totally sums up the Sivakarthikeyan-starrer. The film was problematic on multiple levels. You get a boring flashback portion, besides a subplot that discusses farmers' issues. Yawn. Soori calls his wife -- Jil, Jung and Juk. He has forgotten their real names because they're too tough to recall. Enough of the objectification? Still not. There is another scene where a fat woman comes running to the stage, and we hear the sound of an elephant's trumpet in the background. Director Ponram thinks all this is funny.

Mohini

Trisha plays a double role -- Mohini and Vaishnavi -- in this film. A spirit takes revenge on others by entering into the body of its lookalike. Naturally, double-trouble. The story is a rehash of your typical horror film template that becomes very predictable starting from scratch. Mohini, like Nayaki, is a film that will make you feel why someone like Trisha should even attempt after being in the industry for close to 16 years.

Sema

This is also on the lines of Trisha Illana Nayanthara, Bruce Lee and Kadavul Irukaan Kumaru. Kuzhanthai (GV Prakash) thinks it is okay to stalk a girl. When she doesn't give in, he even says, ""Bhoomi suthinadha vida, pasanga ponnungala jaasthi suthirkaanga."" Despite having strong comedians on board like Kovai Sarala, Mansoor Ali Khan and Yogi Babu, the end product isn't all that impressive.

Kaali

An Indian-based doctor in the US learns that he is adopted and decides to come to India to trace his roots and biological parents. This search forms the narrative of the Vijay Antony-starrer. The film, directed by Kiruthiga Udhayanidhi, is failed by execution and has several loopholes in the plot. The premise of Kaali is bizarre and outdated at the same time. As an actor, Vijay Antony barely shows any nuance in emotions or action. And this plays to his disadvantage on the whole.

Iruttu Arayil Murattu Kuthu (IAMK)

If a film comes with the 'A' certificate in Tamil cinema, it means it has the 'license' to say and show anything on the screen. The four friends stay at a beachside bungalow, and they eventually realise the house is haunted by a ghost with an insatiable sex drive. Laced with crass objectification of women, double entendre dialogues, lewd gestures and gags, IAMK becomes a butt of jokes especially post-interval. The film also engages in homophobia, and the lead characters often constantly shame a character for being a gay person.

Pakka

The film follows the '80s loud commercial template -- a larger-than-life hero, two sidekicks, ample sentiments, songs and a few fights. It is hard to decide what genre Pakka belongs to (there's lot of very lazy writing involved), but for sure, it is not an entertainer. We keep waiting for something to happen. But there is really nothing. Why, for that matter, is this film called Pakka? There is no answer.

Diya

Director Vijay has tried to make the audience feel what the loss of an unborn is like. But how does an aborted foetus turn into a ghost? There is no clear answer as to why baby Diya decides to take revenge on her parents five years after the abortion. Vijay puts out a message at the end of the film that reads, ""What if those foetuses had grown up to be Abdul Kalams and Indira Gandhis?"" One minute silence for that sentence. As a woman, I can't buy this idea of making someone guilty of their decision -- to not have a baby. Well, the couple could have opted for an abortion because they weren't equipped enough to handle a baby. No, the director doesn't seem to talk about the value of one's life logically.

Nagesh Thiraiyarangam

Horror films, as a genre, evoke extreme responses -- you either love them or hate them. But what is bothering me of late, is the attempt to 'normalise' misogynistic practices in films to get the desired tone of the film. For instance, Nagesh Thiraiyarangam has lines like ""Aandavan ponnungalukku azhaga kudutha maadhiri, aambalaingalukku ariva kuduthurkaan."" It makes me sad and disappointed to see how films are made by people who seldom care about objectifying women again and again. The story revolves around a real estate builder, who wants to sell his father's old property, a movie theater, but finds that the building is possessed by a ghost. The film has a tiring flashback and a confusing screenplay.

Kalakalappu 2

Sundar C has this habit of thinking a catchy title and then spinning a story around it. Kalakalappu 2 certainly looked more colourful than the original, but that is not simply enough for a good premise. After taking us through the core plot, the filmmaker keeps introducing us to newer sub-plots and more characters. This makes the storyline diluted. Being a franchise, the filmmaker had to explore the genesis of the main characters and trace back their relationship with each other at some point. But no, Sundar C doesn't do that. Kalakalappu 2 has all the lazy cliches intended to make the film appear manipulatively audience-friendly. There is nothing endearing about buffoonery which involves a group of grown men and women putting up a dud show.

Oru Nalla Naala Paathu Solren (ONNPS)

A convoluted narrative does not make a film different, and this was the problem with the Vijay Sethupathi-starrer. Oru Nalla Naala Paathu Solren is just another mindless fantasy film which neither entertains nor leaves you wanting for more. After 20 minutes into the story, you don't want to watch this pointless film anymore. Everything in ONNPS is an exaggeration to the power of ten. There is no logic. There is no magic although there are some insanely funny moments in between.

Sketch

Advertising

If I meet Vikram again, I would want to ask him what made him sign Sketch. Because the film feels too generic for a star like Vikram to have acted in it. In the film, masculinity is just defined by the ability to single-handedly fight a bunch of goons and Vikram's temper is applauded as a heroic quality. The story is all about hero-worshipping the protagonist, and nothing else. Sketch is a half-Bheema, half-Rajapattai and a bit of Gemini combined distastefully."

B.V.R. Mohan Reddy, executive chairman of CYIENT Limited explained, ""The growth and adoption of technologies in terms of machine learning, big data analytics and robotic process automation are making strong inroads not only in the traditional tech-assisted industries but also non-traditional tech-assisted industries.""

The biggest boost is being witnessed in blockchain which was originally thought to be an application in financial services and retail. But it has now found its way into agriculture, healthcare, governance and logistics where technology has opened new opportunities and also created an ease which was not seen before.

Aided by start-ups in developing new products in these undefined sectors and also creating service lines to improve efficiency, productivity and competence levels, technology is giving a new economic boost and also bringing about social equality.

Dr Sinubabu Gedela, chief executive officer of Omics International said, ""We are going to see a major boost in the business of health informatics, open access medical publishing and scientific data which is going to use the backend operations of IT in a big way.""

The education sector is going to see a boost in terms of machine learning, equipping teachers with technology and upgrading their technology skills which will change the dynamics of the industry.

Keeping this in mind, high-yielding toria varieties were introduced during 2014-15, besides high-yielding potato Kufri Pukhraj was introduced during 2015-16 by using scientific package of practices.

By the end of 2018-19, the toria varieties could be replicated to 150 hectares and Kufri Pukhraj variety replicated to 15 hectares. Further, more than 150 farm families were directly benefited from these two interventions.

Moreover, all these varieties were replicated to other nearby villages.

After shared transportation, services, and workspaces, it's the turn of shared living spaces to create disruptions, this time in the house rental market.

If the plans charted by Homestede Living, the co-living business of Warburg and Lemon Tree announced last week, are any indication, the concept of shared accommodation is going to take off in a big way. Homestede plans to offer 100,000 beds over the next year as it seeks to make inroads into a highly underpenetrated segment, Kapil Sharma, chief financial officer at Lemon Tree Hotels, told Business Standard.

The company is pinning its hope on 35 million students enrolled in graduate and post-graduate programmes and young working professionals who frequently migrate from one city to another and on a look out for a quality, hassle-free accommodation, said Sharma.

""This segment is highly under-penetrated. A steep capital cost and high rent has given birth the concept of share accommodation,"" he said, adding that Homestede was looking to have a pan-India presence, intending to build 100,000 beds over the next six years. This will include having a presence in all the major cities, including smaller ones like Kota in Rajasthan, which has emerged as a prominent education hub for producing excellent results in IIT-JEE and medical entrance exams over the past decade and a half.

Lemon Tree Hotels is the first hospitality firm to enter the segment. It has been the preserve of technology-based start-ups such as Nest Away, Zolo, CoHO, StayAbode, and SimplyGuest.

In October, SoftBank-backed OYO also entered the segment with OYO Living. Unlike most of the incumbents that have 5,000-10,000 beds, the scale at which Homestede will operate will be much larger, Sharma said.

An experience in the hospitality business, he said, would come handy in offering the desired quality experience at an affordable cost. Sharma is looking at a return of 14 to 15 per cent of the investment being made.

To start with, Homestede will have an asset light model - manage the existing properties and lease properties from real estate firms that have unutilised inventory.

In the next phase of expansion, it will also have greenfield properties. Depending on the location and the prevalent rent in a particular city, the charges will vary from Rs 15,000 a bed per month.

Homestede has also plans to tap into markets outside India in the next phase as Warburg Pincus is operating similar businesses in Hong Kong and China, said Sharma. Homestede is in talks with engineering and management institutes for a possible association.

Warburg announced a joint venture with Lemon Tree and a planned investment of Rs 3,000 crore into the business last week. While it will hold a 68 per cent stake in the venture, Lemon Tree will own 30 per cent. The remaining 2 per cent will be held by Lemon Tree Chairman Patanjali Keswani. The partners will initially invest Rs 1,500 crore in equity over a period of time and an additional equal infusion at the option of the partners to develop rental housing projects.

Earlier this month, Knight Frank India, an international property consultancy, launched a report that said 72 per cent millennials prefer co-living spaces and more than 55 per cent respondents in the age group of 18 - 35 years are willing to rent co-living spaces.

The survey also showed close to 40 per cent of all respondents are most comfortable in paying between Rs 1.2 lakh and Rs 1.8 lakh per annum towards rental housing in key cities of India. The sweet spot for rentals, thus, remains at a monthly outflow of Rs 10,000-15,000, it said."

When volunteers visited the wedding hall with social welfare officials, the mehendi ceremony was on.

The volunteers reasoned with the parents to call off the wedding. Then officials stepped in with a warning of the legal implications. The incident happened in Podanur, a favourite locale of the British and now a buzzing residential area in the city.

This was not a one-off incident of child marriage in an urban area. In November, Childline, the NGO that operates a 24x7 helpline for children, in Coimbatore stopped nine child marriage and half of them were in city limits.

There is a perception that child marriages are something that happen in the rural hinterland. But every third child marriage in Tamil Nadu is in an urban centre. A report by National Commission for Protection of Child Rights released in September says that 36.5% of child marriages are from urban areas of the state. TN ranks fourth among states with high urban child marriage rates. Goa tops the list with 77% of child marriages in the state happening in urban areas followed by Mizoram and Haryana.

""We have stopped a lot of child marriages within the city from places including Ramanathapuram, Irugur, Ondipudur and Athupalam,'' says S Umadevi, Coimbatore district coordinator of Childline.

Child rights activists say this trend started about 10 years ago, partly because of the influx of rural folk, who brought with them age-old customs. But even among urban populations this trend is picking up. While deep-rooted socio-cultural practices, matriarchal prejudices and economic factors drive parents in rural areas to marry off their daughters before the legal age, what prompts urban parents to marry off their minor children? Economic factors are key to urban child marriages. But equally, urban parents marry off their daughters early fearing they will fall in love with boys from different castes or that they will face sexual harassment, say activists who have counselled families.

Parents of Malathi (name changed) from Radha Nagar in Tirupur said they decided to marry off their daughter when she was studying in Class XI after they saw her speaking to a boy in 2015. ""We felt she would elope,"" said her father. But social welfare department officials intervened and stopped the marriage. After counselling, Malathi promised to pursue higher education. Now she is in the second year of her BCom course. ""In Chennai, we found most of the child marriages happen in the slums,'' says Girija Kumarababu, honorary general secretary of Indian Council for Child Welfare, Tamil Nadu.

""More than 90% of parents of child brides in Chennai say there is no protection for their daughters. When both parents are working, there is no supervision of children in slums where the tenements are so close to each other,'' she said. ICCW analysed 1,156 child marriages stopped in Chennai and found that poor economic conditions of the girl's family, concern for her safety and feat that she would have an affair were cited as reasons. There were instances of marriages planned with the consent of the minor, but in a large number of cases the child's consent was not obtained. ""Child marriage takes an emotional toll on the girl. Early pregnancy and child birth also have adverse effects on the health of mother and child,'' says a social welfare department officer.

In Tamil Nadu, a significant number of child marriages are reported in southern and western districts in rural and tribal areas. In villages, marrying within blood relatives is still prevalent, where a girl will be wedded to her maternal uncle. Caste and social status as well as bids to retain property within the family are reasons why parents force early marriages. But over the past decade, rural child marriages are coming down while the graph is rising in urban areas.

""Some 60% to 70 % of child marriages in urban areas are because of safety concerns. Parents feel protection mechanism is inadequate,'' said Andrew Sesuraj, state convener of Tamil Nadu Child Rights Observatory. Activists say a multi-pronged approach should be adopted to curb child marriage. A close watch and timely action is imperative, but long term action such as building awareness on the health implications of early marriage, which results in immediate pregnancy and financial burden, should be carried out, say activists."

Speculation is rife in the corridors of power that state Chief Secretary Dinesh Kumar Jain, who is set to retire next month, is under consideration for the position of an election commissioner with the Central Election Commission.

Jain, whose family is based in Delhi, is also understood to be keen on landing the prestigious assignment. Sources, meanwhile, said that the much-awaited major transfer in the state's senior bureaucracy may well be deferred till Jain's fate is revealed. A section in the government is pushing for a three-month extension for Jain as Chief Secretary.

On Hold

What's brewing in the state's excise department? According to sources, a controversial move of revalidating 205 liquor permits, which were found to have been irregularly allotted between 2010 and 2016, has been put on hold. While Excise Minister Chandrasekhar Bawankule had conducted fresh hearings for these cases in October itself, senior department bureaucrats have raised questions over the validity of this review exercise.

Retirement Perk

Three months after his retirement, former medical education department secretary Sanjay Deshmukh, a 1998 batch IAS officer, has landed a post-retirement assignment. Deshmukh has been appointed as Chairperson of the Energy Vigilance Committee of the MSEB Holding Company Ltd. The post had fallen vacant after incumbent P R Baviskar, also a retired IAS officer from the West Bengal cadre, stepped down citing personal reasons.

Promotion Time

Advertising

It is that time of the year when promotions are handed out to police personnel. In the IPS cadre, sources said this time officers belonging to the 1994 batch are eligible for promotion to Additional Director General (ADG) rank. Mumbai's Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Deven Bharti is among those in line for promotion. Others include Ashutosh Dumbare, Dr Sukhwinder Singh, Anup Kumar, Vineet Agarwal and Ramanand Bharma. Meanwhile, IPS officers belonging to the 2001 batch are eligible for promotion to Inspector General of Police rank.

Scoring A Home Run

Politicians are not the only ones who are reluctant to give up perks of office, especially spacious government accommodations, long after they have demitted office. Tales abound in the corridors of power on how several retired bureaucrats, including some who haven't even been accommodated by the government in post-retirement positions, have clung onto official accommodations in violation of norms.

Lectured

This past week, a senior bureaucrat suffered the ignominy of being lectured by his senior in front of representatives of the Maratha Kranti Morcha. Sources said while the CMO had directed the MKM representatives to meet the bureaucrat, he'd left his office leaving them waiting. Objecting to this, they raised the matter with a senior official. The bureaucrat was then recalled and had to sit for the meeting.

Serving A Message

Eknath Khadse may be sulking, but the former minister hasn't lost his acerbic sense of humour. With the BJP leadership having to bear intense ribbing after the poll debacle in the heartland states, Khadse did not miss the opportunity to make himself heard. Eyebrows were raised when Khadse last week stated that permanent loyalty to a party cannot be taken for granted in politics, at a function where senior Congress leader Ulhas Patil publicly offered him support to switch over to his party."

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath recently directed the officials concerned to make immediate arrangements for proper care of stray cows. He also ordered clearing of grazing grounds in different parts of the state from encroachments. In Agra, police had to intervene in at least six cases to free cows locked in schools and public health centres. On Saturday, villagers locked up stray cows in a school in Garhi Bachchi. A day earlier, cattle were locked up inside a primary school at Arela village in Etmadpur tehsil. Officials of the Basic Education department had to intervene to get the premises vacated for children who had been forced to stay away from classes. Farmers rued that the bovines were destroying crops. ""Cows and bulls have become a huge nuisance, eating crops and destroying greenery,"" complained a farmer of Barauli Ahir block, Ramesh. (PTI)

Stalker dies after private parts chopped off in Maharashtra

Thane: A 27-year-old man from Maharashtra's Thane district whose private parts were allegedly chopped off by three persons, including a woman he was reportedly stalking, has died in a Mumbai hospital, police said Sunday. An official said that Tushar Pujare, a home loan adviser, was allegedly stalking a 42-year-old woman in the district's Manpada area and had also visited her home and told her husband about his infatuation. Pujare's brother, in his complaint to the police, said 15 days prior to the incident, the woman had warned Pujare of dire consequences if he did not stop his advances. On December 25, Pujare was called to Nandivli area of Dombivali by the accused on the pretext of arranging a home loan, the official said. ""Pujare was assaulted there and the woman chopped off his private parts with a knife. The woman rushed Pujare to a nearby hospital and then left from there,"" the official said. ""On Friday, at around 11pm, Pujare succumbed to his injuries in JJ Hospital in Byculla in Mumbai. We have added the charge of murder against the three accused,"" a police official said Sunday.

Later, in the evening, Yadav along with his three accomplices forcibly entered her house and badly beat her up."" ""They stripped off her clothes and made to run in the village.

The startup is also working on a Crypto Point of Sale System (cPos) and physical card-based system that would enable users to pay with a swipe of card or a tap of a button to purchase goods and services. Mittal hopes Ethx will have more than 5 million users in 2019 from the about 850,000 users they have garnered in the past seven months.

Ossus Biorenewables: Clean energy from waste water

This Bengaluru-based startup is developing solutions for clean, carbon-free, energy and recovery of green chemicals from waste water. They are doing so by using bH2 Plus -- a technology that employs specially-designed microbial cell factories to generate biohydrogen and metals from renewable feedstocks like industrial effluents, municipal sewage and polluted water bodies. The solution has the potential to be retro-fitted to storage tanks, effluent treatment plants or installed for the restoration of polluted rivers, lakes and other water bodies.

Founded by Suruchi Rao and Shanta Rao in 2017, Ossus Biorenewables is currently in the process of demonstrating the capability of their technology to generate value from the so-called ""produced water"" (water that oil and gas companies get as a by-product along with oil and gas). Ossus is currently working with upstream oil and gas companies like Shell and ONGC as part of their startup programmes, with the first pilot slated in Bengaluru. By early 2019, Ossus hopes to establish a base in the US too.

Language learning startup, Multibhashi uses technology to teach English and other Indian languages via cloud , streaming video, real time chat and gamification. MultiBhashi also undertakes customized services such as content localization and corporate training in vernacular languages for rural outreach and marketing businesses.

According to Anuradha Agarwal, founder, Multibhashi, ""We are committed to teaching job-related English communication skills to the next billion users coming online. We fully realize that a task of this scale can only be accomplished through technology."" The android app designed to impart English education not only provides self-paced learning content in the learner's mother tongue but also lets him/her virtually connect with a tutor who speaks his/her mother tongue and teaches English over a voice/video call. Agarwal also recently introduced a chat bot and voice bot inside the app. Additionally, they have started developing a community feature whereby people will be able to learn from each other by sharing their English-related problems, suggest solutions and even consume entertaining content in English, which will improve their comfort with the language.

Pushed into commercial sex work for no fault of theirs, a group of rescued minors pursue education without any hassle, thanks to the Mothers Committee, constituted by HELP-Girls Advocacy Alliance(GAA) here.

But this was not before the NGO partner of Childline India Foundation intervened and helped the girls, who were without any age proof, get the much-needed birth certificate insisted upon by school authorities for admission.

Those who took care of the rescued girls in the age group of eight to 12 ran from pillar to post for months as it proved to be a big challenge for them in getting the all-important document without knowing parentage of the children.

The NGO which works actively among survivors of human trafficking took up the matter with the Ongole Municipal Corporation, revenue officials at various levels and the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) for over a month. The sustained efforts paid dividend with the five of them joining a municipal school here and three others a private school close to their dwelling after the civic body issuing the certificate, says HELP Programme Officer B.V. Sagar. In the case of children of sex workers, they have a problem in declaring the name of father.

After due proceedings conducted by revenue officials from the level of Revenue Division Officer down to the Village Revenue Officer and based on declaration made in court, the girls were issued birth certificates, according to Ongole Municipal Commissioner S.Venkatakrishna.

Rehabilitation of girls forced into flesh trade continues to be a big challenge even now as compensation under Andhra Pradesh Victims Compensation Scheme is provided only in cases registered under IPC 376 (rape), HELP Director N.V.S. Rammohan says, while pleading for decriminalisation of sex work and survivor-centric approach.

Even those booked under Immoral Traffic Prevention Act should be provided compensation so that they could lead a reformed life. Families of rescued girls who were pushed into commercial sex work should be given livelihood support, he added."

Suneetha and her classmates at Government Higher Primary School at Madrahalli in T. Narsipur taluk of Mysuru district have been reciting English rhymes in the last fortnight as the day to present their newly acquired English talent is fast approaching.

The school in the tiny village has around 101 students and each one has to speak English with their teachers, friends, and students throughout the day on January 1, 2019. While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T. Narsipur model' across the State by training teachers through the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) and the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET), another senior officer said."

Connecting the dots

On December 13, the Kalaburagi police found two bodies in a public garden. One was not in a recognisable state. Police, searching the pockets of the dead man, found some pictures. Assuming that one of the photos found might be that of the deceased, they released the same in many Whatsapp groups and requested journalists to spread the word.

Within a few hours, the person in the picture, assumed dead, appeared in the station, hale and hearty, and declaring vehemently that he was alive and well. Police asked him whether he could identify the deceased, but he couldn't. Puzzled how his photo turned up in the dead man's pocket, the cops and the man tried to solve the mystery. The man guessed that the photograph was in his wife's vanity bag, which she had lost recently. The body remained unidentified.

A function for the maiden jayanti celebration of a saint was to be attended by many dignitaries, including ministers and legislators. The jayanti, after all, had just been added to the list of govt-sponsored celebrations. Scheduled to start at 10.30am, the event began two hours later, without the ministers' arrival. Disappointed, journalists learnt that there wasn't much to report on. Another group, who had no interest in being there, were also herded into the auditorium to ensure a quorum of some dignity -- the hapless students of nearby colleges!!

For the eyes only

Getting an interview with someone who is notorious for avoiding the media can be a way to get a good story. One such IAS officer I had been chasing for an appointment asked me to meet him at his office one day. I was thrilled. Once I reached his office, I sat before him and started hunting for my pen. He offered me his, but I politely told him that I had one. He waited, pen still proferred before me, till I finally pulled out a pen and said triumphantly, ""I found it!"" The officer, known for his serious nature, said, ""Ma'am, with your pen, you can only write on your eyes."" Looking down, I realised I was holding a kajal pencil!

An I-Day to remember

Covering Independence Day functions held by the government is considered easy as there is hardly any deviation from the usual protocol. This year, however, I chose to cover a different kind of event -- the flag hoisting ceremony at the government school for blind students in Tilaknagar, Mysuru. It was eye-opening. I went in expecting the same format of the event as that at countless other venues, only to see my notions getting blown to smithereens when the proceedings began. A teacher gave a running commentary of the events. When the flag was unfurled, he described how it fluttered and the flowers that fell out. The children cheered him and the flag. Four months later, the memory is still fresh in my mind.

Movie dialogue for elusive cop

Officials at the Police Commissioner's office in Bengaluru seem to have decided to talk to the media only after they get the nod from the top brass. Recently, this reporter wanted recent crime statistics for the year, and visited the City Crime Record Bureau. As usual, the answer was ""Please get permission from our senior officer"". And thus started a series of calls to the senior officer who didn't answer and nor was he in his office. After trying many times over a few days, this reporter sent a WhatsApp message to the officer: ""Aapko (with the officer's name) pakadna mushkil hi nahin, namunkin hai! (Catching you is not just tough, it is impossible!)"" This dialogue, from the movie Don, suffixed with a smiley, elicited an immediate response, ""Meet me in my office now!"" Relief, and finally, those elusive statistics.

Leopard prompts ODF drive

In March, I reported about a leopard being caught in a trap camera at Kappatgudda. The picture of the leopard, seen by several people living nearby, led them to decide to stop defecating in the open for a while. For nearly two months, the villagers chose to stay away from the fields and many took to saying ironically that the village was finally 'open defecation free'. Eventually, when the fear died down, some villagers even approached the forest officials, asking them to keep the news alive as it would help the village attain ODF status eventually.

Managers hungry for good reviews

Writing food reviews is not as easy as it seems. On my visit to some restaurants, the managers, chefs or PR bands insist on joining us at the table. What follows are some weird and awkward moments as one's face is watched intently, and every reaction and expression is judged. To get a better insight at times when I wear the perfect poker face, managers try really hard to decipher what I am jotting down in my notebook. Faced with an inquisitive manager at a review recently, I had to look him in the eye and tell him not to worry, as the food was not ""so bad""!

KDA chairman gets schooled in Kannada

Kannada Development Authority Chairman S G Siddaramaiah, during his Ballari visit, was given a lesson in Kannada by none other than Ballari Deputy Commissioner Ram Prasath Manohar. The KDA Chairman had convened a meeting of officers, and held a lengthy discussion on how Kannada was getting stepmotherly treatment in Karnataka. He also taunted bureaucrats, saying they favoured English. Winding up his speech, Siddaramaiah spoke about the plight of Kannada students in border villages of a neighbouring state, and asked about the ""percentage"" of reservation set aside for them in education and jobs. The DC, listening patiently, corrected the KDA chairman with, ""Percentage annabardu adke, shekada annabeku (Don't term it percentage, say shekada)"". This left the other officials in splits, and the chairman speechless.

5% story in 4 hours

Collecting details for a story can sometimes reach a stumbling block at the unlikeliest of places, as I experienced during an interview with a septuagenarian. It took four hours, three cups of coffee, and a whole lot of broaching. It yielded little. The interview began with the person's childhood as well as several other details of his life. All my efforts to steer the conversation to the story went in vain. Finally, as the clock struck 8pm, the person informed me that it was time for his dinner. He added that he had narrated only 5 per cent of his story, and that he would give more details at the next meeting. I thanked him for his time, and beat a hasty retreat, deciding to look elsewhere for the information.

To cope with the situation, two sections of each class are clubbed and taught together. Further, students are compelled to sit on carpets to make optimum usage of space.

The school, which was constructed in 1995, has 306 children studying in classes 1 to 5. It has 10 sections, but only five classrooms to accommodate the strength. Two out of these five classrooms also function as the school's kitchen, administrative room, and a store house.

Pardeep Kumar, administrative head of the school, admitted that the institution was suffering for lack of classrooms. ""One single room functions as the kitchen, where mid-day meals are stored, school's record room, and even a classroom. We have very little space for construction of additional classrooms. We are not sure if more floors can be added to the current structure since it is old and already deteriorating. We don't even have a playground,"" said Kumar.

Vanshika Singh, a Class 5 student, said that she and other classmates had to sit on the floor during classes. ""I sit on a carpet that is spread over the floor. We don't have benches for all the classes,"" she said. The 11-year-old added that the school did not have enough play area. ""During the lunch break, the small courtyard area gets too crowded. There are far too many children and sometimes they even get hurt while trying to play in the limited space,"" added Singh.

Kumar, however, said that the school was trying to make the optimum usage of whatever little resources it had. ""We only have benches in two classrooms. In the remaining three classes, we use carpets so that more students can be adjusted in one class. During summer, at times, we move one section outside to study on the verandah, and students from the other section study inside the classroom,"" explained Kumar.

Apart from the space constraints, the school is grappling with crumbling infrastructure. Students study in classrooms where the walls are cracked, with plaster peeling off their surface, and ceilings that have been water-damaged. The portion of the school that houses the washrooms is also in a bad state, and is enclosed by a broken wall.

Kumar said that the school had recently received funds for routine repairs and work would be initiated during the upcoming holidays. ""The routine repairs will be taken care of, but the school should be given a new and bigger space for it to overcome the space crunch. The school needs a bigger space to operate and accommodate the increasing number of students,"" said Kumar.

Meanwhile, district elementary education officer Premlata Yadav said that the education department had not received any complaints pertaining to the matter of space crunch from the school. ""We will look into the matter if we receive a formal complaint. We have already directed funds for routine repair work,"" said Yadav."

The Army is reaching out to the civilian population under operation 'Sadhbavana' (goodwill) and it had helped the force to build a strong bond with the residents of remote pockets who are facing lot of hardships due to lack of basic facilities, Jammu-based Army PRO Lt Col Devender Anand told PTI.

He said the youth-oriented programmes has touched the hearts and minds of the people as the Army is organizing free coaching classes to help them in their studies, skill development courses, pre-recruitment training and counselling camps and also engaging them in sports activities.

""We have organised over 900 civic action programmes across Jammu region comprising 10 districts this year, benefiting thousands of people.

""The major thrust is on poor population living in the hilly districts especially the youth besides the ex-servicemen who are being educated about the latest schemes being announced from time to time for their welfare and address their problems, the army officer said.

He said this was in addition to the rescue missions undertaken by the force to help accidents victims and those stranded in inaccessible areas during snowfall.""Hundreds of people were rescued and some of them evacuated by choppers to save their lives in the recent past"".

He said the Army has organised 104 medical and veterinary aid camps this year, providing free service to the needy at their door steps.

Thousands of villagers, mostly nomadic shepherds who live in hilly areas, were provided solar lanterns, which brought smiles on their faces, the officer said.

He said the Army has organised dozens of tuition classes for both boys and girls to help them in their studies besides 123 lecture classes and 78 awareness drives were held for the benefit of the youth who were also engaged in sports activities like cricket, football, volleyball and chess competitions.

Last week, Lt Col Anand said said Army started tuition classes for children of rural areas in mountainous Ramban district with a twin objective to help poor students and generate employment for the educated youth.

The three-month long tuition classes were started at different locations including Lower Gund, Cheril, Halemaidan, Batu, Karalchihal, Ukhral and Rajgarh areas, he said.

""The aim of these classes is to impart quality education to children from rural areas who cannot afford private coaching. These classes are being conducted during winter vacations to ensure maximum attendance,"" he said.

He said more than 250 students would be accruing the benefits of quality coaching through this project which also generated employment for educated youths who have been hired as teachers for these coaching classes.

The PRO said the Army gifted gymnasiums and other sports items and also constructed toilets at various educational institutions.

Experts were engaged to deliver lectures on various important issues like women empowerment, health and hygiene, ill effects of drugs, water conservation, road safety, global warming, first aid and the need to maintain communal harmony, he said.

He said various short-term courses in nursing, stitching and awareness drives on career opportunities for girls in armed forces were regularly held for the women.

Over two dozen motivational drives were also undertaken to attract youth to take Army as profession while 37 communal harmony meetings were conducted to bring together various communities and maintain peace in the region, he added.

The agriculture department estimates the loan waiver to cost Rs 35,000 crore.

The first scheme to face the axe was the Deendayal Vananchal Yojna that provided health and education facilities to forest dwellers. On December 24, the Kamal Nath government issued an order scrapping the scheme on procedural grounds--the absence of approval from the finance department. The state spent about Rs 5.50 crore in the last financial year on the scheme introduced in 2016, according to forest department officials.

""We are compiling all the schemes introduced by the previous government and the money spent on these schemes. The status report will be presented before the state cabinet to take a call,"" said a senior officer familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.

The previous government introduced several schemes such as the Sambal Yojna, Mukhyamantri Teerth Darshan Yojna, Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojna, Ladli Laxmi Yojna, and Krishak Samridhi Yojna targeted at senior citizens, women, farmers, poor households and students.

Under the Sambal scheme, the government provides electricity at a flat rate of Rs 200 a month to labourers from the unorganised sector and farmers having up to five acres land; it reimburses the power distribution companies if the monthly bill is over Rs 200. As a result, the government has to spend about Rs 150 crore per month. At least 20 million people have registered for the scheme.

""There is concern of excessive consumption of power by beneficiaries. The new government will have to look into the same"", said an official in the energy department who asked not to be named.

Jayant Malaiya, finance minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party government, said: ""The schemes of the previous government may be affected as the new government may not have adequate funds after waiving the loans of farmers. If the loans are really waived, the government may not have money for other schemes and infrastructure of the state may also suffer.""

Government officials said the problem the new state government is confronting is that it may not be able to scrap or modify many of Chouhan's schemes for fear of alienating people before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Principal secretary, finance, Anurag Jain declined to comment on how the government will meet its requirement of funds to waive the farmers' loans.

Economist Jayantilal Bhandari said, ""The government may scrap some of the previous government's schemes. At the same time, it may look into tourism, industries, skill and development to generate more funds. But given the huge amount of debt and lack of balance in income and expenditure, its a huge task in the government's hands at present to fulfil its promise.""

State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, ""There is no problem in arranging money for the loan waiver, though the previous government left the treasury empty. The previous government spent most of funds on rallies, events and advertisements. With fiscal discipline and revenue realisation, the government can manage the funds."""

AI-based technologies helped companies add new revenue streams and optimise current ones.

According to an analysis by professional services firm PwC, technological disruption has also impacted the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) or investment strategies of large corporations.

""With larger corporations looking to adapt to technological advancements and revamp their business models, 2018 has seen a number of acquisitions in the new technology space,"" said Sanjeev Krishan, partner and leader, private equity and deals, PwC India.

""Relevance has become a key element for the survival of any business, and this has made technology expertise a requirement to achieve a competitive advantage in the current market,"" he added.

From mindshare to wallet share

Coined by computer scientist John McCarthy in 1995, AI and ML came to the fore when Silicon Valley-based tech giants such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia and IBM among others used the technology first to maintain their operations and then later dished out solutions for different sectors.

In the last few years, these companies have invested heavily in AI and ML for business intelligence, helping them expand to new markets and gain dominant shelf space in an individual's life via personal computing devices such as mobile phones, PCs and smart home products. However, when companies opened up their codes, libraries and frameworks, a host of startups took advantage of the freely-available technology and began offering a range of new solutions to a section of the market that was underserved by system integrators and the tech giants themselves.

Jishnu Bhattacharya, managing director of Nexus Venture Partners based in Menlo Park, said AI and ML have been gathering momentum in the last couple of years.

""Till around mid-2017, one could say that AI and ML had a lot of mindshare in the industry but largely in 2018, one could say that these technologies have gained wallet share, which is to say they are seeing a lot of investment,"" Bhattacharya told TechCircle.

He added that horizontal and vertical AI applications will increase as businesses find new use cases to implement these technologies. ""One-third of our investments in the last five years have been into AI, analytics and data-related firms as we look at companies who are trying to build a value chain around data,"" Bhattacharya said.

In fact, out of the six companies that Nexus Venture Partners invested in India in the first half of 2018, four ran on AI-based platforms or offered automation solutions. Analysts also claim that India specifically has been evolving in terms of these technologies.

""It's a rapidly evolving market, and AI/ML tools are witnessing increased adoption across multiple industries,"" PN Sudarshan, partner at Deloitte India, told TechCircle. ""Currently, there is a lot of interest around this technology and multiple applications are being implemented across business use cases, whether to improve operational efficiencies or customer experience.""

He said, however, that for India to take maximum advantage of AI and ML, large-scale actionable data needs to be available to train algorithms. The country also needs to develop capabilities, expertise and talent in AI/ML to build custom applications at scale.

""While the ongoing digital transformation of public and private sector enterprises transforms the economy from being data poor to data rich, India's strong talent ecosystem in science and engineering would help us accelerate the adoption,"" Sudarshan said.

A number of emerging enterprises and startups are providing specialised services in decision sciences, carving out their own niche in the AI ecosystem, he added.

""As per various estimates, there are more than 300 AI startups in India. While it's difficult to quantify the exact number of investments, given that most of it remains unreported, startups in categories such as healthcare and customer experience management have seen good investor interest,"" he said.

However, Sandeep Parikh, partner for advisory on AI and ML at consultancy firm EY India, said that although IT service providers have rushed to the market with a wide range of AI/ML-based homegrown solutions over the last few months, most of them are unproven and they have been overstating their capabilities, resulting in hype.

""There is still some way to go in terms of creating concrete and end-to-end true differentiation using cognitive solutions, though we have seen some interesting pieces in operations, front offices, finance, human resources and marketing where ML has potentially created small but real impact,"" Parikh said.

According to him, there is also a lack of awareness in the marketplace of how to apply these technologies in the real world to generate relevant and lasting impact.

Puneet Gupta, chief technology officer at data and engineering service firm GlobalLogic India, said that investment in the research and development of core AI and ML models is scarce.

Sectors adopting AI and ML

Finance, banking, machinery, operations and retail are at the forefront of integrating AI and ML in their businesses.

PwC's Krishan said that the retail sector in particular was at the frontline of technology convergence this year.

""Advancements in technology are driving the constant evolution of consumer behaviour and expectations, compelling traditional retail players to challenge themselves in the race against the growing e-commerce segment,"" he explained, adding this trend will continue to garner significant interest from both global and domestic players.

Gupta of GlobalLogic said that domains such as education, legal, healthcare and banking in India have adopted AI to solve problems. ""The adoption rate is highest in areas like self-service, customer care, assisted automation and assessments,"" he added.

Deloitte's Sudarshan said that while AI and ML can be used for any application that involves prediction and has proven to be beneficial in areas like medical diagnostics, image recognition, autonomous driving and predictive maintenance in factories.

While companies such as Microsoft, IBM, Bosch and SAP are already working in the healthcare segment, several private banks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have invested heavily in these technologies including chatbots for customer assistance.

The chief information officers of the three above-mentioned banks have told TechCircle in earlier interviews that they were using AI and ML largely to improve customer experience, attract young customers for digital credit facilities and to boost customer growth.

Besides finance, the sales, marketing, operations and procurement functions are also seeing increased adoption of the emerging technologies, according to Nexus's Bhattacharya.

Outlook 2019

Experts and analysts believe that investments in AI and ML will continue to increase unhindered in 2019.

Market research firm IDC predicts spending on AI to grow to $52.2 billion in 2021.

""AI and ML are still in the early stages of large-scale market adoption and will continue to witness interest. While businesses will continue to automate some of their workflow processes using AI/ML tools and improve operational efficiencies, there are also interesting use cases emerging in customer engagement and customer experience management,"" said Sudarsan of Deloitte.

According to him, these functions will use AI and ML to improve the personalised experiences for end consumers.

EY's Parikh said that investments into the emerging technologies will most certainly continue into 2019 and could accelerate if there are real end-to-end solutions that can generate real outcomes and benefits for customers.

Animesh Samuel, co-founder of NLP solutions provider Light Information Systems, expects data sets to converge on a single AI platform in 2019. Till 2018, companies looked for AI solutions in silos such as chatbots, robotic process automation, tools, etc., he said.

""We missed out the real fodder for AI -- data! The solutions for 2019 will unite structured and unstructured data to automate entire processes,"" he explained.

Gupta of GlobalLogic said that enterprises need to focus more on building AI/NLP for local language support and to create domain-specific core models. ""This will have a much deeper impact in widespread addition of AI,"" he said.

He expects investments in both startups and large technology providers to surge.

IBM Research's chief operating officer Dr Dario Gil said that 2019 will see improvements in 'causal modeling' techniques that will push AI from asking 'what happened' to 'what would happen' based on possible actions.

He also said that companies will improve on conversational AI by applying new anti-bias techniques in combination with guidance from in-house and industry ethics advisory groups to make their products and platforms fairer."

Police said that this was after four-five students were scolded by their physical education teacher on Thursday morning. Three of them allegedly complained against the teacher to their father.

The school principal, who has lodged a complaint in the case, said that the father and his accomplices entered the school and started thrashing the teacher inside campus.

(Written by Sharon Thomas)

As a projector is being set up at a hotel in Girgaum, Nirmala Sarvardekar (80) makes an announcement in front of a group of 20 senior citizens. ""It is the last meeting of 2018 and today we are going to watch an English movie,"" says Sarvardekar.

The group, which has 50 members, travels to Madhavashram Hotel every Friday to unwind. During this year-end meeting, they settle in their seats to watch The Gods Must Be Crazy, a 1980 South African comedy film.

In 2004, Sarvardekar, a former professor of Wilson College, along with a retired teacher of St Xavier's High School, Sulochana Bapat (79), formed Visava, which means rest and relaxation in Marathi.

""We are friends from college and used to go for evening walks. We noticed that there were a lot of senior citizens in the Girgaum area. We thought of forming a group where we could all interact and spend quality time with one another,"" says Bapat.

They meet at a mini hall of the 115-year-old Madhavashram Hotel. ""It's been 15 years since they are meeting here. They make the place come alive with their interactions and activities. It's a joy to host them,"" says Krishna Mhane, hotel manager, who offers them the place for free.

The interactions range from political debates to literary discussions. ""We have discussions on informative write-ups, sometimes we review old Marathi literary works, recite poetry or watch acclaimed movies,"" Sarvardekar says. A few years ago, the group would come on air on a radio programme, Jestha Nagarik, hosted by Aakash Vani. In every show, four senior citizens would go on air to discuss Marathi poetry and prose.

The idea behind the group was to create a space where elderly people could feel free to have a conversation regarding anything. Tardeo-based Narayan (88) and Iravati Lavate (79), who wrote to the president last year seeking permission for physician-assisted suicide to avoid terminal illness and a slow death, are always ready to debate over euthanasia. ""Everyone asks why do you want to die. And we argue it is our right to decide when to end our lives,"" Iravati says.

The members are from different backgrounds -- some retired, while a few who did not complete formal education. But they share a common zeal to read, think and express themselves.

""These days, we spend most of our time with our grandchildren, taking care of them. They are born into the hands of technology. No one has time for a face-to-face conversation. With this group, we feel we are back in time,"" says Shailaja Virkar (75), a retired officer of General Post Office near Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. The group also celebrates birthdays, an annual day and many similar occasions.

""Once a year, we gather funds to donate to an organisation in Assam, which focusses on the education of girl child,"" says Prabha Devi, Secretary of Visava.

At 92, K G Chhetri is the oldest member of the group, a retiree from the Railways. ""We share a fraternal bond."" They also visit the houses of members, who are unable to make it to the weekly meetings due to health issues."

Creating a record of sorts, the municipal corporation completed five mega projects, including three underpasses and two flyovers to ease traffic congestion in different areas of the city, in just one year under Strategic Road Development Programme (SRDP).

The year 2018 began with the launch of Ayyappa Society underpass in January for GHMC. Living up to the expectations of the State Government and the citizens, the municipal corporation has completed four other much-needed projects, including the Mindspace underpass (April), Chintalkuna underpass (May), Kamineni LHS Flyover (July) and Mindspace flyover (November).

Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister KT Rama Rao, during the launch of Ayyappa Society underpass, had announced that this was just the beginning and 2018 would be the year of execution and, accordingly, five projects were completed.

After the launch of Metro services on the Ameerpet-LB Nagar route on September 24 this year, commuting has become bit easy for many passengers in the city.

L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad is now operating a train for every six minutes on the Miyapur-LB Nagar route (8 am to 12 noon and 5 pm to 9 pm). A train is being operated for every seven minutes on the route during non-peak hours (12 noon to 5 pm).

Hyderabad Metro Rail crossed 30 million cumulative ridership milestone in just 351 days after the commercial operations were launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 28, 2017.

The striking aspect is that the ridership increased from 20 million to 30 million in a mere 71 days. With 46 kms of Metro operations, Hyderabad Metro Rail is now the second largest Metro service in the country after Delhi Metro Rail.

Buoyed with the response, Metro officials are now working hard to launch the services on the Ameerpet-Hitec City route at the earliest.

Hyderabad drew national attention for many reasons this year. Among the many, Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board's exclusive Rain Water Harvesting Theme Park in Jubilee Hills and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation's first-of-its-kind Dog Park at Kondapur garnered attention of many nationally and are already a big hit with people.

Impressed with the initiatives taken by both the organisations, different departments from across the country are visiting the parks and drawing plans to replicate the same in their respective cities.

Kanpur Development Authority vice-chairman Kinjal Singh, along with a couple of others, visited the HMWSSB's rain water theme park at Jubilee Hills and complimented the good work done in Hyderabad.

Launched in August of this year, Kanti Velugu scheme in the State has not only identified eye-related ailments among the population but also has set a blueprint for the soon-to-be-launched universal health profile of every citizen in the State. All the health authorities in Telangana State now have to do is to simply replicate the Kanti Velugu scheme for other diseases.

The sheer scale of Kanti Velugu scheme is quite mind-boggling. For instance, between this August and December, over 8,000 healthcare workers in the State have covered a record 1.13 crore persons who underwent basic eye screening in as many as 6,603 villages in the State.

Perhaps, this is for the first time in the country that such a large cross-section of population has participated in eye screening. In the process, through the Kanti Velugu scheme, 18,36,303 beneficiaries received reading glasses. The mega eye-screening camp also identified 7,39,047 persons who were eventually referred to secondary and tertiary care facilities in the State.

The Telangana State took a major step towards strengthening medical education when the Centre gave its nod to set up All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at Bibinagar in April of this year. The sector also got a boost when Telangana received green signal to set up four more medical colleges, each in Mahabubnagar, Siddipet, Nalgonda and Suryapet.

While it takes at least four to five years, and sometimes even more, to actually operationalise AIIMS following Centre's approval, the health authorities here are looking at a possible start of the academic year from 2019 itself. All this is possible because of the presence of a NIMS Bibinagar hospital building, which was constructed at a cost of Rs 80 crore, spread over a campus of 160 acre. Already, authorities here have handed over 200 acres of land, including the NIMS hospital building, to the Centre at Bibinagar for AIIMS project.

The AIIMS will be completely run by the Ministry of Health, Medical and Family Welfare (MOHFW), New Delhi, and is set to play an influential role as a teaching hospital and research centre in Telangana State.

Facial Recognition System (FRS), a first-of-its-kind technology-driven initiative, was introduced by the State police in 2018 for detecting crime.

The Director General of Police, M Mahendar Reddy, launched the scheme in August. FRS has been linked to TSCOP app to assist field-level officers to check suspect's face with criminals' database available with the State police along with Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) database.

The FRS is also enabling police in tracing missing persons also. A few weeks ago, the system helped police in identifying a woman, M Shantamma, who went missing from Nacharam, and reuniting her with the family members.

The facial recognition tool of Telangana Police also helped reunite a teenage girl from Lakhimpur, Assam, with her family after she went missing and was admitted to children's home in Tezpur in Sonitpur.

Kaleshwaram lift irrigation witnessed massive work turnout this year as six major works - lifts and barrages at Medigada, Sundilla and Annaram - were initially scheduled to be completed by the year end. Despite floods in Godavari that resulted in disruptions impacting the work progress, the implementation agencies have completed the key components of the six works barring concrete laying on the spill ways of the barrages.

Chief Minister, K Chandrasekhar Rao, who had a marathon review on the project works recently, pointed out the tardy progress in certain packages. The concrete pour on the Medigadda barrage spill way is in progress without any break for the past one week. All the three barrages and three lift irrigation schemes that are part of the multi-package integrated irrigation project will be completed in the next 90 days, according to the Project Chief Engineer, N Venkateswarlu.

He said the lift schemes would be ready for drawing 2 tmc water as designed by from River Godavari to extend irrigation to the ayacut for next Kharif season after the onset of monsoon. The first lift scheme at Medigadda will become operational soon. Some major milestones achieved this year on the project include the dry run of the underground pumping stations in KLIS package 8.

Works pertaining to erection of 85 crest gates on Medigadda barrage, 74 gates on Sundilla barrage and 66 gates on Annaram barrage was nearing completion. ""We will be ready with the key lifts and barrages by March next,"" said the Chief Engineer of the project.

Bhakta Ramadasu Lift Irrigation Scheme (BRLIS) intended to provide irrigation to drought-prone pockets in Palair area of Khammam district is today regarded as one of the best lift irrigation schemes completed in shortest-ever possible time. It also helped in addressing the drinking water problem in a number of villages.

A new ayacut of 16,365 acres in the rain shadow zone of Khammam district was brought under cultivation this year with the completion of phase II of the lift irrigation scheme. The first phase of the scheme helped in extending irrigation directly to 58,958 acres. Some 103 irrigation tanks that received water after a long gap of three decades helped in recharging the ground water, thus giving indirect benefits in terms of irrigation to another 25,000 to 30,000 acres.

In one year's time, there is a marked transition in the agrarian profile Tirumalayapalem, Palair, Kusumanchi and Mudigonda mandals of Khammam and Maripeda mandal of Mahabubabad district. The entire ayacut of the project is in the tail-end of the SRSP Stage II distributory system under DBM 60. Both the phases of the lift irrigation scheme had cost Rs 356.54 crore.

Phase one was completed in a record time of 11 months, while phase two was completed in less than six months after getting the administrative approval from the State government.

The agriculture department estimates the loan waiver to cost Rs 35,000 crore.

The first scheme to face the axe was the Deendayal Vananchal Yojna that provided health and education facilities to forest dwellers. On December 24, the Kamal Nath government issued an order scrapping the scheme on procedural grounds --- the absence of approval from the finance department. The state government spent about Rs 5.50 crore in the last financial year on the scheme introduced in 2016, according to forest department officials.

""We are compiling all the schemes introduced by the previous government and the money spent on these schemes. The status report will be presented before the state cabinet to take a call,"" said a senior officer familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.

The previous government introduced several schemes such as the Sambal Yojna, Mukhyamantri Teerth Darshan Yojna, Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojna, Ladli Laxmi Yojna, and Krishak Samridhi Yojna targeted at senior citizens, women, farmers, poor households and students.

Under the Sambal scheme, the government provides electricity at a flat rate of Rs 200 a month to labourers from the unorganised sector and farmers having land of up to five acre; it reimburses the power distribution companies if the monthly bill is over Rs 200. As a result, the government has to spend about Rs 150 crore per month. At least 20 million people have registered to avail of the scheme introduced in July.

""There is concern of excessive consumption of power by beneficiaries. The new government will have to look into the same"", said an official in the energy department who asked not to be named.

Jayant Malaiya, finance minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party government, said: ""The schemes of the previous government may be affected as the new government may not have adequate funds after waiving the loans of farmers. If the loans are really waived, the government may not have money for other schemes and infrastructure of the state may also suffer.""

Government officials said the problem the new state government is confronting is that it may not be able to scrap or modify many of Chouhan's schemes for fear of alienating people before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Principal secretary, finance, Anurag Jain declined to comment on how the government will meet its requirement of funds to waive the farmers' loans.

Economist Jayantilal Bhandari said, ""The government may scrap some of the previous government's schemes. At the same, it may look into the areas like tourism, industries, skill development etc to generate more funds. But given the huge amount of debt and lack of balance in income and expenditure, it's a huge task in the government's hands at present to fulfil its promise.""

State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, ""There is no problem in arranging money for the loan waiver, though the previous government left the treasury empty. The previous government spent most of funds on rallies, events and advertisements. With fiscal discipline and revenue realisation, the government can manage the funds."""

According to the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation Swachh Bharat Mission, India's sanitation coverage has successfully moved up to 98 per cent from mere 38 per cent in the year 2014, when Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was kick-started in the country in a bid to provide each and every individual access to safe sanitation and hygiene.

Status Of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan In Rural India

Since October 2, 2014, according to the data provided by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, around 9 crore toilets (9,09,69,052) have been constructed in the rural parts of India. In 2018 alone, more than 2 crore toilets have been built. As a result, 534 districts and over 5 lakh (5,38,285) villages have achieved the open defecation free status in the country.

A few months ago, addressing the nation while launching the Swachhata Hi Seva movement across the country ahead of Mahatma Gandhi's 149th birth anniversary on October 2, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""Nobody had thought that India can construct 9 crore toilets in 4 years, but, we all did it. This is the result of the efforts of swachhagrahis (People working for Swachh Bharat Mission) from across the country.""

Not just PM Modi, the movement of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan also received a big thumbs up from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Mr Gates said, ""Most governments do not talk about sanitation, therefore, it remains a hidden problem. The Indian government is to be congratulated for putting a focus on sanitation. Given that this is a long lead time in terms of capital investment and the processes, I feel good about the progress that's been made in India.""

This is not the first time, Bill Gates has lauded the government's commitment towards improving the sanitation in the country, in 2017 as well through his blog post titled 'India Is Winning Its War On Human Waste', Mr Gates talked about how he ""loved"" the mission, its uniqueness and the considerable progress it had managed to make in a short span of time.

2018 Highlights

For the first time, taking inspiration from its urban counterparts, Rural India unveiled Swachh Survekshan Grameen 2018, wherein, 6800 villages, 680 districts and 34,000 public places, across the country were ranked on the basis of its cleanliness-related parameters. The ministry also took feedback from 50 lakh citizens during the course of the Swachh Survekshan Grameen 2018.

This year, Rural Haryana, topped the chart of Swachh Survekshan - Grameen in North Zone, Rural Gujarat in West zone, Chhattisgarh in East Zone, Andhra Pradesh in South zone and Assam and Sikkim in North East zone.

Apart from Swachh Survekshan Grameen, this year the government also launched Swachh Bharat Summer Internship Programme, wherein the government asked youths to visit one or more villages during their summer vacations and contribute 100 hours and conduct activities of their choice to contribute to the cause of rural sanitation in India. The interns who will get excellent results will be awarded a cash reward and recognition at the national level. Students pursuing courses in higher education institutions will also be given two credit points for undergoing 15-days (100 hours) summer internship under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan activities.

Talking to NDTV on how programmes like Swachh Survekshan and 100-hour Swachh Internship is helping rural parts achieve the ODF target, a senior official from the ministry said,

These programmes contributed towards achieving the sanitation goal in one way or the other - wherever we are today is because of the efforts of swachhagrahis, who have contributed towards the cause of swachh India.

Giving an example, the officer said,

In Bihar, Sitamarhi became the first ODF district this year. The credit goes to all the swachhagrahis who helped construct 2 lakh toilets in mere two months' time. Not just that, 20,000 swacchagrahis from across India came to Motihari for a week to work on behavioural change among people of 38 districts of Bihar and help the state achieve its swachhta target on priority. Whether people are helping construct toilets or simply motivating the villagers about constructing toilets, the end result always will be an open defecation free area. So, the motive of launching these activities and programmes is always helpful in meeting the end target of ODF country.

Status Of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan In Urban India

According to Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, 62 lakh Individual Household Toilets (IHHL) and 5 lakh Community and Public Toilet seats have been added in urban areas of India, making 21 states and Union Territories urban regions free from open defecation. Along with this, a major initiative of mapping of all public toilets in the country on Google maps has also been undertaken by the ministry to enable people to easily locate public conveniences. So far, 835 cities have uploaded more than 33,000 public toilets on google maps.

Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra says that India's urban sanitation ration is at 95% and the ministry is confident that they will be able to achieve ODF success before the target of October 2019.

As per the ministry, to make urban areas 100 per cent ODF, the government needs to build 67 lakhs individual toilets and 5.8 lakhs public toilets in the country. In the meantime, the Ministry of Housing & Urban affairs has launched ODF+ and ODF++ protocols', with a focus on sustaining ODF tag and achieve holistic sanitation, wherein proper maintenance of toilets is done for their continued usage and safe management of faecal sludge from toilets is ensure so that no untreated sludge is discharged into open drains, water bodies or in the open.

Swachh Bharat Abhiyan - Creating Positive Strides

Speaking to NDTV about what sets Swachh Bharat Abhiyan apart from previously launched sanitation programmes in India, Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation said, ""One of the things that really sets Swachh Bharat Mission apart from other programmes is that it is really caught on to people. It has today become like one of the biggest jan andolan, a people's movement and has captured the imagination of a billion Indians. The focus of the government today is not on constructing toilets but on bringing in the behaviour change amoung people.""

Mr Iyer further added,

The most innovative technology under Swachh Bharat Mission is the twin-pit toilet. The toilet is a complete package in itself - one can build it for about Rs12,000 and after a year can actually start earning money from it. Once one pit is full with the excreta, you close and start using another pit, by the time the second one is full, the contents from the first pit is successfully converted into a very good compost, which can be sold in the market, as a result, you end up earning money.

The government-sponsored National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) conducted by an independent verification agency under World Bank also shows the positive side of Swachh Bharat Mission. As per the survey, usage of toilets in rural India is over 93 per cent in India, which means people are actually using toilets that are being constructed by the government successfully. But there are challenges.

Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) Director General Sunita Narain says, ""Building toilets is only the first and perhaps the easiest part. This cannot be seen as the ultimate yardstick of success. What are we doing with the immense amounts of solid and liquid waste that these millions of new toilets would be/are generating?""

Explaining how monumental the problem of not sorting faecal waste would be, CSE which did an assessment of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in 2017, highlighted that 1 lakh tonne of excreta every day is produced by 720 million people using 144 million household toilets. To sort such a massive amount of waste, more than 5,200 trucks would be needed every day.

CSE's Programme Manager with rural water-waste management Sushmita Sengupta says,

If waste is not managed well, it can turn out to be a far bigger problem than that of open defecation. The untreated waste can contaminate everything - from land to water sources.

Naina Lal Kidwai, Chairperson, India Sanitation Coalition also stressed on the fact of shifting focus of government from becoming an open defecation free country to achieving ODF Plus targets that means total sanitation in terms of solid waste management, improved sewerage lines, stormwater drains and pucca cement roads, in addition to open defecation free tag.

Ms Kidwai says,

If ODF Plus targets are not met then for India, Swachh Bharat Mission will be a very expensive failure. It is time we all, even the government start working towards the treatment part of the excreta, otherwise getting a Clean India tag will be very tough.

Apart from the challenge of waste management, the last mile of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan of attaining 100 per cent ODF status in less than a year, may not be easy. Three crore more toilets are needed to be built in rural parts of the country and five lakh toilets in urban parts of India, while that may seem achievable there are concerns emerging. Recently the Comptroller and Auditor General exposed cases of fudging of data in the state of Gujarat. It highlighted that in ODF Gujarat, 29 per cent of households still lack toilets and said that false claims have been made by the state in a rush to achieve ODF targets.

On the other hand, Centre Of Science and Environment's 2017 assessment of Swachh Bharat Mission highlights that the government aspirational target of making India clean and open defecation free by October 2, 2019, looks like a tough goal. The report highlighted the tardy progress in four states of India - Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Odisha in four years of Swachh Bharat Mission. These four states account for a massive 60 per cent of the people in India who defecate in the open and the report concluded that unless these states become open defecation-free, the world, and India, cannot meet their ODF target."

Karnataka High Court: Makeover moves for B'luru

Bengaluru's aesthetic beauty has been restored, city roads are free from potholes, and cleanliness has improved -- all thanks to the Karnataka High Court, which woke up BBMP from slumber. Acting on a batch of PILs, a division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari directed BBMP to preserve the city's visual appeal by removing illegal hoardings, flexes and banners. Due to this, new bye-laws are being evolved to regulate hoardings. BBMP officials even registered an FIR against Minister D K Shivakumar for not removing an unauthorised ad, despite being given time. Citizens also got relief from pothole-riddled roads and garbage piles in public areas. The court availed the assistance of Army engineers to check the quality of work done by BBMP.

Komala GK, Nanditha's teacher, recalled how her parents, who work as daily wage workers, came looking for her all the way to the new school where she was posted. ""I could see anger, fear and sadness in them. They asked me what their daughter should do with the school closed.""

The battle was against water hyacinth, a weed. Ulsoor lake, situated in the heart of the IT City,is also used by the Sappers for training. Tired of seeing their lifeline being suffocated owing to pollution, the Sappers took matter into their own hands. The soldiers,on boats, pulled out the waste using their bare hands. They also removed plastic waste, household rubbish and other garbage. At the end of the day, the Army also issued a wake-up call in their signature fashion, blunt and to the point: ""People should understand that it is not the business of the Army to become garbage cleaners.""

Ananya:Hero in the hills

Ananya Vasudev RM saved 15 families of Karike village in Kodagu district during this year's floods and subsequent landslides. Ananya Vasudev,an assistant lecturer of Geology at the National Institute of Technology, received a WhatsApp video from a friend which showed loud sound emanating from the ground. Ananya Vasudev asked his friend to send another video. After seeing the fresh video, he was sure the sound was due to soil piping and the area could see a landslide. Soil piping is a formation of voids within soil which causes internal erosion and seepage. He immediately spoke to Kodagu Deputy Commissioner Sreevidya who sent a team to the village and evacuated the families. As predicted by Ananya, the area saw a huge landslide a few hours later.

S B Vastradmath: Speedy justice his goal

Chitradurga district court judge S B Vastradmath has done his bit to ensure that the public reposes its faith in the judiciary by delivery of quick judgments. Recently, he was in new for sentencing a man who killed his wife to life imprisonment within 13 days of the crime. He pronounced another judgment within 11 days of the crime. In September, the judge delivered 153 judgments in 22 days without taking a day's leave. He has broken his own record of achieving 70 points in a single calender month, which was earlier set by him during his tenure as the Civil Judge (Jr division) at Molakalmuru. In the system to evaluate judges, a point is awarded for each judgment where the maximum is 70 points irrespective of the number of cases. Vastramath says awarding death penalty to 3 men accused of rape and torture of a woman in Kolar was his most memorable judgment.

Ayub Ahmed: Dignified farewell mission

Meet Ayub Ahmed, who uses his own resources to shift unidentified and unclaimed bodies, and performs their last rites. This 38-year-old Mysuru resident has been carrying out this job for the past two decades. As soon as members of the public, hospitals or even the police inform him about unclaimed bodies, Ahmed reaches the spot in his old Ambassador car and takes the body. He works as a loader at the Mandi Mohalla Market in Mysuru. Though Ahmed has not kept an official count of the bodies that he has buried or cremated so far, Ahmed puts the figure at about 10,000. Ahmed posts photos of the bodies on his Facebook page in the hope of reaching out to the kin of the deceased. In absence of claims, he gets the paperwork done, after which he takes the unclaimed bodies to the graveyard and performs the last rites as per their religion.

Krishna Byregowda:Crusade against plastic

At a time when plastic water bottles were the norm in government offices, Rural Development Minister Krishna Byregowda decided to do away with them at his offices and meetings. He replaced the plastic bottles with glass tumblers and reusable water bottles. Byregowda even carries a personal water bottle to the Assembly and Council to avoid using plastic or paper cups. Each person who visits the minister's office is served water in a glass tumbler, unlike the popular practice in most government offices where water is given in plastic or paper cups. Such was the impact of his approach to the matter that the CM asked officials to refrain from distributing water in plastic bottles at all government events.

Randeep D: Official in public demand

That good work seldom goes unnoticed was proved in the case of IAS officer Randeep D, who was brought back as the Additional Commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) owing to public pressure after being shunted from the position. Randeep was transferred by an order signed by Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy as the Commissioner of Social Welfare Department. However, he had earned the confidence of waste management activists for his attempts to reform the ill-managed system in the city. Randeep was credited with setting up the Solid Waste Management control room, bringing proposals of GPS tracking of auto-tippers and compactors, and updating the microplan. Activists pointed out his role in implementation of standard operating with regarding BBMP's Animal Husbandry Department. This led citizens to launch an online campaign to demand his reinstatement. After the campaign got the support of about 1,000 people, Kumaraswamy had to take a relook at his decision.

Kempaiah: BEO answers the call

An inspiring act by the Block Education Officer of Bangarpet Taluk went a long way to show how personal involvement can improve the learning ambience for children. Kempaiah shocked the school administration authorities, as well as teachers and students during a visit to a Kannada Higher Primary School in the district -- he cleaned a blocked toilet. Kempaiah had decided to visit the school to see the conditions for himself after he received several complaints from parents about the unhygienic conditions in the classrooms and toilet. While checking the toilets, when he saw it blocked, he got to his knees and started cleaning it with a brush. He had expressed to TNIE that it was unfortunate that the teachers and anganwadi workers had not kept the school clean. The girls in the school were forced to walk to their homes in the village for toilet breaks during class hours.

Inscription Stones of Bangalore: Documenting city's history

A civic activism project, ""Inscription Stones of Bangalore"" aims at creating awareness about and protecting ancient stone inscriptions (shila shaasanas) found in the Bengaluru region. The group has discovered several new inscription stones and restored the neglected ones by relocating them to a respectful place. They have educated citizens through postcards, public talks, school visits, poster presentations and other group- funding initiatives. With the help of latest technology, they have created 3D models of critically-endangered stone inscriptions. This project follows in the footsteps of B L Rice, who between 1894 and 1905, documented the stones in his 12-volume book, Epigraphia Carnatica. The project also acts as a platform for interested Bengaluru residents to work towards conservation of these ancient stones, which speak a lot about the Garden City's rich cultural past."

With careers today not limited to traditional domains, there are a plethora of options to choose from. One such unconventional, albeit fulfilling, career option is that of a physiotherapist. Physiotherapy is a science related to health care that focuses on restoration of movement and function of various body parts. Physiotherapists help diagnose and treat patients of all ages suffering from health problems or conditions that limit their mobility and affect their day-to-day activities. They also work with individuals to develop fitness and promote general well-being as part of a healthier and active lifestyle.

Healthcare services

A person who has undergone training as part of a graduate, postgraduate, or doctoral programme in the science of physiotherapy is eligible to take this up as a profession. To pursue this course, one must have a background in life sciences such as biology and anatomy, or a foundation in psychology or sociology. Higher degree programmes like masters or doctoral studies in the field of physiotherapy give candidates in-depth knowledge and a vivid analysis of various aspects of this science.

Physiotherapists are an essential part of the healthcare delivery system and play an important role in rehabilitation and other programmes that promote health and fitness in both professional as well as social communities. They are not only the providers of health but are also responsible for uplifting their patients from the mental trauma and pain associated with restricted movement and physical functioning.

Some roles and responsibilities of a physiotherapist are:

Diagnose and manage dysfunctional physical movement.

Promote improvement of all-round mobility and specific physical functions.

Work towards restoring, maintaining, and enhancing physical movement and optimal functions.

Promote overall well-being and fitness to ensure good quality of life.

Prevent and treat symptomatic progression of impaired physical movement, functional limitations, disabilities related to diseases, disorders, conditions, injuries or post-operative recovery.

Options

Clinical physiotherapists: They provide care to patients with activity limitations and impairments/ailments of any kind. They collaborate with other healthcare providers to address needs such as communication and the provision of effective and efficient treatment assistance. At a clinical level, they provide end-to-end care for patients, and undertake their assessment and treatment.

Engagement care officer: In this role, physiotherapists reach out to old patients who may be at risk of a relapse. By making sure that they follow the recommended exercise routine, they help ensure patients' long-term well-being.

Clinical and non-clinical roles: Other roles that physiotherapists can assume include consultation, education, research, and administration. Some may be a part of the quality control team as well and others can undertake key leadership roles in the business management vertical to ensure smooth functioning of a healthcare delivery centre.

Other options: Professionals with a degree/ diploma in physiotherapy have many job opportunities in India -- in hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation centres, and private clinics. With the advent of home healthcare services, physiotherapy services are also provided at home and offices. Physiotherapists also have ample prospects in out-patient departments of hospitals, clinics, community and primary health centres, health clubs, fitness centres, occupational health centres, schools for differently-abled children, and senior citizen centres. Since physiotherapy is also an important part of sports injury recovery programmes, physiotherapists find jobs in sports medicine and rehabilitation centres, too.

Prospects

Professionals in India with a degree in physiotherapy complemented by excellent soft skills such as teamwork, good communication, and critical thinking may earn anywhere between ₹8,000 and ₹15,000 per month as freshers.

While the remuneration varies with the company and set up, it also depends on the level of qualification and the college.

As candidates move higher on the experience ladder, the pay packages also get better. The growth in pay scale also largely depends on the professional abilities and the potential of the physiotherapist.

Maley worked as the British Council's South India (Madras) Regional Director between 1984 and 1988. A well-known author of ELT books and Series Editor for the Oxford University Press (OUP) Resource Books for Teachers series, Maley has also served as the President and Vice President of the International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (IATEFL), and has taught in the National University of Singapore and at Assumption University, Bangkok. Currently, he enjoys writing poetry, short stories, and ELT books. He was in Chennai recently as a resource person at an international conference organised by SSN College of Engineering.

In this interview, Alan Maley recalls his experience in Madras and shares his views on the importance of creativity in the English language classroom.

In the book , you state that ""creativity is an endangered species in the current model of education, which is increasingly subject to institutional, curricular and assessment constraints"". How important is creativity for teachers of English?

Creativity is enormously important for teachers of English on several levels. One level is what they do in the classroom and also for themselves. It is easy to fall into a routine when you are a teacher.

Doing things differently makes you creative. Thinking about doing things differently and doing things more creatively keeps you alive as a teacher and makes you a better teacher. If you are a creative person, it will carry over into your teaching and your students will also benefit from you and that will give an opportunity for them to show their creativity.

Many teachers still think of creativity as the preserve of a particularly gifted group of people. It is not so. Everyone is creative. Creativity is not beyond one's capacity. Anything can be done in more than one way and the techniques can be very simple and feasible, and they are usable in the classroom. Teachers can develop their creativity which can take many different forms and can be exhibited in many ways such as finding a quicker solution to a problem, narrating something differently, making up a joke, and so on. Yes, creativity is important for teachers because creative teachers can motivate learners and enable them to learn a language in an interesting and effective way.

Tell us more about your recent book?

The book was published in May by Cambridge University Press. It is a collection of 50 classroom activities which teachers can use and adapt in their classrooms.

Should language teachers be trained to become more creative?

First, teachers should know the importance of creativity and should have the desire to become more creative. Teachers should feel the need for being creative. Training is also important. Teachers should be equipped with creative techniques which they can transfer in the classroom. In-service training is as important as pre-service training. Teachers should be taught to generate ideas among learners. It means that they should talk less and create more opportunities for students to speak in the class. Teachers should be creative as well as reflective. Creative teaching and reflective teaching go together.

What is your take on learner-generated material?

It is important to use the learner-generated material in the language classroom. It will be more effective than readymade textbooks. As I said earlier, everyone is creative and learners are also creative. I believe that students are quite capable of generating their own material. They should make students believe that they have the capacity to select materials suitable to them. Learners must be encouraged and involved not only in selecting the materials but also in suggesting language activities. Teachers should give their students a chance to generate their own material. It is a creative process.

How to make language teaching and learning more effective and meaningful?

It is important to make learners feel the need for learning. They learn English for a wide range of purposes but they are not aware of their needs. There should be a shift from ""have to learn"" to ""want to learn"". This shift will motivate them to learn the target language effectively.

How important is professional development for teachers?

I think it is very important as they are prone to fall into habits. So, there is a need for them to keep their mind active. Teacher development programmes give teachers the opportunity to listen to fellow teachers, exchange ideas, pick up others' ideas and use them in their teaching, and learn from one another. They should constantly learn something new and update themselves by taking new courses.

About your association with Dr N S Prabhu who popularised task-based approach to language teaching.

I was fortunate to have had NS Prabhu as a colleague (English Studies Officer) and to see his Bangalore Project at first hand. His task-based approach to language teaching has been much discussed and appreciated by experts in different countries where English is taught as a second or foreign language. His departure from a linguistically-structured syllabus to a procedural syllabus based on a series of carefully staged tasks was a critical moment in the development of our current conceptions of English Language Teaching."

One of two claimants to the title of the Seventeenth Karmapa, he had escaped to India from Tibet in the January of 2000. My audience was at the then modest Gyuto Monastery in Sidhbari, a small village near the Central Tibetan Administration's base in Dharamsala. The soft-spoken and rather shy 19-year-old lama spoke almost exclusively through his interpreter, deflected questions about Tibetan autonomy and his own political role in exile, and modestly asserted that he was presently focused on his studies.

Monk or a Spy?

In the 15 years since, the Karmapa has emerged as one of the tallest leaders from the Tibetan Buddhist world, arguably the second after His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso. The 900-year-old Karma Kagyu order that he heads commands a sizeable worldwide following, and is the richest of the four sects in Tibetan Buddhism with assets of over $1.5 billion. Furthermore, compared to the Dalai Lama who turned 83 this July, the 33-year-old Karmapa represents change within some of Tibetan Buddhism's old orthodoxies. In March 2017, he took the first definitive steps towards the revitalization of full ordination for Tibetan Buddhist nuns, reviving a lineage that has been broken for almost a thousand years.

However, despite Ogyen Trinley Dorje's popular standing and the Dalai Lama's recognition of him as the Seventeenth Karmapa, India has remained distrustful of his political sympathies.

It has also officially distanced itself from taking a position between the two rival claimants; the 35-year old Thaye Dorje is the other. The circumstances of Ogyen Trinley's escape from Tibet had informed India's initial caution: He was recognized by the Chinese government as the reincarnation of the Sixteenth Karmapa in 1992, and lived at his seat in Tsurphu monastery near Lhasa under the PRC's watchful gaze for over seven years. It seemed implausible that he had managed to escape unaided at the age of 14, thus fueling the suspicion that he was a Chinese spy.

India's Long Tradition of Mistrusting Tibetans

The Government of India's suspicion of itinerant Tibetan Buddhist monks has an older provenance, much like Tibetan migration into India that did not begin with the Dalai Lama's escape in March 1959.

Ever since the People's Liberation Army took control in 1950, Tibetans coming into India had recounted stories of forced ""re-education"" within monastic institutions. Some accounts had been exaggerated for effect.

In 1955, The Indian Political Officer in Sikkim reported a rumor that the Chinese proposed to bring about ""500 girls trained in Communism"" to Lhasa who would be made to marry monks from various monasteries: ""Such monks as marry them will be given loans to carry on trade... The Chinese are experiencing great resistance from the monasteries to their regime in Tibet and to the new changes. Perhaps this is the subtle means of overcoming resistance and hastening the process of Sinification of Tibet.""

Archival records of Tibetans applying for Indian citizenship in the 1950s show an emerging bureaucratic shorthand in which markers of allegiance viz. 'Buddhist' and 'Communist' became synonymous with the territorial markers 'Tibetan' and 'Chinese.' Incoming Tibetan monks were required to prove that they had ""Buddhist leanings"" and were ""opposed to Communism."" Four decades prior to Ogyen Trinley's escape, the Panchen Lama's bodyguard and Chinese-language interpreter Sonam Thargay came to India, avowedly to serve the Dalai Lama. Despite his pleas to the contrary, India extradited him on the belief that anyone who had served under the Communist regime would have been thoroughly indoctrinated into its ideology, and was likely a Chinese spy.

Karmapa's Frustration With India's Anxieties

Months before he acquired Dominican citizenship, Ogyen Trinley expressed frustration over India's surveillance of his activities. Despite relaxing travel restrictions earlier this year, the Indian Government still forbade him from visiting Rumtek monastery in Sikkim, which is the site of the sacred black hat, the symbolic crown of the Kagyu lineage. The last state to be merged with the Indian Union in 1975, Sikkim was known in the Tibetan Buddhist prophetic tradition as sbas yul, or the hidden land that would serve as a place of refuge for Buddhism when it came under threat elsewhere. And so it has: both the present Karmapa and Dalai Lama's predecessors lived in exile there.

China has long disputed its boundary with Sikkim, as well as India's claim over the erstwhile Buddhist kingdom. Sikkim is one of the nodes of the Doklam trijunction that witnessed the two-month long Sino-Indian military standoff in the summer of 2017. Less than two years later, the Karmapa controversy is another a poignant reminder of India's cartographic anxiety that fuels its compulsion for ascertaining ideological loyalty. It is also a symptom of competitive nation-building in the Himalayan region between the world's two most populous states.

As a step towards 'merger', all chief educational officers have been instructed to send the list of such elementary and high schools located within or near higher secondary schools. ""The department is collecting the data now so that action can be initiated next academic year. After merging, the school buildings will be converted into libraries or adult learning centres,"" said an officer, requesting anonymity.

Friday was set as the deadline to submit the list, according to a letter sent to all officers on December 17, days after they met in Chennai.

Sources said a government order had been issued in this connection but the officers were instructed not to act upon it till the next academic year. ""However, we have been instructed to increase the students' strength in the meanwhile,"" said one of the officers who attended the meet.

Tamil Nadu had earlier informed the Centre that it had taken an initiative to merge 1,053 government schools. Also, funds for another 1,950 schools with less than 15 students each were stopped recently.

This move was adopted so that Tamil Nadu adhered to Samagara Shisksha Abhiyan's (SSA) guidelines. SSA was formed recently by merging erstwhile schemes -- Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Class I-VIII) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (Class IX-XII).

Under the new guidelines, government schools with less than 15 students are not eligible to receive the composite school grant, ranging from ?25,000 to ?1,00,000 depending on student strength.

Composite grants were used by schools to improve infrastructure, maintain toilets, buy material to develop students' reading skills and carry out other development activities.

Of the 31,200 government schools, nearly 3,000 institutions that come under various municipalities or are run by departments such as Adi Dravidar, Kallar Reclamation, forest and social welfare have a strength of less than 25 students, shows official data.

So, only ?89.6 crore was released as composite grants for schools in TN this year despite ?97.18 crore being earmarked. Condemning this, educationist Prince Gajendra Babu said the governments were systematically destroying state-funded schools by denying funds and it was unfair to expect parents to admit their children in these schools without adequate teaching staff or facilities."

She portrayed a woman whose passion is teaching but suffers from Tourette Syndrome. The project was also her comeback to showbiz post the birth of her daughter, Adira. The tale of the teacher's bond with a bunch of lesser-privileged students struck a chord with the audience, not just in India but also in China. Rani will soon be seen on the big screen again as Shivani Shivaji Roy in Mardaani 2. We met the actress recently to talk about the year that was and her choice of roles. Excerpts from the chat...

Both the films spoke about powerful women in different walks of life. Mardaani is a female police officer tackling flesh trade and child trafficking, which are extremely important and grave issues in our country as well as the world. I remember many parents telling me that they didn't want to watch the film as they'd feel uncomfortable, or that they didn't want their children to watch it. I told them that, on the contrary, the movie was for them and their children. It helps society become aware that this is not happening in a faraway land, but right in our neighbourhood. We can't view the world with rose-tinted glasses. I wanted to be a part of such a story, that too, told from the point of view of a female police officer. Hichki was about a teacher with Tourette, who is asked to tutor a bunch of underprivileged children. In a strange way, both of them are in the same boat. Together, they learn that you can turn your weakness into strength.

They are based on subjects that are relevant -- child trafficking and issues with the education system. They also pointed to the fact that people judge you for your outer appearance instead of your merit. When you see a woman in a cop's uniform, you may wonder whether she will be able to protect you. But that shouldn't be the case because an officer is that, irrespective of the gender. Similarly, a teacher's Tourette Syndrome doesn't mean she won't be good at her job. There were so many layers to these characters.

I think, when people look back at these films, they will realise how important they were. When a movie releases in the midst of what you are living in, you may not realise its importance at that point in time but you will, five years down the line. It will impact change in the society and the thought process. It takes time for an actual change to come about in a society, but these films will help kick-start that process.

I have always believed that content is king. Whenever a story tugs at your heartstrings and has an emotional connect, it will find an audience. Now, how big a viewership it will get is when you need to look at the box office. Even if it's a moderate hit, you know that it has been liked. For me, the learning has been to always listen to your gut and instinct because when I signed both these movies, I didn't expect them to become the hits that they did. But I believed in the stories. I knew that I wanted these stories to be told because these subjects were relevant. It was about believing in myself and the stories. I also realised that if there is a producer willing to make a film like this, then as an actor, I have to back it too. Whether or not it does well, the intention is right. And when the film succeeds, that's a bonus because what you had set out to achieve, you have managed to meet it.

With Hichki, there were many more question marks because I was married, a mother. So, would the audience want to see me? That myth was broken and I realised a lot of people wanted to see me (smiles), so that was great. I can be part of the cinema and the stories I want to tell. At the same time, I love entertaining films, so whenever I do a film with a message, it is necessary to make them entertaining as well. Nobody wants to hear a lecture that's boring. I want to be part of films that can strike a balance between both these aspects. When I know that there's an audience who wants to see me, I can dabble in various genres. It gives me happiness to know that the viewer doesn't shut you out because you are married or have kids. They do that when you don't make good films, it's as simple as that.

I think there are some similarities between our cultures, backgrounds and family values. Perhaps, Hichki worked so well over there because they related to the teacher-student relationship. It's the victory of the script and content. The Chinese government really loved the movie and agreed to release it there. I remember being in a room full of Chinese audience watching a Hindi movie, clapping and crying. That was a surreal feeling. Then to meet professors from the university and for them to say they wanted to be like Naina... it was something else. Even when we had a screening in Mumbai for 300 teachers across Maharashtra, they and the principals got emotional. Many of them said Naina has become an inspiration to them. And I got to hear the same thing in China. That was amazing.

I can't really say that because I never faced that problem. In fact, I've always got meaty roles, right from Raja Ki Aayegi Baarat to Yuva or Black and Bunty Aur Babli. They were equal to the men or even more, but never less. As an actor, it's our responsibility to choose the right characters. It doesn't matter if it's like the one I did in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (Tina's part) but it has to be impactful. Length of a role is never the issue, the substance is what matters. Actors shouldn't confuse a bigger role with an important one. You could have a small part in the film, but it should leave an impact rather than being in the entire film and not making one. I have always wanted to do films that talk about the modern Indian woman. My roles have always depicted her. So, there's always a direct connect.

I don't really make any resolutions. Every new project that I sign becomes my resolution. I know that for this project, I need to achieve a set of goals. For Hichki, I needed to look like I did pre-motherhood. I wanted to get back in shape so that I would look the part. Now, I need to look like a cop for Mardaani 2, so my entire process will be dictated by that. Also, for me, it's very important that each day I spend with my daughter is special. So, to maintain a balance between my work and personal life is my resolution every year (laughs)."

Bogibeel, the longest rail-road bridge of India, spanning nearly five-km across the Brahmaputra, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 25. It will link Dibrugarh with North Lakhimpur district of Assam and parts of eastern Arunachal Pradesh. The event, marked with much fanfare, was hailed by many as a historic milestone in the development of the Northeastern region.

One could wonder, what is so special about a bridge that has taken 16 years to complete? Should we really be rejoicing over the completion of an infrastructure project, which has missed its timelines several times? The brouhaha over a bridge may even invite disdain in the drawing rooms of Lutyens Delhi. But for thousands of poor people, living in eastern Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, this is truly a momentous occasion.

Sixty eight years after being ravaged by a devastating earthquake and the ensuing floods, Dibrugarh is reclaiming its lost glory. It used to be a thriving centre of the plantation industry during the colonial times. For the people of the region, it remains a hub of higher education and medical treatment. However, for decades, the only recourse for people to cross the Brahmaputra would be to chug along for over an hour, in a diesel propelled ferry, which would also carry their vehicles and goods, even cattle. Crossing the river could be a costlier proposition than flying between Mumbai and Goa. All this is set to change. Commissioning the bridge has reduced the journey time across the river to less than five minutes, bringing relief to people living in these remote parts.

The single biggest factor which has shackled the development of the Northeast region is the absence of robust connectivity. A maze of river systems across Arunachal Pradesh, with their confluence in the Brahmaputra, have posed an enormous challenge. The commissioning of Bogibeel, therefore, is a harbinger of hope. The bridge's significance goes well beyond the succour to local residents. It has the potential to infuse economic dynamism in the region and provide opportunities for the expansion of tourism, industrial development and trade.

Bogibeel must be viewed alongside other infrastructure developments in neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh. The iconic Bhupen Hazarika bridge over the Lohit river was commissioned recently by the prime minister. A 7.5 km long bridge over the Dibang river was dedicated to the nation a few days ago. The Trans Arunachal Highway, has seen considerable progress, especially in the eastern part of the state. An airport has been commissioned at Pasighat, barely two hours away from Dibrugarh. One of the most pristine parts of Arunachal Pradesh has now become accessible to the rest of the world. This could give a fillip to tourism, given that the region has abundant wildlife and is ideal for river rafting and angling. However, an imaginative roadmap of tourism development, promotion and branding needs to be crafted, centred around the region's tribal ethos.

Dibrugarh lies at the heart of a crucial oil and gas axis in Assam, given its proximity to Digboi and Duliajan oilfields. Further east lie the Kharsang gas fields and Kumchai oilfields of Arunachal Pradesh. The district also has significant coal deposits. There are more than 200 tea factories in Dibrugarh. Commissioning of the bridge has raised the prospects of industrial development and opportunities of productive employment for the youth, especially in the mining and plantation sectors.

Bogibeel is the gateway to the historic Stilwell Road, which connects Ledo in Assam to Kunming in China, passing through Myanmar's Kachin state, via Arunachal Pradesh. The 1,800 km long route was used for transporting arms to the Chinese by the Americans during World War II. Its revival for trade is well within grasp now. The route could well become the centrepiece of the ambitious Act East Policy. It would follow the Asian Highway (AH )14 and reach Kunming along AH3. The Chinese stretch has a six-lane highway, while the Indian side in Arunachal Pradesh has a two-lane highway. Infrastructure in Myanmar, of course, would need to be strengthened and the land customs station at Nampong in Arunachal Pradesh revived. Trade could revitalise economic activity, in what is otherwise one of the most backward parts of Arunachal Pradesh.

From a strategic standpoint, movement of troops has become a much quicker, efficient and reliable proposition. The road beyond Dibrugarh leads to the frontier parts of Arunachal Pradesh, with a fully functional advanced landing ground of Air Force at Walong, barely 100 km from the Chinese border. This was a theatre of armed incursion in 1962. Now access to one of the remotest border outposts in Anjaw has been made much easier.

Bogibeel is poised to usher winds of change in this part of the world. However, the advantage of connectivity must be accompanied by an imaginative blueprint of economic development, drawing upon the region's advantages. The symbolism of Bogibeel goes well beyond the Brahmaputra.

The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2018, passed by the Lok Sabha recently, has caused great alarm. Transgender and intersex activists have protested on the streets, campaigned with parliamentarians and spoken out against the Bill. Is it not an irony that all of this is being done to ensure that the law is not passed? Why is there such a strong resistance to this Bill? Here are the main concerns.

In the landmark NALSA v. Union of India judgment, the Supreme Court laid down that transgender and intersex persons have the constitutional right to self-identify their gender as male, female or transgender even without medical intervention. The court held: ""Each person's self-defined sexual orientation and gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom and no one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including SRS, sterilization or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity"". Hence, medical procedures should not be required as a pre-condition for any identity documents for transgender and intersex persons, nor should there be any requirement of a mental health assessment. Requiring a person to submit proof of medical treatment or mental health assessment of their gender identity violates one's right to dignity, the right to be free from unwanted medical treatment and the right to be free from discrimination.

The 2018 Bill in Section 6 establishes a District Screening Committee for the purpose of recognition of transgender persons. This Screening Committee includes a chief medical officer and a psychologist/psychiatrist, which goes to show that medical and psychological tests would be required for grant of change of gender identity. There is no provision in the Bill that gender change would be permitted without medical or psychological treatment.

The Bill also does not allow for recognition of gender identity as male or female. It only allows for an identity certificate as 'transgender'. This goes against the decision of the Supreme Court, which recognised the right to self-identify oneself as male, female or transgender and would also be forcing intersex persons to get a gender identity as ""transgender"".

The U.K.'s Gender Recognition Act 2004 was the first law in the world allowing people to change gender without surgery. Since then other countries, including Argentina, Ireland and Denmark, have passed laws that allow people to 'self-declare' their gender, rather than seek approval from a panel of medical experts.

Hence the District Screening Committee needs to be removed from the 2018 Bill. The Bill needs to state explicitly that no medical or mental health examination will be required and applicants will simply need to submit an affidavit attesting the request for a change of gender identity.

Debates on the Bill have always included the demand for reservations for transgender and intersex persons in educational institutions and in public employment as they are seen to be crucial for their social inclusion. This was not only mandated by the Supreme Court in NALSA, the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill 2014 too provided for 2% reservation.

Surprisingly the 2018 Bill does not provide for any reservation. It provides in Sections 10 and 14 that there would be no discrimination in education and employment, but these rights are meaningless if transgender persons are not able to get access in the first place. Equality would demand that in order for the trans and intersex community to get access to their basic social rights, there should be horizontal reservation in education and employment provided to them. When the new Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 was passed, it included reservations of 5% and 4% in education and government jobs, respectively. It is surprising therefore that the 2018 Bill has no mention of similar provisions.

The Bill in Section 19 makes it a criminal offence for anyone to compel a transgender person into begging. This has serious implications. A large number of people from the trans and intersex community are engaged in begging and sex work due to discrimination and not having any other opportunities. This provision would lead to members of the trans community being criminalised. When the criminalising of begging itself has been held to be unconstitutional by the Delhi High Court, there is no place for this offence in the 2018 Bill. For too long, gender minorities have been criminalised for being out in the streets and in public, and having this offence in the Bill will lead to further criminalising of transgender lives.

In all these ways the 2018 Bill is seriously flawed. It does not have a whole gamut of positive rights such as the rights of trans and intersex persons to inheritance of property, rights within the family such as adoption and to be free from domestic violence, rights of political participation such as the right to vote and hold public office, and the right to health to include free sex reassignment treatments. It also does not make sexual violence against transgender and intersex persons a criminal offence. The current law on rape is gender specific and transgender persons have no recourse under criminal law for sexual assault.

The Bill is an opportunity to ensure that the constitutional rights of transgender and intersex persons are realised. Let us not lose this opportunity by passing such a flawed legislation."

All 56 papers of 20 marks each, albeit a revision test, would serve as a mock exam just to give the students the feel of the Boards and also help students to understand areas they need to focus on. By December 31, all government schools under the DSE across the State will receive these papers.

""In the last exam most students failed in Math and Science so we have decided to focus on revisions. From January 2 for the next 3-4 days students will do revision and then appear for the practice test which has been prepared by a panel of experts,"" explained B Venkata Narassama, District Education Officer, Hyderabad.

In addition, the DSE has also organised a day-long orientation programme for Math and Science teachers on how to conduct revision, evaluation of answer sheets and helping students clear backlogs.

Five worst performing districts in health and nutrition and three of five districts in basic infrastructure sectors are also from Jharkhand, according to the ranking.

The ranking details the incremental progress achieved by the districts during June to October this year across six key development sectors.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the ADP in January this year to transform the districts that have shown relatively less progress in key development sectors. Jharkhand's 19 districts are in the Centre's aspirational district programme in which a total of 111 ""aspirational"" districts were ranked.

However, there is some good news too as Jharkhand's Ramgarh and Gumla districts achieved second and third positions in skill development and education indicators in the country. Ranchi figured in top 10 district list of 'fast movers.' Ranchi, which had ranked 106 in June's ranking, jumped to 10 in current ranking of Niti Aayog for increasing pace of the improvements.

Pakur district was put at bottom (111 rank), while Chatra and Giridih at 109 and 108 positions respectively. Other two districts in bottom five list are Hailakandi of Assam and Kiphire of Nagaland.

Pakur deputy commissioner (DC) Kuldeep Chaudhary said, ""I joined as DC in Pakur just a month before. The ranking is based on the data between June and October. So, I cannot comment on this. One thing I can say for sure that Pakur's performance would improve in the next ranking.""

The DC said he has been constantly reviewing the progress in every sector as per the action plan of aspirational districts. ""I have directed the officials to implement the action plan so that required improvement could be achieved,"" Chaudhary said.

Giridih deputy commissioner, Neha Arora, said she would comment after going through the ranking list.

NITI Aayog, however, asked five bottom districts to pick up the pace and ensure sustained progress in every development sector.

Releasing the second delta ranking in New Delhi, NITI Aayog chief executive officer (CEO) Amitabh Kant said, ""We have constantly endeavoured to ensure transparent, real-time measurement of qualitative development in Aspirational Districts through the use of third-party validated data. This will strengthen the spirit of competitive and cooperative federalism on the foundations of evidence-based policy making.""

NITI Aayog's knowledge partners Tata Trust and BMGF (IDInsight) carried out household surveys in all aspirational districts during the month of June this year covering over one lakh households. Six key development sectors-education, health & nutrition, financial inclusion, agriculture & water resources, basic infrastructure and skill development were assessed in the districts.

According to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) FIR, the case was registered after a complaint was made by the US embassy and a preliminary enquiry was conducted.

The CBI has named Balraj Singh, owner of Kings Punjab Travels, Gagan Gupta, a resident of Pathankot, Chetan Sabharwal, a resident of Chandigarh, Lovepreet Singh, a resident of Tarn Taran and Tilak Raj of Hoshiarpur in Punjab and other unknown persons.

In its email complaint to the CBI on February 7, 2018, the US Embassy's Assistant Regional Security Officer-Investigator William J. Aylward said that on August 10, 2017, a United Airlines security official posted at the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) in Delhi contacted the US embassy officials to report that a woman by the name of Gagan Gupta was attempting to travel to the US with four children.

""The United Airlines officials stated that the children and Gupta were unable to corroborate the reason for travelling to the US and the physical appearances of the children did not match with the photos in their passports.""

The CBI registered a preliminary enquiry on April 28, 2018.

During investigations, it was found that Gupta was attempting to traffic the children namely Amanpreet Singh Multani, Akashdeep Singh, Mohit and an unidentified child under the assumed names of Karanveer Singh, Sambhav, Milan Mehra and Inderdeep to the US as students of St. Joseph's Convent School.

""She misrepresented herself as principal of St. Joseph's Convent School, authorised to take the minors for an 'educational trip' to the US,"" the agency said.

The CBI also found that Balraj Singh helped in arranging the visas and school identity cards for the children, while Sabharwal had earlier approached the school for facilitating an ""education tour"" to the US for its students. He had also facilitated interviews for the students and staff members with the US embassy in New Delhi.

Lovepreet Singh and Tilak Raj were booked for helping in bringing the children from Punjab to New Delhi and arranging for their accommodation and tickets to the US.

The agency charged them under sections of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and human trafficking.

In a similar case of trafficking, the CBI also registered a case against Kala, a resident of Punjab and Aryan, a resident of Delhi, over illegal trafficking of minor girls to Kenya on the pretext of providing employment.

Three girls were rescued by the Indian High Commission in Kenya.

It will be rolled out on an experimental basis for the primary students of classes 5 and 6 in the first phase, Ganjam District Collector, Vijay Amruta Kulange, said.

The online teaching through smartphones in Odia medium schools is Kulange's brainchild.

The district administration has started preparation to record some of the best classes taken by teachers in various subjects in primary sections, which will be available on YouTube and WhatsApp, the official said.

""If things move smoothly, the system will be available by the end of February 2019,"" Kulange said.

Since most of the students are cell phone savvy and mobile phones are available in almost all households, this method of online learning will help students in their home studies, Kulange said.

This would also help them to learn about the subjects taught in classrooms when they remain absent, he said.

""Not only the students of Ganjam, it will also be shared with students of other districts,"" he said.

The online education will be an additional input to the students besides classroom education, said district education officer (DEO), Ganjam Sanatan Panda.

The first information report, filed on court orders, also names her mother and an uncle. The case was registered against the three on a complaint by the father of another rape accused, who is in jail, said senior police officer Harish Kumar on Thursday.

He said complainant had alleged that the survivor, her uncle and mother had procured a forged age certificate to implicate his son Shubham in the rape case, said Kumar.

The police said the case was registered against the family members under sections related to cheating and forgery.

The complainant had moved the court saying the school transfer certificate, purportedly made by Raebareli school and produced as the age certificate, was forged to frame his son, police said.

The survivor's uncle is presently in jail in connection with another case. The complainant's wife and son are accused in the rape case and have been in jail since April along with the main accused, BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

Sengar, a four-time lawmaker from Unnao, was charged by the CBI with raping the girl at his residence in Makhi village on June 4 last year.

The girl was again abducted and raped by a separate group of accused, allegedly including complainant's son Shubhan Singh, his driver Naresh Tiwari and one Brijesh Yadav between June 11 and June 20, 2017.

The complainant, Harpal Singh alleged that the rape survivor had an affair with a man named Awadesh Tewari, with whom she had eloped in September 2017, and returned sometime later.

After she returned, her family had begun persuading his son Shubham to marry her, the complaint said.

When Shubham refused to marry her, the family filed a case against him and his mother on charges of kidnapping as well as various offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, alleged Haripal Singh.

He also alleged that the rape survivor's family had forged her age certificate with a fake date of birth, purportedly issued from a school in Raebareli as proof.

Both the education department official and the school principal have denied signing the certificate, Haripal Singh claimed.

The Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government's ""inaction"" against the party lawmaker in the case had drawn scathing criticism from the Allahabad High Court.

The state government had subsequently transferred the case to the CBI nearly 10 months after the alleged crime took place."

On a typically cold summer evening in Liverpool, it's business as usual for Tatenda Taibu. He's at St Mary's college to pick his 13-year-old son, Tatenda Junior, from school. The usual daily elaborative review talk starts, and from Math, English, Arts, Music, it veers towards sports.

Tatenda Jr: Dad, the coaches showed us (Class 7 students) a video where players were hitting big sixes. There was this big guy, tall left-hander...

Taibu: Chris Gayle?

Tatenda Jr: Yes, yes, yes. How do you know?

Taibu: I thought it was him because he hits the ball a long way

Tatenda Jr: You know him?

Taibu: Yes, I do

Tatenda Jr: How?

Taibu: I played against him, and with him, and was communicating with him 3 weeks ago.

Tatenda Jr: No dad, you are lying

Taibu: Look here on my phone (shows videos of him playing cricket with Gayle).

Tatenda Jr (looks in disbelief)

Taibu: Let's get home and I will show you more.

A simple conversation between father and son would serve as the straw that would break the camel's back and bring Tatenda Taibu back to cricket after six years.

""You know with my family, even when I was playing and my boy was old enough (3-6 years) to understand a little bit between, I never took cricket back home,"" Taibu tells Firstpost. ""Cricket remained at the ground and when I went home, I wanted my boy to know me as a dad and not as a superstar.""

Unaware that his father played for the Zimbabwe national team and against some big stars, Tatenda Jr stared at the phone in disbelief as his father showed him more videos of his top innings after reaching home.

""Cricket remained at the ground and when I went home, I wanted my boy to know me as a dad and not as a superstar."" Image courtesy Tatenda Taibu

""He (Tatenda Jr) sort of knew that dad is famous but he didn't know what dad was famous for. I thought, let me tell him a bit more about what I achieved in cricket because I never really talked about my achievements at home. So then he said, 'I would really love to see you play, I would really love to see how you played'. So I said I will give my boy a chance to watch me.""

The decision was made on an impulse, in consultation with his wife, Loveness Taibu, who has always been a supportive force. The doting father decided to return to professional cricket so that his son could watch him play.

When Taibu decides to take up something, he gives it his 100 percent. Just three months after having that conversation with his son, Taibu was back on the field, playing professional cricket in the Sri Lankan domestic arena. Signed as an overseas player for Baduraliya CC, his first four innings scores read: 13, 57, 39 and 13.

Ahead of the first match, it felt like someone had hit the reboot button.

""I felt nerves. I felt like I was playing on debut again. But as soon as I stepped onto the field, I felt it as a familiar place and the nerves quickly went away.

And then he animatedly singles out the 57-run innings and says with a tinge of regret, ""I should have scored a hundred (in the second innings of the first match). When I got to 50, there was still enough time. I definitely should have got a hundred, I was feeling very good. I kept as well, took 2 catches and haven't conceded any byes so far, so it's been good.""

So why play domestic cricket in Sri Lanka and not Zimbabwe?

Having visited the country in the past, he knew that the Sri Lankan first-class cricket was ""quite competitive."" And secondly, he needed to speak to someone who understood him well. So he got in touch with his good friend Roshan Abeysinghe, a long time broadcaster and commentator, and after a heart-to-heart discussion where some tough questions were asked, Abheysinghe put Taibu's name forward in the Sri Lankan domestic arena.

""I knew that I will walk into the domestic arena of Zimbabwe and score runs. I wanted something challenging, I like a challenge and I like to overcome a challenge,"" Taibu explains. ""I never played first-class cricket in Sri Lanka, I don't know most of the bowlers. I have only faced one or two that I have played with before. So I am facing new bowlers, new conditions, new team, and new environment. Everything is new. So for me, it's a proper test of my ability. If I do well in that, I will have the satisfaction that I can still play the game.""

The preparations had accelerated ahead of the Sri Lankan domestic season. The family had joined in to help. His wife and son would feed the balls in the bowling machine provided by his club where he played some cricket and coached in Liverpool.

Bereft of a team environment and cricket set-up, Loveness would help her husband schedule practices and instill discipline along with keeping a constant vigil to avoid complacency.

At 35, it is a given that the first question Taibu would have faced was about his fitness. That, however, is the least of his concerns.

""Gladly, I have always kept fit and I knew that just hitting a few balls in the nets over the bowling machine will get me back into form,"" Taibu asserts.

""Look, when I stopped playing cricket, I never really stopped training, even physical training. When I made the decision (to come back to competitive cricket), my schedule included running 7 kms on the beach, twice a week and then the other days in between, I would be doing sprints on the beach. I did all my fitness on the sand. So in terms of fitness, it's probably the easiest thing for me. I would not be lying if I said I am probably one of the fittest cricketers in the world. Without a doubt,"" he adds.

Tatenda Taibu became the youngest captain in the history of Test cricket when he led Zimbabwe against Sri Lanka at Harare in 2004. Reuters

Taibu is no stranger to comebacks. And this was yet another twist in his life that has endured an Afridiesque curve. The diminutive 18-year-old Shona from Harare arrived on the cricketing scene as a promising wicket-keeper-batsman touted to be a potential successor of Andy Flower. He became Zimbabwe's first black captain, the youngest in the world, at 20. He then resigned from the captaincy, quit cricket, moved to South Africa, returned, and then again announced retirement at the age of 29 in 2012 finishing as the fourth-highest run-getter in ODIs for Zimbabwe, affecting the second-most dismissals in a decade-long international career. His decision to quit the second time came as a surprise as just hours ago, he had been named in Zimbabwe's provisional squad for 2012 World T20. However, at the time, his heart was somewhere else - towards the Lord.

""I had felt a calling in my heart to do some church work and I was on a spiritual journey at that time,"" Taibu explains. ""I needed to find some peace in my heart and that was the calling that I believe I had. And my character is such that, when I am looking at a certain direction, I can't look at other things around. I just look at where I want to go and hit and then I focus on that. So when I was focusing all my energy on my spiritual journey, even cricket became a distraction. I was not giving cricket my 100 percent attention which I was giving to my soul-searching. So, cricket had to go.""

Taibu set off to do work for churches. He was a trustee at a church where he would take care of the overall operations - look after the assets of the church, make sure the building is intact, benches, piano, and musical instruments are working. He took care of electricity and water bills and distributed money, food, and transport to the poor besides being part of the group that was praying for sick people.

Disconnected totally from cricket, it was a life changing experience. ""I found that to be fulfilling in my heart. It gives you constant satisfaction to the day. I cannot describe it. Even though I got no cent the satisfaction it brings even when I talk about it now, cannot be measured with money.""

All through this, he was living on the money generated from renting posh houses purchased during his playing days. He was doing some business with his Indian friends and was a shareholder in a gold mining company. But with the political and economic condition deteriorating in the country Taibu shifted base to the United Kingdom in 2015 where he enrolled his children in St Mary's college to give them the best education possible. Being on a tier 4 visa (the visa is issued to a parent in support of a child who is doing their education in UK), the 35-year-old is not allowed to work in the UK and he still lives mainly off the money from the rented houses.

""I wasn't foolish with money when I was earning a lot as a player,"" he says. ""I had bought several nice houses and rented them out. They cost about 1200-1400 USD monthly. That's a lot of money. That's quite comfortable and I have been living like that since I left cricket.

It was after four years, he returned to the field, playing for Liverpool and District team Hightown St Mary's where he coached the kids too and also opened an academy.

And then again, life took another turn. Taibu was back with Zimbabwe Cricket as convener of selectors and development officer. It was a year-long on-off conversation with Zimbabwe Cricket chairman Tavengwa Mukuhlani which started when he bumped into him at a bank in Bulawayo, that culminated into the former captain taking up the position after a lot of convincing.

He didn't take the proposal seriously at first given his tumultuous relationship with the board over the years. But after some intense one-to-one conversations with Mukhulani, he decided to take up the job.

After almost two years in charge, he was sacked earlier this year, along with coach Heath Streak and captain Graeme Cremer after Zimbabwe failed to qualify for the 2019 World Cup. The lack of (or no) communication and explanation from Mukhulani after sacking left Taibu unhappy.

At 35, Taibu has seen it all and still going strong. However, he doesn't want to go overboard. A national return is still far away from sight. He wants to take a realistic route rather than an idealistic one.

""I haven't thought that far. Because to start thinking about international, I have to be comfortable in first-class and I have to have the confidence that my body is still in shape, I have to have the confidence that I will score hundreds, I have to have the confidence that I will take not only good catches but great catches. So it's a little bit too early to be thinking about that.""

It will also mean moving back to Zimbabwe along with making sure that his other projects, which are under the supervision of his agent and wife in his absence, aren't affected. He might take a decision on the next step at the end of the Sri Lankan season, around March-April. Then spend the summer with family before getting back onto the field for club cricket.

All through the chat, the excitement in Taibu's voice is palpable. Just like his inexhaustible energy, the nostalgia factor too hasn't gone away. Every time he has a conversation with ones who know the game, memories come back.

""They remind me that I used to hold the record for the youngest captain in the history of Test cricket. I am reminded about that all the time. Every time I am in India, I am reminded about playing in Kolkata (for Kolkata Knight Riders). Only two days ago, someone sent me a message saying 'I didn't know you were the player of the tournament in the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand.' We played against SSC here whose coach is Thilina Kandambi, he asked me, do you remember you once bowled me out in a one-day game? So yes, when people send messages, I have to remember those things. It brings back memories.""

""I think, I have passed that stage where I think for myself now. All the decisions I make now it's either for my wife or kids, it's never me anymore.""

So, just like the Chanderpauls, is there a chance we could see the Taibus playing together? Well, Taibu senior has no plans of getting his son into professional cricket.

""He doesn't have the basic talent for a cricketer. He loves the sport but doesn't want to practice. I have only done practice with my boy twice. He doesn't want it. He would play for school or club, score two runs, not take a wicket and come back and say, I enjoyed the cricket today. From a young age, I was taught to enjoy cricket and I enjoyed my cricket when we won. But with him, they can lose, he won't have contributed but still, he will come back and say, 'Dad, I enjoyed my cricket today' (laughs). So I am happy with him like that.""

It might seem far-fetched but if it does happen, what would it feel like donning that Zimbabwe jersey again?

""The feeling will not be for me but my boy. I think I have passed that stage where I think for myself. All the decisions I make now it's either for my wife or kids, it's never me anymore.""

From darkness to light. Or so I thought when I heard about my shifting from the dark dungeons of coal mines, as coal secretary, to the bright lights of school education, as secretary for school education and literacy.

However, I discovered soon that in the coal sector, mining was underground and mafias operated above it, but in the minefield of school education, it was the other way round. All the education mafias existed underground, and they were all masked, masquerading as so-called noble giants. Having taken on some of the mafias of the coal sector and partly succeeded in bringing the sector to order, the task was now to handle these 'noble giants'. It was made more difficult as there was no public outrage against invisible scams in education as was in the case of coal.

Everything seemed to be apparently in order.

To make matters worse, I was the fifth person to hold the charge of secretary in the education department in just two and a half years. Most of my predecessors with impeccable credentials in the education sector did not continue or were not allowed to continue. The government apparently found in me to be the most 'educated' person (I had never worked in this sector except for a brief tenure of three months in 1997 in adult education in Uttar Pradesh) to handle this sector.

It would be an understatement to state that the education sector was in bad shape - both in terms of budgetary allocation and human resource management.

The budgetary allocation for school education was Rs 55,115 crores during 2014-15. This amount got reduced in subsequent years. For instance, the allocation for 2016-17 was Rs 43,554 crore.

On the human resource front too, the situation was alarming. The department had five secretaries between 2014 and 2016. A number of joint secretaries were also changed during this period. It was like musical chairs reminiscent of my days in UP where it was rumoured that the only industry flourishing was the transfer industry.

In the two biggest states of the country, the positioning of top management followed a peculiar pattern. Whereas in UP, there were two additional chief secretary-level officers manning school education and secondary education separately (creating huge coordination problems), in the state of Bihar, one officer looked after both the education and health departments. Consequently, the health of education continues to suffer.

In addition to this, the mafias were having a field day, eating into the system, like termites. Fortunately, like all mafias, those in the education sector too were not a majority, but played a dominant role in decision-making. They were extremely well connected and deeply entrenched. There were a host of mafias, but the prominent ones were operating in these areas:

There are around 16,000 B.Ed and D.El.Ed colleges in the country. A large number of these exist only in name. If you pay them well, you can get a degree without an effort. It was rumoured that if you pay them more, they could even arrange for a 'naukri' (a government job). Action was initiated by then chairman of National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) Santosh Mathews, an upright officer, by issuing notices to all the colleges to furnish the details of their existence on affidavits. The idea was to ensure that only those that actually existed got recognition and in case of wrong information they could be prosecuted. It worked initially, but the colleges realised that quite a few of them could be in trouble. Despite the support he got from most of the states, he was put under enormous pressure by the mafias who took the 'judicial' route to pin down the chairman. He had to quit.

In a few northern states of the country, a number of examination centres are given on 'theka' (contract) for copying. These centres are highly 'priced' as they facilitate mass copying or cheating during examinations. The current chief minister of UP, Yogi Adityanath, came down heavily on this mafia. This was last done by Kalyan Singh in 1991, but thereafter no chief minister could dare to do that. Consequent to the steps taken in UP in this year's exams, more than one million students chose not to give exams. It is a reflection of the 'addiction' to mass copying.

The publishing industry thrives on the education sector. People with vested interests want to maintain status quo as this benefits them. It happens at two levels. As respective state governments provide free books to students, there are various ways in which money is made. The 'mandatory cuts' in getting the books printed centrally constitutes a substantial portion. The initiative taken by the UP government in 2018 and the consequent savings thereunder lends credence to this allegation. The Bihar government is toying with the idea of direct benefit transfers recognising the 'dealings' inherent in central printing and distribution.

The other level of money making is done by a handful of private publishers who enter into an 'arrangement' with the private schools in the name of quality, and compel the students to buy almost four to five times more expensive books as compared to the NCERT ones. If all the students of around 20,000 CBSE-affiliated schools were to source NCERT books, there would be an estimated annual expenditure of around Rs 650 crores. Compared to this, if they source books from private publishers, it would cost around Rs 3,000 crores per annum. The difference is too great to justify the quality argument.

The NCERT did a wonderful job in the current academic year to ensure that books were available on time so that the students were not compelled to buy expensive books, but this effort will need to continue. The NCERT will always be under pressure from people with vested interests to be 'inefficient'.

Most of the private schools in India contribute enormously to imparting quality education. However, some of them are bringing a bad name to this segment. There are some extremely powerful individuals who are able to get away with the most immoral things in education. They violate various norms, legal and ethical, with impunity because having been part of the official machinery at some point in time they know the tricks of the trade.

Irrational hiking of fee, charging huge sums of money to 'lend' their brand, harassing the brand assignees are some of the many tricks they practice. The chairperson of the CBSE Rajesh Chatur who chose to take them on was shown the door in 2017. His successor, Anita Karwal, one of the finest civil servants, was also set to be 'sacrificed'. But she held her ground despite pressure.

The good news in all of this is yet again from UP where the state has enacted a law on the fee regulation after consulting all the stakeholders. Hence, the legislation has been welcomed by all. Hopefully, other states will follow suit.

'Employers on most occasions find it difficult to find a match between the two,' Adi Godrej tells Viveat Susan Pinto and Niraj Bhatt.

As we enter the sprawling Godrej facilities in the Mumbai suburb of Vikhroli to meet group Chairman Adi Godrej for our lunch meeting, the first thing we notice are the changes taking place.

A landscaped garden, the under-construction buildings and the new headquarters all suggest that it is no longer a conservative, 121-year-old group.

Tall structures have replaced the understated three-storeyed buildings, announcing the group's real estate ambitions.

<>Godrej One, the new 11-storeyed headquarters, is the first building under The Trees, a mixed-use development master plan, which will have commercial, retail, residential, a five-star hotel and cultural spaces.

The other change is Adi Godrej handing over the reins at key operating companies last year to his children, while he continues as chairman at the group level and at Godrej Industries.

Known for his disciplined lifestyle, Godrej, an early riser, walks to stay fit and makes it to office at quarter past eight every morning.

He's also on time for our lunch, slated at 1 pm at the directors' dining hall on the fifth floor of Godrej One.

The Godrej family, whose net worth, according to the Forbes 2018 ranking, is $14 billion, derives a significant portion of its wealth from owning land in Vikhroli.

Godrej Properties, the group's real estate arm, says Godrej, holds enormous promise as the demand for quality housing grows in Mumbai and other cities.

The Godrej group is the largest real estate owner of Mumbai with 4,000 acres, and The Trees project is part of the group's monetisation exercise.

Other listed group companies include Godrej Consumer, Godrej Industries and Godrej Agrovet.

The directors' dining hall overlooks the Eastern Express Highway and the verdant mangroves beyond, which the family trusts protects.

An imposing Anjolie Ela Menon adds colour to the otherwise white room.

As we are served Mexican bean soup and corn cheese toast, the 76-year-old Godrej is quick to point out that he is not an art connoisseur and the painting was bought by his wife Parmeshwar who passed away two years ago.

In a sense, she was the perfect foil to Godrej, say industry peers, outgoing to his largely reserved nature, a fashionista to his more formal dressing style, a woman who led her life to the fullest.

Unlike his billionaire peers, Godrej doesn't find it necessary to own a corporate jet, preferring to fly commercial or occasionally chartering aircraft.

He says about his wife: ""She added her own dimension. She had a lot of friends; was social. She also helped in the business, with advertising (for brands such as Cinthol) as well as in new product formulations.""

Parmeshwar's work on improving AIDS awareness in the country along with actor Richard Gere as part of the 'Heroes Project' a decade-and-a-half ago is well-known.

Godrej himself remains passionate about healthcare, education and environmental sustainability.

He recently stepped down as chairman of the board of Indian School of Business, but continues to be on the board.

He has championed the cause of effective skilling and training of people at various fora.

""I don't think there is a dearth of jobs in India. What exists instead is a clear gap between skilled people and the work at hand. Employers on most occasions find it difficult to find a match between the two, which is why it is important to focus on skill training,"" he says.

Joint ventures stitched up by the Godrej Group across categories from appliances to personal care, wheat flour to packaged food, following the 1991 liberalisation of the Indian economy, were rolled out quickly, but didn't last long.

Godrej has no regrets about them saying, ""They were not useful beyond a point.""

In the last 10 years, the group has opted to take the inorganic route to growth, buying companies across Asia, Africa and South America.

Godrej says the group's focus remains mainly on these markets and that it is open to divestment opportunities elsewhere, such as the one it undertook recently in the UK, where the group exited Keyline Brands, its first overseas acquisition, done in 2005.

Godrej does not have any diversification plans on the table, but will ""enter adjacencies"".

The macro headwinds that India is facing at present do not bother him.

India, he says, will be the fastest growing major economy in the world despite all the challenges.

His advice to the next generation is to ""look forward to Mondays"".

Godrej, who holds a bachelor's degree in engineering and an MBA both from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is passionate about management.

""My father was into technology while I was more into management,"" he says.

Godrej, say corporate governance experts, has always relied on a healthy board comprising qualified practitioners and was amongst the first to introduce independent directors on the boards of group companies in India.

""The way to avoid a conflict is to take a thought or idea to the board early on the decision-making process,"" he says over the main course of ratatouille lasagna.

The Godrej model of ownership has also been keenly tracked by observers that involves inducting qualified family members into the business, encouraging them to contribute meaningfully to the organisation in their chosen domain and working closely with professional managers in the group.

Godrej's three children -- Tanya, Nisaba and Pirojsha -- have all been through this process, he says, who are now heading group companies after working their way up.

While Tanya is the chairperson of Godrej Nature's Basket, Nisaba heads the Godrej Consumer board, while Pirojsha is chairman, Godrej Properties.

Though Godrej has given his children the freedom to run their companies, he still oversees operations as group chairman.

""They are qualified and capable of running their businesses well. While we keep ownership and management separate, if anybody from the family wants to join the business, our point is that you have to be well qualified to do so,"" he says as the table is cleared for dessert, which includes cut fruits.

The Godrej Group has also been at the forefront when hiring women, giving them flexi-hours and daycare facilities, and has been one of the early employers of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community in its offices across the globe.

""We were early believers in diversity and felt that we should have a strong representation of women in our organisation. Globally, 40 per cent of our employees are women. In certain geographies such as Africa, Indonesia and the north east of India, the percentage of women employees is even higher,"" Godrej says.

It had also set up a committee for sexual harassment complaints years ago.

""We gave women the option to complain if they faced a problem,"" he says.

His love for travel has taken Godrej to 95 countries across the seven continents.

A supporter of the World Wildlife Fund in India, Godrej prefers nature and likes to get away to the mountains.

He loves reading autobiographies and biographies and has been greatly influenced by leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Margaret Thatcher.

""Right now I am reading Ramchandra Guha's Gandhi: The Years That Changed the World. This is possibly the thickest book I've ever read,"" he says on his favourite pastime.

""I am fascinated by the fact that Socrates was Plato's tutor, Plato was Aristotle's tutor and Aristotle was Alexander's tutor. I have read about them all and the impact they've had,"" he says as we finish our coffee."

2. Disgruntled Gujarat Congress Leaders Meet at Modhwadia's House

Several disgruntled Congress leaders and legislators met at the residence of senior leader Arjun Modhwadia here late Wednesday night and expressed dissatisfaction about the party's state leadership.

The meeting followed the opposition party's loss in Jasdan Assembly by-election. Speaking to the media later, many of those who attended the meeting hit out at state Congress chief Amit Chavda without naming him.

Alpesh Thakor told reporters that the meeting was aimed at drawing the high command's attention to 'some lacuna' in the state leadership.

""We strongly believe that importance should be given to experienced, committed and strong leaders who are known as mass leaders and who are fighting for people. We will communicate this to the central leadership,"" he said.

3. DEO Starts Surprise Checks to Weigh Schoolbags

Following a directive issued by the state government, the District Education Officer (DEO) conducted checks in 35 schools and found that the weight of the bags was heavier by 2 kgs for almost all students studying in Class I and II.

The DEO not only examined the bags, but he also weighed them. According to officials students are carrying bags heavier that what the government has prescribed. The education department has asked the DEO to conduct inspections in three schools each week.

In the last week of November, the Gujarat government announced that it will act against schools where students carry bulky bags laden with books.

4. Ahmedabad Churns Half of SME IPOs from Gujarat

Ahmedabad-based Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) are going bullish on raising funds through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). Ahmedabad accounted for half of the SME IPOs launched by Gujarat firms in 2018 with 25 out of the 47 IPOs churned out from the state, followed by Rajkot and Surat.

The city also grabbed a lions share in total funds mobilised via SME IPOs in 2018. Of the total Rs 568 crore firms based in Ahmedabad raised Rs 236 crore. However Maharashtra remained on top by earning Rs 785 crore through SME IPOs in 2018 and Gujarat was second.

Across India as many as 143 SME IPOs came to the market and raised Rs 2406 crore which was higher than Rs 1,738 crore raised from 133 offers in 2017.

On 30 January 2019, or by the first week of February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to lay the foundation stone at the Rs 1,000 crore Umiya Dham, developed by the powerful Kadva Patidar community in Ahmedabad.

This will be the PM's second visit to Gujarat after making a trip to the state for the Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2019. For the state BJP, the event will be significant to regain its strong Patidar vote bank for the 2019 General elections after the Patidar reservation movement dented the BJP's image.

The Vishwa Umiya Foundation has said that the Umiya Dham will be spread across an area of 2 lakh square meters.

The officials said that in majority of the cases, the students were found to be carrying bags heavier than what the government has prescribed. In some of the schools, the management had followed the government resolution and made changes in the time-table.

The state government had earlier issued a directive to all district education officers and district primary education officers to conduct surprise raids in schools and check the weight of schoolbags carried by children.

The education department has asked all DEOs to carry out checks in at least three schools every week irrespective of the board to which a school belongs. DEOs have been asked to check schools affiliated to Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board according to Gujarat government rules, while those affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education will be checked according to CBSE standards.

Sources said that V Balakrishnan IPS, joint commissioner of police (Chennai Central Crime Branch) was asked to leave the premises three months ago. He is yet to move out. When contacted, Balakrishnan said, ""I've sought a short extension and will soon be vacating the quarters.""

Authorities have not been able to explain how IPS and IAS officers, who have nothing to do with the university, managed to get quarters here. Earlier, five others including retired teaching staffs and a secretary, who was working in the state higher education department, left the quarters after receiving similar instructions.

Experts TNM spoke to say that the child is likely to be born without the infection, but the doctors will have to take extreme care and several precautions to ensure that happens.

""The transmission of HIV from a positive mother to an unborn child depends on the 'viral load',"" explains Dr Amrose Pradeep, Chief Medical Officer (CMO) at YR Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRGCare Hospital) in Chennai. ""The highest risk of transmission occurs early on in the acute phase of exposure, because that is when there is a high viral load present.""

Viral load is a unit of measurement used by medical professionals to determine the number of viral matter (in this case the concentration of the HIV virus) in an individual's bloodstream. During the initial period following exposure to the virus - which it is now for the mother, a person is said to have a high viral load. Thus, it would seem that the chance of transmission of the virus to the baby much larger. However, the presence of a healthy placenta shields the child against the virus.

""The virus cannot cross a normal, healthy placenta, and as a result the child will not be affected by the virus at this point,"" he says, but warns, ""A loss of structural integrity of the placenta can result in the virus being transmitted to the baby.""

Placental complications are common during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is at this juncture, if a mother is known to be HIV positive, that extra caution must be taken to ensure that the child is safe. The mother must be started on antiretroviral (ART) medications which will help decrease the viral load and will prevent the onset of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

""As far as I know, the mother has been started on the ART therapy and that is the first step. This will ensure that there is less chance of it being passed on to the child at the time of birth,"" adds Dr Pradeep.

The second instance when the infection can be passed on from the mother to the child is during delivery. Since the child passes through the birth canal and is exposed to the mother's blood and secretions, all of which contain the virus, there is a very high chance the child will be infected. To avoid this, doctors recommend that a C-section delivery is done, to reduce contact with the same fluids.

""After delivery, the child has to be given preventive care as well. For 6 weeks, that is 42 days, a combination of medications must be given,"" said the doctor.

Speaking to media on Wednesday, Dr Radhakrishnan, Tamil Nadu Health Secretary, said that the mother and child would be given the necessary treatment and care to ensure that they are healthy. He added that the child would be started on prophylactic (preventive) medicines once born. ""Nevirapine syrup will be given for about 6 to 12 weeks along with other medications to ensure that the child is not affected,"" he said. Doctors at YRGCare, recommend that nevirapine be given along with another ART medication known as zidovidine.

The case pertains to a 23-year-old pregnant woman who was given a blood transfusion at a government hospital in Sattur of Tamil Nadu's Virudhunagar district. In an effort to improve her anaemic state, doctors recommended that she be transfused with a unit of blood. Days later, it came to light that the blood which she had been transfused with was HIV positive, and in an extreme lapse of processes and possible criminal negligence, it had not been detected by technicians responsible for screening of the blood. The three technicians responsible for the negligence have since been terminated.

Officials from the health department have stated that the cost for treatment would be borne entirely by the government. The mother is currently undergoing treatment and is being monitored by a team of doctors at Madurai's Rajaji Government Hospital."

Acting on the complaint lodged by mandal education officer Leela Vathi at the Punganur police station, the cops registered a case against Bhuvaneswari and Naidu, and sent them to remand, said sub-inspector Arun Kumar Reddy.

Honorary president of Balala Hakkula Sangham Achyuta Rao had earlier brought the matter to the notice of the chairperson of the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, New Delhi. He wanted the commission to issue an order to initiate action under the POCSO (Protection of Childre n from Sexual Offences) Act.

Chittoor district educational officer K. Panduranga Swamy told Deccan Chronicle: ""It came to our notice that on Tuesday the school teacher punished some of the students of classes III and IV by letting them stand outside in the sun with bare bodies because they were late and had not done their homework. We immediately pressed the MEO to lodge a complaint at the local police station and ordered a thorough probe in the matter. We won't tolerate such inhumanity against the children and hence we have withdrawn recognition of the school and will take severe action against the school management.""

Minister for industries N. Amarnath Reddy has also instructed the district collector to withdraw recognition to the school.

Under the collector's direction, the DEO further released a statement, which reads: ""As a result of the negligent behaviour of the management, the boys left with bare bodies and this is a serious lapse on the part of the management which cannot be excused and thus attracted the provisions of Rules in GO Ms No. 1, dated 01.01.1994 and Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, 1988. Whereas, the school management behaved with total negligence in maintaining the safety of students and violated the provisions of rules governing the recognition of the private educational institutes and AP Education Act, 1994.

Phil Murphy, center, visited Princeton Innovation Center BioLabs on July 25 to announce two statewide programs aimed at supporting new and established innovative businesses in New Jersey. Pictured from left to right are Tim Sullivan, chief executive officer of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, Anne-Marie Maman, president of the New Jersey Business Incubation Network and executive director of the Princeton Entrepreneurship Council; Debbie Hart, president and chief executive officer of BioNJ; Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber; and State Treasurer Elizabeth Maher Muoio.

The year 2018 represented a pivotal point in the development of an innovation ecosystem in the heart of New Jersey as Princeton University established significant new collaborations with pioneering members of industry -- all with the aim of bolstering the resources available to researchers and scientists in their quest to make new discoveries in the service of society.

As President Christopher L. Eisgruber noted in July, standing alongside New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy at Princeton Innovation Center BioLabs, ""We believe that these cross-sector partnerships will foster a vibrant innovation ecosystem with the potential to generate transformative ideas, benefit the regional economy and attract top talent -- outcomes that will make central New Jersey an increasingly attractive place for all who live, learn and work here.""

The year kicked off with the opening of the Biolabs facility in Plainsboro at the Princeton Forrestal Center, and closed with Google and the University announcing that a new artificial intelligence laboratory would open in the town of Princeton in January. In between were other developments such as an agreement between the Princeton Catalysis Initiative (PCI) and Celgene Corp., and a Princeton-Microsoft agreement to research biofilms.

Murphy came to the Biolabs site to announce two initiatives to jumpstart the state's innovation ecosystem.

""It's right here in places like this across our state where the innovation economy will be reborn and once again dominate in New Jersey,"" Murphy said. ""These are the spaces where the next great leaps in technology and the life sciences will be made by new companies doing leading-edge research and development.""

These new relationships are described below, drawing from University announcements and related stories.

BioLabs opened in May, taking a major leap in connecting the talent and resources at Princeton to the larger New Jersey entrepreneurial network.

The 31,000-square-foot-facility includes wet labs, dry labs and co-working spaces for Princeton-related tech and life science startups and for companies throughout the region.

""Princeton Innovation Center BioLabs is one of several initiatives designed to strengthen the innovation ecosystem in central New Jersey and thereby expand the impact of Princeton's teaching and research,"" President Eisgruber said at the ceremonial ribbon-cutting.

The facility is designed to encourage collaboration, with shared work areas and many types of meeting spaces where scientists and entrepreneurs can share techniques and spark new ideas.

Eleven companies are tenants of the incubator space, spanning biotechnology, medical devices, battery technology and clean technology. Two of the companies have been spun out of the University by faculty, based on work in their labs: HIT Nano, which focuses on low-cost and high-performance lithium-ion batteries and led by Yiguang Ju, the Robert Porter Patterson Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and director of the Program in Sustainable Energy; and Optimeos, which focuses on building nanoparticles for pharmaceutical use and co-founded by Robert Prud'homme, professor of chemical and biological engineering, and Shahram Hejazi, venture capitalist and professional specialist in electrical engineering and the Keller Center for Innovations in Engineering Education.

Princeton Innovation Center BioLabs won Innovator of the Year from the Regional Chamber of Commerce during their gala awards ceremony in late November.

At the start of 2018, the Princeton Catalysis Initiative launched with the goal of accelerating interdisciplinary collaboration on catalysis across the University and with industry. On Nov. 1, PCI established its first industrial collaboration, a 10-year, $6 million commitment from Celgene Corp.

Catalysis is a key technological driver for solutions to many outstanding problems of increasing social concern, including the development of alternative energy technologies, environmental remediation strategies, access to novel pharmaceuticals and antibiotics, sustainable agriculture, and renewable soft materials.

""PCI will be an academic incubator for new fields of research that will have significant benefit for society,"" said David MacMillan, the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry and director of PCI. ""Princeton is uniquely positioned to be the leader in this movement, and in collaboration with Celgene we expect to make discoveries that will significantly impact human health over the next 10 years and beyond. Celgene brings much more than funding -- collaborators, ideas, and new opportunities for innovation and cross-pollination.""

""We are incredibly excited to enter into this collaboration with the Princeton Catalysis Initiative, said Lawrence Hamann, vice president for chemistry at Celgene. ""The opportunity to engage with absolutely world-class investigators in such a diverse range of scientific fields aligned with Celgene's broad research interests represents a unique and powerful means to advance some cutting-edge basic science.""

Princeton chemistry professors Abigail Doyle and David MacMillan explain catalysis in this video.

As a global research university and leader in innovation, Princeton cultivates mutually beneficial relationships with companies to support the University's educational, scientific and scholarly mission. The University is guided by the principle that initiatives to fortify and connect with the innovation ecosystem will advance Princeton's role as an internationally renowned institution of higher education and accelerate its ability to have greater impact in the world.

The University's relationship with Microsoft is one of its most extensive with industry, spanning collaborations in computer science, cybersecurity and biomedical research.

On Nov. 29, Princeton and Microsoft announced they are teaming up on the leading edge of microbiology and computational research modeling research.

Microsoft is helping Princeton to better understand the mechanisms of biofilm formation by providing advanced technology that will greatly extend the type of research analysis capable today. Biofilms -- surface-associated communities of bacteria -- are the leading cause of microbial infection worldwide and kill as many people as cancer does. They are also a leading cause of antibiotic resistance, a problem highlighted by the World Health Organization as ""a global crisis that we cannot ignore."" Understanding how biofilms form could enable new strategies to disrupt them.

To support Princeton, a Microsoft team led by Dr. Andrew Phillips, head of the Biological Computation group at Microsoft Research, will be working closely with Bonnie Bassler, a global pioneer in microbiology who is the Squibb Professor in Molecular Biology and chair of the Department of Molecular Biologyat Princeton and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, and with Ned Wingreen, the Howard A. Prior Professor in the Life Sciences and professor of molecular biology and the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics.

Using the power of Microsoft's cloud and advanced machine learning, Princeton will be able to study different strains of biofilms in new ways to better understand how they work. Microsoft is contributing a cloud-based prototype that can be used for biological modeling and experimentation that will be deployed at Princeton.

""This collaboration enables us to bring together advances in computing and microbiology in powerful new ways,"" said Brad Smith, president of Microsoft. ""This partnership can help us unlock answers that we hope someday may help save millions of people around the world.""

""By combining our distinctive strengths, Princeton and Microsoft will increase our ability to make the discoveries needed to improve lives and serve society,"" said Christopher L. Eisgruber, president of Princeton University. ""Technology is creating new possibilities for collaboration, and we hope this venture will inspire other innovative partnerships in the years ahead.""

During a visit to campus earlier in the year, Smith, a Princeton alumnus, gave a talk about the growing role of artificial intelligence and its implications for society. He called for people with varied backgrounds and expertise in humanities and public policy to join in discussions to ensure the fair and ethical use of the new technologies.

Google and the University announced Dec . 18 that the company will open an artificial intelligence lab in the town of Princeton in January. Computer science professors Elad Hazan and Yoram Singer will lead the effort, splitting their time working for Google and Princeton.

The lab at 1 Palmer Square will begin with a small number of faculty members, graduate and undergraduate student researchers, recent graduates and software engineers.

Work in the lab will focus on a discipline within artificial intelligence known as machine learning, in which computers learn from existing information and develop the ability to draw conclusions and make decisions in new situations that were not in the original data.

In congratulating the University and Google on the new venture, Gov. Murphy said it's another great step in the innovation economy here in New Jersey."" The governor said he looks forward to ""a great collaboration in artificial intelligence for years to come.""

Citing Princeton's long and groundbreaking involvement in computing, Emily Carter, the dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, said, ""This collaboration is another excellent example of how fundamental insights in mathematics and theoretical computer science drive new technologies with benefits far beyond the original domain of the work.""

Jennifer Rexford, chair of the Department of Computer Science, said the new venture comes at a time of significant growth in computer science and related areas of data science at the University. ""It's an exciting opportunity to work with a leading company while also maintaining the strong academic independence and freedom that is essential to Princeton,"" she said."

Or, the new technology, built with a combination of encryption and transparency, is a solution in search of a problem.

The reality likely falls somewhere in between. While a growing number of startups and researchers are devoting themselves to exploring blockchain's full potential, experts caution that a healthy dose of skepticism is needed to fully evaluate the technology and its eventual place in society.

For many individuals, though -- including some looking to invest -- blockchain technologies and their limitations remain poorly understood, leaving people vulnerable to being exploited by bad actors. Researchers at Princeton University's School of Engineering and Applied Science are striving to change that through education, outreach and research.

""Early on we realized this was a technology that was not well understood but that a lot of people were interested in,"" said Ed Felten, the Robert E. Kahn Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs at Princeton. ""There wasn't a coherent, high-quality way of teaching about this technology or explaining it, so we've tried to systematize the knowledge and unsolved problems underlying it.""

Simply put, a blockchain is a ledger. But unlike an old-time hotel register gathering dust on a counter, a blockchain ledger is held electronically in multiple locations across the internet. It is visible to any member of the community participating in that particular blockchain. Each copy of the ledger is held on a computer called a node; when someone makes a transaction using the blockchain -- say using virtual currency to order a pizza -- the operators of the nodes run through calculations to create a new entry, or block, in the ledger. Each new block is encrypted using a private, numeric key from the person who bought the pizza; the new blocks are also linked to the previous blocks using additional encryption.

The combination of encryption and visibility makes entries extremely difficult to fake. Because the calculations are carried out on multiple nodes and the results are visible to participants -- varying results would be an immediate red flag. The distributed nature of the system means it is hard for a single entity to control. It also makes transactions extremely difficult to track back to a user.

The initial use of blockchain technology was in new forms of currency such as Bitcoin. More recently, the ability to track decentralized transactions reliably has attracted other sectors. Businesses are exploring its use for contracts, app development and international finance.

""I think this will be a story of gradual integration, rather than a story of a revolution,"" said Arvind Narayanan, an associate professor of computer science at Princeton. ""It's an interesting new technology, and a number of us here are working to make that technical footing even stronger.""

In 2014, Narayanan began teaching one of the first university courses on blockchain, which he and Felten soon expanded into an online Coursera series and a popular textbook. At the same time, with colleagues and former and current students, they began innovating ways to maximize the benefits of blockchain and minimize the risks. ""There's a lot at stake, and a lot not understood about this technology,"" Felten said. ""As independent academics, the role we try to play is to be explainers, interpreters and b.s. detectors.""

That said, Felten and Narayanan believe that blockchain does have a significant role to play -- although, most likely, we have yet to imagine what it will be. ""In some sense, we're still in search of its major application,"" Felten said.

Numerous Princeton alumni are attempting to fill that unknown by becoming early innovators in the field, including a co-founder of the cryptocurrency Ethereum and founders of several high-profile companies, such as Blockstack (see list below). Where they will take these and other ventures depends not only on technical finesse, but imagination.

Blockchain's most prominent use so far has been in creating cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, that are not controlled by a central bank. These currencies are not blockchains themselves -- they are abstract tokens -- but trades of their coins are recorded on blockchains. Because ownership and any transfer of ownership is recorded on the public ledger, participants in the Bitcoin system do not need to trust any one entity. Instead, they place their trust in the distributed ledger technology, which is maintained by a large number of participants around the world.

Each cryptocurrency offers a limited number of coins, although new ones are regularly created and doled out as payment to users, called miners, who are the first to solve the difficult computational problems -- the harsh puzzles -- added to the chain. Miners' computers run algorithms that perform the difficult task of building blockchain records and solving mathematical problems. In exchange, they receive coins.

While this sounds abstract, Felten points out that the system actually has much in common with conventional currencies. ""Most money we have exists in numbers on some computer somewhere,"" he said. ""If you go into a sandwich shop, they give you a sandwich in exchange for you telling a bank to move numbers from one account to another."" Like paper money, he continues, cryptocurrencies have value because their supply is limited, and because users can be confident that they can exchange them for goods and services. Cryptocurrencies now trade against the dollar, and their combined market cap is over $100 billion.

Among their biggest attractions, cryptocurrencies offer a way to transfer money over distances and borders without involving intermediaries that may charge high fees. In other cases, certain cryptocurrencies possess advanced features, including the ability to create smart contracts, or self-enforcing rules that govern escrow arrangements and other interactions.

Blockchain is still in its infancy, though, so the true scope of its usefulness is likely yet to be revealed.

""It's kind of an analogy to the early days of the internet, where some people were super excited and made a lot of claims about how it would change human existence forever, and some said it was just a fad,"" Felten said. ""While it didn't solve all of humanity's problems, it did turn out to be pretty important.""

But for all the interesting current and future uses for blockchain, he added, there is ""an extraordinary amount of snake oil and exaggeration in the public rhetoric."" Because some cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous, for example, they are particularly attractive for criminal groups, including those looking to exchange illegal goods. In other cases, less savvy users are exploited through ""pump and dump schemes"" in which unscrupulous investors artificially boost the price of a hot commodity and then quickly sell, causing a crash. ""There are a huge number of scams going on,"" Narayanan warned.

Blockchain is also extremely energy intensive, mostly due to mining, which requires specialized equipment with a high demand for electricity. Bitcoin mining alone accounts for about 0.1 percent of total world energy use -- more energy than certain countries, including Denmark and Ireland, consume. As Narayanan testified before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in August, this represents a serious problem for energy use and the environment.

From the early days, Princeton researchers have been striving to mitigate some of these issues and to better understand the technology and its potential.

""Bitcoin is portrayed in the media as jumping into existence from the mind of one mysterious person, but I co-authored a paper on the component technologies of cryptocurrencies that cited literature from the early 1980s,"" Narayanan said. ""Continuing to improve on cryptocurrency and blockchain will take a lot more computer science research.""

BlockSci, for example, is a database that Narayanan and his colleagues built to analyze hundreds of millions of Bitcoin transactions. BlockSci allows them to investigate trends and to answer questions such as how much money is actually being transferred and how much privacy users truly have.

""There are lots of interesting scientific and commercial questions we can ask with these data,"" Narayanan said. A recent investigation revealed, for example, that bitcoins are changing hands less often than what was previously assumed -- about 1.4 times per month -- suggesting that individuals are using coins less as currency and more as investments.

Princeton students and graduates are also pushing the field forward, by creating apps and writing software to improve cryptocurrencies; founding companies based on blockchain; and funding such ventures. Joseph Lubin, one of the founders of Ethereum, graduated from Princeton in 1987 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science.

One recent venture, Basis, founded by Princeton computer science alumni Nader Al-Naji, Lawrence Diao and Josh Chen, recently raised $133 million for effort to build a cryptocurrency that maintains a more stable price than conventional blockchain-based ""coins."" The Basis system creates the virtual equivalent of a central bank, which automatically adjust the supply of currency, based on demand.

One recent Princeton alumni venture, Blockstack, aims to build a completely decentralized internet based on blockchain. According to co-founders Ryan Shea (2012 BSE in mechanical and aerospace engineering) and Muneeb Ali (2017 Ph.D. in computer science), Blockstack, which is registered as a public benefit corporation, was inspired by major issues they perceived in the way the internet works, including concerns about personal data and autonomy.

""We saw that a lack of competition and lack of control for the end user was really hampering freedom, security and privacy around the world,"" Shea said. ""We wanted to build a new system that empowers the individual and allows each of us to own our data.""

Rather than Facebook storing and controlling all of a person's data on its servers, for example, a Blockstack user could easily migrate his or her digital identity from app to app, if desired. Blockstack software for managing profiles and securing accounts is already available, as are decentralized messenger and document editor apps. Next year, the company plans to release its own blockchain in tandem with a Blockstack token, and discussions are underway for creating a decentralized Twitter.

""We're working with lots of teams to help them build whatever apps they desire on the platform,"" Shea says. ""The most exciting things are less around the exact details of the underlying infrastructure we provide and more around how we enable developers to create new experiences.""

Blockstack is already coming full circle by inspiring and enabling other Princeton scholars to create new technologies. At the Keller Center for Innovation in Engineering Education's eLab Summer Accelerator Program in August, a team of new Princeton graduates launched Afari, a Blockstack-based social media platform meant to give data privacy back to the people by returning data ownership and privacy to users, and by giving everyone an equal chance for their voice to be heard and rewarded.

""Social media is so broken in our opinion that you need to redesign it from the ground up,"" said Avthar Sewrathan, co-founder of Afari and a 2018 graduate in computer science. Blockchain, the team said, makes that possible. ""When you make a post on Afari,"" said co-founder Felix Madutsa, ""your data is not stored with us but rather is stored on a decentralized system that you, the user, controls and owns.""

A sampling of Princeton University alumni and alumni ventures playing prominent roles in blockchain-related work:

Afari was launched in 2018 as part of the Keller Center's eLab Summer Accelerator program by 2018 computer science alumni Richard Adjei, Felix Madutsa and Avthar Sewrathan along with junior May Jiang and sophomore Seyoon Ragavan.

Blockstack, a public benefit corporation, was founded by founded by alumni, Muneeb Ali, who earned his Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton in 2017, and Ryan Shea, who earned his BSE in mechanical and aerospace engineering in 2012. Princeton computer science professors Michael Freedman and JP Singh are technical advisers to the company.

Commonwealth Crypto was co-founded by Sharon Goldberg, who earned her Ph.D. in electrical engineering at Princeton in 2009 and is now the company's chief executive officer.

Ethereum, a blockchain-based computing platform that supports the Ether cryptocurrency, was co-founded by 1987 alumnus Joseph Lubin.

Michael Novogratz, who earned his undergraduate degree in economics at Princeton in 1987 and is a leading cryptocurrency investor, spoke on the subject at the 2018 Princeton Reunions.

Emin Gün Sirer earned his BSE in computer science from Princeton in 1993 and is an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University where he co-directs the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts.

Once the #MeToo movement caught on in India, in director-writer Vinta Nanda's words, it led to ""a volcanic explosion and threw all the lava out"". The task ahead in 2019, she says, is to ""sort out the lava (read: gender issues)"".

Bollywood was shaken in the last quarter of 2018 when Tanushree Dutta recounted her harassment by Nana Patekar on the sets of Horn OK Pleassss a decade ago and how shoddily her complaint was handled. Even as Dutta's account created ripples this time, what turned it into a tsunami was the report of sexual harassment that a former employee of the now dissolved Phantom Films was subjected to by filmmaker Vikas Bahl. Others came forward to name Subhash Ghai, Anu Malik, Sajid Khan, Kailash Kher, Vivek Agnihotri, Gursimran Khamba and Utsav Chakraborty, but it was Nanda's Facebook account alleging rape by Alok Nath that was the most chilling.

Talking about the fallout of #MeToo, Nanda says, ""The creative community is a critical mass made up of freelancers who are directors, singers, writers and lyricists. There is no corporation that controls it. This population, which runs the entertainment industry, comes under various associations. Most of these associations deal with issues related to the government, taxation or dispute. However, after the #MeToo movement every single association has set up an internal committee and is following the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 guidelines. Thousands of complaints have been registered with them. These are the tangible changes that have taken place in the last few weeks,"" says Nanda.

Ketaki Pandit, head of the anti-harassment committee of Screenwriters' Association (SWA), Mumbai, is glad that ""a long silence was broken"". ""Even though the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) guidelines existed for five years, many were not aware of it. As per the law, every single organisation is supposed to have an internal committee (IC),"" she says. The sharing of #MeToo accounts, Pandit as well as Kulmeet Makkar, chief executive officer at the Film and Television Producers Guild of India Limited, Mumbai, believe has ""started a very important conversation about something that was never spoken about"".

Today, the industry is going through a change, albeit a slow one, as the guild is making it mandatory for its members to implement PoSH regulations and set up IC committees. ""The education regarding the regulations and how that's to be carried out is being taken care of by agencies that have been shortlisted by us. No one can guarantee that it won't happen again. However, there will be a process in place to address the grievances,""

says Makkar.

Advertising

Though several organisations had ICs, they had not created awareness among their employees regarding the committees. In the post #MeToo world, many in the industry are ""speaking about consensus"". Pandit says, ""Earlier it was either rape or nothing. People did not take cases of harassment seriously. This is an opportunity to learn more and ask ourselves if we are being complicit."" She, however, adds that since there are ""no proven offenders"", it is still a long road ahead.

The guild has come up with posters that drive home the point about gender equality. Makkar says, ""What is important is that it is being implemented not just in offices but outdoors or other spaces where shooting is done. The guild members are talking of conducting workshops before a film shoot starts."" The SWA has also been holding workshops to develop gender sensitivity.

The #MeToo movement, Pandit says, has been a conversation starter. ""The responsibility now is to carry forward the conversation,"" says Pandit and adds that it is important to involve men in the conversation. ""Today, everybody is accountable,"" says Nanda. Yet, she points out, ""We can't have utopian thoughts and assume that no man or woman is going to ever exploit another"". Citing the recent meeting of an 18-member panel with PM Narendra Modi, Nanda says, ""Even after the discourse triggered by the #MeToo accounts, the delegation had no woman. Only two women, Dia Mirza and Sandhya Mridul, called this out. The year 2019 probably is going to be about sorting out these issues -- increasing the representation of women, equal pay and participation.""

Knotty Affairs

This would probably go down as the year when some of India's heartthrobs decided to give up their single status. They grabbed attention for their wedding preparations, engagements and bridal finery. Sonam Kapoor tied the knot with Delhi-based Anand Ahuja on May 8 in Mumbai. The second half of the year saw several more nuptial vows -- if Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Kapoor got married in Italy's Lake Como, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas exchanged vows in Jodhpur's Umaid Bhawan Palace. Multiple receptions followed. While Kapoor and Chopra promptly added Ahuja and Jonas, respectively, to their names, Padukone has kept her already

famous surname.

Prized Territory

The National Film awards might have traditionally been presented by the President of India, but this year was an exception. President Ram Naik only made a brief appearance at the ceremony in May and presented awards in 11 out of a total of 140 categories. The announcement regarding this, made a day prior to the ceremony, triggered protests, leading 68 award winners to boycott the ceremony. Many called the decision ""discriminatory"" and ""a joke"". The then Information and Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani and Minister of State Information and Broadcasting Rajyavardhan Rathore presented the awards after the President left.

Web of Entertainment

The impact of digital entertainment has become more prominent that ever before. Even as a number of digital platforms showed dynamism by coming up with a variety of content, Sacred Games on Netflix led the march with an impressive cast and scale. Ambitious series such as Mirzapur on Amazon Prime, Ghoul on Netflix, Rangbaaz on Zee5 and It's Not That Simple on Voot expanded the reach of entertainment.

Shock and Tragedy

Actor Sridevi was found dead on February 24 in a hotel bathtub in Dubai. She was there to attend the wedding of her husband Boney Kapoor's nephew Mohit Marwah and Antara Motiwala. Even though her sudden death gave rise to rumours, the Kapoor family stood together. Sridevi was posthumously honoured with the National Award for Best Actress for Mom. As 2018 drew to a close, she made her last

big screen appearance in Zero.

Making a Mark: International foray of several Indian movies is in the offing, even though Village Rockstars, written and directed by Rima Das, is out of the Oscar race. The latest Assamese feature film by Das, Bulbul Can Sing, will have its European premiere at the 69th Berlin International Film Festival in the Generation 14-plus section. Zoya Akhtar-directed Gully Boy, featuring Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt, will also have a special screening in Berlin. Ritesh Batra's fourth feature film, Photograph, will have an international premiere at Sundance Film Festival in January. Theatre director Anamika Haksar's first feature film, Ghode Ko Jalebi Khilane Le Ja Riya Hoon, has also been selected for the New Frontier section

at Sundance.

In Kashmir, the most possible chances of any occurrence which can happen to you is that either you will be exploited or you will exploit others for their own needs. The time when the government announced to regularize the services of various daily wagers, causal labour's, hired and need based labourers of various departments of Jammu and Kashmir functioning, across the state, the joy and happiness among these labour classes were reflective and can be seen very easily from their expressions on the announcement date.

Any such announcement from the government without any checks and balances whether it brings any change or not but it had definitely paved a way to corruption and exploitation of these labourers in various government departments of Jammu and Kashmir.

When the government started the process and issued the directions to various departments to send the detailed list of such workers, initially the number of such workers were nearly about 60 thousand, keeping these facts under considerations the government tries to formulate the definite and effective proposal for these labour class workers just to provide them some relief for the services which they have rendered in various departments on nominal wages in some cases no wages at all for years.

In spite of all these the labourers of various departments worked with the hope that someday they will get the reward of their dedication and hard work by recognizing their services by the government.

The data forward by various departments to Government shocked everyone where from 60 thousands the number of workers were doubled a new data of nearly 1.20 Lakh were submitted mostly by snatching the rights of various genuine causal labour workers who had been working in various departments from years.

Who were these extra 60 thousand who had added salt to the wounds of those poor and destitute labours who had served these departments from years but the department fails to recognize their services now and exploit them for years due to the acute shortage of permanent employees.

How can you throughout a labourer who had given his 10 years of precious services to the department with many hopes of getting absorbed in the department just on the pretext of not falling under the ambit of SRO 520.

How a less experienced can fit under the ambit of SRO 520 by your magical tricks and not the poor one without any special references from any class although much experienced and senior as compared to your loved ones.

Most of the officials of the respective departments happened to be the mama, papa, abu, abba, uncle, dadyetcetcor somehow related to the causal labour classes working in various departments, most unfortunately the MLAs and MLCs

And, higher officials of respective departments and even the Sarpanchs in some cases have created the mess in every department by adjusting political workers and their nears and dears as causal labourers in various departments which are dead on fields from years but on papers they have been in service of various departments even in their teens to regulate their pocket money.

After the release of the lists by various departments we have seen such glaring examples with unbelievable miracles where we have witnessed papa working as medical assistant and her wife including two sons and two daughters working as causal labourers under hospital development funds.

It was just an idea of mini hospital at home infact a new innovation. The examples of dynastic rules can be witnessed in various departments of Jammu and Kashmir apart from in politics. We have witnessed also the dead ones in such lists and persons ranging from 12 years to 95 years in such lists as well.

We have also witnessed a single person registered in more than two departments from years that too shown present on both the departments doing his job with dedication.

While performing all these miracles we have left thousands on the mercy of God by snatching their genuine rights who had been in all such departments from years but find nowhere their names in all such lists and even didn't know the persons who have been shown working in their place of postings where they have been working for such long years.

There are thousands of such cases where the sons of officials have been shown working in various departments from years and at the same time they were enrolled in various educational institutions of the state as well as outside the state pursuing their higher education.

How come a person be present at two places at a same time while be present in the department where he is working and had attended the exams on the same day outside the statesuch miracles are happening only and only in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

Recommendation of very poor and deserving one to any department as causal labour so that he may be able to minimize his sufferings and can feed his family to some extent can be understood and is appreciable but how come a son of a gazetted officer or an official whose is taking more than 50 thousand as salary can be inducted in the list of need based labourer or causal labour. Have such officials not in such positions to feed their lonely sons.

I have seen a large number of very poor especially from Gujar communities and from other socially, economically and educationally deprived communities who are serving in various departments from years on very marginal wages in some cases no wages at allmostly due to the acute shortage of permanent employees in various government departments it is only these causal labourers who are serving in various departments.

In some cases the permanent employee's has been assigned various areas to look after and they hardly visit to such areas. It's only because of the services of these causal labourers the glory of many departments are still standing.

Have heard the stories of various destitute causal labours how much happy they were when they were asked to register themselves online, bringing affidavit from courts along with their Aadhar cards. They were asked to register in their respective departments.

In some cases hundreds of causal labourers have paid 1000 to 1500 each just to register themselves online in their concerned departments and officials concerned knowing that it's equalent to the wages which their departments are providing them after so many months.

""Without looking here and there we did all what we were asked to do in order to get regularized and to be registered online so that we will be covered under the ambit of SRO 520,"" said one with tearful eyes.

Initially we were just 20 to 30 but the department have forwarded list of 70 and we are not even in the list of 70's as well now. This is how the poor and destitute once are dropped deliberately to pay way to the special ones.

How will a poor, illiterate, socially, economically and educationally backward person the only bread owner to their families will now move from office to office with his cries in order to get them heard in higher offices where there is no value and no respect for the emotions of poor and destitute ones.

""How can I visit now to all these offices with my cries when they are responsible for all this mess from Regional Director's to Director's office while left my family to die of starvation,"" heard from one while his eyes were flooded with tears, everlasting hopes and aspirations.

Here the principle of ""might is right"" is the only visible principle. In this unfortunate land of Kashmir you can be exploited or you can exploit others, when poverty is your long lasting friend you are born to be exploited only we are surrounded by turn costs, opportunists, who can claim big but at the end all promises proved to be hoax and hallow which holds nothing for poor and common masses.

There are many deserving causal labours who had given their whole life while serving such departments with the only hopes from years someday they will be regularized, give them their legitimate rights before they will die along with their everlasting dreams and aspirations.

The genuine and deserving ones had become the victims of the mess of corruption and favouritism which had casted shadows of darkness even on their genuine cause.

If the rules are unjust a man is not only right to disobey it, he is obligated to do so."

The Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party had pressed for a judicial inquiry into the encounter, the issue echoed in the Parliament as well. Professors and students at the Jamia Milia University found support in the left-of-centre intelligentsia and staged protests on a national scale until the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) eventually cleared the police of any violations of rights. The broader impact of an incident like this goes beyond the profile of the accused and the procedures of investigation. It impacts the social identity of a community who is then suspected even more of having pan-Islamic leanings that can threaten constitutional equilibriums. The question is, what does the local administration do to repair the reading of such an incident and the way it dents the morale of the neighbourhood where it takes place. The first and lasting interpretation of such an investigation and arrest in the immediate neighbourhood is that the accused have been framed, and through them, the entire social milieu they belonged to is being condemned.

Jafrabad, from where the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested four young men on Wednesday suspecting they were part of a module of the Islamic State, was no different. The area falls in North East Delhi's Seelampur constituency. Here, the percentage of Muslims is 44.19 percent compared to 12.66 percent in all of Delhi and the literacy rate is 74.20 percent compared to 81.57 per cent for Delhi. Firstpost hit ground zero to assess the mood among the families and the locals after the Wednesday's arrest.

Jafrabad, which falls in Seelampur constituency, is a Muslim-dominated neighbourhood of North East Delhi. Pallavi Rebbapragada

Fleece and goose leather jackets in greys and blues and browns hang off hooks in slim lanes of Jafrabad, known for its jacket market, with broken drains at random intervals. Hafeez Ahmad Suhail, whose son Mufti Mohammad Suhail was arrested from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh in the wee hours of Wednesday, sat on the edge of a bed, weeping into a floral fleece blanket. He said that he fully cooperated with the police and the investigating authorities who combed through his tiny first-floor house where women and children also live.

He said he is weak and paralysed and wants the police to record and report the truth, even if it goes against his son. But, he said that the investigation authorities should have told them where they came from before raiding their home ruthlessly, not leaving a single piece of cloth untouched. He said his two sons repair inverter batteries and one son supplies emergency lights. Sohail was arrested from Amroha in North West Uttar Pradesh. He had moved to Amroha just two months ago.

Junaid, brother of suspected terror mastermind Sohail, said that the geometric pattern in Sohail's diary was to study turning coils in inverter batteries and not make bombs.

Sohail's older brother Junaid, seated next to his father, pulled out a diary and pointed to a hand-drawn geometric pattern used to depict functioning of inverter batteries. He said the family doesn't manufacture batteries and any technician can say this is a pattern for turning the coils that are used by repair mechanics. Junaid said that the investigating teams took away the circuits used in chargers.

He described Sohail as a God-fearing boy who had been put through madrasa education and someone who didn't have many friends and mostly spent time at home. An NIA official, who had been directing the activities of the investigating team at every step, has stated that most of those who have been arrested were known to Sohail since before. He is also the alleged voice in the video where intricacies of an IED are being explained. The agency has confirmed that it has recovered a huge cache of explosives, arms and ammunition from the accused.

The mood below Sohail's house seemed tense. Anxious young men had formed huddles. Ishfaq and Naseem, both of whom work in the jacket market, said that such an incident throws a blanket of doubt over the entire community's character and intentions.

He said there are people who work hard to earn a living in Faizabad and that they will be unhappy if Jafrabad is treated the same way as Batla House was in the broader discourse on minority rights because that can damage the peace in their locality.

Mohammad Ishaq, an elderly person known to Sohail, referred to him as a 'kaabil bacha (competent child)', one who never fought with anybody. He admitted that the terror speculations are most damaging to the locals, who, as it is, find it hard to find acceptance outside because of their last names and their social class.

A short bike ride away is the home of Rashid Zafar Raq, located right above a garment shop that he owns and runs. Rashid is one of the 11 terror suspects who the NIA arrested in raids in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, on Wednesday.

His sister-in-law told Firstpost that the investigating authorities raided their home for 12 hours, but didn't find anything from within its chipped pink and green walls. She asked why they dragged her brother-in-law away if nothing was found in the house and also objected to the lack of a search or arrest warrant.

Mahmood, Rashid's cousin, said that if someone's home is raided without warrants and the investigating authorities don't feel the need to explain what's going on, then the people are justified in feeling defenceless against a system. He said they covered Zafar's face and dragged him out and didn't let any of the family members leave the premises, even to get food to feed the children in the house.

Rashid Zafar Raq, one of the 11 arrested by the NIA, owned a garment shop in Jafrabad. Pallavi Rebbapragada

Vivek Tyagi, SHO from Jafrabad, told Firstpost that he was part of the raids and that the locals are, in fact, unaware of the laws. ""The crime rate in Jafrabad, fuelled by gang wars, has come down. It is largely a peaceful area and no unconstitutional measures were taken to conduct the investigation or the raids,"" said Tyagi, adding that the families can appeal in court against the action taken by the NIA.

Chapter five of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, deals with the arrest of persons. Section 41 is the main section providing for situations when the police may arrest a person without a warrant. Under this, any police officer may without an order from a magistrate and without a warrant, arrest any person who has been concerned in any cognisable offence, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists, of his having been so concerned; or who has in his possession without lawful excuse, the burden of proving which excuse shall lie on such person, any implement of house-breaking; who has been proclaimed as an offender either under this code or by order of the state government.

Unfortunately, after the police leaves the scene, speculations and fear enter the scene and representatives from the local administration are missing to address and explain the goings-on. There's a void nobody fills and it widens to become a national issue that is debated by big political parties. In all this, where is the local administration?

Dilip Pandey, a Lok Sabha prabhari from the area, who had come to inaugurate a function at the Zakir Hussain Memorial School in Jafrabad on Thursday morning, told Firstpost that he wasn't aware that such an incident had taken place and that he can't go beyond the party line to give his personal opinion because it 'does not matter'.

Abdul Rehman, AAP Counselor from Chauhan Bangar in East Delhi had reached the homes of the accused, to gauge the situation. Alleging that minorities are being targeted, he asked why incidents in Muslim colonies like Batla House, Chauhan Banger, and Jafrabad take place before elections. ""Yesterday, Mohammad Azam's home was raided. The police didn't find anything but seized the passports of the family members. Why?"" he asked. AAP MLA Haji Ishraque refused to comment on the issue. If local leaders fail to reach out to residents, alienation is bound to seep deeper into the psyche.

Minorities seek comfort in territorial bastions and this spatial segregation has elements of both voluntary self-segregation and forced exclusion wherever governments have failed to address unequal access to residential areas.

Jafrabad and Seelampur are also severely drug-torn regions.

In 2016 October, Firstpost had reported on the drug crisis in New Seelampur and the way cannabis and medical drugs were being sold and consumed in the open. Asif Chaudhry, a social worker from the area, had then told Firstpost that entire families are addicted to smack, cannabis and medical drugs, apart from alcohol and tobacco.

Two years on, Chaudhry is sorry to state that the drug crisis has increased. He said that instead of focusing on cutting the supply chain of drugs and using its energy to attack the mafia network, Seelampur's drug crisis is viewed as the Muslim area's 'internal crisis' by the local and state administration.

""Communal politics and minority appeasement are the reason why even basic law and order issues acquire a religious lining. This is the reason why Muslims are either all victims or all criminals, there is no middle ground,"" he said.

There are many Jafrabad-like neighbourhoods in urban India, and callous handling of incidents like these could push them further away from the mainstream.

The country's trailblazing transgender beauty queen wants to look good in any weather.

""I don't like to look puffy,"" the 25-year-old said as she drove to a beauty salon that hired her to promote its products and services via Facebook live videos.

It's with this typical bluntness, confidence and attitude that taboo-breaking Ms. Batsukh strutted into the country's first ever Miss Universe Mongolia competition in October.

Though she fell short of representing her country at the Miss Universe contest in Thailand on December 17, her participation shed another light onto a group living on the edges of a deeply patriarchal country with conservative views about sexual orientation.

Had she won, she would have joined Miss Spain's Angela Ponce as one of the first transgender contestants in Miss Universe's 66-year history. ""I wanted to inspire as many women as possible,"" Ms. Batsukh said.

""But I'm still proud that I got the chance to compete in this contest, and the 'Solongo' I created was a true winner in my heart,"" she said.

Her participation didn't please everyone, dredging up negative reactions on social media.

""The world would have a negative image of our country if a man represents us while there are thousands of beautiful and real women in our country,"" one person wrote on the Facebook page of Miss Universe Mongolia.

But Ms. Batsukh isn't deterred by such abuse.

Born Bilguun Batsukh, she grew up as a boy in the semi-arid central province of Dundgovi.

She couldn't pinpoint her gender identity until she learned about different gender orientations as a university student in her early 20s.

It was when she started working as a programme officer at Youth for Health, a non-governmental organisation that provides safe-sex education for LGBT people, that she realised she was a woman born in a man's body. She started wearing wigs, putting on dresses and taking hormone therapy.

Ms. Batsukh is among the few LGBT people who have dared to come out in Mongolia, where some 80% of the community remain in the closet, according to a UN survey.

""It is extremely difficult for transgender people to be employed,"" said Baldangombo Altangerel, legal programme manager at the LGBT Centre.

A video of a young transgender woman who had repeatedly been beaten in the streets went viral in Mongolia last year, highlighting the prejudices LGBT people face.

Ms. Batsukh wants to dispel the image that transgender women can only be sex workers or strippers living on the fringes of society.

She flaunts her wealth, regularly travels abroad and is a celebrity in her country of three million people.

Ms. Batsukh found fame in 2014, when she represented Mongolia in Miss International Queen, finishing in the top 10 of the international transgender beauty pageant organised in Thailand.

She pursued a modelling career and became a make-up artist. ""I had to reveal myself (as transgender) so I could correct the misunderstandings in society. If we keep hidden, society will keep on hating us. They don't know us,"" she said.

Ms. Batsukh has used her public image to speak up on television and social media, fighting against perceptions that transgender people are suffering from mental illness.

Ms. Batsukh is seizing on the popularity of her Facebook page, which has more than 120,000 ""likes"", to create a reality show featuring women seeking a makeover. The beauty queen will help the women lose weight, change hairstyles and apply make-up.

Sarangoo Sukhbaatar, one of the 25 women competing to be among the five participants, said she trusted in Batsukh's ability and skills to transform her looks.

""Solongo truly understands what women feel,"" said Ms. Sukhbaatar."

The Uttar Pradesh Police have booked a teenager for fraud and forgery months after she had accused a Bharatiya Janata Party MLA in Unnao of raping her, the Hindustan Times reported on Thursday. She, her mother and uncle have been accused of tampering with documents to prove she was a minor.

The case was filed on Sunday based on directions from a local court after a plea from Haripal Singh, the father of one of the 11 people in jail since April in connection with the rape case. Haripal Singh's wife is a co-accused and was arrested too. BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar is the main accused.

According to Singh's account, the rape complainant had eloped with a man last year, after which her family began to ask Singh's wife to get their son married to her when she returned. When Singh's family refused, his wife and son were falsely named in the rape case, he alleged. Singh also claimed that the teenager's family had forged a school certificate to wrongly show that she was a minor at the time of the alleged rape. An education officer and a school officer who had purportedly signed the certificate had denied having done so, Singh claimed.

An investigation is under way to verify the documents, said Dinesh Chandra Mishra, an official at Makhi police station, where the case was filed.

""The FIR was lodged on charges including cheating by impersonation, cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, forgery for purpose of cheating and using as genuine a forged document,"" Mishra told The Indian Express.

The complainant had accused Sengar, who represents Bangermau in the state Assembly, of raping her at his home in June 2017 when she had gone to meet him about a job. In April, she attempted suicide outside Chief Minister Adityanath's house, alleging that the police did not act on her complaint though she had approached them several months earlier. The CBI arrested Sengar on April 13.

The complainant's father had died after he got into a fight with Sengar's brother while in judicial custody. The police had arrested the brother for the alleged assault."
"159","1027557996","2018-12-27","https://scroll.in/article/907059/looking-for-modi-through-the-eyes-of-a-triple-talaq-crusader-in-western-uttar-pradesh","Looking for Modi: Through the eyes of a triple talaq crusader in western Uttar Pradesh","Scroll.in",FALSE,"In the fourth part of our series revisiting places from Narendra Modi's 2014 campaign, Scroll.in travels to Bareilly in western Uttar Pradesh to look at his government's impact on Muslims.

In a two-storey building under a flyover in Bareilly, above namkeen shops, past a policeman posted in the stairwell, lives a 24-year-old woman with her parents, brother, two parrots and five Persian cats.

The oldest of the cats, Simba, with her furry golden coat, sauntered around the living room, while black-haired Mikey scampered. Mother and child, I asked. ""No, no, partners, just like Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas,"" the young woman giggled, her eyes sparkling, her long straight hair bouncing in a ponytail.

She might not have the international fame of film actor Chopra, who also grew up in Bareilly, but in this part of western Uttar Pradesh, everyone seems to know Nida Khan.

The young woman was catapulted to fame in 2016 when she filed a case against her husband, Sheeran Raza Khan, accusing him of beating her after she failed to meet his family's demands for dowry.

Sheeran Khan is no ordinary man: he is the scion of a powerful family of Islamic scholars who trace their lineage to Ahmed Raza Khan, the founder of the influential Barelvi school of Islam, which is followed by most Indian Muslims. They are the custodians of the Dargah-e-Ala Hazrat, the tomb of Ahmed Raza Khan. Sheeran Khan's uncle Tauqeer Raza Khan, a prominent cleric, also leads a political party called the Ittehad-e-Millat Council, and was a minister in the Samajwadi Party government.

When a rishta (marriage offer) came from the illustrious dargah family, Nida's mother was tempted. But her father, an officer in a public sector company, was clear: Nida had just passed out of St Francis High School, he wanted her to complete her graduation. Sheeran Khan's family had to wait.

The engagement took place in the summer of 2014, two months after Nida Khan finished a degree in commerce.

India had just witnessed a tumultuous election. Narendra Modi, the controversial chief minister of Gujarat led the Bharatiya Janata Party to a thumping victory. Under his watch, more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslim, had been killed in the 2002 Gujarat riots. This triggered deep anxieties among Muslims, who found their representation in the Lok Sabha plummet to an all time low.

As a woman on the path to marriage, Nida Khan was caught in her own maelstrom - she had just started to wear a burqa. All she remembers of the election is that she cast her vote for the first time. She voted in favour of the Congress candidate, not as a rejection of Modi, but because she was impressed with the strength of Indira Gandhi, India's only woman prime minister.

""I too was a leader in school,"" Khan said. ""First, as class monitor, then as school prefect.""

But when it came to marriage, Nida Khan followed tradition. In February 2015, when her nikah was solemnised to Sheeran Khan, she had not even seen his photograph.

Months later, in July, she was back at her parents home - with injuries serious enough to have caused a miscarriage.

""Our mentality did not match,"" she explained. ""Everyone assumed he is from the dargah family, he must be a hafiz, aalim [erudite person], but it turned out he was a Class 5 passout."" She got a taste of his anger in March, when he stormed into an examination hall where she was writing her first-year masters of commerce exams. Holding her by the arm, he pulled her out - a story dramatic enough for the local newspapers to publish, but after carefully excising all the names.

Such was the power of the dargah family that when Nida Khan decided to file a police complaint in 2016, she was initially turned away. She had to seek the intervention of the courts.

Even then the police hastily filed a final report exonerating Sheeran Khan, citing lack of evidence. On his part, he claimed the marriage itself was infructuous - he had dissolved it by saying ""talaq"" three times.

At this crucial juncture, Nida Khan's crusade caught the attention of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which, by then, had decided to raise the pitch against triple talaq. Launching the party's campaign for the 2017 assembly elections, Modi spoke of saving ""Muslim sisters"" from injustice. But many in the Muslim community saw this as an encroachment in their personal laws and another act of majoritarian assertion.

Already, western Uttar Pradesh had witnessed attacks on Muslims. In September 2015, a middle-aged man, Mohammed Akhlaq, was dragged out of his house and killed by a mob which claimed that he had slaughtered a calf for meat. The murder took place just 50 km away from Ghaziabad where Modi, during the 2014 election campaign, had thundered against India's rising beef exports, deriding them as ""gulabi kranti"" or a pink revolution.

Consolidating its 2014 victory, BJP swept the Uttar Pradesh elections in March 2017. For Muslims, the political marginalisation was now complete - not a single Muslim MLA in the ruling party and a rabble-rousing Hindu monk, Adityanath, in the chief minister's seat. One of his first orders was to clamp down on unauthorised slaughterhouses and meat shops, which mostly employ Muslims. While the shops reopened after complying with the new rules, meat became a bad word, leaving people in the business vulnerable.

Mohammad Salim Qureshi ran a meat shop in the narrow lanes of the old city of Bareilly. In June 2018, he was beaten to death in his own neighbourhood, allegedly by the henchmen of the police, after he failed to pay them bribes. ""They threatened to fix my brother in a cow slaughter case,"" said his brother Nayeem Qureshi.

Scroll.in spoke to a dozen Muslims living in and around Bareilly. Surrounded by other Muslims, they said they felt secure in their neighbourhoods, but travelling outside was a source of anxiety. A young rice miller said he had stopped taking trains to Delhi and now only journeyed by car: ""Because my wife wears a hijab,"" he explained. Others spoke of avoiding meat - in school tiffins, on journeys. ""No kebabs on the train,"" said a crafts merchant.

In this worsening social climate, the BJP has found one trump card: the triple talaq crusaders among Muslim women. Ishrat Jahan, a petitioner in the Supreme Court case that led to a ban on the practice, joined the party this year in West Bengal. So did Sofia Ahmed from Kanpur, who was rewarded with a post in the Uttar Pradesh minorities commission.

But Nida Khan is yet to join.

Her story offers glimpses of the complex fabric of life in western Uttar Pradesh, which is now under strain.

Bareilly district lies in northwestern Uttar Pradesh in a region called Rohilkhand, named after the Afghan Rohillas who ruled in the 17th century. The large Muslim population here - 34.54% in Bareilly and 50.57% in neighbouring Rampur - is often the subject of the feverish imaginations of Hindutva supporters.

For all the menace attributed to them, most Muslims here barely scrape through a living. The traditional occupations they follow are in a state of decline.

""Bareilly is famous for four things,"" a young man explained, ""baans, surma, manjha, zari"" - bamboo furniture, eye kohl, kite string and embroidery work.

All of them are losing out to cheaper, factory-made versions.

In 2014, while campaigning in Bareilly, Modi invoked the special connection he shared with the city as a Gujarati who loved flying kites. ""If your kite flies high, then the manjha must be from Bareilly,"" he said, sending the audience in raptures.

Referring to the downturn caused in the industry by cheaper nylon substitutes called Chinese manjha, he promised to turn around its fortunes, in the same way that he claimed his government had done with the kite industry in Gujarat. ""Brothers and sisters, in Gujarat, the kite industry is in the hands of the poor, 90% of whom are Muslims,"" he said. ""We did research and started schemes. The industry barely touched Rs 35 crore, we took it to Rs 500 crore.""

Among the audience was Arshad Hussain, the president of the Manjha Mazdoor Kalyan Samiti, which represents 30,000 workers in Bareilly district. Impressed with Modi's speech, he voted for the BJP in 2014, he recalled with nervous laughter one morning in December, sitting in a field in impoverished Bakarganj, where hundreds of men ran around poles in luminous winter light.

To make the kite-slaying manjha, the workers must injure their hands, coating the cotton thread strung on poles with a rice paste mixed with glass. The daily wages are a pittance - just Rs 150-Rs 200.

Far from seeing a revival under Modi government, this marginal industry has been pushed further against the wall. First, demonetisation in November 2016 caused an upheaval, then seven months later, the introduction of Goods and Services Tax came as a blow.

GST, which replaced a welter of other taxes, was supposed to make things easier. But not only are the costs of filing GST returns prohibitive, navigating paper work is a steep challenge for those who lack a formal education, said Hussain. ""About 200 people run majha-making units here,"" he said. ""Only 50 have a GST registration."" Others either sell their products by borrowing GST numbers [from other units], for which they pay a commission, or they sell them cheap to whoever is willing to buy.

A sales representative of a leading yarn-making company who was visiting Hussain in Bakarganj said he saw a downturn in every industry he did business with: shoe-making, textiles, mattresses. ""Cash flow has stopped in the economy,"" he said. As firms waited for refunds, GST had locked up private funds with the government, and banks were not lending. The result was a liquidity squeeze. ""The big players are benefitting, the smaller businesses are getting wiped out,"" he said.

In Shahmat Ganj in the old city, Asad Khan, 42, who makes and sells hand-embroidered salwar kameez fabrics pointed to a pile of products lying around. ""These have come back from Punjab,"" he said. He had sold them on credit - the buyer made no upfront payment - but when they remained unsold, the buyer sent them back. ""Now the trouble is I have already paid GST on them, which I won't get back,"" Khan said. The new tax system does not account for a traditional economy based on credit and trust.

It is easy to discuss the economic crisis in these neighbourhoods. But broaching the subject of the worsening social climate and the anxiety of being Muslim is not.

""I have stopped watching TV,"" is all that Asad Khan was willing to say.

Hammad Nabi, a youth leader of the Samajwadi Party, said it was counterproductive to dwell on the fears of Muslims: it pushes them to hardline leaders like the Owaisis, he claimed. ""This government is bad not just for Muslims, we say it is bad for everyone,"" he said.

But in the villages of Bareilly, there is disquiet. Zarar Ahmed, 60, the pradhan of Jojkharpur village in Bahedi block, and the head of the association of village chiefs, alleged that Muslim-majority villages were being denied development funds under the BJP. ""They have not sanctioned a single awaas [house] in my village,"" he said, referring to the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana, which subsidises the construction of low cost houses.

In another Muslim-majority village, Rurki, in the same block, a younger pradhan, Akram Khan, 43, disagreed. ""There might be verbal discrimination,"" he said, hinting at the sparring between BJP MLAs and pradhans owing allegiance to the Samajwadi Party, ""but there is no discrimination in funds.""

In his own village, however, stands a monument to the government's malice towards Muslims.

It is a two-storey building which lies incomplete. Funded through the previous government's multisectoral development programme, the building was meant to house an industrial training institute. The programme, which was launched in 2008, aimed at building infrastructure to ""address the development deficits of minority concentration areas"". The Centre contributed 75% of the funds, while 25% came from the state.

But, since the Modi government came to power, Uttar Pradesh officials say not only has the sanction of new projects stopped, even ongoing projects have come to a standstill because central funds have dried up. All that the Modi government has done is rename the programme as the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram.

For instance, of the Rs 3.65 crore allotted to the industrial training institute in Bahedi, Rs 2.65 was released by the previous government, all of which was spent. About 75% of the construction is complete. But the second instalment never came. Now, weeds have taken over the unfinished building.

In Bareilly district alone, as many as 24 projects are lying incomplete. The original sanction for them was Rs 52.73 crore but the delay has pushed up costs to Rs 77.56. To complete them, Uttar Pradesh would have to dip into its own funds, which, officials say, is unlikely to happen.

""Don't do anything for minorities, no issue,"" said a senior official. ""But this government wants to show it is not doing anything for them.""

Another example of Modi government's ill-will towards Muslims, said state officials, was the unprecedented delay in the salaries of teachers appointed under the madrassa modernisation scheme. Launched by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government in 2003, the scheme aimed to supplement privately funded deeni talim (religious education) with government-funded duniyawi taleem (secular education) through the appointment of maths, science and other subject teachers.

While delays occurred even under the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, never before had the Centre completely stopped releasing salaries. ""It's been 33 months since we were paid,"" said Mohammad Shakeel, who has been in service since 2003. ""We have agitated in Jantar Mantar [in Delhi], to no avail.""

""Modi ji says he wants Muslims to have ek haath mein computer, ek haath mein Koran [a computer in one hand, Koran in the other],"" he continued. ""Computer to mila nahi, ab Koran bhi chooth jayegi."" We did not get a computer, and now we stand to lose the Koran.

Funds are not the ony instrument by which governments signal their priorities.

Months after it came to power, in August 2017, the Adityanath government ordered all districts to enforce the singing of the national anthem in madrassas on Independence Day. The proceedings were to be recorded and the footage sent to Lucknow.

The decision created palpable tension in parts of Bareilly, said an official, leading to orders being imposed under Section 144 to prohibit more than four people from assembling at a spot.

Assigned the task of enforcing the order in one madrassa, he recalled how he got around it. ""I told them I will sing, you please join only if you want to,"" he said. ""Literally, no one sang. But I had positioned the camera in a way where only I was visible. So the work was done.""

In August, Nida Khan received a call from Rekha Arya, the women and child development minister of neighbouring Uttarakhand. Arya said she wanted to discuss women's issues but Khan was smart enough to know this was a cover. In July, a cleric in Bareilly had passed a fatwa against her, which had prompted the police to assign her a full-time security detail, but it had also raised her public profile. Aware that other triple talaq crusaders had joined the BJP, she anticipated an offer from the party.

When she consulted her parents, her father said ""no netagiri"", but her mother asked her to make up her own mind. Khan reminded herself that it was only after the BJP had come to power in Uttar Pradesh that the investigation in her case had been reopened. The police had taken one year to file the chargesheet. ""There was delay, but no injustice,"" she reasoned. ""I am safe as long as the BJP is in power. If the SP comes back, I am finished.""

But driving from Bareilly to Dehradun, via Haridwar, was a challenge.

It was the season for the Kanwar Yatra, in which young male devotees of Shiva walk long distances to fetch the water of Ganga from Haridwar. The road was jammed. ""My brother told the driver, be extra careful, if you even touch the bhole people, you will get killed,"" Khan recalled. A video had surfaced, showing Kanwariyas vandalising a car in the full public view, with the police watching helplessly.

In 2012, communal clashes had erupted in Bareilly district after Kanwariyas were stopped by Muslims from playing loud music in the town of Aonla. This year, in many villages of Bareilly, Muslims complained that Kanwariyas deliberately strayed from the official routes, marched in front of mosques, resorted to provocative slogans. ""Musalman khamosh raha (Muslims stayed silent),"" said Abdul Waheed, a leader allied to the Samajwadi Party. ""We counselled them to stay silent. If you speak up, you only will get beaten up. The government is theirs.""

But Nida Khan scoffed at the simplistic binaries. ""Our people too take out jaloos [processions] which are nothing but shakti pradarshan [displays of strength],"" she noted. The competitive displays clashed in 2010, when a procession to mark the Prophet's birthday ran into a Holi celebration in Bareilly. This triggered riots that led to a month-long curfew in the city.

Voicing a commonly held belief, Nida Khan claimed the riots were not spontaneous: the clash was orchestrated. Less than a year ago, in 2009, Santosh Gangwar of the BJP, after six successive wins, was defeated by the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections. The Bahujan Samaj Party was in power in the state. Both the Samajwadi Party and the BJP were political marginalised. Nida Khan claims they got together to engineer the riots and polarise the electorate. ""Tauqeer Mian [of the dargah family] and Santosh Gangwar are after all good friends,"" she said.

This year, in the thick of speculation over whether Khan would join the BJP, local newspapers reported that Gangwar had scuttled her chances - at the behest of the dargah family. While Arya had made an offer on behalf of BJP's Uttarakhand unit, Nida Khan had turned it down, saying she would also consider an offer from the central leadership. Days later, Gangwar called her for a meeting, but nothing came of it.

Nida Khan remains ambivalent about joining the BJP.

In September, she had travelled to Lucknow to collect an award. Adityanath was the chief guest at the event. On stage, the moderator asked him about the mob lynchings in the state - as recently as June, a Muslim man had been killed over cow slaughter rumours in Hapur.

Khan recalled his answer: ""Mob lynching? No, that's not taking place in UP"".

""I was like how much is he lying,"" she said. ""But the anchor did not even cross-question him.""

In the Bareilly college, where Nida Khan studied, colonial-era red brick buildings are set against green expansive lawns. Like many campuses, in recent years, it has seen a rise of the Hindutva student organisation, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. In October, a bus carrying Urdu books sponsored by the National Council For Promotion of Urdu Language, an autonomous body under the Ministry of Human Resource Development, had to be sent back after ABVP objected, shouting slogans against it.

Even without paying much attention to politics, two young women in the second-year BSc course had concluded that Modi government was anti-Muslim. ""Everything is being renamed,"" said Rashmi Singh, 19. Her friend, Alqama Zaidi, 17, chipped in: ""Did you see the WhatsApp joke about Hajmola?"" - referring to a brand of candy. ""The government has renamed it, because it has Haj and Moula. Its new name is Deen Dayal Upadhyay."""

Consultations through ""intensive"" telephone calls will continue in the meantime, Gao Feng, spokesman at the commerce ministry, told reporters, adding that talks have been steadily moving forward despite the Christmas break in the United States.

""Even as the U.S side is in the Christmas holiday period, China and U.S. economic and trade teams have been in close communication, and the consultations are progressing in an orderly manner as scheduled,"" Gao said, when asked about progress on negotiations.

Gao did not comment directly when asked to confirm a media report on a U.S. trade delegation visit scheduled for the week of Jan. 7.

""The two sides have indeed made specific arrangements for face-to-face consultations in January in addition to continuing intensive telephone consultations,"" he said, without elaborating.

U.S. and Chinese officials have spoken by phone in recent weeks, but a meeting next month would be the first in-person talks since U.S. President Donald Trump met his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Buenos Aires on Dec. 1.

Trump and Xi agreed to stop escalating tit-for-tat tariffs that have disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods between the two countries.

The leaders also agreed to launch new talks while the United States delayed a planned Jan. 1 tariff increase until March.

In response, China has resumed purchases of U.S. soybeans for the first time in six months, even though hefty tariffs on U.S. cargoes remain in place.

China has also said it will suspend additional tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles and auto parts for three months starting on Jan. 1, adding that it hopes both sides can speed up negotiations to remove all additional tariffs on each other's goods.

Bloomberg, citing two people familiar with the matter, reported on Wednesday that a U.S. trade team will travel to Beijing the week of Jan. 7 for talks.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that talks were likely in early January.

In yet another reconciliatory sign, China issued on Tuesday a so-called negative list that specifies industries where investors - domestic or foreign - are either restricted or prohibited.

The unified list is seen as another effort to address concern among Western investors that there is no level-playing field in China. Investment in key Chinese sectors, however, is still prohibited.

Gao said China would ""comprehensively"" remove all market access restrictions for foreign investors by the end of March, in areas not included in a foreign investment ""negative"" list published in June.

China has pledged to open its vast domestic market further to foreign investors and better protect their rights in the face of growing complaints and reduced foreign investment.

The commerce ministry is working on improving market access to foreign investors in the telecommunications, education, medical and culture sectors, Gao said, when asked about areas that could see curbs eased.

In particular, the equity cap on foreign investment in the education and medical sectors, which are of ""great interest to foreign investors with a large gap in domestic supply"", would be relaxed, he said, without giving a timeline.

On Wednesday, China unveiled the draft of a foreign investment law containing a proposed ban on forced technology transfer and illegal government ""interference"" in foreign business operations, practices that have come under the spotlight during the trade war.

In an apparent move to emphasize reciprocity, the draft law reserves the right to retaliate against countries that discriminate against Chinese investment with ""corresponding measures"".

The draft will likely go through several readings before being submitted to parliament for formal approval, which could take another year or more.

Heaping some uncertainty in the way of the trade talks was the recent arrest of the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in Canada at the request of the United States.

U.S. prosecutors accuse Meng Wanzhou of misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder, has said she is innocent.

Along with the alleged mastermind, Raja, Delhi Police arrested two school owners in Deoria, Shambhu Nath Mishra and Manoj Kumar. The police said that the accused were distributing mark sheets and certificates via the fake education board.

The fake board was used to attract students who could not clear Matriculation and Intermediate Examination, and promise them that they would provide certificates and mark sheets at nominal charges. The gang had created over 23 websites for the fake board, the police said.

Police was also able to recover various fake marksheets, migration certificates, answer sheets, provisional rolls, board question papers, students register records, plain mark sheets and documents of class X and class XII.

According to ACP (Crime) Rajiv Ranjan, the accused were able to convince students that they were a recognised board and would arrange marks cards and certificates for students for Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 within two to three months.

If your company is not inclusive, it will wither away and die,"" declares Parmesh Shahani, head of Godrej India Culture Lab, to a gathering of 150 people at Godrej's Mumbai headquarters in Vikhroli on 13 December. The occasion is the launch of A Manifesto For Trans Inclusion In The Indian Workplace. Written over six months, the white paper makes a strong case for trans-inclusion and aims to be a practical guide to help companies navigate the challenges involved. It's also the latest in a string of high profile initiatives by Indian corporates aimed at empowering the trans community, especially in the past year.

In February, the VLCC Institute announced a free ""Assistant Beauty Therapist"" training course for transgender individuals at its Hyderabad branch. Over two dozen people have already completed the course. In July, Uber Eats -- the global ride-sharing behemoth's online food delivery subsidiary -- hired India's first transgender delivery agent in Chennai. In Kolkata, the Medica Superspecialty Hospital (part of the largest chain of hospitals in eastern India) hired two transgender operating theatre technicians on a six month internship. With big names such as Godrej, Tata Steel, Infosys and the Lalit Suri Hospitality Group -- all of which have implemented trans-inclusive policies in recent years -- leading the charge, it looks like India Inc is finally waking up to the benefits of diversity and trans-inclusion.

""Three years ago, when we held a consultation meeting for the UN Global LGBTI Standards of Conduct for Business at the Godrej headquarters, we called so many companies and only 15 showed up,"" says Shahani. ""And they asked us not to tell anyone that they had attended. But for this event, we've got people flying in from Delhi and Bangalore, and they're all saying please tell the press we're here.""

Visibly invisible

Transgender people -- individuals socially, legally and medically categorized as being either male or female, but who assert that this is not their self-identity and/or expression -- are the most visible members of India's LGBTQ+ community, and also its most marginalized. The 4.9 lakh strong community faces immense social stigma, banishment from family and traditional social structures as well as extreme levels of physical and sexual violence.

This marginalization also extends to economic activity, with an estimated 92% of Indian trans people excluded from the mainstream economy. Yet, until recently, their problems and needs were largely ignored. That changed in 2014 when, in the landmark NALSA (National Legal Services Authority vs Union of India) case, the Supreme Court granted legal identity to the ""third gender"", granting them all the fundamental rights guaranteed to a citizen of India, and directed state and central governments to implement initiatives for their betterment. This marked a small but significant change in how India perceives its transgender citizens, a shift evident in the community's portrayal in pop culture. In the last couple of years, trans people have been positively portrayed in ads (such as the 2017 Vicks ad about trans motherhood), television (the Kukoo character in Sacred Games) and film (Vijay Sethupathi's trans-woman lead character in the upcoming Tamil film Super Deluxe).

Corporate India has been slower on the uptake. But activists and corporate insiders working to push for trans inclusion received a shot in the arm earlier this year, when the broader LGBTQ+ community scored a historical legal victory. In September, the Supreme Court struck down the colonial-era Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized sex between consenting adults of the same gender. Even though the penal provision wasn't a legal barrier to hiring trans people -- it did not criminalize gender identity, only sexual behaviour -- it gave most corporates an excuse to stay away from conversations about LGBTQ+ rights. With the judgement, those conversations have now become mainstream, with even conservative industry bodies FICCI (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry) and CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) now hosting panels on LGBTQ+ diversity at their annual conclaves. ""The judgement removed the fig leaf from the companies that were citing 377 as a reason not to be trans-inclusive,"" says Shahani. "" Now they can be seen for who they are -- scared, homophobic or uninterested. That means a lot of other companies have rekindled their efforts. And people within companies who want change to happen have used it as a springboard to push for it.""

The trailblazers

Much credit for the growing interest in LGBTQ+ inclusion -- trans inclusion specifically -- goes to a small group of companies, some of which led the way even before the NALSA judgement. Both Infosys and IBM India, for example, implemented non-discriminatory policies and started employee resource groups for LGBTQ+ employees in 2011. Godrej and Royal Bank of Scotland have policies that extend medical benefits to same sex partners, with the former now also having gender neutral bathrooms and offering insurance cover for sexual reassignment surgery (SRS) for trans employees. These companies aren't just implementing these policies because it's the right thing to do -- though it is -- but also because it's good for their bottom line. The Godrej paper estimates that India's LGBTQ+ community has a combined spending power of $200 billion (₹ 14 lakh crore), while a 2016 World Bank report says that India is losing up to $32 billion annually due to homophobia and transphobia. That's money no company can leave on the table. Other benefits include a diverse talent pool and being more attractive to millennial candidates. ""Inclusion is a way to make more money, ensure innovation and also create a favourable reputation for a company in the digital age,"" says Shahani.

Keshav Suri, executive director of The Lalit Suri Hospitality Group, agrees. Suri has championed a number of LGBTQ+ initiatives in his organization, including LGBTQ+ nights and drag shows at the Kitty Su clubs, an equality and diversity HR policy and mediclaim cover for SRS and same-sex couples.

""At the end of the day, to have a discrimination free company only makes good business sense,"" says Suri, who has also launched the Keshav Suri Foundation to work on gender sensitization in corporates and skill development for trans people. ""If you have team members that are not able to be fully themselves, then they will not integrate with the company. But if you accept people for who they are, they'll give you a 100%.""

Anubhuti Banerjee always knew she was a trans-woman, but she didn't feel ready to transition until she was working with Tata Steel. At the time, the company had been making concrete efforts to become more diverse and inclusive. So when Banerjee told the company's chief diversity officer that she wanted to transition, she was immediately offered full backing and support, despite the lack of a policy to handle potential issues faced by trans employees.

""The top management were also extremely supportive,"" says Banerjee, who now leads the company's employee resource group for LGBTQ+ employees. ""I got the opportunity to make changes to the current policy so that they are more inclusive to people on the LGBTQ spectrum. That was a kind of empowerment that I never expected.""

Banerjee had to face insensitive questions and unsavoury comments from colleagues in the beginning but after an ongoing series of sensitization workshops, she says that things have gotten a lot better. Today, the company not only covers SRS under its medical insurance and has gender neutral bathrooms, it is also doing community outreach on gender sensitization at Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar, where Tata Steel has a sizable number of employees.

""Recently, someone who joined us from campus got in touch with me and asked if there was an employee resource group and affirmative policies for trans people,"" says Banerjee, who says Tata Steel's support played a big role in her family and friends' acceptance of her transition. ""That was one of the major factors in them joining the company. This gives us the strength to go on because it showed that people are paying attention at what you're doing, and it is going to have an impact.""

Less talk, more action

For trans individuals, a corporate job is about much more than a steady salary. It's about being afforded a life of basic dignity, and often a potential way back into their families and mainstream society. So it is unfortunate that the number of trans people in corporate workplaces remains so low, with trans activist and UNDP consultant Zainab Patel putting it at less than 300. Companies remain unsure of how to go about hiring trans employees and of what policies and infrastructure are necessary to make them feel welcome. This often goes beyond the workplace, as potential trans employees may need support to overcome challenges like finding housing and adjusting to mainstream work norms.

""For trans women especially, who are not within society and within a traditional family structure, adapting to the workplace is difficult,"" says trans-rights activist Olga Aaron, founder of the Bringing Adequate Values of Humanity (BRAVOH) movement. ""They're not used to fixed work hours, accountability, working under a boss. That's one of the main reasons they cannot cope.""

""The other thing is remuneration,"" adds Patel. ""If trans people have to give up any of their traditional income generation practices -- whether it be sex work, begging or dancing -- the job has to compensate for the economic loss they might face.""

Another major challenge is that due to lack of access to higher education, the pool of skilled candidates is quite small, despite skilling initiatives by a number of NGOs. If we are to make significant progress quickly, it's imperative that the government get involved. Of the 249 skill development campaigns run by the government, only one covers trans people. The trans community represents a missed opportunity for the Skill India campaign.

The biggest problem though, is that many companies are still unwilling to go the extra mile. ""They'd rather hold a panel discussion, or talk about changing their policies, but that's not how social change happens,"" says social inclusion start-up Periferry founder Neelam Jain. The Chennai-based organization has placed over 65 trans individuals in private sector jobs since its inception in May 2017, but Jain is sceptical of India Inc's commitment to trans-inclusion. ""We've done enough of guiding corporates on why they should do this. But they really want to play it safe. It's bizarre that they don't realise they could be part of a revolution, of making history.""

Despite the slow pace of change, 2018 has been a year of notable gains for the trans community. Or at least it had been before 17 December, when the Lok Sabha passed the controversial Transgender Persons (Rights and Protections) bill. Called regressive and discriminatory by many trans activists, the bill requires certification from a medical establishment just to say you're trans, criminalizes begging, makes no mention of reservations and has much more lenient penalties for sexual and physical assault on trans people than for similar offences against cisgender women. ""This is actually the anti-thesis of the rights demanded by the community"" says Patel. ""We've gone a generation back with this bill.""

Once again, the Centre has dropped the ball when it comes to trans rights. But India's powerful private sector has the potential to do better, and bring about real change and empowerment for the community. To do that though, the rest of India Inc must go beyond platitudes and panel discussions, and puts its money where its mouth is. As Jain pointedly told the crowd at the Godrej India Culture Lab event, with the removal of Section 377, and the clear benefits of having a more diverse and inclusive workplace, corporate India is out of excuses. ""It's not rocket science,"" she said."

From toilet to a roof over their heads

D1 is all that Lakshminarasamma and Obalappa -- residents of Kadapalakere village in Pavagada taluk -- received to construct a house by the gram panchayat. The two landless farmhands were forced to live in their neighbour's toilet for a year, anticipating grants under Ambedkar Awas Yojana. Officials blamed a ""technical glitch"" for the D1 grant joke played on the elderly couple. TNIE had reported their plight on November 3. A day later, a team of taluk-level officials, visited them and promised to help them get funds.

Bannerghatta stays safe

The TNIE had published two stories titled 'Land swap between defence, govt in sensitive zone' and 'Bannerghatta faces threat of being swallowed by urban jungle', on September 8. Lokayukta Justice Shetty initiated suo motu proceedings and started investigations into the issue, and directed authorities to take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening.

Lokayukta stops flow of filth

On July 20, 2018, TNIE published three stories -- 'Bengaluru may reap toxic veggies, for froth it sows', 'We don't want another Bellandur' and 'Sheep are falling sick' -- on the impact of polluted water supplied to lakes in Chikkaballapur and Kolar districts from the KC Valley project. Based on these reports, Lokayukta Justice P Vishwanatha Shetty issued notices to the Secretary, Minor Irrigation Department, the Chairman, Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board, Chief Executive Officer, Lake Conservation and Development Authority, and commissioners of BBMP and BDA. The Lokayukta asked the respondents to submit their responses within four weeks, and take measures to remedy the situation.

Kere Kamegowda, man on a mission

On July 15, 2018, TNIE reported how an 82-year-old shepherd had singlehandedly developed 14 ponds in Daasanadoddi village in Malavalli taluk of Mandya district. Over a span of four decades, Kamegowda had turned an entire hillside in his village green. Witness to the barren land, scorching heat and sufferings of birds and animals alike, Kamegowda -- often referred to as a 'madman' -- dug ponds for two hours every day for 40 years. Recognising his service after it was reported in TNIE, the Karnataka government conferred on him the Rajyotsava Prashasti, the highest state award. Kamegowda declared that he would use the award to dig more ponds.

At 91, forever student gets Rajyotsava

Learning never stopped for nonagenarian Shranabasavaraj Hadli, a retired government school teacher who wrote the entrance exam for a PhD course at Kannada University, Hampi. TNIE carried his inspiring story on September 6. Hadli, 91, from Bisaralli village in Koppal taluk, was selected for the Rajyotsava award this year. Hadli, who has authored 15 books and penned a few songs, applied for a PhD in 'Vachana Sahitya' at the university. Of his four sons and two daughters, two sons retired recently.

Rai pays heed, villagers get pure water

Actor Prakash Rai came to the rescue of people at Bandlarahatti in Hiriyur taluk after TNIE reported about the lack of work happening in the village that he adopted, on January 27. After the publication of the report, titled '10 months after adopting Hiriyur village, Prakash Rai yet to show up' on October 11, Prakash ensured that a water purification unit is installed at a cost of D3 lakh. The new plant started functioning in the village, and villagers are happily drawing water from this facility now.

Martyrs' kin get their due

Lokayukta Justice P Vishwanatha Shetty asked officials concerned to take action after TNIE wrote about families of 13 martyrs awaiting benefits after the soldiers died on duty. The story, 'Families of martyrs from Karnataka wait endlessly for compensation,' published on July 19, narrated the plight of the martyrs' kin as the files were held up at the offices of the concerned Deputy Commissioners and Urban Development Authorities. Justice Shetty asked the government to dispose off the families' applications within 8 weeks. He also asked the Revenue department to submit the status report after securing the report from the deputy commissioners concerned and registered a suo motu complaint.

Gadkari takes note of smart suggestion on NH

Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari asked the National Highways Authority of India for a new Detailed Project Report after TNIE published a report about citizens' seeking a relook at the proposal to upgrade National Highway 766C. The February 15 report, 'Citizens suggest shortcut during highway upgrade,' featured people of Hosanagar and members of Kollur Mookambika temple suggesting a method to cut 19 km from the proposed highway by diverting the existing stretch between Hosanagar and Adogodi via Nagara and Sampekatte through Sutta and Bekkodi.

Rapist in dock; jawan, sister get justice

On May 23, TNIE wrote about the struggle of an Army jawan to get justice for his 20-year-old sister who was raped for one-and-a-half years by a rowdy. The jawan, hailing from Muddibehal, was posted in Assam, and discovered the alleged crime when he came home in 2017. He thrashed the accused and took him to the police, who refused to register a complaint. Taking notice of the TNIE report, titled 'Karnataka: Army jawan struggles to get justice for his sister who was raped,' the Indian Army wrote to the district police and administration, asking them to take action. Based on the letter, police registered a complaint and the case is in court.

No to amphitheatre, yes to college playground

A decision was taken to demolish an open-air theatre built by actress Bhavana Ramanna on a playground belonging to Government Arts College in Bengaluru after TNIE reported about it. The government is also mulling recovering the expenditure needed for the demolition work from the previous principal of the college who had allowed the work to begin. The Higher Education Minister was prompted to order an inquiry into the project following the TNIE report, 'Private open air theatre at government college sparks row', published on August 7. TNIE was the first to report a decision by the State government to allow the construction, which, the actress said, aimed to provide space for artistes to perform in the heart of the city.

Frothy lake grabs govt attention

After a story on the bad condition of Byramangala lake at Bidadi in Ramanagara district was published in TNIE on August 23, the Minor Irrigation Department ordered preparation of a Detailed Project Report for setting up a sewage treatment plant. The report, 'Bengaluru feeds its poison to Byramangala lake in Bidadi, gets back its taste,' highlighted how industrial and city waste was entering the lake through the Vrushabhavati river and polluting nearby villages, leading to health issues. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) also started sending officials to inspect industries in and around Bidadi to prevent them from letting untreated water into Byramangala Lake.

Water channel comes back to life, irrigates farms again

After a story on the unscientific road work taken up by the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) Department at Idu gram panchayat in Karkala taluk was published on December 22, RDPR engineers instructed the contractors concerned to dig the trench and make a channel to ensure resumption of water supply to fields. The story, 'Farms left parched as road project buries water channel,' highlighted how the 1.44km road, under 'Namma Grama Namma Rasthe' scheme, from Idu Palke to Batteni, had buried a traditional water channel that used to irrigate 70 acres of paddy fields. Ajith Kumar Jain, a farmer, told TNIE that farmers are happy now since the refurbishing of the channel began on December 24.

Reuniting a child with her foster mother

For seven years, Jayashree Guttedar had brought up an abandoned girl as her own, only to be told that she was raising the girl ""illegally"". The wailing baby that Jayashree had rescued from a bush near a private maternity hospital in Gubbi Colony in Kalaburagi years ago, was taken away by Women and Child Development department officials to an orphanage. Jayashree -- a mother of three who had accepted the girl as her own -- had to run from pillar to post, fighting to claim the child with proper documentation. Jayashree then reached out to district in-charge minister Priyank Kharge. On October 3, 2018, TNIE carried the story, highlighting the torment of the mother. Minister Kharge intervened, and the child was returned to Jayashree with coordination from the district commissioner."

The video of the incident in Punganur Mandal of Chittoor district on Wednesday went viral within hours, following which people demanded stringent action against the school authorities. Child Rights activists from Hyderabad have reached out to the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights to initiate immediate action.

""This heinous, corporal punishment is unacceptable. You cannot punish children in such a way for being late to school. Parents send their children to schools entrusting the authorities and keeping a lot of confidence in them. If they (schools) resort to such ugly acts, what will the parents do?"" child rights activist Achyuth Rao told News18.

Following a complaint by the area's education officer, a case was registered under Juvenile Justice Act and IPC Section 323. The police are yet to take the school authorities, who are on the run, into custody.

The education department has, meanwhile, decided to withdraw the schools recognition for the next year. ""The parents, children and the school staff have been investigated. A detailed report will be out by the end of the day. The punishment is unacceptable and violates child rights. We are going to withdraw the school's recognition for 2019-2020,"" Dr K Panduranga Swamy, Chittoor District Education Officer, told News18.

Families of the students, along with activists, staged protests outside the mandal education department, demanding suspension of the school principal and the teacher responsible for the punishment.

The affected students will now be provided counselling by local child rights activists.

Schools authorities did not respond to News18's questions."

This is not the first time such an incident has been reported in the state. NDTV reported that in 2015, two students of a government school in Bheemunipatnam Mandal were hospitalised after a teacher allegedly asked them to take off their shirts and stand in the sun, as punishment for not doing their homework.

The students, who are brothers, reportedly collapsed after standing in the heat for nearly three hours. Two teachers, Rani Kumari and Anil Kumar were suspended, The News Minute reported.

The incident came days after a 13-year-old student in Andhra Pradesh alleged that her school principal forced her to take a pregnancy test, over suspicions that she was having an affair with a teacher.

Activists, social media hits back

Following the incident, child rights activists and netizens alike condemned the incident. Child rights activists have alleged that the principal of the private school and the local divisional educational officer tried to hush up the incident when the video of punishment went viral and the parents lodged a protest, India Today reported.

India Today also quoted activist Achyut Rao as saying: ""We earnestly request the (National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights) to issue orders to initiate action under the provisions of Posco Act and immediately order an enquiry.""

On Twitter, one user tweeted: ""Shocking punishment by a private school In Chittoor #AndhraPradesh, minor students were forced to stand necked as they came late to the school. Child rights activists demand criminal action on management.

The Delhi Police has arrested three men for allegedly running a fake education board in the national capital and other parts of the country, officials said Wednesday. The accused have been identified as Altaf Raja (23), Shambhu Nath Mishra (46) and Manoj Kumar (32), they said.

According to police, the accused used to distribute marksheets and certificates through the fake education board and the three have cheated more than 10,000 students belonging to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and other states. The fake board syndicate used to allure students who could not pass the Matriculation and Intermediate Examination on promise that they will provide the certificate and marksheet at nominal charges, police said.

On September 9, police received information that Raja along with his accomplices was operating the board by the name of Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi in Vikas Puri. They represent that their board was recognised and provided marksheets and certificates of class 10 and 12 within two-three months for Rs 5,000 to 10,000, Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) Rajiv Ranjan said.

A complaint in this regard was also received from the Delhi Directorate of Education, he said. A trap was laid and Altaf Raja was apprehended while delivering the fake certificates and marksheets, he added. During investigation, other accused -- Shambhu Nath Mishra and Manoj Kumar -- were also arrested, he said. Police said the gang prepared more than 23 websites of the fake board.

In September 2017, accused Raja was arrested along with Pandey for preparing fake board certificates. After coming out of jail, they again started running the syndicate on a higher level. However, Pandey is presently in jail in connection with the case, the officer said. During further investigation, one Rampal of Rampur was also traced who stated that he had procured marksheets and certificates of class 10 and 12 on his name from these agents of the fake board syndicate in Rampur.

He, along with three other persons, was arrested during the verification of documents issued by the board in the recruitment of U P Police in 2018, the officer added. Many fake marksheets, certificates, provisional certificates, migration certificates, answer sheets, nominal rolls, question papers of the board, registers of record of students, blank marksheets and certificates of class 10 and 12 have been recovered, police said."

arises is as regards the power of the Disciplinary Authority in the instant case

being the Hon'ble the Chief Justice, the Hon'ble Judges of this Court to

institute the disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner. There can be no

dispute about the fact that the Maharashtra Civil Services Rules are applicable.

A useful reference could be made to Rule 8(1) and (2) of the said Rules which

are relevant for the purpose of the present Petition:

8. Procedure for imposing major penalties:(

1)

No order imposing any of the major penalties

shall be made except after an inquiry held, as far

as may be, in the manner provided in this rule

and Rule 9, or where such inquiry is held under

the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850 (37 of

1850) in the manner provided in that Act.

(2) Whenever the disciplinary authority is of the

opinion that there are grounds for inquiring into

the truth of any imputation of misconduct or

misbehaviour against a Government servant, it

may itself inquire into, or appoint under this rule

or under the provisions of the Public Servants

(Inquiries) Act, 1850, as the case may be, an

authority to inquire into the truth thereof.

Provided that, where there is a complaint of

sexual harassment within the meaning of Rule 22A

of Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules

1979, the Complaints Committee established in

each Department or Office for inquiring into such

complaints, shall be deemed to be the inquiring

authority appointed by the disciplinary authority

for the purpose of these rules and the Complaints

Committee shall hold, if separate procedure has

not been prescribed for the Complaints

Committee for holding the inquiry into the

complaints for sexual harassments, the inquiry as

for as practicable in accordance with the

procedure laid down in these rules.

ExplanationWhere

a disciplinary authority

itself holds an inquiry under this rule, any

reference to an inquiring authority in this rule

shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be

construed as reference to the disciplinary

authority.

A reading of the said Rule 8(2) therefore discloses that the

discretion is of the Disciplinary Authority if it is of the opinion that there are

grounds for inquiring into the truth of any imputation of misconduct or

misbehaviour against a Government servant. Hence the said Rule (2) can be

said to confer a wide discretion in the Disciplinary Authority in the matter of

inquiring into the truth of any misconduct or misbehaviour against the

Government servant.

12 Now coming to the guide lines which have been formulated by the

Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India which are comprised in the letter dated 3102014

they read thus:A.

The complaint making allegations against

members of the Subordinate Judiciary in the

States should not be entertained and no action

should be taken thereon, unless it is accompanies

by a duly sworn Affidavit and verifiable material

to substantiate the allegations made therein.

B. If action on such complaint meeting the

above requirement is deemed necessary,

authenticity of complaint should be duly

ascertained and further steps thereon should be

taken only after satisfaction of the competent

authority designated by the Chief Justice of the

High Court.

C. If the above requirements are not complied

with, the complaint should be filed/lodged

without taking any steps thereon.

The said guidelines were modified and communicated vide letter

dated 1632017

issued by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice Of India. The

modification carried out which is relevant for the purposes of the present

Petition is in clause (A). The modified clause (A) reads thus:

A. The complaint making allegations against

members of the Subordinate Judiciary in the

States should not be entertained and no action

should be taken thereon, unless it is accompanied

by a duly sworn Affidavit and/or verifiable

material to substantiate the allegations made

therein.

(emphasis supplied)

13 Hence by modification the requirement is that a complaint should

be accompanied by duly sworn affidavit and/or verifiable material to

substantiate the allegations made therein. Hence a complaint can be

entertained in two contingencies one is when a complaint is accompanied by a

duly sworn affidavit and second is when the complaint contains verifiable

material. It is in the light of the said modification that the instant case would

have to be considered. The said modification being in the matter of the

procedure which is required to be followed prior to holding a Departmental

Enquiry, the same would obviously relate back to the date of issuance of the

show cause notice, even if the notice is prior to the issuance of the

modification.

ORDINARY ORIGINAL CIVIL JURISDICTION

WRIT PETITION NO.643 OF 2017

Asif Badremunir Tahasildar Vs. State of Maharashtra

CORAM :R. M. SAVANT, &

SARANG V KOTWAL, JJ

PRONOUNCED ON : 4th MAY, 2018

Citation: 2018(6) MHLJ 850

JUDGMENT (PER R.M.SAVANT J.)

1 By the above Writ Petition No.643 of 2017 the Petitioner is

challenging the order dated 1572016,

(Exhibit N) by which order the

Learned Registrar General of this Court has informed the Petitioner that the

Disciplinary Authority in exercise of the powers conferred by Subrule

5(c) of

Rule 8 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules 1979,

has decided to hold a Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. By the

orders passed on the same date, the Enquiry Officer was also appointed to

enquire into the charges.

In so far as the Writ Petition No.692 of 2017 is concerned, the said

Writ Petition also challenges the order dated 1572016,

(Exhibit D) which

order is to the same effect as the order impugned in the above Writ Petition

No.643 of 2017. By a separate order passed on the said date an Enquiry

Officer has also been appointed to looked into the charges which are the

subject matter of the second Departmental Enquiry.

2 Since the Petitions involve a common question as to whether the

Departmental Enquiry could be commenced against the Petitioner in the

absence of a written complaint supported by an affidavit, both the Petitions are

heard together and are being disposed of together.

3 The facts giving rise to the above Petitions can in brief be stated

thus:

WRIT PETITION NO.643 OF 2017

The Petitioner was appointed as a Civil Judge Junior Division.

The Petitioner at the relevant time in the context of the Departmental Enquiry

was working as a Civil Judge Junior Division in Bhokardan District Jalna. A

complaint was received from one Mr. Teple against the Petitioner concerning

his tenure as Civil Judge Junior Division, Bhokardan District Jalna. By the said

complaint disciplinary action was sought against the Petitioner. The then

Learned Principal District Judge, Jalna forwarded the said complaint to the

Registrar General of this Court. The complaint was placed before the

Disciplinary Committee. The Disciplinary Committee comprising of the

Hon'ble Judges of this Court directed the Learned Principal District Judge

Jalna to conduct a fact finding enquiry. The report of the fact finding enquiry

was thereafter placed before the Disciplinary Committee who decided to

initiate a Disciplinary Enquiry against the Petitioner. The Petitioner was

accordingly issued a show cause notice along with the memo of charges and

statement of imputations. The Petitioner submitted his reply to the said show

cause notice. The matter was placed before the Disciplinary Committee who

considered the entire material including the reply submitted by the Petitioner,

as the said reply was found not satisfactory, the Disciplinary Committee

decided to hold a regular Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. It is by

the impugned communication dated 1572016

that the Petitioner was

communicated the said decision which as indicated above is the subject matter

of the above Writ Petition.

WRIT PETITION NO.692 OF 2017

4 Information was received by the Learned Principal District Judge,

Kolhapur as regards the incident which had taken place on 1672015

involving the Petitioner. In the said incident the Petitioner had allegedly

assaulted the bus driver of the school bus of his daughter and thereafter

threatened the driver and the owner of the bus that he would involve them in

a case under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and put them behind

bars for a period of 4 days. Pursuant to the said information which the

Learned Principal District Judge Kolhapur had received, he directed the

Learned District Judge3,

Kolhapur to conduct a discreet enquiry in respect of

the said incident. The Learned District Judge3

proceeded to Ajara, District

Kolhapur which was the place of posting of the Petitioner and conducted a

discreet enquiry in respect of the said incident which had allegedly taken place

on 1672015.

In the course of the said discreet enquiry, the Learned District

Judge3

recorded the statements of the driver, owner of the school bus and

some other persons and accordingly submitted his report to the Learned

Principal District Judge. The Learned Principal District Judge upon receipt of

the said report in turn submitted his report to the Learned Registrar General of

this Court. The matter was thereafter placed before the Disciplinary

Committee of this Court. Thereafter on 512016

the Disciplinary Committee

considered the said report and decided to initiate disciplinary action against

the Petitioner. The Petitioner was served with a show cause notice with the

articles of charges and statement of imputations. The Petitioner has filed his

reply to the said show cause notice on 1752016.

The matter was placed

before the Disciplinary Committee along with the Petitioner's reply and the

report of the Learned Principal District Judge. As the Petitioner's reply was not

found to be satisfactory, the Disciplinary Committee decided to initiate regular

Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner which decision was

communicated to the Petitioner by the impugned order dated 1572016.

As

indicated above by an order passed on the same day the Enquiry Officer was

also appointed to looked into the charges alleged against the Petitioner.

5 At this stage it would be relevant to refer to the charges which are

alleged against the Petitioner. The said charges are reproduced hereinunder:

WRIT PETITION NO.643 O F 2017

(First Departmental Enquiry)

Charge1

That during your tenure at Bhokardhan you were

staying in rented house owned by Shri Bismilla

Khan Mahetab Khan r/o Bhokardhan. In your

letter dated 08.04.2010 addressed to Executive

Engineer, P. W. D., Jalna you had informed the

Executive Engineer that as no Government

accommodation was available for you at

Bhokardhan, the Principal District Judge, Jalna

had granted permission to you to stay in private

accommodation on rental basis. Accordingly you

had acquired house of Shri Bismilla Khan

Mahetab Khan at Bhokardhan on rent of

Rs.6,000/and

requested him to issue Certificate

in that regard. The copy of said letter was also

addressed to the SubDivisional

Officer, P. W. D.,

Jalna. After the dispatch of the said letter

addressed to the Executive Engineer, P.W.D. Jalna,

you had carried out correction in your own

handwriting by rewriting

the figure Rs.5,000/as

Rs.6,000/and

in words Rupees Five thousand

as Rupees Six thousand. As per your oral

direction the SubDivisional

Officer, P. W. D., Jalna

also made correction in copy of your letter

addressed to him. However, in the office copy

maintained by the office, no such corrections

have been carried out and the amount of rent is

written as Rs.5000/per

month in figures as well

as in words. Thus by misusing your official

position you had made corrections in forwarding

letter later on for your personal benefit.

Charge2

That you had submitted medical bill of

Rs.20,513/regarding

treatment of your wife,

Smt. Najnin Tahasildar for reimbursement. In

order to get medical reimbursement bill you

produced false documents i.e. ""Mata Balak

Saurakshan Card (ANC Card) purporting to be

signed by the Medical Officer, Rural Health

Centre, Bhokhardhan, and that by producing such

false documents you obtained the amount of

Rs.20,513/on

22.11.2010, you thus not only

produced false document but used the said false

document (ANC Card) for encashing medical bill

knowing that it was a false document and thereby

caused wrongful gain to yourself and wrongful

loss to the state exchequer and thereby

committed gross misconduct.

Charge3

That from 08.02.02010 till 03042010

you

were stationed at Jalna for training, as per the

letter dated 17.10.2012 of the District Court,

Jalna (tk-dz-@vkLFkk 6266@2012) you had sought

permission to leave headquarters for going to

Bhokardhan only on 14.03.2010 and 24.03.2010.

That during the crossexamination

in the

departmental enquiry NO.03/2011 initiated

against Shri K. E. Teple, Junior Clerk, Civil Court,

Bhokardhan you deposed ""gs Eg.kus [kjs ukgh dh] eh

ekb&;k iRuhyk xzkeh.k #X.kky; Hkksdjnu ;sFks fn-09-02-2010 o

06-03-2010 jksth ?ksmu xsyks ukgh"" Thus you either made

false statement in the crossexamination

in the

abovesaid departmental enquiry or on

09.02.2010 and 06.03.2010 you went to P. H.C.,

Bhokardhan, without seeking permission from

the principal District Judge, Jalna to leave the

headquarter on the abovesaid dates. You, thereby

failed to maintain absolute integrity and devotion

to duty by indulging in most inappropriate

behaviour.

WRIT PETITION NO.692 OF 2017

(Second Departmental Enquiry)

Charge1

That on 16.07.2015 at 8.15 a.m. one Shri

Ashok Laxman Lohar, Driver of school van

reached your bungalow to pickup your daughter

Ms. Layba for school. After waiting there for five

minutes, the driver Shri Ashok started the van.

Thereafter you immediately came out of your

house and started abusing and beating the said

driver. When he tried to run away, your servant

caught him and presented him before you then

you again beat him by kick and fist blows. Your

abovesaid misbehaviour shows that you failed to

maintain judicial discipline or propriety and you

conducted yourself in a manner unbecoming of a

Judicial Officer and brought great disrepute to

the institution as a whole.

Charge2

After the said incident you called Shri Vijay

Jyotiba Kesarkar and Shri Stephen, owners of the

vehicle and Shri Ashok Lohar, Driver, during

office hours i.e. 11.00 a.m. in the court, talked

rudely with them and threatened them that you

will detain them for four days. When they

apologized, you threatened them that you would

file complaint against them by calling the officer

of Education Department. You further threatened

them that you will file complaint against them

under section 307 of I.P.C. to the effect that they

were in the van and they purposely tried to run

over him. Your abovesaid misbehaviour shows

that you failed to maintain judicial discipline or

propriety and you conducted yourself in a

manner unbecoming of a Judicial Officer and

brought great disrepute to the institution as a

whole.

Charge3

That you misused your position to make

Shri Vijay J. Kesarkar and Ashok Lohar to take

back the statements given by them during the

preliminary enquiry and accordingly both of them

filed application to withdraw their statements

recorded during the enquiry. You thus failed to

maintain absolute integrity by indulging in most

inappropriate behaviour.

Hence the allegations against the Petitioner in the Second

Departmental Enquiry are two fold, one is the alleged assault of the driver of

the school bus by the Petitioner and the second is the threat given by the

Petitioner.

6 In so far as the processing of complaint received against the

members of subordinate

judiciary is concerned, the Hon'ble The Chief Justice

of India had issued guide lines which are comprised in his letter dated 3102014

addressed to the Hon'ble Chief Justices of the High Courts. The said

guidelines were issued so that a uniform procedure is followed by all the High

Courts dealing with such complaints. The background to the issuance of the

said guidelines is contained in the said letter dated 3102014.

The said guide

lines came to be modified by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India, which

modification was communicated by letter dated 1632017.

The modification

carried out was in respect of clause (A) of the said guidelines. A reference

would be made to the text of the said guidelines a bit later in this judgment.

7 As indicated above, the order dated 1562017

passed by the

Learned Registrar of this Court informing the Petitioner of holding of the

disciplinary proceedings against him in respect of two sets of charges which

are subject matter of the two disciplinary proceedings, is the subject matter of

the above Petitions.

8 Heard, the Learned Counsel for the parties.

9 The principal contention of the Learned Counsel appearing for the

Petitioner Mr. Shaikh was that the commencement of the Departmental

Enquiry against the Petitioner was in breach of the guidelines issued by the

Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India as the Departmental Enquiry sought to be

commenced against the Petitioner without there being a written complaint and

an affidavit in support thereof as mandated by the said guidelines. The

Learned Counsel would contend that in cases of the absence of a written

complaint and an affidavit in support thereof the Departmental Enquiry

commenced against the judicial officers have been quashed and set aside. The

Learned Counsel sought to place reliance on the unreported judgment of the

Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court in the matter of Girishkumar

Rameshchandra Soni Vs. State of Gujarat & Ors. dated 1592017

and the

judgment of the Apex Court in the matter of R. C. Sood Vs. High Court of

Judicature at Rajasthan & Ors.1 The Learned Counsel would contend that

though in respect of the second Departmental Enquiry the Petitioner had

pursuant to the show cause notice issued to him represented against the said

show cause notice and pointed out as to how it was unnecessary to hold a

Departmental Enquiry against him. The reply of the Petitioner has not been

taken into consideration and neither has the Petitioner been afforded a

personal hearing though the Petitioner had requested for the same. It was

next contended by the Learned Counsel that in so far as the first Departmental

1 (1998)5 Supreme Court Cases 493

Enquiry is concerned i.e. the incidents which have taken place whilst the

Petitioner was posted at Bhokardan District Jalna. The complaint made by one

Mr. Teple was motivated in view of the fact that the Petitioner was an Enquiry

Officer in the preliminary inquiry which was held against the said Mr. Teple.

The Learned Counsel would next contend that in so far as the second

Departmental Enquiry is concerned, which is in respect of the alleged incident

which took place at Ajara, District Kolhapur, whilst the Petitioner was posted

there. There is a reference to Advocate Mr. Shailesh Deshpande in the report

of the Learned District Judge who carried out discreet enquiry, the said

Advocate was not recommended by the Petitioner for appointment to the post

of AGP. It was sought to be contended by the Learned Counsel that why the

reference to the Advocate Mr. Shailesh Deshpande appears in the report of the

Learned District Judge 3

who carried out the discreet enquiry, is unknown.

10 Per contra the Learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent

No.2, Mr. Nerlekar would submit that power to hold the Departmental Enquiry

against the judicial officer belonging to the subordinate

judiciary is conferred

by Rule 8(2) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules

1979. The said Rule confers a wide power on the Disciplinary Authority in so

far as holding of the Departmental Enquiry is concerned and the said Rule

leaves it to the subjective satisfaction of the Disciplinary Authority whether

such an enquiry is required to be held. The Learned Counsel would contend

that in so far as the guide lines are concerned, they have been modified by the

subsequent communication dated 1632017

and the words ""and/or verifiable

material"" has been included in the guide lines meaning thereby that a

Departmental Enquiry can be commenced either when there is a complaint

accompanied by an Affidavit and/or there is verifiable material. In the instant

case, the report of the discreet enquiry which report has been forwarded to

this Court by the Learned Principal District Judge, comprised the verifiable

material on the basis of which the Departmental Enquiry has been commenced

against the Petitioner. The Learned Counsel would next contend that in the

instant case the Learned Principal District Judge of Kolhapur has submitted a

report to this Court for taking appropriate action in the matter of holding of a

Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. The Learned Counsel would

contend that the contention of the Petitioner that at the stage of considering

his explanation to the show cause notice the Petitioner is required to be heard,

is misconceived . The Disciplinary Authority on the basis of the material which

has come on record till that stage which includes the reply, has to only come to

a prima facie conclusion that there is material to proceed against the

delinquent. The Learned Counsel would next contend that reliance placed on

the judgments of the Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court as well as the

judgment of the Apex Curt in R. S. Sood, is misplaced as the said judgments

were rendered in the fact situation as prevailing in the said cases. The

Learned Counsel would contend that the Petitioner would obviously have

adequate opportunity to controvert the charges which are levied against him in

the Departmental Enquiry that would be held against him. However, on one

ground or the other the said Departmental Enquiries have been unduly

delayed by the Petitioner. The Learned Counsel would lastly contend that

since the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked against the communication

informing the Petitioner of holding of a Departmental Enquiry against him, this

court would not exercise its extra ordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the

Constitution of India. In support of which contention reliance was placed on

the following judgments of the Apex Court.

1. Union of India & Anr. Vs. Kunisetty Satyanarayana (2006) 12 SCC 28

2. Special Director & Anr. Vs Mohd. Ghulam Ghouse & Anr (2004) 3 SCC 440

3. Executive Engineer, Bihar State Housing Board. Vs. Ramesh Kumar Singh &

Ors. (1996) 1 SCC 327

4. State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Brahm Datt Sharma & Anr (1987) 2 SCC 179.

11 Having heard the Learned Counsel for the parties we have

bestowed our anxious consideration to the rival contentions.

In the context of the challenge raised in the above Petitions, the issue that

arises is as regards the power of the Disciplinary Authority in the instant case

being the Hon'ble the Chief Justice, the Hon'ble Judges of this Court to

institute the disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner. There can be no

dispute about the fact that the Maharashtra Civil Services Rules are applicable.

A useful reference could be made to Rule 8(1) and (2) of the said Rules which

are relevant for the purpose of the present Petition:

8. Procedure for imposing major penalties:(

1)

No order imposing any of the major penalties

shall be made except after an inquiry held, as far

as may be, in the manner provided in this rule

and Rule 9, or where such inquiry is held under

the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850 (37 of

1850) in the manner provided in that Act.

(2) Whenever the disciplinary authority is of the

opinion that there are grounds for inquiring into

the truth of any imputation of misconduct or

misbehaviour against a Government servant, it

may itself inquire into, or appoint under this rule

or under the provisions of the Public Servants

(Inquiries) Act, 1850, as the case may be, an

authority to inquire into the truth thereof.

Provided that, where there is a complaint of

sexual harassment within the meaning of Rule 22A

of Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules

1979, the Complaints Committee established in

each Department or Office for inquiring into such

complaints, shall be deemed to be the inquiring

authority appointed by the disciplinary authority

for the purpose of these rules and the Complaints

Committee shall hold, if separate procedure has

not been prescribed for the Complaints

Committee for holding the inquiry into the

complaints for sexual harassments, the inquiry as

for as practicable in accordance with the

procedure laid down in these rules.

ExplanationWhere

a disciplinary authority

itself holds an inquiry under this rule, any

reference to an inquiring authority in this rule

shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be

construed as reference to the disciplinary

authority.

A reading of the said Rule 8(2) therefore discloses that the

discretion is of the Disciplinary Authority if it is of the opinion that there are

grounds for inquiring into the truth of any imputation of misconduct or

misbehaviour against a Government servant. Hence the said Rule (2) can be

said to confer a wide discretion in the Disciplinary Authority in the matter of

inquiring into the truth of any misconduct or misbehaviour against the

Government servant.

12 Now coming to the guide lines which have been formulated by the

Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India which are comprised in the letter dated 3102014

they read thus:A.

The complaint making allegations against

members of the Subordinate Judiciary in the

States should not be entertained and no action

should be taken thereon, unless it is accompanies

by a duly sworn Affidavit and verifiable material

to substantiate the allegations made therein.

B. If action on such complaint meeting the

above requirement is deemed necessary,

authenticity of complaint should be duly

ascertained and further steps thereon should be

taken only after satisfaction of the competent

authority designated by the Chief Justice of the

High Court.

C. If the above requirements are not complied

with, the complaint should be filed/lodged

without taking any steps thereon.

The said guidelines were modified and communicated vide letter

dated 1632017

issued by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice Of India. The

modification carried out which is relevant for the purposes of the present

Petition is in clause (A). The modified clause (A) reads thus:

A. The complaint making allegations against

members of the Subordinate Judiciary in the

States should not be entertained and no action

should be taken thereon, unless it is accompanied

by a duly sworn Affidavit and/or verifiable

material to substantiate the allegations made

therein.

(emphasis supplied)

13 Hence by modification the requirement is that a complaint should

be accompanied by duly sworn affidavit and/or verifiable material to

substantiate the allegations made therein. Hence a complaint can be

entertained in two contingencies one is when a complaint is accompanied by a

duly sworn affidavit and second is when the complaint contains verifiable

material. It is in the light of the said modification that the instant case would

have to be considered. The said modification being in the matter of the

procedure which is required to be followed prior to holding a Departmental

Enquiry, the same would obviously relate back to the date of issuance of the

show cause notice, even if the notice is prior to the issuance of the

modification.

14 Now coming to the facts of the instant case in so far as the first

enquiry is concerned, the same is on the basis of the complaint made by Shri

Teple, which was processed by the Learned Principal District Judge Jalna and

then a report was submitted to the Learned Registrar General of this Court

which was thereafter placed before the Disciplinary Committee which directed

the issuance of the show cause notice to the Petitioner pursuant to which the

Petitioner replied to the said show cause notice and the reply having been

found not to be satisfactory, the Disciplinary Committee of this Court decided

to hold the Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. In so far as the

second Departmental Enquiry is concerned, the Learned Principal District

Judge having received information of the incident which took place on 1672015

had directed the Learned District Judge3

to conduct a discreet enquiry

in respect of the said incident which the Learned Judge conducted and

reported to the Learned Principal District Judge. The Learned Principal

District Judge on receipt of the said report forwarded the same to the Learned

Registrar General of this Court with his recommendation. The Petitioner was

thereafter issued a show cause notice as to why a Departmental Enquiry

should not be held against him. The Petitioner submitted his reply. Having

found the reply of the Petitioner to be unsatisfatory, the Disciplinary Authority

decided to hold a Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner. Hence in

respect of both the Departmental Enquiries there is a report of the Learned

Principal District Judge which was forwarded along with the verifiable

material which was in the form of the report of the discreet enquiry conducted

by the Learned Principal District Judge3.

In respect of the second

Departmental Enquiry and the complaint made by Mr. Teple who is an

employee of the Court, the same was also forwarded by the Learned Principal

District Judge along with his report. Hence in so far as the Departmental

Enquiries against the Petitioner are concerned, they would be covered by the

second part of clause (A) namely that they are based on verifiable material to

substantiate the allegations made. It is therefore not possible to accept the

contention of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner that in the absence of

there being written complaint accompanied by a duly sworn affidavit, no

Departmental Enquiry can be initiated against the Petitioner. It is also not

possible to accept the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner that

the complaint and the duly sworn affidavit have to be read together with the

verifiable material so as to mean that the material cannot be independently

brought forward but has to be by way of a complaint which is accompanied by

a sworn affidavit. It is probably on account of the difficulties faced in

proceeding and initiating the disciplinary proceedings wherein information is

received by the Learned Principal District Judge or any other authority of the

Court that the amendment in the guide lines was made vide letter dated 1632017

by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India. Construing the guidelines in

the manner sought by the the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner would fetter

the powers of the Disciplinary Authority in initiating departmental proceedings

against the erring judicial officers and thereby negating the power vested in

the Disciplinary Authority for enquiring into the truth of the allegations

against a judicial officer.

15 In so far as the submission of the Learned Counsel for the

Petitioner that the reply of the Petitioner has not been considered and that the

Petitioner has also not been given a hearing in so far as the second

Departmental Enquiry is concerned, in our view the said submission is

misconceived. The Disciplinary Authority is under no obligation at the stage of

the show cause notice to afford any opportunity of hearing to a delinquent.

The Disciplinary Authority has only to consider whether there are grounds for

proceeding with so as to enquire into the truth of any allegations against the

judicial officer. In our view therefore, the said submission cannot be accepted

and there is no violation of the principles of natural justice merely because no

hearing was afforded prior to the Disciplinary Authority coming to a conclusion

to proceed departmentally against the Petitioner.

16 Now coming to the judgments on which reliance was placed by the

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner is concerned, the cause for allowing the

Special Civil Application filed by the Petitioner therein are two fold namely that

since the allegation made against the Petitioner was as regards sexual

harassment in respect of which a complaint was required to be in writing in

terms of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention,

Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 and prior thereto under the Rules which

were framed pursuant to the judgment in Vishakha's case and since in the said

case there was no written complaint but action was sought to be taken on the

basis of the oral complaint made by three Advocates. The Division Bench was

of the view that the disciplinary proceedings could not be initiated on the said

basis. The second ground was that though the incident was of the year 2012

the decision to hold a Departmental Enquiry against the Petitioner therein

culminated in the charge sheet dated 2112017

issued to the Petitioner and

therefore there being a time lag of 5 years between the date of the incident

and the date of the order, the Division Bench was of the view that a

Departmental Enquiry could not be initiated against the Petitioner. The

Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court has also referred to the circular

issued by that Court on 2542017

which can be said to be paramateria to the

first circular issued by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India. The Division Bench

thereafter referred to the Judgment of the Apex Court in R. C. Sood's case

(Supra), in which case the Apex Court had set aside the Disciplinary

proceedings which were initiated against the Petitioner R. C. Sood as the

complaint was not supported by an affidavit. The Division Bench therefore

opined that in the absence of any written complaint, initiating the

departmental proceedings pursuant to the oral representation, will run counter

to the ratio laid down in the judgment of the Apex Court in R. C. Sood

and Ishwarchand Jain Vs. State of Punjab.

17 Now coming to the judgment of the Apex Court in R. C. Sood, the

said judgment was rendered by the Apex Court when neither of the circulars

i.e. circular dated 3102014

and 1632017

were in the field. The said

judgment was also rendered in the peculiar facts of the said case. In the said

case the Petitioner R. C. Sood whilst acting as a Registrar of the Rajashtan High

Court was proceeded departmentally on account of the wrong mentioning of

the cut of date for determining the age in the advertisement issued for filling

up the vacancies in the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service by way of direct

recruitment. A committee of two Judges was appointed to go into the matter

as regards the mentioning of the cut of date in the advertisement issued calling

for applications. The committee of two Judges suggested that fresh

applications be called for and the matter should be placed before the Hon'ble

Chief Justice for taking suitable action against the officer who was responsible

for issuing the incorrect notification. The matter was placed before the Full

Court of the High Court. The Full Court constituted a committee of two other

Judges to look into the record leading to the issuance of the notification. The

said committee observed that it was their tentative view that the Petitioner was

responsible for the ""forgery committed in the record"" and it recommended a

regular enquiry to be made in accordance with rules. The report of the two

Judges committee was placed before the Full Court and the Full Court resolved

that the Departmental Enquiry be initiated against the Petitioner and he should

be placed under suspension. The Petitioner challenged the said action by way

of a Writ Petition in the Apex Court. By judgment dated 22111994

the Apex

Court quashed the proposed disciplinary proceedings as well as the order

placing the Petitioner under suspension. The Apex Court observed that it was

difficult to appreciate how the two Judges committee could come to the

conclusion that there was a forgery in the record and/or any person had

benefited from the said error or that the Petitioner was responsible for the

same.

18 The Hon'ble Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court had issued

a office note dated 1251994

providing that if a complainant does not file the

requisite affidavit, no action should be taken on that complaint. Though

initially the first disciplinary proceeding was quashed by the Apex Court, the

problem of the Petitioner R. C. Sood did not end there. As observed by the

Apex Court by letter dated 27101994

one of the Judges of the Rajasthan High

Court forwarded a PIL Petition received by him to the Hon'ble Chief Justice by

his letter addressed to the Hon'ble Chief Justice mentioning therein that as

allegations are serious they deserved to be investigated thoroughly. The said

letter was the same letter which had been dealt with by the earlier Hon'ble

Chief Justice vide letter dated 3111994

and the issue was closed. However,

the matter was placed before the Full Court and the Full Court resolved that

the order passed by the Hon'ble Chief Justice on the report of the preliminary

enquiry against R. C. Sood conducted by the Additional Registrar be hereby

revoked. The Full Court thereafter resolved to constitute a committee of three

Hon'ble Judges of the Rajasthan High Court to enquire into the various

complaints forwarded to them by the Hon'ble Judge against the Petitioner R.C.

Sood. The Apex Court in the facts of the said case observed that there was no

valid reason in law for the Full Court to revoke the decision of the then Chief

Justice which was taken on 3111994.

The Apex Court also adversely

commented upon the manner in which the enquiry was sought to be conducted

by the three Judges of the Rajashtan High Court. The Apex Court observed

that the witnesses were also of the choice of one of the members of the

committee and were persons who were inimical to the Petitioner R.C.Sood.

The Apex Court observed that the complainant Vijay Singh was a imposter and

who was that person who was examined by the committee, remained

unexplained. The Apex Court therefore in the facts of the said case held that

the complaint could not have been entertained without there being an

affidavit. Paragraphs 23 and 25 of the said judgment are eloquent and reflect

the reasons why the Apex Court interfered in the said matter. The same is

therefore reproduced hereinunder for the sake for convenience:

23. Apart from the nonjudicious

manner in

which the Three Judge Committee conducted the

enquiry the sequence of events, which bears

repetition, shows that being piqued with this

Court's judgment quashing the first departmental

enquiry the High Court, with a few functionaries

playing an active role, left no stone unturned

with a view to victimise the petitioner. On 21st

October, 1994 the High Court suspended the

petitioner and decided to hold the first

departmental enquiry. On 24th October, 1994 this

suspension was challenged by way of a writ

petition in this Court in which this Court on 7th

November, 1994 issued show cause notice to the

High Court. Suddenly we find on the High Court

record Justice Kokje's letter dated 27th October,

1994 forwarding to the then Chief Justice the old

complaint of Vijay Singh. The Chief Justice makes

an endorsement on this letter on the same date thereby

showing the sense of urgency. First office

note is written only on 9th November, 1994, after

issuance of notice by this Court in the writ

petition filed by the petitioner. The fact that it is

only on 30th November, 1994, after the decision

of this Court on 22nd November, 1994, that the

Full Court fixed up the matter lends credence to

the petitioner's submission that the dates which

appear on record may not be real. This is more so

when we find that none of the documents in the

form of complaints allegedly received by the

Judges bear any endorsement as to the date of

receipt of the same. To crown it all the second

round started on a complaint of Vijay Singh

stated to have been received by Justice Kokje on

or before 27th October, 1994. This complaint had

been circulated in September, 1993 amongst all

the then Judges of the High Court and in respect

of which order was passed by the then Chief

Justice and the matter was closed on 31st

January, 1994. Respondents' counsel could give

no explanation as to how Justice Kokje got this

complaint against the petitioner some time before

27th October 1994 when he was transferred to

the Rajasthan High Court only on 28th April,

1994. At that time the petitioner had ceased to be

the Registrar of the High Court with effect from

1st February, 1994. It is obvious that a copy of

this complaint was handed over to Justice Kokje

by some one who was interested in harming the

petitioner and thereupon the second round of

action against the petitioner commenced with

Justice Kokje being made one of the members of

the Three Judge Committee.

25. Normally enquiry committees are set up in

order to ascertain correct facts. Here, however,

we have a situation where a committee consisting

of a local judge and two transferred judges was

set up with the local judge sitting alone and

collecting a menagerie of witnesses who had a

grudge against the petitioner and were thus sure

to depose against him. Some of these witnesses

were those who had not sent any complaint

against the petitioner prior to 30th November,

1994 and it is only the local judge who, wanting

to gather statements against the petitioner, could

have known whom to approach and call for

evidence. Of the two transferred judges who were

members of the committee, one never took part

in any proceeding when evidence was recorded

between 20th February (Sic 20111994)

and 2nd

January, 1995. Yet he signs the report dated 4th

January, 1995. The other transferee judge is the

person who set the ball rolling with his conjuring

up Vijay Singh's complaint which had originally

been circulated long before the judge's transfer to

Rajasthan. The respondent's counsel was unable

to explain as to how this complaint was

conveniently placed in this judge's hand. It is

evident that there was a deliberate design to

bring to a premature end the judicial career of

the petitioner, whose name, at that time, was

being actively considered for elevation as High

Court Judge. This is apparent from the fact that

in the resolutions dated 30th November, 1994

and 5th January, 1995 it was resolved by the Full

Court that the President of India and the Chief

Justice of India should be informed about the

holding of the departmental enquiry against the

petitioner. Acting on the basis of the Committee's

biased report the Full Court, we are sad to note,

continued in similar vein and proceeded to nail

the petitioner by taking a decision which lacked

objectivity. Apparently stung by the judgment

dated 22nd November, 1994 of this Court it

retaliated by launching a fresh set of charges

against the petitioner clearly with a view to ruin

his judicial career. We have no doubt that the

action taken by the court was not bona fide and

amounts to victimisation. This is certainly not

expected from a judicial forum, least of all the

High Court, which is expected to discharge its

administrative duties as fairly and objectively as

it is required to discharge its judicial functions.

19 In our view, the judgments of the Gujarat High Court in

Girishkumar Soni's case and the Apex Court in R. C. Sood's case having been

rendered in the peculiar facts and circumstances as were prevailing in the said

cases would not aid the Petitioner in so far as the instant case is concerned. In

the instant case the factual basis has changed in as much as the original

circular issued by the Chief Justice of India has been amended by the

subsequent circular providing for a written complaint accompanied by an

affidavit and/or verifiable material. In our view, in respect of both the

Departmental Enquiries there being verifiable material on record, the same

would be covered by the amended circular dated 1632017.

20 The question that also arises is whether in the facts of the present

case we should exercise our writ jurisdiction. As indicated above the Petitioner

has invoked the Writ Jurisdiction of this court against the order dated 1572016

informing him that a Departmental Enquiry is to be commenced against

him. The Petitioner can obviously participate in the enquiry and refute or

dispel the charges which are leveled against him. In our view, the

commencement of the said two disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner

cannot be said to be without jurisdiction as is sought to be contended by the

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner as being in violation of the circulars issued

by the Hon'ble The Chief Justice of India. In our view the reliance placed by

the Learned Counsel for the Respondent No.2 on the judgments (Supra) of the

Apex Court, seems to be apposite. The Apex Court has in terms observed that

exercise of writ jurisdiction at the initial stage of commencement of the

disciplinary proceedings would only be in exceptional cases more especially in

cases where the disciplinary proceedings are commenced without jurisdiction.

Such is not the case in the instant matter. We therefore do not deem it

appropriate to exercise our Writ Jurisdiction.

21 We however, leave the contentions of the Petitioner in respect of

the charges levelled against him in the Departmental Enquiries open. Subject

to the aforesaid, the above Writ Petitions are dismissed. Rule to stand

discharged in both the Petitions with no order as to costs.

Eight of these colleges do not even have land allocated for building. Most of these 55 colleges function out of few rooms in government schools.

Of the 81 government colleges opened in five years, 73 were new colleges, while eight were bifurcated. The bifurcation process includes opening separate colleges for science, commerce and art streams out of existing colleges.

Admissions to these colleges have taken place and classes are going on but the buildings of 47 colleges are under construction.

Several of colleges opened in the past five years run out of classrooms borrowed from nearby government schools, including the government colleges in Sri Dungargarh and Kolayat, Bikaner district. ""Two rooms have been allocated to us in the nearby school. Since the space is less, the classes are conducted in different batches,"" said Mahendra Rajput, a first year student of Government College, Sri Dungargarh.

""We haven't had any practical classes till now but the exams are starting on January 15. We don't even know where the exams would be held. They may make some temporary arrangement on the playground,"" he added.

Nearly 200 students have been admitted to Government College Sri Dungargarh that has six teachers, said GP Singh who was appointed the officer on duty when the college was opened.

Dr Digvijay Shekhawat, assistant director, college education (Bikaner Zone), said: ""Fifteen bighas of land was allotted for the college in Sri Dungargarhbut the funds for construction of the building have not been received. We received Rs 1.5 lakh for furniture and we will procure furniture worth Rs 10 lakh soon. Several faculties have joined the college recently. The classes are running smoothly,"" said Shekhawat.

Space for several bifurcated colleges is also uncertain. While three new colleges were opened in Kota division, two of the existing colleges were bifurcated. New government colleges were opened in Antah, Itawa and Kanwas which are still running out of nearby government schools.

""The arts college bifurcated out of JDB Girls' College, Kota, is yet to get clearance from the public works department (PWD) as several trees have to be cut down and demolitions have to be carried out for the same.

Land for the commerce college which is bifurcated out of the same college was allocated near the highway, where several 100-year-old trees have to be cut for the same. Moreover, a building that dates back to the British era exists on the land. Hence, construction of a college building there may be difficult,"" said Dr. Dinesh Tiwari, assistant director, college education, (Kota Zone).

Reacting to the present condition of the colleges opened under the BJP regime, party spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said: ""The BJP government opened new colleges heeding public demand. At some places the colleges are running out of different buildings but in most of the places, the colleges have enough space. For example, Poddar school in Jaipur had huge space and a college was opened in the same campus. The BJP government did better work in the education sector in five years than the previous Congress regime.""

Satyendra Singh Raghav, spokesperson of the Congress, said: ""The BJP government kept making new announcements and schemes but did not work on the ground. They did not check the condition of the schools and colleges or the schemes on ground."""

During his monthly Jan Samvad programme at Suchana Bhawan in Meurs' Road, Das took cognizance of a woman's complaint against Dumri CO Jagdish Kumar Pandey. Sunita Devi, the complainant, had accused Pandey of asking extra money for issuing correction slips.

Das asked state land reforms, registration and revenue secretary Kamal Kishore Soan to suspend the officer and order a probe to evaluate his ill-gotten assets. ""These are the officers who tarnish the image of the government. There assets must be seized and used to open schools and hospitals,"" Das said before ordering the department to transfer the CO and block development officers (BDO) every three years.

Ashish Kumar, a resident of Sahibganj, alleged that one Shibu Soren ST Intermediate cum Degree College was presenting forged documents to seek grants from the state department of higher, technical education and skill development department. To it, Das asked the department to investigate similar complaints from across Jharkhand and cancel their affiliations if found not compliant to the state government's directives. ""Institutions like these are out to spoil the future of the youth. These businesses must be stopped at once,"" Das said.

The CM spoke to farmers and residents of Thethaitangar block at Simdega district and encountered claims that 95 farmers had not received compensations for their crops, which were damaged due to excessive rain July 2015. The claims stood in contrast to the Das government's recent hectic parleys to the Union government to declare 129 blocks drought hit due to insufficient rains this year and seek grant of Rs 819 crore for carrying relief measures. Hearing this, Das ordered the deputy commissioner to camp in the area on December 30 and ensure their compensations are disbursed.

In what was the last Jan Samvad of 2019, Das praised police department for reigning left wing extremism and directed authorities to distribute blankets in the state run Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas so that its boarders can stay warm. The CM's instructions came at a time when cold related deaths are being reported from several districts but no relief measures being announced by the state disaster management department."

Your foreign travel insurance claim can be rejected","MoneyControl",FALSE,"Buying travel insurance is easy these days and a policy can be bought online in a matter of seconds, however, it is important for the policyholder to make the necessary disclosures on time

Foreign holidays can be fun, but a sudden sickness abroad can put a dampener. Worse, what if despite having travel insurance, your claims get rejected abroad and you have to shell out precious US dollars?

Delhi-based Shikhar Jha, 53, visited the United States in April 2018 for two months to meet his daughter and son-in-law who recently had a baby. Jha had purchased a travel insurance policy online, but in a hurry, he did not disclose one crucial detail. He had a bypass surgery in the year 2016. The surgery was successful, Jha had recovered and had moved on. And perhaps, forgotten when the time came to pack his bags to fly overseas.

But the ailment came to haunt him. When he reached the US, he got pneumonia. He went to the hospital in New Jersey, and the doctor found something was wrong with his lungs.

When Jha submitted the report to his insurance company back in India, to claim the hospitalisation expenses, the firm rejected his claim. It said that Jha had not disclosed his bypass surgery and his heart condition while buying the policy.

This, despite the fact that the reason for his ailment in the US (pneumonia) had got nothing to do with his heart. "" The company further told me that you are obliged to disclose each and every disease that has happened to you and even if that is cured earlier. It was a hard lesson for me,"" says Jha.

The merits of buying travel insurance are known. But just buying travel insurance doesn't automatically mean that all your hospitalisation expenses, if any, while travelling abroad get covered.

Disclose your pre-existing diseases

Although buying travel insurance is easy these days and a policy can be bought online in a matter of seconds, it is important for the policyholder to make the necessary disclosures. Your past health is one such key disclosure.

What we forget is that travel insurance, just like your health insurance in India, can get rejected for a variety of reason. In such times, you are too late to make the right claims, like Jha realized it the hard way.

Foreign travel is very common these days, be it family outing, a solo adventure, honeymoon with your better half or for foreign education. Most travellers buy travel insurance because they think it is necessary and the cost of medical treatment abroad is restrictive. Usually, travel insurance covers financial losses like lost or stolen luggage, cancellation of holiday bookings as well as unexpected medical costs overseas.

Kapil Mehta, co-founder, Securenow.in, a Delhi-based insurance broker told Moneycontrol that it is worthwhile to know how the pre-existing disease coverage will work before you buy one. Whenever you take treatment outside the country, the doctor checks the health history of the patient.

The doctor records everything and gets to know about every pre-existing diseases related to them. ""Even if you are making an insurance claim, during overseas travel, against some other ailment which is not related to an ailment or disease for which you had sought treatment in India in the past but did not disclose it while buying your travel insurance, your claims will get rejected,"" says Mehta.

For the purpose of buying travel insurance, any disease or ailment that you've been treated for, in the past 48 months before you buy a foreign travel policy, is considered to be a pre-existing disease at the time of claim.

What gets covered...

If an individual is injured or falls sick while travelling, the cover will include hospitalisation expenses, expenses for prescription drugs and outpatient treatment including doctor and surgery if any.

Tarun Mathur, Chief Business Officer- General Insurance, Policybazaar.com told Moneycontrol that travel Insurance covers almost all medical conditions provided that they have been disclosed by the insured at the time of purchase of travel policy. ""The most common, pre-existing conditions like diabetes, blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases are also covered under travel insurance, provided you adequately disclose them at the time of buying the foreign travel policy,"" he said.

...and what doesn't

There is generally a list of permanent exclusions -- Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), cancer, self-inflicted injury, any sexually transmitted diseases -- treatment for these diseases are not covered under most travel insurance plans.

If you get hospitalized in a foreign land for some other ailment, but it gets traced to the exclusionary conditions, even then the claim will get rejected. The doctors dig to find out the root cause of your ailment. Typically, any ailment including accidental death and permanent disability arising out of an accident, if not linked to a pre-existing disease or condition, is covered under your travel policy.

Check the pre-existing diseases coverage before you buy your cover to avoid disappointments later. Also, some insurers have specific exclusions while others don't cover pre-existing diseases altogether. Do check with the adviser before you get one.

Things to know when persons have some pre-existing diseases

Disclose all past injuries or illnesses or medical condition while buying a policy to avoid any ambiguity during the claims process.

Opt for a cover with an insurance company with a transparent claims management processes and one who provides the list of global network hospitals on their website, thereby helping individuals avail cashless claims facility.

All foreign travel policies are cashless. Once you get admitted into a hospital, the doctor diagnoses and gives you a report. You need to send this report- through an email preferably- to your local insurance company here in India, who would then pay the money directly to your hospital abroad.

It's best to stick to insurance companies that have a single touch point for all your foreign travel insurance needs, such as a single international toll-free number across the globe.

Only sudden hospitalisation needs (say, you get dengue while travelling abroad) are covered and till the patient is stabilised. Pre-existing diseases not disclosed will be overlooked only in cases where you face a life-threatening situation abroad and get hospitalised.Any planned hospitalization due to pre-existing diseases will not be covered in your normal foreign travel policy."

According to police, the accused used to distribute marksheets and certificates through the fake education board and the three have cheated more than 10,000 students belonging to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and other states.

The fake board syndicate used to allure students who could not pass the Matriculation and Intermediate Examination on promise that they will provide the certificate and marksheet at nominal charges, police said.

On September 9, police received information that Raja along with his accomplices was operating the board by the name of Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi in Vikas Puri.

They represent that their board was recognised and provided marksheets and certificates of class 10 and 12 within two-three months for Rs 5,000 to 10,000, Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) Rajiv Ranjan said.

A complaint in this regard was also received from the Delhi Directorate of Education, he said.

A trap was laid and Altaf Raja was apprehended while delivering the fake certificates and marksheets, he added.

University officials said the decision was taken due to security reasons as Allama Iqbal Library in the campus is yet to install CCTVs and sensor gates. However, the issue snowballed into a major controversy prompting the University to withdraw the decision and allow pheran-clad people inside the library after a thorough check.

""How silly can it get? Have we solved all other problems that we create new ones? Kindly take note J&K governor,"" tweeted Naeem Akhtar, former J&K Education minister and senior Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader, tagging the J&K governor.

Chief Librarian of University of Kashmir, GM Peerzada, said Alama Iqbal Library is a repository of so many rare books and handwritten manuscripts as old as 300 years.

""There are no CCTVs and sensor gates. Due to security reasons, we told children that this library belongs to you and if you can come without pheran, it would be better. For example, I was walking near the library at around 8.30 pm and I saw some people. They were not students. When I asked them where they are going, they said they want to go to the toilet. I told them the library is not to go to toilet but for reading. I asked them to show their ID card but they ran away,"" said Peerzada.

The ban evoked a sharp response with people questioning authorities over the decision. ""Since so many people have asked me about this, I have given the relaxation and allowed people with pheran. People can come wearing pheran but they should take their hands out so that we can check them properly,"" he said.

The decision of the University comes days after a major row erupted in Kashmir after Zonal Education Officer of Langate banned the cultural dress in its offices.

The ban evoked sharp reactions with people creating hashtags on Twitter to support the pheran and calling for the department to revoke the ban. Drawing flak, the education department later withdrew the order in a bid to calm tempers.

Pheran is a traditional dress of Kashmir and both, men and women take pride in donning it. Older Kashmiri women wear pheran in all seasons while men prefer to wear it during winters to keep warm.

People also use kangri (a traditional fire pot) under the pheran to keep themselves warm during winters. In 2014, the Army had to withdraw its advisory urging journalists not to wear pheran while visiting its Corps Headquarters."

A locally-made rocket launcher, material for suicide vests and 112 alarm clocks to be used as timers were recovered from the searches, said National Investigation Agency (NIA) Inspector General Alok Mittal.

""They were planning to make not one but a large number of bombs which is evident from 112 alarm clocks recovered by us,"" he said.

The searches were carried out in coordination with Special Cell of Delhi Police and Anti-Terrorism Squad of Uttar Pradesh Police at six places in Jaffrabad, Seelampur in Delhi and 11 places in Uttar Pradesh - six in Amroha, two in Lucknow, two in Hapur and two in Meerut, he said.

The searches and the arrests, including of a 'mufti' from Amroha, come a month before Republic Day celebrations on January 26 when security is heightened across India, particularly in the national capital.

""The members were in an advanced stage of preparation. They were just waiting for the successful assembly of bombs and wanted to hit multiple locations using remote controlled IEDs and pipe bombs and carry out Fidayeen attacks using suicide vests when needed,"" Mittal said.

The probe agency rounded up 16 persons of the group 'Harkat ul Harb e Islam', which loosely translates into war for the cause of Islam, he said.

Of the 16 detained, 10 were arrested - Amroha and five from five from Seelampur and Jaffrabad localities in north-east Delhi - by the NIA, while six are being interrogated. More arrests are likely, Mittal said.

The ""highly-radicalised module"" of youths in the age group of 20-35 years is completely self-funded and no criminal antecedent of its members had surfaced so far, he said.

Those arrested include the alleged mastermind, 29-year-old Mohammed Suhail, a 'mufti', or a Muslim legal expert empowered to give rulings on religious matters, from Amroha in western Uttar Pradesh, an engineering student in a private university in Noida and a third year graduation student in humanities in a university in Delhi as well as two welders, he said.

""It was ascertained that Mufti Mohammed Suhail alias Hazrath and his associates have mobilised funds and have procured weapons, ammunition and explosive material to prepare IED's and bombs and they plan to carry out explosions and fidayeen attacks at places of importance in and around Delhi and also target crowded places,"" he said.

He added that the agency found a video where Suhail is demonstrating the method to complete a bomb circuit.

The agency recovered 25 kg of explosive material -- Potassium Nitrate, Ammonium Nitrate, Sulphur etc, he said.

In addition, 12 country-made pistols, 150 rounds of live ammunition, a country-made rocket launcher, 112 alarm clocks, phone circuits, batteries and 51 pipes to be used as bombs were also recovered.

The group had also purchased remote control cars and wireless doorbells to use their circuits in assembling remote controlled improvised explosive devices.

The NIA also recovered steel containers, electric wires, 91 mobile phones, 134 SIM cards, 3 laptops, knife, sword, ISIS-related literature during the searches, he said.

Two brothers -- Raees and Saeed -- had assembled the rocket launcher and some other weapons in their welding shop, he alleged.

Mittal said the suspects had done a reconnaissance of vital Government installations and planned to target political personalities and other important persons.

All arrested youth are moderately educated barring two -- an engineering student and a BA third year student -- and are from middle income families.

The agency is also investigating if Suhail or any other member had taken oath of allegiance with the West Asia-based ISIS and whether anyone had visited the area occupied by the terror outfit.

The officials said there was no trail of foreign funding but about Rs 7.5 lakh in cash have been recovered during the searches.

Among the arrested are two brothers -- Zaid (20) and Zubair (22) -- who were instrumental in arranging batteries, connectors, SIM cards on fake documents and funds for buying bomb-making material, the NIA has alleged.

The two had even stolen gold from their family which was in the range of about Rs 5-7 lakh and sold it in the market to arrange for funds, they said.

According to investigations, the module was founded about 3-4 months ago by Suhail who brought all its members together and indoctrinated them.

The group remained in touch through data-based messaging applications WhatsApp and Telegram to avoid scrutiny of agencies.

Seeing their alarming pace of progress, the central agencies, which had kept the group on surveillance, decided to bust it today.

The NIA had registered a case on December 20 against Suhail and other members.

The agency believes the module has foreign-based handler(s) but their identity and location is still being probed.

The officials refused to comment on media reports citing inputs from other agencies involved in the operation that RSS headquarters and Delhi Police headquarters were also on the hit list.

The group comprises youths in the 20-35 age group with moderate education (barring two), hailing from middle income group families and radicalised by an Amroha-based Mufti, who is also the alleged mastermind and founder of 'Harkat-ul-Harb-e-Islam', which can be loosely translated as 'war for the cause of Islam', the NIA has alleged.

Following are their brief profiles and roles as alleged by the NIA:

* Mufti Mohammed Suhail alias Hazrath (29) the alleged founder of the group is a native of Amroha in West Uttar Pradesh where he works as a Mufti in a madrasa at Hakim Mahtab Uddin Hashmi Road. Presently residing in Jaffrabad in North East Delhi, he allegedly founded the group three-four months back and indoctrinated its members using on-line resources linked to the ISIS. A video has been seized by the agency where Suhail can be heard telling how to assemble bomb using a circuit.

It is alleged that he had tasked other team members to procure arms, explosives and other accessories to prepare remote-controlled bombs and pipe-bombs.

* Anas Yunus (24) is a resident of Jaffrabad. He is a student of Civil Engineering at a private university in Noida. He procured electrical items, alarm clocks and batteries etc to be used in assembling bombs in furtherance of their terror conspiracy.

* Saeed alias Sayeed (28) a resident of Saidapur Imma, Amroha, runs welding shop in Amroha where some pistols and rocket launcher were fabricated.

* Saeed's brother Raees Ahmad a resident of Saidapur Imma, Amroha, UP. He owns a welding shop at Islam Nagar, Near Idgah, Amroha, Uttar Pradesh. The brothers had allegedly procured 25 kilogram of explosive material and gun powder for preparing IEDs and pipe bombs and were instrumental in fabricating a rocket launcher to carry out terrorist attacks.

* Zubair Malik (20) is a resident of Jaffrabad. He is a student of BA 3rd year at a University in Delhi.

* Zubair's brother Zaid (22) is a resident of Jaffrabad. Both the brothers were part of the terror conspiracy and were instrumental in procuring batteries, connectors, SIM cards (135 recovered during searches) on fake documents and mobilising funds for buying bomb-making material. Both allegedly stole family gold to arrange for money.

* Saqib Iftekar (26) is a resident of Hapur, Uttar Pradesh. He works as an Imam in Jama Masjid, Baksar, Uttar Pradesh and helped Mohammed Suhail in procuring weapons. The agency has recovered 12 pistols, 150 rounds of live ammunition, knives and swords during searches.

In the bureaucratic reshuffle that was carried out by the Ashok Gehlot government last week, were those in charge of education touched? Rajasthan has, over the last four years, become a symbol of ""New India'', both in its changes in school curriculum and in the number of lynching incidents it has seen (seven since 2015).

In May 2016, when Jawaharlal Nehru's name was dropped from Class VIII textbooks in the state, both as our first prime minister and as a prominent leader of our freedom struggle, Gehlot and Sachin Pilot were quick to lash out at Vasundhara Raje's government.

But criticising is easy. Actually undoing what you decry while in the Opposition, requires political will and hard work. Add to that the Congress' apathy towards ideological issues such as the content of school education. So, in 2004, then HRD minister, Arjun Singh, took his own sweet time to change the NCERT texts introduced by his predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi, an RSS member.

These texts taught impressionable teenagers that Muslims sided with the British and barely contributed to the freedom struggle. However, in one CBSE school in Mumbai, the history teacher actually contradicted the text to tell her students that all communities contributed to the freedom struggle. But there may not be too many such teachers in Rajasthan. A recent report in the New York Review of Books quotes a Bohra Muslim teacher in Udaipur dismissing the Mughal-era in class, going along with the new history textbook.

Advertising

Hopefully, it will not take Gehlot and Pilot that long to withdraw these texts. The inconvenience caused by changing textbooks in the middle of the academic year would be far less damaging to students than the lies they are being forced to study. Even one more term to let school children learn that Maharana Pratap defeated Akbar at Haldighati; pre-Independence Congress leaders had no connect with the people; and how Nehru was just a footnote in our history, is one term too long.

In 2004, it was at the end of the academic year that the Sonia Gandhi-led UPA defeated the Vajpayee-led NDA, presenting the ideal opportunity to change school texts. Yet, Arjun Singh used the excuse that sufficient stocks of current texts were already there, to not effect an immediate change.

The same lethargy towards righting what is obviously wrong with Rajasthan's police, was on display in l'affaire Naseeruddin Shah. The organisers of the Ajmer Lit Fest said they had alerted the police. Yet, goons could enter the venue and throw ink on the actor's picture. Instead of caving in after that and telling Shah not to come, why couldn't the organisers have delayed the proceedings till the cops removed these vandals from the venue and provided security for the rest of the day? In this Twitter age, surely the CM and deputy CM could have been alerted immediately?

We don't know the entire story. What we do know is that the Hindutva goons had their way, with the knowledge of the police. The change in regime didn't seem to matter to either them or the police. Mumbaikars are familiar with this behaviour: Whoever rules Maharashtra, no policeman touches the Thackerays. The next day, five BJP workers were arrested in Ajmer, but under preventive detention, a law normally used before someone commits a crime.

This year, Rajasthan was ranked number three by Amnesty International in their state-wise hate crime list. The lynching of dairy farmer Pehlu Khan and the hacking of Bengali labourer Muhammad Afrazul -- incidents which shook us all -- took place in Rajasthan. The police exonerated all six named by Pehlu Khan in his dying declaration, and booked his two companions for cow smuggling. Did any of this matter when the new government transferred 17 IPS officers last week, including its senior most police officer?

Two days after being appointed Deputy CM, Pilot told a news portal that the ""atmosphere of mob lynching and cow vigilantism has to be curbed immediately...

The accused have been identified as Altaf Raja (23), Shambhu Nath Mishra (46) and Manoj Kumar (32), they said.

According to police, the accused used to distribute marksheets and certificates through the fake education board and the three have cheated more than 10,000 students belonging to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and other states.

The fake board syndicate used to allure students who could not pass the Matriculation and Intermediate Examination on promise that they will provide the certificate and marksheet at nominal charges, police said.

On September 9, police received information that Raja along with his accomplices was operating the board by the name of Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi in Vikas Puri.

They represent that their board was recognised and provided marksheets and certificates of class 10 and 12 within two-three months for Rs 5,000 to 10,000, Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) Rajiv Ranjan said.

A complaint in this regard was also received from the Delhi Directorate of Education, he said.

A trap was laid and Altaf Raja was apprehended while delivering the fake certificates and marksheets, he added.

During investigation, other accused -- Shambhu Nath Mishra and Manoj Kumar -- were also arrested, he said.

Police said the gang prepared more than 23 websites of the fake board.

In September 2017, accused Raja was arrested along with Pandey for preparing fake board certificates. After coming out of jail, they again started running the syndicate on a higher level. However, Pandey is presently in jail in connection with the case, the officer said.

During further investigation, one Rampal of Rampur was also traced who stated that he had procured marksheets and certificates of class 10 and 12 on his name from these agents of the fake board syndicate in Rampur.

He, along with three other persons, was arrested during the verification of documents issued by the board in the recruitment of U P Police in 2018, the officer added.

Many fake marksheets, certificates, provisional certificates, migration certificates, answer sheets, nominal rolls, question papers of the board, registers of record of students, blank marksheets and certificates of class 10 and 12 have been recovered, police said."

As the date for implementation of the tariff order issued by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) draws closer,

broadcasters have launched campaigns to educate consumers of the change in regime and the various bouquets on offer.

Under the Trai tariff order, all broadcasters have to declare the maximum retail price for their channels, and all channels have to be made available on an a-la-carte basis.

Viacom18, has based its campaign around the 'lucrative pricing' for its basic Hindi channel pack. The network has introduced the Hindi value pack at Rs 25 a month, and used the value proposition of the pack as its marketing peg.

Viacom18 and TV18 have launched a multi-media marketing campaign, titled 'Ek Me Hai More Yahaan', that advocates the comprehensive value for money that the 'COLORS wala pack' provides to viewers. The campaign highlights the concerns of TV viewers over the rising cost of entertainment and packages top channels across genres are offering so that the entire entertainment and news needs of a family are taken care of.

Sudhanshu Vats, group CEO and managing director, Viacom18 says, ""While deciding the communications strategy, we felt that the most compelling argument in favour of bouquet offerings is that you get the most popular channels from the network at less than Rs 1 a day. We have also put the po­pular consumer facing brand at the forefront of the communication rather than the corporate brand in order to reach out to consumers more effectively.""

He adds that while the marketing costs for the quarter will rise on account of the campaigns, broadcasters are looking at the exercise as a long-term gain.

Star India, on the other hand, has used the pull of known faces and celebrities to extol the value of its bouquets. Star India released a national campaign across eight languages based on the thought #SachMein that brings alive the value offered by the Star Value PACK. The campaign, created in-house at Star India, uses the approach of 'reverse bargaining' for communication. The Hindi commercial features superstar Aamir Khan, who plays a customer known to drive a hard bargain, and is convinced of the value offered by the pack by the end of the ad.

The same creativity has been executed across markets with a local flavour featuring local stars like Mohanlal for the Malayalam campaign, Kamal Hassan for Tamil, Nagarjuna for Telugu, Darshan for Kannada, Dev for Bengali and Swapnil Joshi for Marathi.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises (Zee), on the other hand, has chosen to use a more topical analogy for its campaign. Prathyusha Agarwal, chief marketing officer, Zee, explains, ""To simplify the complex structural change coming their way, we have chosen the topical analogy of elections through ""Channels Ka Chunaav 2019"" -- a multimedia multi-stakeholder communication initiative -- urging viewers to fulfill demands of all family members through Family Ki Suno, Zee Ko Chuno!""

""There are three crucial aspects to educating all stakeholders about this change. It starts with bringing about awareness of the uniform pricing regime and the paradigm shift it brings, then educating consumers about specific packs and offerings and lastly, facilitating behaviour change at the last mile,"" she adds.

ALSO READ: NITI flags 'inadequate' cybersecurity, constraints in broadband access

Zee is also undertaking familiarisation workshops with service providers -- multi system operators and local cable operators -- in an effort to facilitate behaviour change at the last mile.

Sony Pictures Network India (SPN), has opted for a phased approach towards the consumer. It is using the high impact properties in its portfolio to communicate with the viewers about the impending change in tariff structure. For example, it is using the ongoing India tour of Australia, which airs on the network's sports bouquet, informing viewers that they can now opt for only the channels they want.

Rajesh Kaul, chief revenue officer, distribution and head, sports, explains, ""Sony Pictures Networks India has worked on a comprehensive consumer education campaign, which we will roll out in phases since we do not want to overwhelm the consumer at one-go. One of the primary influencers in this campaign will be Amitabh Bachchan.""

There is a protest planned at Jantar Mantar in Delhi.

Trai ensures no disruption

On Wednesday, Trai issued a circular saying it was preparing a detailed migration plan for all its existing subscribers. ""The plan will provide ample opportunity to each and every subscriber for making an informed choice. This will also enable service providers to carry out various activities as stipulated in the new regulatory framework in a time-bound manner,"" the circular said. Some markets may see a blackout from 7 pm to 10 pm on Thursday, to protest against implementation of the order.

""Growth is coming back to the Indian IT services industry,"" he told PTI, talking about industry highlights in 2018 and prospects in the coming calendar year.

Pai said 2018 saw ""H1B visa situation getting tougher,"" Indian companies focusing more on Japan and southeast Asia, massive expansion of captives and buy-backs by big companies.

Hyderabad has become a hot destination, with many new age companies coming to the Telangana capital, thanks to good infrastructure, and ""very good marketing"" by KTR (K T Rama Rao, who served as IT Minister in the previous TRS government), according to him.

He also said Indian companies were now trying to expand in markets in Asia much more vigorously, particularly Japan which is ""opening up"" and southeast Asia.

Reskilling of employees in IT services companies has redoubled, Pai said. ""More than half the people have been re-skilled in all the IT companies in India. Digital income is growing in double digits for all the companies. 2018 has been a good year"".

Hiring has gone up, he said. ""First time in seven years, hiring compensation (entry-level) has gone up by 20 per cent. Fresher compensation is going up, after a long time. It's a good news"".

He listed greater use artificial intelligence and machine learning in enterprises, greater thrust on digitisation, bigger spending by BFSI (banking, financial services, insurance) in America, as being growth opportunities for Indian IT companies in 2019, which will also see them look for greater penetration into Europe and Asia.

But the challenges for them are going to be localisation in America. ""You must become more local in America, most of them (Indian companies) are trying to do. And they are finding that when you are local, cost actually is not increasing because you are going to smaller towns where costs are much less"".

The year 2019 is going to be better for entry-level guys because hiring is going to be much better, said Pai, also Chairman of Manipal Global Education Services, and Aarin Capital, and a member of the Board of Directors of the National Stock Exchange of India Limited.

Under this PM, the CBI is a weapon of political vendetta. An institution in terminal decline that's at war with itself (sic).""

Back in 2013, the Supreme Court had made a shocking observation that the CBI ""was a caged parrot speaking in its master's voice.""

The mainstream media, too, has played an important role in creating a negative image of Lalu Prasad.

For example, the media has routinely portrayed the Deoghar District Treasury case as the 'fodder scam' or chara ghotala. An insensitive term that relates to Lalu's caste Gwala implies that he ate all the fodder.

However, Lalu Prasad is not the media's only victim. It is almost the same case with all leaders belonging to oppressed castes who are raising their voices against the status-quo of the eternal caste hegemony prevalent in the Indian society.

A leader like Lalu Prasad, who has fiercely guarded the ethos of Indian democracy and worked uncompromisingly to keep the social-bond of the masses intact, certainly deserves better treatment. Today, a wave of fear is blowing in our country as people are helpless in their struggle for justice. This was seen in the case of farmers' protest, Dalit protests, farmers' march in Mumbai, protests against lynching of Muslims, etc.

We hope that Lalu recovers from ailments and resumes his crusade. Over time, people will surely understand the whole game and return the good name he rightfully deserves.

The service tenure of all officers should be the same.

The Niti Aayog has suggested a new age bar of 27 years for entry into the central civil services for the general category candidates. The Niti Aayog paper was silent on the age limit for SC, ST and OBC candidates, who constitute almost half (49.5 per cent) of the selected candidates for the civil services. Although the union government has clarified that status quo will continue, the idea has triggered a nationwide debate.

If administrative efficacy is the criterion, then the natural corollary is to reduce the age limit for all categories by five years.

According to the present rules, this is the eligibility for the civil services examination:

There are also some special relaxations for the physically challenged, J&K domiciles and servicemen disabled during duty.

Why is the status quoist UPSC giving special privileges in the age limit to reserved category candidates? What explains this benevolence when it has played no role in ensuring diversity or social justice?

Reservation in the civil services emanates from Article 16(4) of the Constitution - ""Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State.""

But it does not say anything about age limit or number of attempts allowed for taking any exam for the civil services or other government jobs. The UPSC notification for the civil services exam fails to offer a reason. It simply lists the relaxations. Even UPSC and DoPT websites are not helpful.

Also read: Niti Aayog pushes Modi govt's 'domain experts' idea for civil services

This may be a government dole to the deprived sections of the society so that a large number of candidates from such categories can appear for these exams. The second explanation is that there will not be enough candidates in the reserved categories if the age relaxation is not given. The third explanation is that since most SC, ST and OBC students belong to rural areas, they start schooling late.

The government report on higher education says that there are 799 universities, 39,071 colleges and 11,923 standalone institutions in India. They churn out 39.78 lakh graduates every year. If we check the enrolment rates, SC students constitute 13.9 per cent and ST students 4.9 per cent of the total enrolment. About 33.75 per cent of the total students enrolled belong to the OBC category. This data is only for a year and the numbers are increasing.

As the minimum educational qualification for the civil services exam is graduation, we can assume that there is a large talent pool from each social category. Every year, more than 10 lakh candidates appear for the civil services exam. The number of candidates who are finally selected remains less than 1000, and that number too is decreasing. This year, there are only 782 vacancies. Out of the total vacancies in the civil services, 49.5 per cent are reserved for the SC, ST and OBC candidates.

This demolishes the argument that age relaxation for the reserved candidates is meant to ensure that a large number of them take this exam. The talent pool in the reserved categories will be sufficiently large even if there is no age relaxation.

Can this 'facility' of age relaxation cause any harm to the reserved category?

Yes. It is causing some serious anomaly in the bureaucracy, especially at the top level. As the retirement age for all the officers is the same at 60 years, candidates availing of the age relaxation will serve a shorter tenure. The service gap can be huge - theoretically, there can be a gap of 16 years as someone from the general category will be entering the service at the age of 21 while another candidate from the reserved category is joining the service at 37. The chances of a young officer reaching the top will always be higher. And the top level of the bureaucracy is where policy decisions are made.

Look at some of the evidences of this anomaly in the top layer of bureaucracy.

This data shows that there is something wrong with the appointment and service rules for the bureaucracy that ensures that the upper layer, which actually runs the country, is not diversified and doesn't have adequate representation from all social groups. This is contrary to the Article 16(4) of the Constitution.

There are two more issues related to the age relaxation clause. There is a possibility that officers who enter the services availing of the age relaxation can have low self-esteem and may face a problem in getting due respect in their peer group.

The second issue is that at the age of 37, it will be difficult for someone to recalibrate life. That is a precious waste of human resources.

- Nothing should be done at one go or abruptly. The interest of the candidates who are following the old system of age relaxation should be taken care of. Change should be implemented in a phased manner.

- After five years, there should be no age or attempt relaxations for SC, ST and OBC candidates.

- If this is not possible, then there should be a differential age of retirement for different officers based on the age of their entry into the service. Service tenure of all officers should be same.

Enterprises in India faced more than 2.6 crore cyber threats during the third quarter of 2018 -- translating to over 2.8 lakhs threats every day, according to a new report from Seqrite, the enterprise arm of global IT security firm Quick Heal Technologies.

Information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITES) companies faced the most number of threats, with over 40 per cent of the threats targeting the industry, according to the ""Seqrite Quarterly Threat Report Q3 2018"" on Wednesday.

Other key sectors such as manufacturing (17.88 per cent), education (12.56 per cent), and hospitality (9.17 per cent) were also deemed to be at risk.

""There is no denying that enterprises face an unparalleled security challenge today. Growing interconnectivity has demolished traditional security perimetres,"" Sanjay Katkar, Joint Managing Director and Chief Technology Officer, Quick Heal Technologies Limited said in a statement.

""Every endpoint, every node, every device connected to enterprise networks has become a point of entry for attackers looking to steal invaluable information and disrupt business operations,"" Katkar added.

While ransomware, exploits, potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) and adware, infectors, and worms remained popular attack vectors for cybercriminals, the report noted a growing threat posed by cryptojacking.

Seqrite detected over 24,000 cryptojacking hits on a daily basis during Q3 2018.

Cryptojacking attacks -- a form of cyber-attack in which hackers hijack the infected system's processing power to mine cryptocurrency -- remain undetected for a long time and can often be used as a platform to launch other complex attacks."

""Growth is coming back to the Indian IT services industry,"" he told PTI, talking about industry highlights in 2018 and prospects in the coming calendar year.

Pai said 2018 saw ""H1B visa situation getting tougher,"" Indian companies focusing more on Japan and southeast Asia, massive expansion of captives and buy-backs by big companies.

Hyderabad has become a hot destination, with many new age companies coming to the Telangana capital, thanks to good

infrastructure, and ""very good marketing"" by KTR (K T Rama Rao, who served as IT minister in the previous TRS government), according to him.

He also said Indian companies were now trying to expand in markets in Asia much more vigorously, particularly Japan which is ""opening up"" and southeast Asia.

Reskilling of employees in IT services companies has redoubled, Pai said. ""More than half the people have been reskilled in all the IT companies in India. Digital income is growing in double digits for all the companies. 2018 has been a good year"".

Hiring has gone up, he said. ""First time in seven years, hiring compensation (entry-level) has gone up by 20 percent. Fresher compensation is going up, after a long time. It's a good news"".

Entry level packages are now pegged at 4.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh per annum, as companies are beginning to pay more to attract ""higher quality"".

""For many years, entry-level compensation packages had not gone up, demoralising people. In fact, delivery boys in cities make 50,000 rupees a month, much more than software engineers. It's ridiculous,"" Pai said.

He listed greater use artificial intelligence and machine learning in enterprises, greater thrust on digitisation, bigger spending by BFSI (banking, financial services, insurance) in America, as being growth opportunities for Indian IT companies in 2019, which will also see them look for greater penetration into Europe and Asia.

But the challenges for them are going to be localisation in America. ""You must become more local in America, most of them (Indian companies) are trying to do. And they are finding that when you are local, cost actually is not increasing because you are going to smaller towns where costs are much less"".

The year 2019 is going to be better for entry-level guys because hiring is going to be much better, said Pai, also chairman of Manipal Global Education Services, and Aarin Capital, and a member of the board of directors of the National Stock Exchange of India Limited.

Start-ups have a total of 600,000 employees in India. ""In the coming calendar year, my estimation is they (startups) will hire about 200,000 people. In 2018, I think they hired 150,000 people"", he said.

""Totally between IT services and start-ups, my estimate is 4.5 lakh to five lakh people will be hired (in India in 2019)"".

In 2018, the IT services companies and startups together are estimated to have hired 3.5 lakh to four lakh people.

""Now start-ups are becoming big.

Former Chief Financial Officer of IT major Infosys Ltd, T V Mohandas Pai said entry-level packages in the industry went up by as much as 20 per cent in 2018, after stagnation in salaries for the past seven years.

""Growth is coming back to the Indian IT services industry,"" he told PTI, talking about industry highlights in 2018 and prospects in the coming calendar year.

Pai said 2018 saw ""H1B visa situation getting tougher,"" Indian companies focusing more on Japan and southeast Asia, massive expansion of captives and buy-backs by big companies.

Hyderabad has become a hot destination, with many new age companies coming to the Telangana capital, thanks to good infrastructure, and ""very good marketing"" by KTR (K T Rama Rao, who served as IT Minister in the previous TRS government), according to him.

He also said Indian companies were now trying to expand in markets in Asia much more vigorously, particularly Japan which is ""opening up"" and southeast Asia.

Reskilling of employees in IT services companies has redoubled, Pai said. ""More than half the people have been reskilled in all the IT companies in India. Digital income is growing in double digits for all the companies. 2018 has been a good year"".

Hiring has gone up, he said. ""First time in seven years, hiring compensation (entry-level) has gone up by 20 per cent. Fresher compensation is going up, after a long time. It's a good news"".

Entry level packages are now pegged at 4.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh per annum, as companies are beginning to pay more to attact ""higher quality"".

""For many years, entry-level compensation packages had not gone up, demoralising people. In fact, delivery boys in cities make 50,000 rupees a month, much more than software engineers. It's ridiculous,"" Pai said.

He listed greater use artificial intelligence and machine learning in enterprises, greater thrust on digitisation, bigger spending by BFSI (banking, financial services, insurance) in America, as being growth opportunities for Indian IT companies in 2019, which will also see them look for greater penetration into Europe and Asia.

But the challenges for them are going to be localisation in America. ""You must become more local in America, most of them (Indian companies) are trying to do.

With the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announcing on Sunday that exams for Class 10 are beginning on February 21, 2019, and those of Class 11 on February 15, city students have expressed their worries, saying exams should have started just at their usual time of March to leave them some time for preparation.

Madhur Vaidya, a student in a private school of Chandigarh, said, ""This year there is hardly any time for preparation. It is December already and we are going to have our board exams within a month. I am very nervous, especially for exams of Maths and Science. ""

Manpreet Kaur, a student of the Government Model School, Maloya, said, ""This year there is not even a single holiday between exams of political science and mathematics. I am worried how students, who have arts and mathematics as a combination, will study these for Class 12.""

However, Simran Singh, a student of the Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 37, said, ""I think the date sheet is fine, but we were not expecting the exams this early. Usually, the exams start in March.""

What teachers say

Arvind Rana, a teacher of social studies at the Government High School, Sarangpur, said, ""Students should also notice that they have been informed duly about their exams well in advance, unlike previous years when the date sheet was released in January end.""

""Because of the poor result last year, teachers have already prepared their students accordingly,"" Rana added.

Meanwhile, St John's High School principal Kavita Das said, ""In most of the schools, they finish their syllabus by December. Now, mostly practising and testing begins. My students will not be uncomfortable with early exams.""

Das said, ""When we had taken up this matter with CBSE, they told us that they are advancing smaller exams so that results are not delayed.""

While district education officer (DEO) Anujit Kaur could not be contacted for comments, sources in the DEO's office said, ""CBSE takes in consideration a lot of factors while framing the exam dates. While advancing the exams this year, they have kept the future aspects in mind as well. General elections are scheduled around March-April next year.

- With 40% of total malware detection, the IT/ITES industry amongst the most vulnerable; organisations in manufacturing, education, and hospitality also at risk

- Cryptojacking emerges as a fast-growing threat vector with over 24,000 hits on a daily basis

New Delhi, December 26, 2018: Seqrite, a specialist provider of enterprise security and data protection solutions, has underlined the growing risk that the escalating evolution of the threat landscape poses to Indian organisations with the launch of its Quarterly Threat Report. The report reveals the latest enterprise security threats and trends identified by Seqrite during the third quarter of 2018. Seqrite is the enterprise arm of Quick Heal Technologies, one of the leading providers of cybersecurity solutions.

The most worrying statistic as revealed by the Seqrite Quarterly Threat Report Q3 2018 was the sheer volume of threats that organisations across sectors faced. Seqrite detected more than 2.6 crore threats targeting Indian enterprises during the three-month period - translating to a per day detection rate of over 2.8 lakhs threats.

According to the report, Ransomware, Exploits, PUA & Adware, Infectors, and worms remained popular attack vectors for cybercriminals, but what was interesting to note was the growing threat posed by cryptojacking. Seqrite detected over 24,000 Cryptojacking hits on a daily basis during Q3 2018, underlining the growing popularity of this relatively new threat.

Another interesting trend mapped in the Seqrite Quarterly Threat Report Q3 2018 was the distribution of attacks across different industries. IT/ITES companies faced the most number of threats, with over 40% of the threats targeting the industry. Other key sectors such as manufacturing (17.88%), education (12.56%), and hospitality (9.17%) were also deemed to be at risk.

Speaking on the report, Sanjay Katkar, Joint Managing Director and Chief Technology Officer, Quick Heal Technologies Limited said, ""There is no denying that enterprises face an unparalleled security challenge today. Growing interconnectivity has demolished traditional security perimeters. Every endpoint, every node, every device connected to enterprise networks has become a point of entry for attackers looking to steal invaluable information and disrupt business operations. Attacks are becoming smarter and more targeted, and are causing much greater damage. In this context, the Seqrite Quarterly Threat Report Q3 2018 serves to underline the sheer scale of risk that Indian organisations are exposed to, at present.""

""Mapping these trends has really helped us in gaining a better understanding of the tactics and modalities adopted by threat actors while targeting Indian businesses. Having successfully defended our clients against these threats, we are now utilising the insights generated by our report to further strengthen our enterprise security offerings, and to better protect our clients from a fast-evolving threat landscape,"" he added.

Based on Seqrite telemetry data, the Seqrite Quarterly Threat Report Q3 2018 has been compiled by Quick Heal Security Labs, the R&D division of Quick Heal Technologies dedicated to arm enterprises with cutting-edge security threat research and cyber intelligence, and analyses data fetched from enterprise networks and endpoints across the globe to deliver enhanced protection to clients against current and evolving cyber threats."

He said, UIDAI is aware of the reports that some schools are asking for Aadhaar cards for student admission.

UIDAI's clarification comes at a time when admissions to nursery and entry-level classes have begun in over 1,500 private schools in Delhi. UIDAI has asked schools to ensure that no child is denied admission for lack of Aadhaar.

In September, the Supreme Court had upheld the Constitutional validity of Aadhaar but clipped the scope of the biometric identity project. It had ruled that Aadhaar was not mandatory for bank accounts, mobile connections or school admissions.

The court had held that Aadhaar would remain compulsory for filing of Income Tax returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number, as well as welfare schemes. (Inputs: Agencies, NGB)"

Enterprise cyber security provider Seqrite has revealed in its Quarterly Threat Report for Q3 2018 that more than 26 million threats targeted Indian enterprises during the third quarter (July to September) - translating to a per day detection rate of over 280,000 threats.

Seqrite is the enterprise arm of Quick Heal Technologies, a cybersecurity solutions provider from India. ""Growing interconnectivity has demolished traditional security perimeters. Every endpoint, every node, every device connected to enterprise networks has become a point of entry for attackers looking to steal invaluable information and disrupt business operations,"" said Sanjay Katkar, Joint Managing Director and Chief Technology Officer, Quick Heal.

According to the report, Ransomware, Exploits, PUA & Adware, Infectors, and worms remained popular attack methods for cybercriminals, but what was interesting to note was the growing threat posed by cryptojacking (hijacking an internet enabled device to run cryptocurrency mining software in the background). Seqrite detected over 24,000 cryptojacking hits on a daily basis during Q3 2018, underlining the growing popularity of this relatively new threat. Reports by other security solutions providers like Symantec have also noted the increasing prevalence of cryptojacking instances over the past year in India.

The World Economic Forum rates cybersecurity threats and attacks as third most likely risk to impact the world today. The scale of the threat is expanding drastically, and by 2021, the global cost of cybersecurity breaches is expected to reach $6 trillion, double the total for 2015. Industry experts predict that Industry 4.0 (adoption of new tech like the internet of things, artificial intelligence etc. across businesses)can be the catalyst of changes in different fields like governance, management and administration of smart cities and other applications which are driving the vision of Digital India, said a recent study by EY.

""Mapping these trends has really helped us in gaining a better understanding of the tactics and modalities adopted by threat actors while targeting Indian businesses,"" he added.

In a recent report, Frost & Sullivan noted that almost 64% of Indian companies faced cyber attacks over the past year, tallying up to Rs 700 million worth of losses for large businesses. Even as there are concerns around the susceptibility of AI-powered devices as well as Internet-connected devices to be easily corrupted, security companies are confident that increasing use of AI will actually help provide better security. ""Threat identification systems already use machine learning techniques to identify entirely new threats. And, it isn't just attackers that can use AI systems to probe for open vulnerabilities; defenders can use AI to better harden their environments from attacks through a series of simulated attacks,"" noted a report on cybersecurity predictions for 2019 by Symantec."

The two accused were identified as Bhagwan Kumar (45) and his son Sandeep Kumar (21), who were purportedly seen punishing the boy in their garage on Monday. Police said the entire incident was captured in a mobile video by some local journalist.

""After the information reached us, we went to their garage and found the child was in a ""murga"" (stress position used as a corporal punishment) position and was holding his ears while sitting on his knees and bending forward, apparently for not being able to fix a punctured tyre properly.

The review by state police found that 40% of men who sexually assaulted children were known to the survivors. In fact, 30% of the predators attacked children from their own families.

""There is a need to create more awareness among children, schoolgoing kids in particular, about their rights and to report any form of molestation and sexual abuse.

Pocso cases, meanwhile, continue unabated in Karnataka. In 2016, 1,614 cases were reported from across the state, while the number climbed to 1,875 in 2017. In the first 11 months of this year, 1,705 cases have been reported.

Police record in pursuing the cases though is a mixed bag. While 60 Pocso case accused were convicted in 2016, the number dipped to 32 the next year. This year, only four accused have been convicted. Police admit collecting evidence and taking statements from eyewitnesses and others are major challenges they face in Pocso probes.

""In many cases, survivors and complainants turn hostile due to many reasons, including fear of getting defamed in society. Neighbours or relatives of survivors hesitate to make statements or appear in court during trial. These are the main reasons for such low rate of convictions. Despite best efforts, over 25% of the cases are dismissed due to lack of cooperation from the survivors and their family members,"" a senior police officer said."

3. Cable Operators Protest Hike in Charges

The Old City Cable TV Operators Welfare Association warned on Tuesday that it would black out the telecast of paid channels and stop payments to Multiple System Operators (MSOs) if they were forced to pay in accordance with the new regulations announced by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).

Addressing a protest meeting here, association president Muqtar Ahmed said implementation of the tariff regime approved by the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appe-llate Tribunal would create problems for cable TV operators and also burden viewers. He said cable TV operators in the Old City were charging Rs 150 to Rs 200 per month. ""The new regime would push up the rate to Rs 600 as we have to pay an average of almost Rs 550 to the MSO. At present, cable TV operators are paying Rs 65 per box,"" Ahmed said.

5. Telangana to Study Chhattisgarh Model for Appointing Secretaries

The TRS which faced a setback in the Hyderabad High Court in the matter of appointments of parliamentary secretaries during its first term has decided to adopt the Chhattisgarh model this time. The TRS in its first term had had appointed MLAs D Vinay Bhaskar, Jalagam Venkat Rao, V Srinivas Goud, G Kishore Kumar, V Satish Kumar and Kova Laxmi as Parliamentary Secretaries through a GO on 29 December 2014. It subsequently issued the Telangana Parliamentary Secretaries (Appointment, salaries, allowances and miscellaneous provisions) Act, 2015 adding legal sanctity to the appointments.

On 1 May 2015, the Hyderabad High Court stayed the appointments and said the Act specified the power of appointment with the chief minister whereas the appointment order was issued in the name of the Governor. The state government approached the Supreme Court which expressed its disinclination in intervening with the order.

Veerpal Kaur, 32, the 400-m gold medalist in Asia Pacific Masters Games (APMG) 2018 at Penang in Malaysia, was on Monday picked up by Chandigarh Police outside the Punjab Chief Minister's residence in Sector 2.

A contractual attendant at her village's anganwadi, Kaur wanted to meet CM Capt Amarinder Singh as she is in dire need of financial assistance for the treatment of her physically-disabled husband, Gurnaib Singh, 38. A diabetic and patient of liver ailment, Singh has been advised to undergo surgery by doctors at Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGI), Chandigarh.

Kaur, a resident of Safipur Kalan village near Sunam in Sangrur, has been camping in the PGI, along with her ailing husband, for the last fortnight and staying at a gurdwara on its premises.

She tried to meet Capt thrice in the last five days, but failed. Monday, when she went to the CM residence for the third time, the security guards deployed there called police, which picked up Kaur. They first took her to Sector 3 police station before dropping her back at the gurdwara in PGI.

She told Chandigarh Newsline that she just wanted to seek assistance for the treatment of her husband, who is 60 per cent disabled, on the basis of her performance on field. ""I went there thrice, but failed to meet CM sahib. Yesterday (Monday), an officer on special duty (OSD) there told me to come again,"" said Kaur, adding she just earns Rs 5,000 per month. ""My husband was working at a factory as a watchman getting Rs 4,500 salary per month, but due to his illness, he had to leave his job. My house is also in shambles. I have two school-going sons. I have come here after leaving my two sons in care of my relatives,"" she said.

Kaur, who also won a gold medal in the first National Masters Games, 2017, said her husband had earlier underwent an operation in Jalandhar, but it proved unsuccessful. ""At that time too, I had to collect money from villagers for the treatment of my husband. For the last one-and-a-half years, the condition of my husband has been deteriorating. Last week, he was admitted to the emergency ward of PGI as his haptoglobin was very low. Doctors controlled the HP of my husband and referred us to hematology department, which further referred us to general surgery,"" she said.

Calls and messages to OSD M P Singh by Chandigarh Newsline went unanswered.

Ailing Singh said, ""Earlier, we used to travel back to Sangrur from PGI after every checkup, but as we are running short of money, we have decided to stay in the local gurdwara till the completion of treatment. I hope government will help us. Due to my illness, I have consulted four departments, including internal medicine and gastroenterology.""

In June 2018, Sangrur MP Bhagwant Maan had helped Kaur travel to Penang for participating in the APMG."

Bhagwat was speaking after presenting the eighth annual Lokmata Sumatitai Smruti Pratishthan awards to honour outstanding social work at a function held at Scientific Society Hall, Laxmi Nagar.

Congratulating the awardees, Bhagwat pointed out that none of them had done social work for gaining recognition and said it was their inner urge that made them do it. ""Life that is lived without difficulties in no life as things easily got are the things you won't value much,"" Bhagwat said.

Present on the occasion were committee president Dr Uday Bodhankar, secretary Jyotsna Pandit and executive members Kundatai Vijaykar, Deodatta Dasture and Pravin Gadewar.

The awards were presented in three categories. The Lokmata award was presented to Padma Shri Dr Rani Bang, a gynaecologist, who has brought transformation in the life of tribals, especially in Gadchiroli area. She and her husband Dr Abhay Bang have revolutionized the way the poor are treated. Their projects have led to reduction in infant mortality.

Accepting the award, Dr Bang thanked three women in her life -- her mother for teaching her all the values, her mother-in-law for her unflinching support during her work and Bhagwat's mother Malatibai for lending support to her mother-in-law and making her believe that all will be well.

Lokmata NGO award was given to Saksham, an organization that works for visually disabled people.

Basappa, 63, then walked to the Sakkarayapattana police station and surrendered himself, police said.

The incident took place at Kanchagaranahalli in Kaduru taluk under Kadur police limits.

Basappa married Jayamma 30 years ago and they lived together for about five years. The couple has two sons, both government employees. One son is working as a teacher while another is working in KSRTC. Their marriage lasted around 5 years. The couple separated but lived in the same village, said police. Jayamma lived with one of her brothers.

A few years after the couple separated, Basappa asked for a divorce. But Jayamma refused to grant him one. His repeated pleas over the years for a divorce were turned down and the two frequently argued over the issue, said police.

On Monday night, Basappa barged into Jayamma's brother's house. First he assaulted his brother-in-law and nephew. Then with a country-made pistol he fired five bullets at Jayamma who collapsed on the spot.

She was rushed to the Government McGann Hospital in Shivamogga where she was declared brought dead.

In his statement to police, Basappa said that Jayamma had ruined his life by not agreeing to a divorce and he had run out of patience. ""It was an act of revenge,"" said a police officer."

In the past few months, the Maharashtra Police has come across over 25,000 social media posts urging people to join them at Koregaon Bhima in Pune to mark the annual celebratory gathering of the battle of Bhima Koregaon on January 1.

While thousands of posts have been deleted, the police are now keeping a watch on such posts, analysing them and trying to have a dialogue with the stakeholders and local leaders to ensure that the upcoming celebrations go off peacefully.

In the aftermath of the 2018 violence at Koregaon Bhima, the Dalit-Maratha agitation and the passing of the Maratha reservation bill seeking quota in education and jobs, the police anticipate that the turnout would be almost double as compared to last year.

""Most of these posts are inciting in nature, prodding people to join them during the annual celebrations. While we have deleted a few thousand posts, the exercise is not tenable. We have decided that instead of deleting these posts, we would observe the kind of messages that is being spread through social media. We have decided to engage with the local community leaders and other stakeholders to ensure that the celebrations go off peacefully,"" said an officer from the DGP office who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

""Through the social media posts, we have been able to make an rough estimate of the kind of mobilisation that is being made and the number of people targeted. This time around, we anticipate less number of women and children and the crowd will mostly comprise youngsters between the age group of 15 to 45 years. The social media posts are targetting the young crowd,"" the officer added.

Another officer said that the posts circulated aren't limited to one community or group but the Koregaon Bhima annual celebration is being used as a ploy by every community to assert their dominance in a state, which will be going to polls next year.

""Between the last year's violence and the upcoming event, a lot has happened in the state -- Maharashtra has witnessed statewide bandhs, the Dalit-Maratha agitation gathered momentum and the Maratha reservation bill was cleared... All this will have a bearing on the upcoming event, as the members from both the communities would like to assert their dominance in an election year,"" the officer added.

Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the Koregaon Bhima violence last year, the DGP office, in a report submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs, had stated that it suspects that while the agitation called by Dalit group and left-wing organisations had support from ""left extremist groups"", the local Savarna (non-Dalit) villagers were instigated by ""right-wing"" organisations.

This year too, sources said that efforts have been made through social media by both the left and right extremist groups in reaching out to people.

""We suspect that these posts have not only been generated by the two communities but the left and the right extremists groups are equally involved. While the arrests of the urban naxals might have deterred them, but we anticipate their participation this time around as well,"" the officer said."

English, instead of Hindi, will become the medium of instruction in class 6 of 36 state-run schools in the city from the next academic session.

A circular by the directorate of elementary education, dated December 20, stated that one section in class 6 of 310 government schools across the state would start using English as the medium of instruction from 2019-2020 academic session. So far, in class 6, all subjects other than English are taught in Hindi. Out of a total of 310 schools in the district that have been chosen for the initiative, the highest number of schools are in Gurugram.

District elementary education officer Premlata Yadav said that the initiative was aimed at improving the student's command over the language. ""Till now, students in class 6 were only studying English as a single subject. They will become more familiar with the language if they use it regularly for studying all the subjects. The initiative is aimed at ensuring that our students are on par with pupils in private schools in every sphere,"" Yadav said.

About 40 English books will be made available to each of these schools in the next academic session to facilitate the initiative. All schools have been directed to ensure that the message is communicated to teachers, students and parents at the beginning of the next academic session.

One section of class 9 in these 310 schools is already using English as a medium of instruction for studying mathematics and science.

While the move has been welcomed by parents and children, some teachers have raised concerns about the lack of qualified English post-graduate teachers in schools. ""It is a good move and we welcome it, but, the shortage of teachers should be fulfilled first to make the initiative a success. The department should consult with the selected schools and find out if they have enough teachers to teach their subjects in English,"" said Satyanarayan Yadav, deputy vice-president of Haryana School Teachers Union."

Most of the schools in Cuddalore, Villupuram, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, and nine other districts have begun using the machines. Schools will bear the machines' maintenance cost.

The incinerators, as students claim, will be very beneficial. ""What is more inconvenient than the having periods is disposing the soiled napkins. We will not have to worry about maintaining hygiene in the campus anymore,"" said Prateeksha, a Class X student. The fully automated machine, prevents foul odour from used napkins and can burn 150 to 200 napkins a day. The department has also provided cupboard facilities in all schools to store toiletries including sanitary napkins, at 64.01 lakh.

While the state is busy promoting hygiene in government schools, there are complaints that incinerators at a few corporation schools are not being maintained. ""Based on complaints we repair the machines,"" said E Govindasamy, educational officer, Greater Chennai Corporation. The Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 mandates installing incinerators or special disposal dustbins to prevent pollution."

Lack of periodic training on handling weapons, inadequate knowledge of wildlife and its laws and 45% vacancies among forest foot soldiers have exposed gaping holes in the ability of the forest department to effectively guard the 26,281sqkm forest area in the state.

Shortage in manpower translates to improper monitoring that makes the forests vulnerable to poaching and tree felling. It also means delay in rescue activities. A range officer, forester or a guard is estimated to be able to cover 25sqkm of wooded area, but in Tamil Nadu shortage of people forces jurisdiction of each official to be at least 30sqkm. ""Many field staff have health problems due to which they cannot trek even short distances in the wooded areas,"" said a senior state forest official.

Staff scarcity in forest department is a nation-wide issue with shortages ranging between 30% and 40% in states such as Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat. The neighbouring Karnataka, too, faces similar problems. A senior official said the sanctioned strength of rangers in Karnataka is 765, but only 613 rangers are in service. Delay in recruitment process, inadequate number of candidates in posts such as forest watchers and guards, are some of the issues that other states face.

In Tamil Nadu, no recruitment was done for close to three decades till 2014 due to internal politics. The process was stalled on several occasions because associations of rangers, foresters and guards moved the courts to obtain a stay, citing various reasons. Kerala is an exception to this, as the state is prompt in recruiting foot soldiers on a regular basis. Former head of TN forest force and principal chief conservator of forests C K Sreedharan said among the four southern states, Kerala tops the list in filling vacancies. ""They have an efficient recruitment system in place and training is imparted to the newly recruited forest foot soldiers."" In Kerala, recruitment happens through the state public service commission, whereas in TN rangers were directly recruited. ""The process of recruitment had to be standardized,"" said Sreedharan. Stressing on the need for proper qualification of candidates, S R V Murthy, conservator of forests, Rajasthan, said, ""Recruitments here are done based on two categories forestry degree holders and science graduates.""

Training is restricted to new forest foot soldiers. ""Rangers recruited in TN undergo 18 months of training, and the foresters undergo six months of theoretical and practical training,"" said a senior forest official. Topics such as sylviculture, forest management, forest fire control and prevention, wildlife laws and soil science are taught during this period'. But in the absence of refresher courses the rules are forgotten and the updated laws ignored. ""Though everyone undergoes arms training, only rangers are provided with weapons. Periodical training is lacking,"" the official said.

Curriculum in the training module for rangers has to be improved, said the officer. The present curriculum is designed by the director of forest education in the Union ministry. Tamil Nadu officials say the training issue has to be addressed without delay. Since poaching is not rampant in Tamil Nadu, the challenges of foresters is monsoon, dry periods, when forest fires occur, and wild animals. To tackle these issues, proper gear, manpower and weapons for protection are essential.

Since 2014, Tamil Nadu forest department has initiated efforts to recruit more field staff, but they are still far from adequate. Recruiting youngsters, training them in forestry related issues, providing them weapons and other paraphernalia such as raincoats and boots are some of the aspects that need the state's immediate attention."

Recording of videos of best teachers of the district explaing important chapters in Odia has already started. These videos will be uploaded to 'YouTube' and their links will be provided on the app. Besides the videos, the app will also provide detailed study materials and interactive practice tests.

""We thought of developing this app to provide resources to Odia medium school students on par with those studying in English medium private schools,"" said Mr. Kulange. Most educational apps for school students are in English or Hindi and some of them charge money for their services.

The delegates were speaking during the programme organised annually by American Federation of Muslim of Indian Origin (AFMI) - USA and Canada in association with Friends of Weaker Society, Ranchi to felicitate the young talents of minority groups who have achieved distinction in State Board examination, CBSE and ICSE exams.

Abu Imran, Director - Higher Education said that due to the negligent approach until now and apathy of Muslim leaders in creating apt environment for promoting education among the minority community members, in Jharkhand alone merely two to three per cent students of minority communities get the privilege to receive higher education. He further held feeble guardianship responsible for not able to convince the children to pursue education with utmost seriousness.

Imran added that due to several myths and political polarization, the people of minority communities are still lagging behind. ""Leaders of other communities do establish institutions but very few leaders from the minority communities' side take an initiative to bring change in education system or else establish institutes of excellence. Pity politics, focus on small issues have drained the real issues,"" Imran stated.

Further, during the career counseling session, Imran, an Alma Mater of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) asked the students to focus on new career options and encouraged the students to opt for legal studies and other vocational subjects apart from the evergreen career options - Medical and Engineering stream.

A talathi is a low-ranking revenue officer in the state government.

The information came to light during the interrogation of the accused arrested in the case till now and the subsequent probe by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the CID. The SIT probe has now zeroed in on the talathi, who was recruited through an examination held at a college in Deccan Gymkhana area and was later posted in Shirur tehsil.

It's been over 25 years since women were inducted into the Indian army. That explains why Chief of Army Staff, Gen Bipin Rawat's recent comments, that lady officers in the Indian army were not yet ready for combat roles, sparked outrage on the role of women in India's land fighting force.

The collective argument is, when we can have a woman Defence Minister, women fighter pilots, why can't we have lady officers in combat roles.

According to Gen Rawat, lady officers in Army were not ready for combat roles because men in the army, who largely come from small villages, would not be willing to accept a female commander.

He also said that women could die in combat, and Indian families were not yet ready to deal with the sight of women's bodies return from war zones.

Implying that a woman's primary responsibility was childcare, Rawat said that the army would not be able to give a woman commanding officer six months of maternity leave. He added that there would be a ""ruckus"" if women were denied that maternity leave.

Last year, the same Chief made headlines when he said ""I am looking at women coming as jawans. I am going to start it soon. Firstly we will start with women as military police jawans.""

Women across the board, dismiss the Army Chief's latest statements as ridiculous. Why curtail women from dying for their country, and why should such glory be reserved for men alone? It was as far back as March 93 when the first batch of women were inducted into the Army and placed in non combat roles in the Services.

Referring to Gen Rawat's argument that men from small villages would not accept women commanders, defence analyst, Lt Col Ankita Srivastava, in a post, wrote, ""This problem has long been solved. It actually started 26 years ago. As time progressed the army jawans have adapted very well to taking orders from women officers.""

She continues, ""Gen Rawat is portraying that should there be a war, a freshly inducted woman commander will be sent to the forward post same day, and she will fail miserably. Oh, try those tactics with any male officer, Sir. Even a freshly inducted male officer who isn't familiar with jawans will fail. The jawans have their way of testing their bosses, irrespective of the gender. Having spent 14 years in the Army and having struggled hard to tell the organisation that I am not a woman, I learnt a very good thing about the jawans of Indian Army. They react/respond to the tone and demeanor of the officer, and not to the gender. The bond does not grow overnight, it builds up gradually.""

In the same vein, the senior officer's post suggests, ""Rawat sir, no one's asking you to induct lady officers just when the war in the country is declared. The induction should be now, and both parties will grow to adapt to each other's mindsets. If our country, which was primarily male dominated and had rural males in abundance, could accept being led by a woman prime minister decades back, I think it's irrelevant to blame the jawans of today's generation when they can access internet/social media and have actually have evolved mentally.""

In the Indian army, women currently occupy roles classified 'as non-combat'. As the groundbreaking Air Force experiment has proved, given the opportunity, there is no battle a woman cannot win.

Last year, the Indian Air Force enrolled women as fighter pilots, while the Indian Navy is yet to recruit women as active combatants.

""The subsequent years (after induction) saw the numbers grow and women got commissioned into all Arms/services barring the Infantry or Artillery arms. I am sure this happened because women proved their worth in whatever roles they were assigned. Which I must say were controlled and assigned keeping safety/security in mind. While it has been 25 years, Permanent commission has still not been given because that would mean Command of units,"" points out Major (Retd) G. Sarita.

Unfortunately, though, gender equality issues in the army go beyond rules about what positions women are allowed to serve in. The individuals we spoke with were clear that gender discrimination is alive and well.

Another officer, who chose to remain anonymous, says, ""Lady officers have proven themselves enough and more. It is high time they were accepted as commanders. After 25 years of induction lady officers are well aware of what their job and related challenges (physical/mental/emotional) are. And if that doesn't deter them from taking up active combat, why should a gentleman thrust his judgement/understanding of their potential/mettle and bar them from achieving what they truly can?""

Another serving lady officer, who is part of Army Air Defence, feels that even though women aren't technically allowed to serve in combat roles, they've been unofficially doing so for quite some time. ""Women were initially inducted in Signals, Engineer, Supply (ASC), and Ordinance on a trial basis and then moved on to their intake in Army Air Defence (AAD), which is actually a support arm during combat. So, in a way, they are part of combat. The Jag, intelligence and education branches of Army, were, in fact, the first ones to take-in lady officers. Like in AAD, women should be given an opportunity to join the combat forces and no further discussion is required.""

On the issue of women officers complaining about men peeping into the tent, Major Sarita says, ""I would say wrong choice of words. We do have a system in place which is a little more considerate towards women in terms of employment, keeping in mind the socio cultural values that we have. Probably that is why while we are talking about women officers in various roles and forms, and nobody is talking about inducting women in the ranks. Shouldn't we talk about this disparity base as well.""

On the Nation not being ready for a martyred woman coming in a body bag, she adds, ""Seems a little frivolous. We have seen Kalpana Chawla being given a hero's status. It was a choice."""

The EC is understood to have addressed a communication to the Chief Electoral Officer Rajat Kumar in this regard explaining the major areas that need to be looked into for making the State ready for elections.

The EC has recently commenced the exercise for conduct of the general elections for which the schedule is likely to be announced in February last week or March first week.

The EC's communication, according to sources, mainly focussed on the preparatory work like the Systematic Voter Education and Election Participation (SVEEP) programme at State and district levels in the run up to the elections.

The election authority had also sought estimates relating to the number of polling stations that would be required for the 17 constituencies where elections would be held as well as the details regarding the staff and logistics.

Senior officials said the election authorities are seriously exploring the methods for effective maintenance of the voter verifiable paper audit trail machines which have sensors which are light and heat sensitive. The issue assumes significance as the election is likely to be held during April/May, the time when the summer peaks in the State. The election officials are also focussing on the estimated number of electronic voting machines including the reserve stock that would be required for the elections. Though there is an option to reconfigure the existing EVMs for use in the next elections, the option could be utilised only after the disposal of the election petitions, if any, after the 45-day period from the day of announcement of results.

""The disposal of election petitions will take another 45 days. This means the exact availability of the EVMs will be known only after March first week,"" a senior official told The Hindu."

FULL TEXT OF THE HIGH COURT ORDER / JUDGMENT

The only issue arising in the aforesaid case is whether there could be a deemed registration under Section 12A of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The question of law framed in the memorandum is as follows:

Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Tribunal is right in law and with jurisdiction in deeming the application as being condoned and in directing the CIT to condone delay and to grant registration under Section 12A of the I.T Act?

2. The learned Standing Counsel, Government of India, (Taxes) points out that there was a detailed consideration in Annexure A as to the respondent being not a charitable trust especially with reference to the clause in the trust deed which enabled collection of fee, deposits, contributions etc., from the students and their parents. Though the trust was essentially for setting up of an educational institution, there was no charity involved is the specific finding. The applicant had constituted a trust in the year 2002, the creation of the deed being on 27.05.2002 and filed an application only on 10.10.2006. There was considerable delay in filing such application and there were not sufficient reasons stated for condoning such delay. Challenging the order of the Tribunal, it is also pointed out that though a period of six months is provided under Section 12AA(2), there is no deeming provision as such in the statute and in such circumstance, there could not be a deemed registration under Section 12A.

3. The learned Counsel appearing for the respondent submits that the very same Commissioner, who filed the appeal has given effect to the order of the Tribunal and in such circumstance, the Income Tax Appeal is infructuous. It is also submitted that the Tribunal had relied on the decision of the Special Bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi reported in [2008] 111 ITD 175 (Delhi) (SB) (Bhagwad Swarup Shri Shri Devraha Baba Memorial Shri Hari Parmarth Dham Trust v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Dehradun) which found the limitation as provided under sub-section (2) of Section 12AA to be a mandatory provision; failure to comply with which would result in there being a deeming registration under the Act. The learned Counsel would also refer to the circular of the CBDT which again mandated that the application should be considered and either allowed or rejected within the period of six months, as provided under Section 12AA. Reliance is placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (2017) 11 SCC 480 (Commissioner of Income-Tax v. Society for the promotion of Education, Adventure Sport & Conservation of Environment)

4. The learned Standing Counsel, Government of India(Taxes), in counter has referred to the decision of the Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court reported in [2015] 372 ITR 209 (All)(FB) (Commissioner of Income- Tax v. Muzafar Nagar Development Authority), wherein it is specifically held that there could be no deemed registration merely for reason of non-disposal, within six months, of an application for registration filed under Section 12AA. On a reading of the Full Bench decision, which has a persuasive power and also the decision of the Special Bench of the Tribunal, we are inclined to follow the Full Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court. Without a specific deeming provision there can be no grant of deemed registration under Section 12AA (2002) 9 SCC 1 [Appollo Tyres v. CIT, Kochi]. There can be no fiction created by mere inference, in the absence of a specific provision deeming something to be other than what actually it is. Then, the fact assume significance as to what was the view of the Department insofar as the mandatory provision of consideration of application and an order being issued within a period of six months.

5. It cannot but be noticed that Section 12AA(2) specifically provides that on an application, an order granting or refusing registration shall be passed before the expiry of the six months of the date on which the application was received. We also directed the revenue to produce the files, which are before us. We see from the files that the application was filed on 10.10.2006. A report was called for from the Income-Tax officer which was submitted only on 24.07.2007, after almost nine months. The communication of the Commissioner of Income-Tax based on which such report was made also is seen to be dated 12.01.2006 referred to in the report of the Income-Tax Officer. The Income-Tax Officer has recommended the registration under Section 12AA(2). However an adverse report is seen authored by the Joint Commissioner of Income-Tax dated 31.07.2007 addressed to the Commissioner of Income-Tax. There has been some adjournments later and eventually the order impugned before the Tribunal dated 29.11.2007 was passed. We cannot but notice that there was unreasonable delay insofar as complying with the mandatory provision under Section 12AA(2).

6. In this context, we have to notice the directions of the CBDT issued as Instruction No.16/2015(F.No.197/38/2015-ita-1) DATED 06.11.2015 which we extract hereunder:-

""Sub-section (2) of Section 12AA of the Income-Tax Act, 1961 prescribes that every order granting or refusing registration under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of that section shall be passed before the expiry of six months from the end of the month in which the application was received under clause(a) or clause(aa) of the sub-section (1) thereof. Thus while processing the application under Section 12 AA of the Act, the time limit of six months has to be adhered to by the Commissioner of Income Tax(Exemptions). However, it has been brought to the notice of the Board that the said time limit has not been observed in some cases.

2.The undersigned is directed to convey that the aforesaid time limit of six months is to be strictly followed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) while passing order under section 12AA. The CCIT(Exemptions) may monitor the adherence of prescribed time limit and initiate suitable administrative action in case any laxity in adhering to the same is noticed.""

7. The CBDT has thought it fit, obviously from experience of dealing with delayed applications, that the mandatory provision has to be complied with in letter and spirit. The officers of the Department are necessarily bound by the directions so issued by the CBDT; which in the present case is a reiteration of the mandate statutorily prescribed. In the present case, we see failure to comply with the mandatory provision as provided under section 12AA(2); the circular having come later to the impugned order.

8. The instruction by CBDT gives us a clear picture of how the Board expected the Officers to treat the mandatory provision under section 12AA(2) as being scrupulously relevant and significant insofar as a consideration of an application filed under section 12AA within the time stipulated in sub-section (2). We have to look at the present case also in the light of the Supreme Court decision in (2017) 11 SCC 480. The learned Standing Counsel, Government of India, (Taxes) would take serious objection insofar as pointing out that there is no declaration of law as found in the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and a mere concession made by the learned Counsel appearing for the Department. It cannot be taken as a concession on behalf of the Department or being the opinion of the Department is the argument. It is also urged that this Court should be concerned with the interpretation of the provision to advance the course of law and not a mere concession by a Counsel before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a solitary instance.

9. On a reading of the order passed in (2017) 11 SCC 480, we are not convinced that there was any concession made by the learned Additional Solicitor General who appeared in the matter for the Income-Tax Department. As we discern from the order, the Commissioner of Income-Tax, Kanpur had filed an appeal from the deemed registration granted under Section 12A for reason solely of an application under Section 12AA of the Act having not been acted upon for six months. The appeal arose from the judgment dated 03.04.2008 of the High Court of Judicature, Allahabad. When the matter was considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the Full Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court cited, herein above, by the Revenue was passed and we do not see the said decision having been placed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Rather than a concession, the learned Additional Solicitor General specifically informed the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the only apprehension of the Department was regarding the date on which the said deemed registration, would be effected; whether it is on the date of application or on the expiry of six months. The Civil Appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court was disposed of expressing the apprehension to be unfounded, but all the same clarifying that the registration of the application under Section 12AA would only take effect from the date of expiry of six months from the date of application. The effect of disposal of a Civil Appeal as has been laid down in Kunhayammed v. State of Kerala [(2000)245 ITR 360 (SC)] hence assumes significance. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in 2017(11) SCC 480; in a Civil Appeal, approved the judgment of the Allahabad High Court allowing deemed registration under Section 12AA; but applicable only from the date of expiry of the six month period as mandated in sub-section(2) of Section 12AA. The judgment of the High Court merges in the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The opinion as expressed by the Allahabad High Court, regarding deemed registration under Section 12A for reason only of non consideration of an application under Section 12AA within a period of six months from the date of filing, having not been differed from by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the Civil Appeal; the declaration by the High Court assumes the authority of a precedent by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the principles of doctrine of merger. Despite the compelling persuasion of the learned Senior Counsel to interpret the provision as has been interpreted by the Full Bench of the High Court of Allahabad we find ourselves, incapacitated so to do and obliged to respectfully follow (2017) 11 SCC 480.

In such circumstance, respectfully following the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court we answer the question in favour of the assessee and against the revenue and reject the appeal. The registration however is applicable only from the date of expiry of the six months from the date of application. There shall be no order as to costs."

In its first ever performance audit of 11 central universities the Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry on December 15, asked them to address their individual gaps -- by focusing on employment oriented courses in some cases; strengthening infrastructure in others; and hiring faculty, administrative officers, and statutory functionaries in still others.

""The ministry, UGC [the University Grants Commission, which regulates higher education] and the central varsities signed memorandums of understanding [MOUs] regarding key parameters [for the assessment] earlier this year,"" a government official said on condition of anonymity. ""This was the first review on the basis of these parameters. The universities have drawn a roadmap about the areas in which their performance needs to be improved.""

The vice-chancellors of central universities of Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kashmir, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Orissa, Sikkim participated in the review. So did the heads of North-Eastern Hill University, Indira Gandhi National Tribal University (Madhya Pradesh) Mahatma Gandhi Central University in Bihar's Motihari and Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya or GGV (Chhattisgarh).

The official said the vice-chancellors made presentations at the December 15 meeting. Suggestions regarding the areas in which more was required were made after the presentations, he added. ""For instance, some of the universities have not filled up key posts like that of registrars or controller of examinations... [They] have been asked to do so."" The secretary (higher education) R Subramanyam and UGC chief D P Singh were there at the review.

The official added the GGV was asked to fill up statutory posts such as that of the controller of examination and the finance officer and to also focus on starting vocational courses. The focus was on the need to start employment-oriented courses in case of Ranchi's Central University of Jharkhand too. Dharamshala's Central University of Himachal Pradesh was asked to appoint key officials such as the librarian and a financial officer. The utilisation of a new campus was discussed in the case of the Central University of Kashmir.

The MOUs regarding the review signed with the varsities include 14 performance parameters, output targets and programmes of work.

The official said 39 central universities have signed such agreements. ""There will be a review of the remaining varsities as well. The varsities will be asked to set their own targets and then the progress can be followed up in consultations with them.""

The Delhi University is the only institution among the 40 central varsities under the UGC's purview that has not signed the pact yet. It is yet to get its executive committee approve the signing of the MoU.

Former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy called the review essential and desirable. ""However, it is to be recognised that central universities differ widely in terms of resources, history, accessibility, ready availability of competent academic and administrative personnel. The HRD ministry should make special provisions for new central universities."""

Bollywood actor Ashutosh Rana has backed Naseeruddin Shah's recent comment on Bulandshahr violence. Speaking on the ongoing controversy surrounding Shah's comment, Rana stated that everyone has a right to share their thoughts.

""Everyone has the right to share his/her views. If someone speaks his mind in the country, does that mean there should be a social trial? We should seriously listen to him/her instead,"" Rana said.

""If someone is speaking his mind and there is a debate, will it improve the country's economic situation,"" he said.

Rana's remarks came two days after veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah's statement on mob violence in the country triggered a controversy.

Actor Naseeruddin Shah had on Friday said that at many places, the death of a cow is being given more importance than the killing of a policeman.

Shah said ""poison"" has spread in the Indian society where at some places, the death of a cow is given more significance than of a police officer, an indirect reference to the recent Bulandshahr violence where a police officer was killed allegedly by cow vigilantes.

The actor raised concerns about the safety of his children who, he said, do not follow any specific religion.

""I had received regional education as a child. Ratna is from a liberal household, so she had next to none. And we chose not to give any religious education to our children. Because I believe that being good or evil has nothing to do with religion.

The veteran actor also expressed anxiety over the well-being of his children, who he said have not been brought up as followers of any particular religion.

""We taught them what our beliefs are. I did make them learn a few verses from the Quran Sharif because I believe reciting them improves one's articulation, Just like one's Hindi articulation improves after reading the Ramayana and Mahabharata in its original (form),"" he said.

Elaborating on why he feels anxious about his children, Naseeruddin said: ""Because tomorrow if a mob surrounds them, and asks, 'are you a Hindu or a Muslim?'... They will have no answer. It worries me because I don't see the situation improving anytime soon.

""These matters don't scare me. They make me angry. And I want that every right-thinking person should feel angry, not scared. This is our home, who can dare to evict us from here?"" he asked.

Shah's statement on mob violence triggered a massive controversy across the country.

Recently, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) released an order on the same lines and directed states to implement it.

Parents said that implementation has always been a problem in the state and added that the state rule or the one passed by the MHRD will not make any impact.

""My sons are studying in class 3 and class 5 in a private school in the city and they are still carrying bags which weigh no less than 8kgs.

There is no way he can carry the load."" Parents said that students also have to carry extra weight in the form of skates, yoga mats among other things to pursues cocurricular activities.

Education department officials, on the other hand, have clarified their position. They said that they are conducting random checks to make sure that schools are following the guidelines.

The angry rebuttal by the Hyderabad MP came after the Pakistan Prime Minister referred to a statement on mob violence by critically-acclaimed actor Naseeruddin Shah, alleging that the members of the minority community were unsafe in India and were not being treated as equal citizens.

Imran Khan had also said that his government would ""show"" the Narendra Modi government in India ""how to treat minorities"" and make them feel safe in their country.

The row was triggered with Naseeruddin Shah alleging that some people in the country had complete independence for taking law into their own hands. In a video message on YouTube, the critically-acclaimed actor said that the death of a cow was being given more importance than the death of a police officer in some areas.

""I feel worried thinking about my children because they have not received any religious education. We chose not to give any religious education to our children because I believe that good or evil has nothing to do with religion,"" the actor had said.

Reacting to his statement, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had asserted that India is the most tolerant nation in the world.

""You will not find the kind of tolerance anywhere in the world which we have in our country. India is the most tolerant country,"" the Union Home Minister had said.

""There are 72 sects in Islam, all of them are found here, not even the Islamic countries have all. There's no question of intolerance in the country,"" he had added."

Even the giant teddy bear at the mall entrance wasn't spared, said Ma Jun, who works at a tutoring company in the building.

""Everything is gone and cleaned,"" she said.

Christmas continues to be a shopping festival across most of China, with huge trees adorning shopping malls in Shanghai and Beijing, but a growing emphasis on traditional culture by the ruling Communist Party and the systematic suppression of religion under President Xi Jinping are imperiling Santa Claus's position.

At least four Chinese cities and one county have ordered restrictions on Christmas celebrations this year, according to official notices and interviews. Students, teachers and parents from 10 schools around China said Christmas celebrations have been curtailed.

""The ongoing local reaction against Christmas is part of the wider sentiment since Xi took power,"" said Zi Yang, a China expert at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

Xi is trying to broaden the appeal of the Communist Party by casting it as a crusader for Chinese tradition in a fast-changing world, he said. ""Therefore, foreign cultural elements such as Christmas are placed on the chopping block.""

The seasonal humbug follows similar outbreaks of anti-Christmas rhetoric in 2014 and 2017. It appears not to be centrally organised, but rather a spreading resistance to foreign festivals by local authorities seeking to align themselves with the growing tide of cultural nationalism.

The squeeze on Christmas is an example of how efforts to ""normalise"" thinking bleed into the everyday lives of many Chinese. That push exploded into view this year through re-education camps for Uighur Muslims and a crackdown on Christian churches that has continued with force in recent weeks.

In Nanyang, about 950 kilometers (600 miles) west of Shanghai, government officials stopped by the office and shopping complex on 16 December to say that Christmas decorations would have to come down, said Ma, the tutoring company employee.

An official from the city's urban management bureau hung up when asked for comment.

Nine hours by car south, Hengyang, a city in Hunan province, said in a 19 December notice posted on an official government social media account that anyone caught holding Christmas sales or celebrations that blocked the streets would be punished. Communist Party members, the notice said, should avoid foreign festivals and instead be ""models of adherence to Chinese traditional culture."" Hengyang police posted a video on their official social media account of locals discussing the importance of Chinese culture and plans to avoid ostentatious Christmas celebrations.

Langfang city, just south of Beijing, banned Christmas stage performances and merchandising promotions, according to a notice circulated on social media.

Shop windows were to be stripped of Christmas stickers and streets kept free of Christmas banners and lights. Law enforcement patrols were to be stepped up 23-25 December to prevent illegal signs of celebration.

The Langfang urban management bureau declined comment. The state-run Global Times newspaper argued that Western media are exaggerating China's crackdown on Christmas and reported that the restrictions in Langfang were aimed not at Christmas but at cleaning up roadside stalls and migrant vendors in hopes of winning a ""National Civilized City"" award from the Communist Party.

Some 270 kilometers (167 miles) west, Fuping county, also in Hebei province, issued a similar clean-up notice. Though the 21 December announcement mentions Christmas eleven times, an official from the Fuping urban management bureau said the rules were aimed at street vendors generally, not Christmas.

Police in the Panlong district of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province in southern China, circulated a notice that hotels, karaoke parlors, internet cafes, bars and other crowded places must prohibit Christmas-related decorations and activities.

""It is forbidden to hang Christmas stockings, wear Christmas hats, place Christmas trees, and so on,"" the notice read.

It wasn't clear if the notice applied to all of Kunming city, though a police officer told the AP that the order to circulate it came from city officials.

Reverend Jonathan Liu, founder of the Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, a California nonprofit, said the pushback against Christmas reflects Xi's efforts to ""Sinicize"" religion.

Preachers are coached on how to convey Communist Party core values in their sermons and national flags and songs have been injected into some church services, he said.

Liu provided the AP with a notice sent to churches in Zhoukou, a city to the east of Nanyang in Henan province.

It tells churches to vet Christmas plans with the government, forbids minors from participating in Christmas events and caps expenses at 2000 yuan ($290). ""I wish you all a happy Christmas! God bless you,"" read the notice, which Liu received from a pastor in China.

An official at the United Front Work Department in Zhoukou referred queries to the religious affairs bureau, which could not be reached for comment.

Before becoming president, Xi went to Finland in 2010 and was photographed with Santa Claus. That kind of chumminess appears to be a thing of Christmas past, experts say.

The central government issued guidelines last year for a cultural revival project that calls for a marked boost in the international influence of Chinese traditional culture by 2025.

""You have a culturally conservative ethos in the country that has definitely been encouraged by the central party-state,"" said Guo Yingjie, a professor of Chinese studies at the University of Sydney. ""It's not hard for university presidents or officials to say, 'OK celebrating Christmas can easily be seen as de-Sinification or promoting Western culture.'""

Students have taken to social media to complain about restrictions on Christmas celebrations at their schools.

At a top Shanghai university, a student union had its Christmas plans cancelled for the first time, an organizer told the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing rebuke.

The students came up with a solution: By replacing ""Christmas"" with ""New Year's"" in their activity proposal and changing the date from 25 December, it sailed past school administrators.

Students in the city of Qingdao were reprimanded for hosting an event about gratitude on Thanksgiving Day and warned not to celebrate Christmas publicly, according to a student, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution.

Liu Kaiming, president of the Institute of Contemporary Observation, a civil society group in the city of Shenzhen, said that despite the drumbeat of official discontent, Christmas cheer continues to spread in China.

""The sound of resistance is more powerful on the surface, but it has no practical effect,"" he said. ""Young people's enthusiasm for the festival is ever-increasing.""

The administrative work of the school is managed by a teacher as it doesn't have a principal. The former principal passed away in 2017 and no appointment was made since then.

This is one among several schools in the state that are struggling without basic necessities.

State education minister Arvind Pandey has been pushing for better facilities for students in government schools, but they are still a distant dream for many schools in the state.

According to the education department data for 2017-2018, out of 1,412 schools in Dehradun, 649 schools do not have a playground, 329 schools do not have ramp facilities or boundary walls, and fencing is missing in 117 schools.

Sunita Rawat, the teacher in charge of the primary school in Raipur, said: ""We got ~50,000 from the department this month and we will use it to repair the floors and toilets. We never had furniture in the school and students have been sitting on mats only.""

She also added that even the neighbouring schools don't have such facilities and they ""never asked the department especially for furniture"".

Another teacher said on condition of anonymity: ""We requested the department to release funds for repairing the boundary wall many times as it is a worry if any child sneaks out through the broken part of the wall.""

SB Joshi, chief education officer of Dehradun, said: ""There are over 1,000 schools in the district and we are trying to provide furniture to all. Till then, jute mats and carpets are provided for students to sit on.""

The department of school education sanctioned Rs 10 crore in November to all 13 districts for buying furniture for government schools.

INOX Air Products, one of the largest manufacturers of Industrial gases in India with 36 plants spread across the country, will work with Mrida for sustainable and holistic development of selected villages and hamlets in Bokaro District of Jharkhand. The project is called ""Udaan, the Wings of Transformation"" and is focusing on bringing about a developmental change in the villages.

As a part of their CSR initiatives, INOX Air Products has started to focus on holistic rural development and initially taken up 2 villages (Jharnamuri and Bajudih) for their campaign. These are around 19 kms from Bokaro Steel Plant, where INOXAP has its on-site liquid production unit. These initiatives will be undertaken for a period of 34 months and began from June 2018.

""Since the rural areas are often the most in need of development, INOXAP decided to focus on them. We were on the lookout for a partner who could help us positively impact the lives of these communities and work closely with them for their social and economic welfare. We firmly believe that our program with Mrida will help better thelives of the people in these areas and that together we can make them a powerful and empowered community"", says Mr. Surendra Choudhary, Chief Financial Officer, INOX Air Products Pvt.

Mrida is closely working with INOXAP partner villages and projects undertaken include any and every activity that will impact the lives of residents of these rural hamlets/villages and help propel them on the path to development. These include agri-inputs,education, sanitation, energy access, clean water supply, healthcare and hygiene initiatives, livelihood generation activities to begin with and the scope of activities will be modified as the project progresses.

""As a concerned corporate citizen, INOXAP had been committing valuable resources to ensure that the communities in and around their plants benefit from their initiatives. We will work together to ensure that a positive, measurable, scalable and sustainable Impact is created on the lives of the people, in the areas that we operate in. Mrida believes in holistic development and with INOXAP's way of thinking there is a huge synergy in what can be done. We are hopeful and our work will speak for itself in a short time"", says Mr Arun Nagpal, Co-Founder and CEO, Mrida Group.

INOXAP through Mrida has already undertaken the following for the Villages in Bokaro:

Community mobilization was the pre-requisite for sustainable development initiative at these villages. The buy in from people would only come about after they were directly involved in the decision making process. Today, villagers are a part of a Village Development Committee and take decisions about the developmentinitiatives directly in consultation with the Mrida Team.

Existing Solar LED Street Light network has been strengthened by repairing existing lights and installing new ones as per need, so that the safety and security of those in these areas can be reinforced. 100% coverage has already been achieved in both villages.

Since safety and health of the villagers is one of the main concerns, availability of clean drinking water to the households becomes very important. As a result,Solar Powered pumping and purification system plant has been installed in Jharnamuri village on a community-based model where villagers pay Rs. 20 per month from each household to the Village Development Committee for availing the services. The money thus collected is utilized for the upkeep of the systemover time and makes the intervention self-sustainable. A water purificationsystem has been installed in the Govt. Middle School for the school students. The Pipeline work for water to school toilets has also been completed.

Creating sustainable and scalable livelihood generation opportunities including encouraging micro entrepreneurship and all-round community engagement will be another area of operation. 2 Stitching centres have already been established and training program initiated for 32 students across 2 villages. Incense Sticks value addition and marketing training imparted for 30 women and local linkages being created: Business already flowing in for them.

It is planned that the following will be also focused on in the next phase:

Setting up of Solar Powered E-Hubs to provide education, entertainment and E-Commerce facilities.

These are predominantly agrarian communities and the farmers are still using traditional methods of cultivation. An in-depth agri-input program focused on bettering yields and focused on high value crops will be undertaken to improve productivity and income levels of the farmers.

Working closely with the existing state-aided primary schools to ensure that more and more children can benefit from the education imparted.

Health and Nutrition related initiatives: This will start with the health baseline survey of the villagers through medical/health camps and based on the results of the survey, subsequent interventions to improve on the basic health index would be undertaken.

Installation of Solar Water Pumping & Purification system in Village Bajudih on similar lines.

Strengthening local leadership at the Village level in the form of Village Development Committees (VDCs) to play an active role in the entire initiative. The idea is for the VDC to eventually take over ongoing activities with minimal involvement of the INOX and Mrida."

""We need a second independence movement. We have to clear the cobwebs in our own brain first,"" says Salil Shetty, former secretary-general of Amnesty International and previously director of the United Nations Millennium Campaign.

Back in India after spending most of the year as a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School, Shetty was in Mumbai last week to speak at IIT Bombay's Techfest on technology and freedoms for India's poor.

A graduate from the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad and the London School of Economics, Shetty is a human rights campaigner with decades of experience.

In conversation with Rediff.com's Archana Masih, he discusses the anti-human rights discourse in the country and his plan to start a movement with India's youth, independent of religion or politics.

What have been the glaring examples of human rights violations in the last few years?

Encounter killings, lynchings, attack on civil society, silencing of the media, attempts to compromise the judiciary etc.

The thing we don't talk about is the highly discriminatory and ineffective criminal justice system.

Half a million people are in prison and 70% on detention without trial -- mostly Dalits, minorities. Two thirds are petty offenders.

It is a well known fact that even if you are not a criminal if you spend long years in jail you come out being one.

Rich people don't spend time in prison. The poor, low castes don't have money to pay for bail.

How has the State failed in protecting citizen rights?

The State's job is to protect people's human rights. Perpetrators in India are individuals, government, religious bodies and corporations.

Extractive corporations are worst because they function in the tribal belt. Greenpeace is constantly under attack in India because they raise their voice in the tribal belt.

If Greenpeace is attacked they fight back, but what when a Dalit or Muslim is attacked?

What are the challenges that human rights activists encounter that they did not face before?

The last few years has been exceptionally hard for human rights activists.

They are creating an anti-human rights discourse. The idea is to sow a seed of suspicion or doubt in those who are neutral.

We are in a desperate situation that need desperate measures. You have to campaign for the values you stand for and make people think hard before they cast their vote.

The killing of a police officer showed the impunity with which a mob could kill an officer of the law.

The Bulandshahr killing was exceptional. The killing of a police officer by Hindu fundamentalists which is in line with the current government's approach towards hypernationalism.

Hindutva politics is not new in this country, but these people have taken it to a different level.

The country needs urgent attention on more serious things -- education, health and water. The farmers, the poor in this country, are in a crisis and so much energy is going into all this.

Lynching is a major assault on human rights. How do you explain this phenomena because it is not only about the cow, but people have been lynched because they have been thought to be child lifters?

Once you open this can, then you lose control over it.

In UP over 1,000 encounter killings have taken place in nine months after Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Ajay Singh Bisht aka Yogi Adityanath) took over, which include 32 deaths.

If you ask people on the street they would probably say that something needed to be done as people are getting away with all sorts of crimes, so basically this leads to normalising such killings and actually makes it acceptable.

In a country that claims to be a democracy one has to follows due process even if that person has committed a crime.

People have lost faith in the mainstream system and are looking for shortcuts.

A couple of weeks after Human Rights Day, how do you see the situation in India today?

I left India in 1995. Twenty three years later what has changed and not can be classified into two -- freedom from want and freedom from fear.

Human rights is not one or the other. Often, people think of human rights as civil-political rights. There have been many important achievements and we shouldn't belittle them -- reduction in poverty, enrollment of girls.

Even on freedom from want, much as we have achieved, we are yet so far behind on global indices.

On the human development index, the most important human metric, when I left we were 139, we are still in the 130s out of 170, 180, in spite of this so-called macro economic growth.

Unfortunately, the trickle down logic has never worked in this country.

On the civil-political side -- I was in school when the Emergency was declared under Indira Gandhi. That was the fight of a lifetime. We thought we had won back all those freedoms.

It is the first time since then that we are seeing a flashback of that kind of behaviour.

Critics of that belief say you can freely criticise the PM which you could not do during the Emergency.

If we took the benchmark we can take away 1 or 2 differences, but there are far too many similarities. I hope we don't have to use 1975, 1976 as a benchmark!

The ambience is that you are not allowed to dissent in this country.

There is a systematic onslaught of trying to reframe what this country is about.

Has the human rights movement in India been marginalised? Are organisations not pushing hard enough like PUCL, PUDR did in the past?

It is being done systematically. India has never had a strong human rights NGO movement. It has had a few important ones. Each and every one has been under attack. They have managed to silence a lot of them.

I don't think human rights groups are not pushing for the cause of human rights, but they are small and weak to start with and have become even more smaller and weaker.

Anti-human rights narrative is much more mainstream, it is partly also global thanks to Trump.

Has the narrative of aggressive nationalism created a climate of hostility towards activists?

The mythology of ultra nationalism is that the only way they can create a Hindu identity is from a vote bank perspective. The only way to shore up your side is by having 'the other' who you can show as 'the other'.

Human rights organisations are a scapegoat to show that they are anti nationals and we are national -- and it seems to be working perfectly.

The question is: Can they sustain it?

You can't sustain a campaign of hate. You can't go on creating division and rhetoric of hate. It comes to roost. We are seeing the first glimpses of that in the state elections.

And it is not only about Hindutva. The violence against women -- rapes -- there are over 100 rapes a day of which more than one quarter are minors. The shocking part is that only one out of four cases lead to convictions.

What is the solution?

We need a second independence movement. A lot of independence is in our head. We have to clear the cobwebs in our own brain first.

There are people who are extreme right wing Hindutva and there are others who believe in the values of the Constitution, but there is a massive number in the middle that is totally confused, who can be pushed this way or that.

These are young, mostly educated, mostly unemployed and have a lot of frustration, anger so they are being pushed this way or that.

We have to work with them. It is a crucial moment for a pan India youth movement which is not political or religious -- for saving India.

How can ordinary Indians be more vocal about assaults on human rights? The Congress has also been silent on human rights violations.

Electoral politics can deliver only so much on fundamental, cultural and social change. It has to be an independent movement which has to attack frontally.

This country needs a youth movement not based on religion or politics but based on the ground of saving India.

What are the dangers to India's future by the attacks on minority human rights?

There are 200 million plus Muslims in India, the second largest Muslim country after Indonesia.

If you start attacking them through the NRC (the National Register of Citizens of India), lynchings, through commando TV channels, it is playing with fire.

What are your thoughts on the MeToo movement in India?

The status of women in India is a serious concern. I am delighted they are speaking up and all power to them. This is the tip of the iceberg. I don't know of a single woman who has not experienced this in India.

In the West it is 1/3rd of the women, here it is 100% who face sexual abuse. Imagine a MeToo movement of domestic workers -- if women start speaking up they will shake up the foundations of the country.

You can't let the State go scot-free in MeToo. It is also the State's responsibility to safeguard women.

No State can function if society and religion is sanctifying the women as second class."

Marques, 32, is a business and research analyst with a global accounting firm, and like many in corporate India, has a demanding work schedule. He ensures taking time off periodically to recharge, a resolve that does not always resonate with other working professionals. ""A few years ago, one of my seniors mentioned that no one in a team should take more than a week's leave since 'It looks bad,'"" says Marques.

Perhaps this is the reason why 75% Indians feel vacation deprived, according to the Expedia Vacation Deprivation Survey 2018, an annual report of global vacation habits . The online survey was carried out across 19 countries in September 2018 among 11,144 employed adults aged 18 and above, with Indians topping the list as the most vacation deprived. The report found a variety of reasons why Indians do not take vacations. These include the fear of missing out on important decisions; appearing less committed about their careers; heavy workload; and the quality of holidays being compromised by colleagues, who expected them to be available even while away. The results, more importantly, suggest that personal time is still undervalued here.

Personal time vs vacation

""I do feel vacation deprived, even though I have a supportive supervisor,"" says Deborah Paul, 45, a communications consultant with an international development agency. ""However, with my work load, it gets challenging to take more than one long break in a year. Now, I have started taking mini-breaks. I use long weekends combined with a day or two of leave for some 'me' time.""

While Neha (who uses only her first name), 37, category marketing head at an FMCG company, doesn't necessarily feel vacation deprived, she is not surprised with the survey results as her emphasis on personal time is not always echoed by co-workers. ""Vacation is not a priority with most people I have interacted with professionally or personally. I am not sure why this happens though.""

Even though there is more awareness on stress management, work-life balance and taking breaks, people are unable to switch off. Sanjay Gopinath, chief human resource officer, FMC Corporation, a global company in the crop protection segment, feels that many professionals continue to equate long hours with productivity. ""People are not necessarily working smart, though they may be putting in long hours,"" he says, adding that this may be the reason they hesitate to ask for leave.

Interestingly, the report finds more companies encouraging employees to take time off, but employees still seem unconvinced about this. Swati Nagpaul, senior HR consultant at a French multinational company, finds many organizations merely paying lip service to the concept of advocating work-life balance. They may be allowing employees to take leave, but do not have policies that support them while they are away. ""I work with a French company and work-life balance is extremely important in their culture. An official backup is always assigned, regardless of your position or duration of your leave, to deal with any work while you are away. I am not sure how many companies in India have these kinds of policies,"" she asks.

Though companies have their role to play in making leave-taking easier, individuals should set boundaries and find their own balance too. ""I differed with my boss and remember telling him how higher-ups at the overseas branches take two week vacations,"" says Marques.

Working smart

Sameer Guha, 37, general counsel for India and South Asia, Mars International, a global FMCG company, prefers putting in some work when on holiday in order to avoid an avalanche on his return. But he calls this working smart, and not in any way taking away from his personal time. ""Vacations are about moments and experiences. If work is distracting us from these moments, then we're doing something wrong. If you have to, put in time early in the mornings or late at night, or on a flight,"" he says. However, to avoid this being interpreted by colleagues as an invitation to disturb you, it is important to clearly communicate boundaries. ""As I grow in my career, it is becoming harder to switch off completely,"" says Neha. ""I don't mind the compromise of having to keep some time for work when I'm on a long leave but I do make it clear to colleagues that I will be available only for two specific hours. Otherwise, I should be called only if something unexpected needs urgent attention.""

Gopinath feels that the pressure will not abate until top management personally demonstrates this balance. ""If the leaders set an example, then the others will follow the pattern,"" he says.

Along with continuous education for all employees on the importance of personal time and its impact on productivity and well-being, Nagpaul feels organizations need to develop policies that genuinely support an employee's time away. ""Introducing different kinds of leave like paternal and bereavement leave is helpful,"" she says, ""Many employees take annual leave for this and are back in two-three days after a death in the family. People need to be able to grieve,"" she adds.

With exposure to varied international work cultures; organizational policies that genuinely support work-life balance; and individual self-discipline, a gradual cultural shift is possible. Companies will play a part, but individuals need to find their own equilibrium.

Work-life balance: A global view

■ France's ""right to disconnect"" law grants employees the legal right to ignore work emails outside of typical working hours.

■ The Netherlands has one of the shortest work weeks globally -- 30 hours per week.

■ Many Japanese companies encourage employees to exercise together, collectively doing Radio Taiso, a 15-minute exercise regimen, in the morning to reduce stress and boost morale.

■ Taiwanese professionals have historically prioritized their employers, viewing requests for time off as rude. To emphasize the importance of family time, a law was put in place in January 2017 that gives employees two days off per week."

(PTI)

The newly formed Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh may not have adequate fiscal space or funds left to implement other poll promises in the current financial year after announcing farm loan waivers, according to officials in the three states. The outgoing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments in the three states have spent up to 70% of the funds allocated in the last budget in the first seven months of this financial year, which will end on March 31.

Madhya and Chhattisgarh announced the waiver on Monday last. Rajasthan followed suit two days in line with Congress chief Rahul Gandhi's poll promise of waiving farm loans of up to Rs two lakh within 10 days of forming the governments in three states.

Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan waived all short-term crop loans while the Chhattisgarh government will pay for loans farmers have taken from the state's Gramin Bank. The waivers will cost between Rs 35,000 to Rs 38,000 crore in Madhya Pradesh, Rs 18,000 crore in Rajasthan and Rs 6,100 crore in Chhattisgarh.

Officials said market borrowing was among the options the governments were exploring. ""We are working out the modalities,"" said a Madhya Pradesh finance department official.

Officials cited the limited fiscal space and said it will be difficult to implement other major poll promises in the current financial year. Budgets in the three states will be presented in February-March next year, months before the national polls due in April-May 2019.

The other promises include unemployment allowances of Rs 10,000 and Rs 3,500 each to a member of a family in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The Congress has also pledged a stipend of an unspecified amount in Chhattisgarh.

It has also promised power bills' waiver for the poor and reduction in electricity tariffs by half for others. The other pledges range from free education and medicines to increasing minimum support price for farm produce in the three states.

In Chhattisgarh, the party has also promised liquor prohibition that, too, will lead to revenue losses.

Officials said the outgoing BJP governments have spent between 50% to 70% of funds allocated in the last budget.

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath and his Rajasthan counterpart, Ashok Gehlot, have blamed the previous BJP governments for emptying the coffers and have said that they will look for new avenues to generate revenue.

The BJP has maintained there was enough money if the new governments wanted to implement their poll promises.

In Madhya Pradesh, the farm loan waiver burden would be about one-fifth of the total expenditure of Rs 1,86,683 crore for 2018-19, of which around Rs 1,25,000 crore has been spent till October end.

Officials pointed out the previous government has availed 90% of the borrowing capacity of Rs 60,000 crore to fund sops before the polls.

Madhya Pradesh's principal secretary (agriculture), Rajesh Rajora, said most money provided for different schemes in the budget has been spent. ""We are looking at different options to fund the farm loan waiver,"" he said

In Rajasthan, the farm loan waiver burden would be around one-sixth of the total budget of Rs 1,07,865 crore, of which about Rs 77,000 crore has been spent.

University of Rajasthan's economics professor, V V Singh, said around 25% of the budget will be spent on meeting these poll promises.

He added any additional spending will result in an increase in the fiscal deficit, which is 3.01% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).

Gehlot on Tuesday insisted his government has a borrowing capacity of Rs 36,000 crore as per the present budget. T

he state has already taken over Rs 25,000 crore loan. Gehlot admitted to the fiscal constraints.

The state's outstanding liabilities are 27.57% of its GSDP, which is above the 25% limit the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act has set.

Rajasthan finance commission's former chairperson, Jyoti Kiran Shukla, called the implications of the waiver announcements on the state budget huge. Shukla said the state has to determine what revenue base it will generate to meet these expenditures.

In Chhattisgarh, the farm loan waiver and increasing the minimum support price of paddy and maize to Rs 2,500 per quintal would take away one-tenth of the state's budget of Rs 83,179 crore.

A Chhattisgarh finance department officer hoped they would be able to implement the promises without breaching the fiscal deficit target.

""Some promises may find reflection in the next budget. The political leadership will take the decision.""

He added implementing prohibition in the current financial year will be impossible as it needs a new legal framework like in Gujarat and Bihar.

Economists have spoken against the farm loan waivers saying they will increase non-performing banking assets. State Bank of India's group chief economic advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh estimates the collective burden will range from Rs Rs 60,000 crore to Rs 70,000 if the election-bound states, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Haryana, in 2019 decide to waive farm loans."

Speaking at an event at a medical college in Lucknow, Singh said, ""I don't think the tolerance that exists in India can be found anywhere else in the world.""

He further went on to say that the diversity in India is what makes it a prosperous nation. ""India is the only country in the world where people from various prominent religions co-exist peacefully... They have contributed to making India empowered, self-reliant and prosperous and will continue to do so,"" Singh said.

In a video interview earlier this week, Shah apparently referred to the incident in Bulandshahr where violence erupted over the allegations of cow slaughter, leading to the death of a police officer and a civilian in the riots. ""We have already witnessed that the death of a cow has more significance (in today's India) than that of a police officer,"" he had said in the interview. ""Are the lives of Muslims less valuable than the life of a cow?""

He added that said that ""poison"" has spread in the Indian society and it will be very difficult to ""capture this djinn back into the bottle""."

The script is now nauseatingly familiar. A prominent public figure expresses his disquiet about the growing intolerance in India. All hell immediately breaks loose. Polite commentary labels him a Congress stooge or challenges him to prove his patriotism equating Modi with the idea of Indian nationhood; the excitable immediately warn of that well trodden threat of shipping him across the western borders.

True to form, India's cacophony of news channels organised platitudinous debates where all extremist voices were amplified. One particularly enterprising network even managed to assemble members of Mr. Shah's extended family as they have some special insight on his comments!

Lost amidst this din is the actual import of the original comments. There is nothing which Mr. Shah said which was particularly exceptional or surprising. Let's look at the extant case. A mob assembled and led by local Bajrang Dal sympathisers -- euphemistically known as the sword arm of the ruling BJP -- -ambushed a police officer in Bulandshahar. Three weeks later, under the watch of a chief minister touted by BJP sympathisers as 'no nonsense' and tough on crime, the prime accused have still managed to evade arrest. The UP police which has been accused of stage managing encounters appears helpless in catching those credibly accused of killing one of their own. The rabble rousing UP chief minister has made it amply clear to anyone paying attention that he views the cow slaughter which allegedly provoked the incident as a much higher priority. The local BJP leaders including elected MLAs have been even more forthright: repeatedly equating the life of a cow with that of human life. And despite all attempts at obfuscation by the usual suspects, there is little doubt that this is part of a larger pattern: the cow which is venerated by large sections of the Hindu population has been cynically used to encourage religious cleavages and often to openly justify mob violence.

Therefore, Mr. Shah is entirely correct in his argument that a cow is being placed at a higher pedestal than that of a slain police officer. That this otherwise anodyne point is somehow controversial vividly illustrates the distance India has traveled in the last few years. The only amusing aspect of this entire sordid tale is the immense sensitivity of those who have encouraged this climate of insouciance and impunity to any criticism of the natural denouement of their rhetoric and actions.

But here's what makes Mr. Shah a tremendously tragic figure in Modi's India. He is not only being criticised and ridiculed by one aspect of the political spectrum but the opposite as well. His simple argument that his children have had no particular religious education in a very liberal household is taken as a convenient rejection of his faith to curry favor with the prevailing majoritarian climate. Mr. Shah's heartfelt lament that his children, if accosted by a murderous mob, would be hard pressed to reveal their religion is dismissed as a convenient fig leaf and not a genuine discomfort with faith itself. You are either a fully practicing Muslim or someone who has no business voicing 'Muslim' concerns: a right which is exclusively available to those who embrace all aspects of the faith. Even though Mr. Shah spoke as a concerned Indian and not as a Muslim.

Mr. Shah is too Muslim for the Hindu Right and not enough of a Muslim for their ideological counterparts. This is a space sadly familiar to those who may identify themselves as cultural Hindus or heavens forbid as liberals with a Hindu name. They have apparently lost all right to comment upon Hindu issues as they may reject the visible trappings of their faith. And yet, unless they are prepared to label Hinduism as the greatest affliction in the history of humanity, they are viewed suspiciously by the other side as well. They are either deracinated fifth columnists or subtle enablers, and not citizens deeply invested in the idea of a pluralistic India. In India's polarised politics, they are caught in the no man's land. That the rejection of extremist positions can be a considered choice and not necessarily a cop out is an argument which is increasingly impossible to make. Mr. Shah is the latest victim of the same discourse; he just happens to carry a Muslim name.

This rejection of the middle liberal space has dangerous portends for India. The liberals may have been insignificant in India's raucous electoral democracy; yet, they carried the aspirations of a more hopeful future. Reducing them to their identities despite all their protestations is another marker of the rise of a more illiberal India. For one of the most diverse countries in the world, that is surely not a sign of a more sanguine and successful future.

In his eponymous character in Saeed Akhtar Mirza's 'Albert Pinto ko guess kyon aata hai', Mr. Shah plays an increasingly disillusioned and angry motor mechanic raging against the system and the unfairness it enables. Why are we not more angry he asks in his latest intervention; one can only hope that his renewed outrage is not the last vestiges of a more liberal India but a flame which can still burn bright."

Mr Kher stated, ""There's so much freedom in the country that you can abuse the army, badmouth the air chief and pelt stones at soldiers. How much more freedom do you need in a country? He (Mr Shah) said what he felt like; it doesn't mean it's the truth.""

Mr Shah (68), while criticising mob violence in the country, had said that he chose not to give religious education to his children.

New York - [Dec 21, 2018] - As the industry trade body focused on architecting the future of marketing, the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA), today announced the formation of the first-ever brand-led ""Future of Mobile Fraud Council"".

The mission of the Council is to help marketers stay ahead of mobile marketing fraud by empowering marketers to assess their exposure to fraud, combat fraud with the right tools and education and finally improve their ability to track the impact of these efforts using collaboratively developed best practices. The initiative will be co-chaired by Kevin Frisch, former marketing executive at Uber and now CMO at Wag Labs, Inc and Terri Schriver, SVP Enterprise Media, Bank of America.

As a prelude to the creation of the council, the MMA conducted an initial benchmarking survey to identify global trends when it comes to how marketers are currently reducing fraud, their expectations and strategic plans about the future, as well as their own evaluation of the effectiveness of these practices.

Preliminary top line results of the study suggest that 84% of marketers expect mobile ad fraud to continue being a significant problem. Over 60% think it will increase in the future, partly because their individual efforts can´t address the fundamental drivers of mobile fraud - strong incentives for perpetrators, lack of penalties and overall complexity of the mobile ad ecosystem. The survey also suggests that marketers will continue to drive the need for more transparency and invest in third party solutions to help reduce fraud in their media spend. Currently, about 1 out of 2 marketers currently claim to use a specific third party solution to detect, monitor and prevent fraud, although most appear somewhat unclear about the effectiveness of these solutions. In fact, 7 out of 10 say their vendor only partly addresses the problem and while 60% of them tend to be ""somewhat"" satisfied, they are less likely to recommend these solutions which results in an average Net Promotor Score (NPS) of minus 18.

""As we are committed to building the strongest and most transparent communications platform, it is critical that as an industry we both bring transparency to the issues that surround fraud in the mobile marketing ecosystem as well as develop best practices and guidance for marketers to protect their media investment,"" said Greg Stuart, CEO, Mobile Marketing Association. ""We applaud the marketers for coming together to collaboratively drive against finding solutions and ways to measure their own efforts.""

The MMA plans to release a detailed report of the findings in January of what will be the first wave of an annual tracking survey about the state of Fraud, with detailed findings by region (NA, EMEA, LATAM, APAC).

Companies who have already joined the Council include 1-800-Flowers, Ahold Delhaize, Amex, Bank of America, Calvin Klein, Campbell's, Coca-Cola, CVS, Discover, Etrade, Ford, GM, GSK, Hallmark, Marriott, Miller, Monster, Samsung, Universal Orlando, Uber. The Future of Mobile Fraud Council will convene its first meeting on 1/24. Marketers who are interested to participate in the Council are welcomed to reach out to fraudcouncil@mmaglobal.com.

Hari Osofsky, dean of Penn State Law and the Penn State School of International Affairs, is chairing the search committee.

Barbara Korner, who has led the college since 2007, announced in March that she will retire as dean on June 30, 2019.

""Our College of Arts and Architecture has grown substantially in the past decade, with a robust community of faculty and students engaged in several highly acclaimed degree programs,"" said Nick Jones, Penn State's executive vice president and provost. ""We expect the college's next dean will build on its many successes and further support our strategic priority to advance the arts and humanities across the University.""

The bus had fallen into the gorge while taking a sharp turn on the hilly road on Saturday. Police investigation revealed that 97 people were travelling in the bus, which had seating capacity for 50 only. They were on a tour organized by a tuition class of Amroli area. Besides the students and teachers of the tuition class, family members of a few students had also joined the tour. The accident happened when the bus was returning to the city from Dang.

All the victims were from the Diamond City's Amroli area. Soon after the bodies arrived, a few families cremated them in the morning hours. A large number of people took part in the funeral.

At least, 65 of the 97 passengers were given treatment at Ahwa Civil Hospital in Dang and many were discharged. Later, 36 injured were shifted to New Civil Hospital (NCH) in the city. Of them, 29 are still under treatment with condition of three reported to be critical.

An offence was registered against Nita Patel, who runs Gurukrupa Classes, and bus driver Sanjay Mehta at Subir police station of Dang for causing death by negligence. Nita and her husband Bipin were seriously injured in the accident and have been shifted to Vadodara by their family members for further treatment. Mehta, who was also injured, is undergoing treatment in the city. Police have collected Mehta's blood samples for examination to find out if he was drunk.

""We carried out post mortem of the bodies at the earliest so that they could be handed over to the respective families soon. Health department teams had provided immediate treatment to patients and 22 with serious injuries were among those shifted to Surat,"" said Megha Mehta, chief district health officer, Dang.

""The rescue operation was over by early morning and the bodies of deceased persons were shifted to Surat in ambulances. Police will investigate what caused the accident,"" said Dang district collector B Kumar.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma visited NCH and met the injured patients and their family members. ""It is a serious crime to travel with 97 people in a bus which has capacity for 50 only,"" Chudasma said.

The state government has announced compensation of Rs2.50 lakh to families of each deceased and Rs1 lakh to each injured.

Chief minister Vijay Rupani visited the injured at NCH in the evening. ""We started the rescue operations immediately after the accident and required care is being given to those who were injured. Strict action will be taken against those responsible for the accident,"" Rupani said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on his official Twitter handle, ""The bus accident in Gujarat's Dang district is deeply anguishing. It is extremely sad that we lost young lives in the accident. My thoughts are with the bereaved families and I hope the injured recover at the earliest.""

Mr Kher stated, ""There's so much freedom in the country that you can abuse the army, badmouth the air chief and pelt stones at soldiers. How much more freedom do you need in a country? He (Mr Shah) said what he felt like; it doesn't mean it's the truth.""

Mr Shah (68), while criticising mob violence in the country, had said that he chose not to give religious education to his children.

""In many, areas we are witnessing that the death of a cow has more significance than that of a police officer. I feel anxious thinking about my children.

This unusual drive is part of the department's efforts to ensure that admissions in pre-primary classes cross the figure of one lakh students.

In past four days since the admissions began, over 25,000 children between ages 3 to 6 have been admitted in the pre-primary classes.

On Saturday, Secretary Education, Punjab, Krishan Kumar, along with the staff of Education Department visited homes in Mohali District area to make the parents aware about pre-primary classes being offered at government schools.

""It is quite unusual as hardly any senior officer would go door to door like Secretary, Education, who is one of the senior most officers of Punjab not only in Education Department but otherwise,"" said a teacher who accompanied the secretary along with several other staff members, adding that due to his efforts over several government schools in Punjab have already got a much better infrastructure.

The teacher added that by the end of this year over 4000 schools would be given the same facelift.

Those accompanying the Krishan Kumar carried a placard that read: ""Na koi fees, na koi basta, sarkari school sab ton sasta (no fee nor bag, government schools are the cheaper places to teach you wards), in their hands.

Ramankumar Gore Mandal (30) and Subhash Chauhan (35) were from Bihar, while Rajendra Nisad (40) was from Uttar Pradesh.

While the bodies were sent for post-mortem, their friends and relatives thronged the Siddharth Hospital premises. ""We want the contractor to take care of my brother-in-law's two young children and widow. He used to work hard here and send money to his family in Bhagalpul, Bihar.

Manju Sahani (40), Rajendra's sister, said, ""My brother had moved to Mumbai so he could support education of his daughters and the daily expenses of the family. We will not claim the body till the contractor is arrested,"" she said.

A total of 11 labourers were taken to Siddharth Hospital. Three of them were severely injured and one of them was shifted to R.N. Cooper Hospital where he is in ICU.

Sinu Vaddi (34) is the sole breadwinner of his family in Andhra Pradesh. Barely 20 minutes after he had started work at the building under repair in Motilal Nagar, it began to tremble.

""Mr. Vaddi was trying to run out when he was hit by the corner of a steel angle. He could only be saved in time because he was on the first floor,"" Parshu Vadar (27), his relative, said.

While Mr. Vaddi and his friend Munna Sheikh are stable, Manoj Rajavanshi sustained ziagomatic injury and rib fractures and was moved to Cooper on Sunday evening.

The Tiruvallur police are on the lookout for a government school headmaster after filing a case against him under the POCSO Act for sexually abusing girl students inside the school a few weeks ago.

The school is located in a village in the Uthukottai police station limits and has over 300 students, both boys and girls, studying in standards VI to X. Bhaskar was the headmaster of the school.

A few days ago, one of the students approached her teacher and complained that the headmaster was misbehaving with her. She was asked to report the same to her mother.

""The girl told her mother that she wanted to drop out of the school due to the headmaster's behaviour,"" said an official from the Social Defence Department.

A complaint about a similar incident in the school was received by the Child Helpline 1098. ""The district child protection unit officials went to the school and checked the suggestion box in the school. They found a complaint letter signed - all students,"" the official said.

With the help of the letter, the officials knew that the headmaster had misbehaved with the girls while they arranged the record books in the almirah. ""There is no separate room for the headmaster. A few cupboards serve as a partition between the classroom and the headmaster's cabin,"" he said.

A complaint was filed with the police on Saturday. ""This incident happened a few weeks ago, but the girls did not reveal it immediately out of fear. We registered an FIR and a search is on for the head master who is absconding,"" said a senior police officer.

Meanwhile, the School Education Department has suspended the headmaster.

An official with the department said that after they received a complaint from the district child protection unit, the education department officials conducted an inquiry and suspended the headmaster on Friday.

""He has been working in the school for the past two years. He came to the school on a promotion. This is the first such allegation against him,"" the official said."

There are many groups talking the human rights of the locals, but what about those of the armed forces? When people pelt stones at soldiers, are the soliders expected to just stand there and not defend themselves? The author seems to be supporting Pakistan's cause. - Vijay Srotiya

***

I have been reading articles on Scroll.in for the last couple of days and they seem to be unbiased, informative and vividly written. Some of the videos that show up on Facebook are also pretty interesting. Coming to Saiba Varma's article on Kashmir's pellet victims, I completely agree with the columnist, but she leaves a few questions unanswered.

The civilians of Kashmir should not suffer the way they are suffering, and pellet guns should not be used, but neither should soldiers be targetted by enraged groups who want to register their protest against the government or the system. The people of India are indifferent to the pictures of Kashmiris being hit by pellets or even to the photograph of Omran Daqneesh from the Syrian war, because they feel that it's not their problem to solve. Safety is important for our fellow countrymen in Kashmir but soldiers should not be made the punching bag of an angry mob. How do we ensure soldiers' safety? - Shayon Deb Roy

I fail to understand how stone pelting is related to anyone's status (""Among seven civilians killed in Kashmir, a cricket crazy teen, a commerce student, a young father""). This article's headline indicates to me that you have a soft corner for stone pelters and instead of writing about non-violence, this website is trying to garner sympathy for stone pelters. - C Patwal

***

As usual, Scroll.in is peddling a biased narrative. What author conveniently omitted is that these individuals were present in in anti-national crowds who were reportedly pelting stones on the troops. - Lokender Singh

***

Please stop supporting stone pelters. Those people who died were supporting militants killed in an operation carried out by the Indian Army. - Paresh Lodha

***

What were the young father and teenage cricket fan doing at the encounter protest site? You are not bothered about the soldiers who laid down their lives in the line of duty. We need an end to biased journalism. - Vivek Yadav

***

It is a sad moment. But we should not forget that they were part of a group pelting stones at the police, a group that was supporting militants. - Malkesh Koshti

***

Only in Kashmir do people oppose anti-terror operations. Why did they throw stones on Army men? Why did they need to enter such a danger zone? Let the Army concentrate on killing terrorists without any disturbance. Stop the propaganda. - Shivraj Udgirkar

***

I appreciate you for putting up stories of those who died during encounters today. Every civilian casualty is our loss. However, when was the last time a news publication highlighted stories of army men killed in counter-insurgency operations or cease fire violations? I request Scroll.in to bring out the other side of the story and give our men the they deserve. - Mukunda Murthi Rao

***

The army command of Pulwama has repeatedly asked people to urge youngsters to refrain from terrorist acts or not to support militants. A recent video showed an officer doing the same. He also asked the elderly to try to bring their sons or relatives back militancy and surrender and assured that the Army would cordially accept them and not do any harm! So when the Army has taken all these steps and issued warnings, why are civilians so angry when action is taken? Don't the locals want peace in Kashmir? The more the adamancy, the higher number of lives that are sacrificed. - Sailok

***

Thank you for highlighting this. Without this, it would have been very difficult for readers to understand how the military is working in Jammu and Kashmir. However you have missed the chance of writing one line to mark respect for the soldier who died protecting people like you and me, who died very far from his home and his family. - Anil Patil

General Rawat spoke in a very even, matter-of-fact way during his interview (""'An embarrassment for the country': Twitter reacts to army chief Bipin Rawat's sexist comments""). Times are changing and our people, especially men, are slowly getting accustomed to women working shoulder-to-shoulder with them. It will take time for our jawans, most of whom come from the hinterland where patriarchy is more prevalent, to change their thinking and to accept marching alongside women, or even take commands from them. General Rawat knows what he is talking about. He knows his men well. - Rowena

***

Don't have a sheepish mentality. General Rawat is simply being practical. War is a hazardous occupation. Women are not made for it. They cannot lift heavy machine guns. They cannot endure torture. Many more such examples can be given.The general has a very concerned and caring attitude towards women. It would be clear to you if you ponder over his statement with a cool head.

Women make a seminal contribution to the lives of men. In return, is it not the duty of menfolk to care for them and protect them? Can we afford to imperil the lives of our women at dangerous war fronts? There are many walks of life where women are better than men and many jobs are available to them that provide them a chance to establish their own independent identity and also give them a chance to be prosperous.In my opinion, hyping the issue of women getting into the military is not proper. - Abhinav Kumar

***

There is no need to get all worked up. The man knows what he is talking about and as a professional soldier who shoulders the burden of the nation's security. He is just dispensing practical common sense. - Sanjeev Srivastava

I have heard Thol Thirumavalavan speak in discussions and TV interviews (""The TM Krishna column: Why are India's Dalit thought leaders always reduced to their caste identity?""). It is unfortunate he is imprisoned in his caste or social class. Among Tamil politicians, he has credentials to be come Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu - he is young, experienced, and can be a national leader too. He is not a firebrand but is level-headed. At the same time, he is aware of sufferings of Dalits in Indian society. I have read the books of Bama and Salma too. Even other Indian religions look down on the marginalised sections of their faiths. Perhaps I am also like Krishna, born into an upper caste, and hope I am not misunderstood as being patronising to Thirumavalavan. - R Venkat

***

As pointed out in this article, the image created about public individuals from marginalised sections arises not when they illustrate their intellectual prowess but on their demonstration of resistance in violation of existing norms. It is natural for affected people to hold and propagate opinions about the disruptor which can be reformed by reasoning subsequently. More than theirs, it is the opinion of marginalised sections that place the defying nature above everything else and this as an identity is installed on such public individuals. For them, the ability to take issues head on is of primary importance. - Karthik G

***

Does the irony of this article strike the author when he himself is guilty of constantly reducing Brahmins to their caste identity? And how does one credit Mayawati for her intellect when she spends hundreds of crores on statues and real estate? If the writer is truly sincere, he will make sure that Thirumavalavan participates in thought and ideology debates at the national level and ensure the breakdown of linguistic and cultural barriers. Naive generalisations and presumptions will not do. - Partho Chandra

***

It's without doubt that Thirumavalavan could have been one among the popular leaders of India if he had not been boxed as a Dalit leader. As the author rightly pointed out, if any one excels in their profession, Indians by and large want to know the religion and caste to which they belong. If it turns out that the successful individual is from a marginalised community, people would rather ignore or limit their talents.

It is because of the sheer prejudice ingrained in the minds of the privileged. It is ridiculous and there is no rationale for such attitudes. If we want to become stronger and at the forefront along with developed countries, we need to appreciate and accommodate the talents and intellectuals of our country irrespective of religion and caste. I am proud to hail from an underprivileged group! - Arumugam Kaliaperumal

I saw all the matches at the Odisha Hockey World Cup from the knockout stage onward (""After a long wait, Belgium hockey's watershed moment arrives at World Cup amid nerve-wracking drama""). The stadium and the organisation was world class. The amenities available for spectators was way beyond expectations.The only jarring note was struck by Hockey India by inviting Sachin Tendulkar onto the dais for the presentation ceremony to present the player of the tournament award. This is after he was interviewed pitch side, at length, during the halftime break.Why didn't Hockey India invite Ajit Pal Singh, the only Indian captain to win a Hockey World Cup gold, or any of the other hockey greats who were present at the stadium? It is no wonder that hockey is struggling to get national attention at a time it needs it most. - H Saldanha

Instead of celebrating pseudo-science and making its perpetrators look like victims at the hands of the educated, I hope you'll find it in your heart to actually contribute to the progress of society and not regress (""One man's long, lonely mission to convince Kolkata that the Sun revolves around the Earth""s).

The earth is a dead star? The energy produced from a star is only possible through nuclear fission reactions and chain reactions are bound to make all matter collapse into itself, which is how black holes are born. A dead star can have no matter, let alone a thriving biodiversity. If the sun were to rotate around the earth, the earth's gravitation would have to be strong enough to hold the sun, a celestial object larger than 10^5 times of itself. As impossible as that is, even if it were true, every cell of every bone of our body would have been crushed into the earth's core if it were to have such a high gravitional pull. It is utter garbage.

Sorry, we have better things to do than argue with obstinate morons. I am a National Institute of Technology student and I do not care for nonsense. But I care for what we celebrate. Don't sentimentalise stupidity. Why would you want to malign a truth we discovered with so much difficulty and one that has brought us so much prosperity? - Anandamoy Bandyopadhyay

The scientific spirit of inquiry is precious and that's what reflects in the polite reply from NASA to KC Paul. However, it is important to understand that baseless opinions do not become valuable just because someone holds them for very long. The standards that were used in selecting Paul as a worthy subject for a film are of no consequence to me, but for Scroll.in to cover him has come as a bizarre surprise. Are you going to follow it up with covering people who have held a lifelong commitment to other baseless beliefs and superstitions?

It is hard to digest that the main downside of being a fool is the possibility of becoming less of a fool someday; because if we continue to be incorrigible fools we may get movies made on our lives, and much more problematically, some day a prestigious news organisation like Scroll.in may cover us. - Satyam Dheeraj

I am a third-generation Christian, the granddaughter of an indigenous missionary, and I strongly disagree with the article by Nate Rabe (""I was raised in a missionary family but only have disgust and anger for Chau's actions in Andamans"").

When the white men came we were half-naked tribesmen. Superstition dominated our lives, living to appease the spirits for good harvests and for health. We head-hunted the enemy for sport. Our only concern was to have our barrel of alcohol full and tobacco to smoke.

Prior to the white man came the Vaishnavite missionaries to the nearby valley people and converted them. They named us untouchables and left us to our vices. Two centuries later, the white man came to us. He gave us education and liberated us from superstition. He gave us our script; albeit the English alphabet modified according to our dialect phonetics, thus saving our language from extinction. The white men put an end to our ""corrupt"" tradition.

To a privileged human tired of the evils of colonialism, the mundane tribal life is paradise. But as a tribal I am forever indebted to the white man for imposing his ""superior"" culture. Life was not this easy, we were an oppressed people.

Most importantly, Indian society as a whole owes a lot to the now demonised Christian missionaries. It must never be forgotten that it was the Christian missionaries and their burden to ""civilise"" the lesser cultures that led to the establishment of blind schools, shelters for widows and lepers. It was through mission schools that education, which was a privilege held only by the upper castes, became accessible to the lower castes. It was their education that enlightened and gave voice to Dalits and women in a society that accepted the oppression of certain sections of the society in the name of culture. - Shinobi Suantak"

It isn't just dust and noxious gases that are floating in the air. You also have bacteria, fungus and other microbes, which could contribute to the rise of allergens and respiratory infections in the city.

Since 2010, Bengaluru University has been monitoring bioaerosols in the form of bacterial contamination and fungal spores in the air. The annual average number of bioaerosol ranged between 64,000 Colony Forming Units per cubic metre to 89,000 CFU/m3. While there are no standards for bioaerosols in the country, researchers say this exceeds the 10,000 CFU/m3 limit prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for indoor air quality.

Seasonal variation

The study, which also looked at seasonal variation, shows that the city is always under a barrage of bioaerosols, with bacterial microbes and fungal spores alternating in their peaks.

The pre-monsoon season, stretching from March to May, records the worst biological pollution quality, with CFU/m3 reaching upwards of 1,02,000.

Warm temperatures in the city, coupled with urban heat island effect that can see certain areas record more than 37 degree Celsius, are believed to encourage bacterial growth. Many bacterial organisms thrive in these warm temperatures, note researchers whose meteorological observation point to an increase in average temperature in the city from 24.1 to 24.4 degree Celsius in the past seven years.

During winters, when the air is slightly chiller, fungal spores dominate bioaerosols. The lowering of humidity (to around 27%, compared to 50-60% in other seasons) 'enhances' spore formation.

""Solid waste is a major contributor to bioaerosol pollution. Rotting waste sees microbial release and is a platform for mould and fungal growth,"" said Sivasakthivel S., a researcher with Bangalore University.

When released, they attach themselves to particulate matter pollution, which is on the rise through vehicles, construction and other pollution sources.

""These minute particles are the ideal platform for bacteria to grow on. The smaller the particle, the greater its reach in the lungs, and greater the health hazard,"" says the researcher.

Of concern is particulate matter which is less than 1 micron in size and can reach the smaller tracts within the lungs. Currently, State agencies monitor particulate matter on two parameters: of 10 microns or less in size and of 2.5 microns or less. The monsoon, which subdues much of the particulate matter, seeks lower bioaerosol counts in the city.

""If you are talking about pollution and health, then it is very important to measure bioaerosols. It is a big problem which could lead to direct health effects from air-borne pollution,"" says Nandini N., Principal Investigator for the project.

Bioaerosols not monitored

Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) said bioaerosols are not notified as a pollutant by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), preventing regular monitoring.

""There is talk of monitoring PM1 levels due to its health consequences. But, even at the national level, there has been no discussion on bioaerosols,"" said an officer.

Causes of bioaerosol pollution

From open dumpyards, landfills, waste strewn on streets, to frothing lakes and the burgeoning pigeon population, bacterial and fungal particles have multiple ways to get air-borne.

While much of it can be natural -- take for instance, fungus on trees shaken by the wind -- rotting food waste in garbage dumps can aggravate matters.

""Even sewage flowing in the open spews out airborne toxins when it falls from a height. This is something we have observed in Byramangala and Bellandur lakes where along with froth, bacteria in the water is thrown up in the air. What we need is for the civic body, water board and others to take bioaerosols into consideration in their policies to put an end to open dumpyards, and the city is kept clean,"" says Nandini N., Professor, Department of Environmental Science, Bangalore University and Principal Investigator in this long-term monitoring project.

The health effects of bioaerosols have not been directly studied, leaving a gap in understanding their contribution to infections or allergies. Pulmonologist H. Paramesh said that while infections had reduced due to better education about hygiene, allergens are on the rise.

""A recent study shows fungi causes 7.5% of allergies, which is the same as pollen. However, this is overshadowed by dust mites, which cause 60% of allergies. In terms of bioaerosols, much needs to be studied,"" he said."

Arun is accused of violating the rules for appointing primary teachers at panchayat and block level government schools.

The inquiry was ordered on December 21 by director of primary education Arvind Kumar Verma. ""Some irregularities were found in the selection process of teachers between 2006 and 2017. He has been given 15-day time to reply to the education department,"" he said.

Arvind told this newspaper on Saturday if Arun failed to come up with satisfactory reply, stern action will be taken against him.

The inquiry was initiated on a complaint from Gopalganj's district education officer (DEO) and district programme officer (establishment). In their letters to the department in August, the DEO and DPO alleged that Arun had committed large-scale bungling in teachers' selection.

According to education department officials, Arun appointed around 100 teachers at panchayat and block level in government primary schools of Gopalganj district without following the criteria of recruitment prescribed by the department.

""In case of any vacancy in government primary school after a teacher retired or died, Arun made appointments on the basis of a merit list issued in 2006 and 2008, without inviting fresh applications.

Indeed, they now fondly call her 'batwoman'.

The mother of two set out on the task in 2003, three years after the death of her father-in-law brought the curtains down on the Masoodi Arts and Sports factory, a 40-year-old bat manufacturing unit. ""I asked my husband Showkat if I could restart the unit and he readily agreed,"" says Masoodi.

Showkat put her in touch with former workers, willow dealers and customers based outside Jammu and Kashmir. There were teething troubles, delays in product delivery and payments etc. ""But my workers helped a great deal in making me what I am today,"" says Masoodi, sitting in a dimly lit room with gleaming MAS (Masoodi Arts and Sports) bats stacked all along the mud walls.

Bat manufacturing requires ""skills like a goldsmith"", says Masoodi, a cursory look and quick feel should tell you whether the bat is gold or a dud. She checks each finished bat herself for any defects. Riyaz Ahmad Ganai had been working at the bat unit for more than two decades till the three-year shutdown forced him to return to his village and take up menial work. With Masoodi reviving the business, he's happy, thankful that his ""children's education was not disrupted"". ""It is not her success alone, but ours too,"" he says.

A J&K government officer, who works in promoting start-ups, says he is bitterly disappointed at how successive governments have been unable to prioritise the industry and capitalise on the huge demand for Kashmir willow across the globe. ""It's rare to see Kashmir brand bats in the national or international markets,"" he says. ""The state government doesn't have the will to curb illegal trade and promote 'Brand Kashmir'. Raw clefts from the Valley are illegally ferried to outside states where prominent brands use their own stickers to pass it off as their product.""

Chandigarh has been ranked second by Niti Aayog in India's Index for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) among all the states and Union Territories. It has topped the UTs with an index score of 68, a release by Ministry of Statistics, Government of India, Friday said.

The SDG India Index measures the progress of states and UTs complying with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The First Baseline Report of SDG India Index for 2018 has been prepared with support from Global Green Growth Institute and the UN.

""Among the UTs, Chandigarh takes the lead because of its exemplary performance in providing clean water and sanitation to its people. It has further made good progress towards providing affordable and clean energy, generating decent work and economic growth, and providing quality education,"" the report stated.

Chandigarh is in the category of ""front runners"", while Himachal Pradesh and Kerala has topped the index with a score of 69. They are also ""front runners"" in achieving the SDG.

""We normalised the raw data on a score of 0-100. The lowest score means worst performing and 100 means best. A state or UT scoring 68 means that it is inching closer to the complete score in terms of accomplishment of the goals,"" said Officer on Special Duty Sanyukta Samaddar from Niti Aayog.

There were 16 SDGs, including sanitation and clean water, poverty eradication, human health, quality education and various others, on which the states/UTs were measured ""to help organise and streamline development actions for greater achievement of human well being"".

In the goal of ""Quality Education"", Chandigarh was among the best performing with 85 index score and ranked in ""front runners""

The goal was measured on adjusted net enrollment ratio at elementary (Class 1-8) and secondary (Class 9-10) schools, percentage of correct responses on learning outcomes in language, mathematics and EVS for Class 5 students, correct responses in language, mathematics, science and social science for Class 8 students and school teachers professionally qualified.

In the goal of ""Gender Equality"", Chandigarh scored 51, second among the states/UTs.

The goal was measured on sex ratio at birth (female per 1,000 male), average female to male ratio of average wages/salaries received per day by regular wage/salaried employees of age 15-59 years for rural and urban and ensuring women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision, percentage of seats won by women in the General elections to state legislative Assembly and various others.

However, there are several areas where a lot if improvement is required.

The first goal of ""No Poverty"" had Chandigarh scoring just 39 marks. The index parameters, under which the city was surveyed, included percentage of population living below National Poverty Line, households with any usual member covered by any health scheme or insurance, percentage of persons who demanded employment under MGNREGA, proportion of the population (out of the total eligible) receiving social protection benefits like maternity benefit and number of homeless per 10,000 households.

Chandigarh fell in ""Aspirant"" category, while Tamil Nadu and Mizoram were the best performers with 76 and 71 index score.

In another goal ""Good Health and Well Being"", Chandigarh has an index score of only 23, while Kerala tops with 92. Even Punjab and Haryana scored better than Chandigarh in this with 71 and 57 respectively.

In this category, the city was measured on parameters like maternal mortality ratio, number of government physicians, nurses, midwives per lakh population and under-five mortality rate per 1,000 live births, percentage of children aged 12-23 months fully immunised (BCG, measles and three doses of pentavalent vaccine) and annual notification of tuberculosis cases per lakh population. Chandigarh was found wanting on these criteria and thus scored among the least.

Similarly, in the category of ""Sustainable Cities and Communities"", Chandigarh has an index score of just 40. The parameters included percentage of urban households living in slums, wards with 100 per cent door-to-door waste collection, waste processed and others.

After all the name of the Bill suggests it is meant to protect the community's rights. Why then is the community outraged and protesting the much-awaited legislation?

""The problems began at the draft level in the way the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment worded it in 2016,"" explains well-known trans community activist Gauri Sawant, who was one of the petitioners in the National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India (NALSA), 2014 in the Supreme Court. ""The initial draft itself showed a poor understanding of gender identity, its articulation and expression. Why else would the bill have deliberately chosen such an offensive way to define trans people? Dehumanisingly it said a transgender person is 'someone neither wholly male nor wholly female.' Obviously there is anger,"" says the Mumbaikar who was the face of India's first trans-inclusive ad campaign for Vicks.

Community outrage, a litany of letters condemning such a definition and the resultant recommendations of a parliamentary standing committee saw the TGPB correcting its definition to include diverse gender identities says Sawant who adds: ""But the TGPB in its current avatar shows how society and the government want to changing little about the way the community is treated and/or perceived. Once they tinkered with semantics - that too after much prodding - the people who drafted the TGPB felt they'd done enough and lapsed back into age-old stereotypes.""

One of the key contentious issues flagged by the community about the Bill's current avatar is the insensitive trampling of transpeople's self-identified gender expression by the Bill's proposal to set up of a five-member District Screening Committee with a medical officer and psychiatrist on-board to certify whether a person is transgender or not. Sawant's fellow petitioner (in the NALSA case) and hijra rights' activist Zainab Patel insists this is in direct violation of the Supreme Court's orders in the NALSA judgement, 2014. ""The court clearly underlined the right to self-determination of gender as male, female or transgender without the mandate of any medical certificate about sex-reassignment surgery (SRS),"" she says and adds, ""In fact, the judges had clearly called any insistence for proof of SRS for declaring one's gender as immoral, inhuman and illegal.""

Patel also invokes the preamble to the Constitution of India which mandates justice (social, economic, and political) and equality of status. ""The first and foremost right we all deserve is Right to Equality under Article 14. The Constitution provides this fundamental right and tolerates no discrimination on the grounds of sex, caste, creed or religion while guaranteeing it to each and every citizen. Yet transgender persons/hijras continue to be ostracised. The TGPB which is supposed to help ameliorate this problem makes it worse.""

A view which finds strong echo with the National Transgender Thirunangai Kinnar Hijra Association. The body has not only rejected the TGPB in its current avatar but called it ""authoritarian and draconian."" It has demanded: ""The TGPB must recognise that gender identity goes beyond the biological; gender identity is an individual's deep and personal experience. It need not correspond to the sex assigned at birth. It includes the personal sense of the body and other expressions.""

The Bill does not provide for employment opportunities through reservations, disregarding the directions of the apex court in the NALSA judgement which asked the state ""to treat them (trans people) as socially and educationally backward classes of citizens and extend all kinds of reservation in cases of admission in educational institutions and for public appointments.""

What is worse while refusing to help create job opportunities where they can earn a living the TGPB criminalises and threatens to target trans persons begging for sustenance under anti-beggary laws. Sawant asks if the state has created equal opportunities of employment since the apex court ruling four years ago to help the community. ""In Marathi we have a proverb - Aai jevayla det naahi aani baap bhik maagu det naahi (The mother won't feed me and the father won't let me beg). That's what the TGPB reduces the trans community to,"" she says and adds, ""This is not about activists like me or Lakshmi (Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi) who in a sense live a privileged life because of our education, awareness and socio-economic circumstances but abject poor trans people who have no support system at all. You know even if they have the money and show it to restaurant owners they are not allowed to come in and even have water in so many places. Such draconian threats of invoking anti beggary laws disregard the lived realities of transgender persons for whom begging often is the last resort. As it is the community faces hate crimes, gets abused, harassed and beaten up by police/hoodlums who want their money, sexual favours or both. The TGPB will arm such elements with brazen impunity which will go unquestioned.""

Many trans persons are abandoned by the family which is extremely hostile to them because of their orientation/lifestyle Sawant warns: ""Forceful rehabilitation will put such individuals in unsafe abusive situations pushing them to self-harm/suicide. Is this what state intervention should be doing?"" She wonders why only hijras and trans people begging is a problem. ""Will this government call Godmen and Godwomen who seek alms and patronage also beggars and stop them? The tradition of going for singing/dancing badhai on the arrival of a newborn or at marriages is older than this nation state. How can that be taken away on a whim?""

Laughing at how the TGPB says they can't beg if efforts to find them an alternate way of living are on Sawant wonders why the Bill infantilises the community and chooses to put the carriage before the horse. ""Till we have the right equal employment conditions, this will continue. Also, if a boy from a Brahmin Purohit's family pursues engineering and becomes an engineer, does the government go after him with a stick if he conducts pujas/rituals in the weekend as a family tradition?""

Incidentally, such detention of the marginalised in the name of rehabilitation has been criticised by the Delhi High Court in Harsh Mander v. Union of India, 2018, declaring provisions of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959 as unconstitutional on grounds that it violates Article 14 (equality before the law) and Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty), and affects the rights of persons who have no other means of sustenance but to beg.

Shockingly the TGPB treats rape/sexual assault of transgender persons as different from the cis-gendered. ""This is severely problematic given the high incidence of such attacks on transpersons where the police and society rarely support the victim,"" says Patel. ""The Indian Penal Code Sections 375 and 376 only consider that a forceful penetration of a woman by a man as rape. The community hoped the much-needed, specific provisions or punishments to deal with rampant sexual violence, rape and assault of trans people will be addressed but it hasn't.""

For the record the TGBP states ""whoever harms or injures or endangers the life, safety, health, or well-being, whether mental or physical, of a transgender person or tends to do acts including causing physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal and emotional abuse and economic abuse, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to two years and with fine.""

Patel points out how this itself encodes discrimination by providing lesser punishment for sexual violence against trans persons, as against seven years' imprisonment awarded in case of sexual assault on cisgender women. ""So the TGPB is clearly emphasising we are lesser. Also since it does not define the acts that constitute sexual offences, it is going to be complicated for transgender persons to both report such crimes and access justice.""

Sawant feels the unkindest cut in the TGPB comes from the denial of civil rights like marriage, civil partnership, adoption and property rights that cis-gendered enjoy. As someone who has assumed guardianship and responsibilities of three abandoned girl children born to sex workers she laments what she calls a cruel move. ""Motherhood is a lived reality and not only a biological thing. Why can't I adopt my daughters officially when they call me aai and that's the way I feel about them?"" she says moist-eyed.

Transgender persons have faced prejudice, discrimination and disdain for years, and it is dehumanising to deny them their dignity, personhood and, above all, their basic human rights. TGPB in its present form continues to push them into obscurity, making a mockery of their lives and struggles by failing to secure for them their constitutional rights say activists who feel there is still time to reconsider. ""We will lobby to see that that the TGPB is brought up to speed with NALSA judgment to ensure the full realisation of transgender persons' fundamental rights when it comes to the Rajya Sabha. I will personally reach out to key people in the government to ensure this is followed up and pushed through,"" says Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi (the first transgender person to represent Asia Pacific in the UN in 2008) who is seen as close to the current dispensation as the Mahamandeleshwar (head) of the Kinnar Akhada.

Irrespective of who gets it done, the TGPB's current avatar needs amendments. The sooner, the better...

Against principles of self-identification

The 2014 judgement said transgender persons had the right to gender self-identification but the TGPB takes this right away

No reservations:

In the NALSA judgement, the state and centre were asked to extend reservations to trans people in education and public employment. TGPB doesn't mention.

Criminalisation of begging

TGPB criminalises begging and prescribes 6 months to 2 years in jail for anyone who ""compels or entices a transgender person to indulge in the act of begging.""

No protection against rape/sexual assault

The TGPB does not provide punishment for sexual violence, rape and assault of trans people on par with the cis-gendered

No civil rights on par

The TGPB denies civil rights like marriage, civil partnership, adoption and property rights that cis-gendered enjoy."

He has joined his father Kandhasamy in their ancestral land in Jakeri, a sparsely populated village in Kelamangalam administrative block of Krishnagiri district. In two acres, they cultivate roses and carnations in two poly greenhouses under controlled conditions, using Israeli technology.

The neighbouring farm belongs to Srinivasan, a general manager in a multinational software company. He drives down from Bengaluru on weekends to attend to his hi-tech rose farm. He plans to take the plunge and become a full-time farmer.

Across four administrative blocks in Krishnagiri District -- Kelamangalam, Denkanikottai, Shoolagiri and Hosur -- poly greenhouses and shade net structures are ubiquitous. Those that drive the hi-tech horticulture boom are young engineers, management professionals, employees from information technology (IT) sector and the like.

Rain-fed agriculture

The trend negates the battle for survival of the average Indian farmer, and the children not seeming keen to pick up the mantle. According to the Annual Status of Education Report - 2017, released by the non-profit organization Pratham, just 1.2% children of farmers aspired to be a farmer.

In Krishnagiri district, the major cultivated area is rain-fed. Over the last few decades, the district witnessed a shift to horticulture, due to its climate and proximity to Bengaluru, the major market for horticultural crops. The undulating dry terrain from Rayakottai to Hosur has no perennial water source and is unsuitable for water-intensive crops.

Fruits like banana, sapota, aonla and guava, vegetables like brinjal, capsicum, and onion, spices like turmeric and pepper, and flower crops like rose, gerbera and carnations are cultivated in over 49,576 hectares.

Hi-tech farming

Hi-tech horticulture's beginnings in the area coincide with the IT boom in Bengaluru, with the last five years witnessing phenomenal growth, aggressively pursued by sons of small and marginal farmers, besides first generation farmers.

Anamaiah Gowdu (33) quit his corporate job and returned to Chettipally, his native village, to modernize his ancestral farm. He grows coloured capsicums.

""Liberal subsidies for poly greenhouses, shade net structures and micro irrigation along with technical and input support, has fuelled the growth of hi-tech farming,"" Ganesh, assistant director, Directorate of Horticulture and Plantation Crops, Denkanikottai taluk, told VillageSquare.in. As part of the hi-tech system, farmers install rainwater-harvesting structures, for micro irrigation.

India-Israel collaboration

According to Satyendra Yadav of Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project's (IIAP) Vegetable Cluster and IIAP Centre of Excellence (CoE), use of hi-tech greenhouses, naturally ventilated poly houses, anti-insect net houses, and walk-in tunnels significantly increase yield.

""The structures reduce use of pesticides and other inputs, prolongs harvest time from 3 to 9 months,"" Yadav told VillageSquare.in. ""As against a yield of 3.5 tons of cucumber per hectare in open cultivation, the yield under protected cultivation is 45 tons. The yield of capsicum in open cultivation is 12 tons per hectare while under IIAP technology, its 72 tons.""

IIAP's goals are to increase crop diversity, productivity and resource use efficiency. CoEs started under IIAP provide a platform for Israeli agro technology, knowledge transfer and training, focusing on nursery development, cultivation methods, irrigation and fertilizer management.

Controlled cultivation

Crops cultivated in the open, under natural conditions, are more susceptible to sudden changes in temperature, humidity, light intensity and other conditions that affect quality and yield. The Israeli technology helps control them and the four vital elements for photosynthesis.

The poly green sheet filters ultraviolet and infrared rays, allowing radiation measuring 400 to 700 nano meters, under which photosynthesis happens. Micro irrigation system ensures the roots get required water, cutting water use by 90%. Carbon-dioxide emitted by plants at night is retained inside the enclosure, boosting starch production.

""This is achieved by manipulating temperature, humidity, light intensity, ventilation, soil media, disease control, irrigation, fertigation and other agronomical practices throughout the season, irrespective of the natural conditions outside,"" Arumugam. S, horticultural officer-in-charge of CoE, Thally, told VillageSquare.in. ""This means farmers can get seven times more produce.""

The degree of sophistication of poly green and shade net houses varies from a simple naturally- ventilated poly house with polyethylene film covering, to highly sophisticated, fully automated drip and fogger systems, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) lightings.

Subsidies

Putting up a naturally ventilated poly green house in one-acre costs about Rs 28 lakh. Under the National Horticulture Mission, farmers get a subsidy of Rs16.88 lakh for poly green and shade net structures in one acre. The drip irrigation system is also heavily subsidized.

Raising nurseries under controlled environment is catching up too. Farmers get Rs 14.2 lakh per acre for shade net nurseries. Drip irrigation subsidy is Rs 1.13 lakh per hectare, plus Goods and Services Tax (GST), under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) scheme. Banks too offer loans because of high returns.

One acre of poly greenhouse cultivation fetches an annual income of Rs 25 lakh per annum, as against Rs 5 lakh in open cultivation. ""The loan can be repaid in a year and the returns thereafter are profit for the farmer,"" said Ganesh.

Profitable farming

Subramani K (32) of Chettipally village in Kelamangalam administrative block, had to discontinue his schooling and take up farming when his father passed away. ""Cultivating groundnut and ragi in three acres under rain-fed conditions, I struggled to sustain,"" Subramani told VillageSquare.in. But he broke the cycle growing green and coloured capsicums in two poly green houses, each over one acre land.

Subramani sells capsicum at Rs 50/kilo at the farm gate. Buyers from Bengaluru pick the produce every day, pack them and transport to various markets across the country. In one acre poly greenhouse, 14,000 plants can be grown, each costing Rs 8.5 including seed cost and wage. Three months after planting, capsicum is harvested nine months a year at a rate of 60 tons per acre.

In the case of roses, 28,000 to 32,000 plants can be raised in an acre. The cost of planting is Rs 12 to Rs 15. Six months after planting, one or two flowers can be plucked from every plant on alternate days. The market price of roses swings between Rs 100 to Rs 200 per bunch of 20 flowers.

Intensive management

""The spectacular results and returns are not coming easy,"" Srinivasan told VillageSquare.in. ""In naturally ventilated houses, increase in outside temperature entails semi-manual washing of plants to keep them cool.""

Each rose bud has to be capped with synthetic mesh to control its size. Rose stems ready for harvest during sunny days have to be pre-cooled. Soil and water need to be tested regularly. According to Sudeesh, one cannot succeed in hi-tech farming without personal attention. ""We keep updating ourselves with new techniques and news about market conditions,"" said Srinivasan.

Protected cultivation does not guarantee pest-free environment. The climate inside these structures is conducive for pests like mites and leaf miner. Farmers spend considerable time spraying pesticides. ""Nets and improvised door systems reduce pest infiltration,"" said Arumugam.

Worth the risks

Subramani recalled his childhood days, when they could hardly buy two sets of clothes a year. He could not afford to repair the house. ""Today, I have two motorcycles and a car, and I have rebuilt our house,"" he said.

About 2,000 acres are under hi-tech cultivation in Krishnagiri district. In Chettipally, there are 200 poly green houses, and new ones are coming up.

Farmers like Sudeesh double up as fabricators and consultants. Farmers are diversifying into other crops like radish, double beans, cauliflower, cabbage and carrot. Villagers are levelling dry and rocky lands to put up poly green and shade net houses, as the ensuing prosperity seems worth the risks.

The ministry of women and child development has informed Parliament that out of the 13,63,300 functional centres for children of up to six years, toilet facility is available in 9,29,339 anganwadis. This comes to just about 68.17% of the total operational anganwadis.

Even drinking water is not available at at all such centres which were conceived to combat malnutrition in children, provide them with pre-school, non-formal education and provide lactating mothers from poor families with nutrition. As many as 1,90,404 anganwadis do not have drinking water facilities.

The response of the WCD ministry came to a question in the Rajya Sabha on availability of facilities like toilet and water in anganwadis. Minister of state in the WCD ministry Dr Virendra Kumar said in his reply that there are 14 lakh anganwadis sanctioned across the country out of which 13.63 lakh are operational as on June 30.

The state-wise data shows that facilities are lacking in a very large number of anganwadis in certain states. For instance in Uttar Pradesh of the 1,90,145 sanctioned anganwadis 1,87,997 are functional and of these 1,34,908 have toilets. In Rajasthan, out of the 61,974 functional anganwadis just 34,656 have toilets and 47,633 have water. In Maharashtra, out of the 1,09,779 operational anganwadis, 58,553 have toilets and 1,03,987 have water.

In response to another question in in the Lok Sabha, the government said that while there are over 24 lakh anganwadi staffers working across various centres in the country, over two lakh posts for anganwadi workers and helpers are lying vacant.

About 1.09 lakh anganwadi worker positions are vacant and over 1.18 lakh posts for anganwadi helpers are unoccupied. A total of 12.8 lakh anganwadi workers and 11.6 lakh anganwadi helpers are currently posted at the centres.

The data (upto June 30) shows that it is not just the ground staff even the posts of Child Development Project Officer (CDPO) who is in-charge of implementation of the project and interface with government are vacant in many places. While there are 5,321 CDPOs working across the country, 1,754 posts are lying vacant."

Q. I have plans to be in the United States for pursuing my higher studies next year. Hailing from a middle class family, I have to look forward to support myself as far as possible. It will really help me if details and procedures on applying for a job after joining the university are explained. Are there any restrictions on number of working hours for a student who works on the university campus?

- Akshay Kumar, Mettuguda

A. As also mentioned in an earlier column, most international students in the United States go on an F-1 (non-immigrant) student visa. On an F-1 visa, a student is eligible to work only on the campus of their university. Immigration laws of the USA do not allow international students to work off-campus during their studies. On-campus work opportunities are also limited to up to 20 hours per week during the academic semester and up to 40 hours per week during school breaks. Also, please take note that you are eligible for on-campus employment only while you are enrolled full-time in an academic programme.

The on-campus work depends on availability of such positions. If a department/ college offers assistantships, you may apply for the same during your application or after admission. Most of the time, an assistantship means that the student does not pay tuition and receives a scholarship or stipend that can cover some portion of accommodation, meals, books and some personal expenses. The sum paid for assistantship varies by State, town, university, etc. Assistantships are available to students in the form of Teaching Assistantships (TA), Graduate Assistantships (GA), and/or Research Assistantships (RA) wherein students help their departments with teaching, research, both teaching and research, or other department/college work. You may look up the department/college webpage or contact the department for further information about assistantship options. You may also apply for other on-campus jobs that are generally advertised through a student job portal by most universities. There is competition for all open positions, so you should plan to apply as early as possible. Also, have a close look at the eligibility criteria before applying for the position.

F1 students can also avail Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and Optional Practical Training (OPT) after completing one year of coursework. CPT is an off-campus internship or practicum in a major field of study and requires pre-approval by the international student office of your university. OPT is also off-campus work for which you may apply after completion of an academic degree. It is 12 months of work directly related to your academic major, extended up to 24 months for STEM fields.

Q. I am in third year of MBBS. My friends told me about USMLE is required to practice in the US. Can you share details?

- Veronica Rao, Khairatabad

A. USMLE stands for United States Medical Licensing Examination and it is a licensing examination required in order to receive a license to practice medicine within the United States. The USMLE comprises three different steps that examine the individual's knowledge of specific topics related to the field of medicine and the application of all of these skills and areas of knowledge in the medical field. Students and graduates of medical schools outside the United States and Canada should apply for the different steps of USMLE by following the instructions at the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) website.

The meeting was conducted after 302 workers affiliated to the union were transferred to other states after they had struck work for 100 days seeking benefits.

The collector asked the management to revoke the transfers and asked the union to abandon the strike announced from December 26. He asked the parties to report to the next meeting on January 8.

Members of KMPTOS, under the All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), had been striking work from August 21 to November 29 seeking benefits such as education allowance, dress allowance and bonus. The union members alleged that the management was being partial to them and had been denying benefits.

After a meeting with labour department officials and the management in Chennai on November 26, they called off the strike. But the management transferred more than 300 workers involved in the strike to its plants in Uttarakhand, Pune and Andhra Pradesh.

P Natarajan, president of KMPTOS said the management, during negotiations in Chennai, had said they would not take any revenge measures, but the transfers were acts of revenge.

R Malarvannan, chief people officer of Pricol Limited, said the transfers were necessitated by the business model where the firm's clients wanted to place orders within the vicinity of their plants. He said the workers were transferred because of this. ""The collector asked us to discuss with the management about revoking the transfer orders. But, we told him that it might not be possible to reconsider transfers. The transfers are not permanent. Already, 20 workers have reported for work,"" he said."

According to the PRO speaking on the occasion, Chancellor, Lt. Gen (Retd) Atta Hasnain, said, ""Education plays an important role in restoring, self-esteem, dignity, and confidence among people anywhere. I have always loved the land and people of Kashmir."" He said the poor quality of land coupled with other issues has created impediments in the establishment of the varsity at its designated place. He asked the faculty members to remain more interactive in order to cultivate the benefits of collective wisdom. He said the Central University of Kashmir and Jammu should jointly hold academic and sports activities and invite students and scholars of their varsities to participate in them, adding the faculty members of both the institutions should frequently interact with each other. ""Both the universities should come up as model universities,"" he said. CUK Chancellor also advocated for the promotion of mentorship in the institution and asked the students to conduct a research about the concept of mentorship and how can it make a difference in the functioning of the university. He opined that a competition should be organized to prompt the students to write papers on mentorship for which prizes should be awarded.

The PRO said the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Mehraj ud Din Mir, gave a detailed presentation about the university and said the varsity has nine Schools and 18 PG departments with near about 35 programs including five years integrated courses and skill-based programs. He said the admission to the programs including research degree programs offered by the CUK and other sister universities is jointly conducted by the consortium of 10 Central Universities on the basis of Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET). He said the Examination and Evaluation Wing of the university is always conducting the End Semester Examinations (ESE) and other assessment tests on time and is declaring their results immediately.

""The number of students and scholars receiving education and pursuing research in the university as on date is more than 2300,"" Prof. Mehraj ud Din Mir said.

He said the university has already established an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC), Directorate of Students Welfare, Research Council and other important cells and bodies, adding the university has an efficient student feedback system. Prof. Mehraj ud Din Mir said the varsity, despite facing infrastructural deficiencies, has organized several international and national seminars, workshops, conferences, guest and extension lectures, and other academic activities from time to time.

The controversy surrounding veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah's remark ""I fear for my children"" is simply refusing to die. After his comment on mob violence stoked a controversy, popular actor Anupam Kher took on Shah saying that there is enough freedom in the country.

""There is so much freedom in the country that you can abuse the army, badmouth the air chief and pelt stones at the soldiers. How much more freedom do you need in a country?"" he asked.

Kher went on to say that Shah expressed what he felt but that does not mean it is the truth.

Naseeruddin Shah, 68, on Thursday (December 20) said he feared for his children in India of today and criticised incidents of mob violence in the country. He was referring to the recent Bulandshahr violence that claimed the life of a police officer.

""My children will have no answer,"" Naseeruddin Shah said, adding that he chose not to give religious education to children.

Shah's comment soon led to a full-blown controversy with many leaders and citizens on Twitter criticizing the actor, who is known for his roles in Sparsh, Paar, Masoom and movies like Iqbal. Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher also starred in A Wednesday, film by Neeraj Pandey.

""How does concern for country make me a traitor?"" Shah said reacting to the criticism that came to him from various corners.

Many accused the actor of being a traitor and a mob had even descended on the site of the Ajmer Literature Festival, where Shah was supposed to be a guest. However, the event had to be cancelled due to protests against the actor by Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and other right-wing associations.

Rajya Sabha MP Rakesh Sinha said, ""Naseeruddin Shah should first ask Rohingya to leave Hindustan as according to him India is unsafe for him and his family. An artist should not be part of a sinister design of anti-civil society propaganda. His statement shows his low thinking.""

Uttar Pradesh Navnirman Sena party Chief Amit Jani claimed that the party had booked a flight ticket to Pakistan dated 14 August (Pakistan Independence Day) for the actor.

The Vishwa Hindu Parishad went on to the extent of calling Shah a paid actor. In a statement, the right-wing organisation said, It is Shah's profession to take the money and act. His comments on the Bulandshahr incident seem similarly motivated.

On the other hand, many have come out in support of the actor. Lt Gen Zameer Uddin Shah, former V-C, AMU and brother of Naseeruddin Shah said, ""I entirely agree with what my brother says. But, I am not afraid. I am disgusted by seeing what is happening in the country.""

""This is not fearmongering at all. This is dissidence expression of one's view and this is not disloyalty,"" he added.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) G Ram Gopal Naik confirmed the chargesheet has been filed against 10 persons on Thursday in a city court.

The 482-page chargesheet has cited 78 witnesses including the girl student, for whom her teacher leaked the paper and some students who had received the papers through WhatsApp, said another officer.

Recovered mobile phones, handwritten notes, question paper written by the girl student and other data retrieved from cell phones have been cited as evidence in the chargesheet.

""The teacher, Rakesh Kumar, wanted to favour a girl student and with the connivance of bank officials, he got the Economics paper and brought it to his residence. He called the girl home and she copied the paper and then he clicked pictures of the paper and circulated it. The girl is one of the witnesses in the case,"" said the officer.

Since he had access to the papers, he also leaked the Class 10 Mathematics paper in the same way to favour a woman relative in Ferozpur whose son was appearing for the Boards.

Along with Kumar, Sheru Ram, branch manager of Union Bank Of India, Om Prakash, head cashier of the same bank and a 40-year-old woman, who had circulated hand-written question papers of Class 12 economics and Class 10 mathematics via instant messaging platform WhatsApp from her mobile phone, were also arrested and have been named in the chargesheet as accused.

Two others, Amit Sharma and Ashok Kumar, who worked at the DAV school in Una along with Kumar, have also been named in the chargesheet, the officer said.

Apart from this, the police had also busted another module being operated by two teachers of Mother Khazani Convent School in Bawana.

In the Bawana module, three men, including two teachers of the private school, were involved.

The teachers - Rishabh and Rohit - had taken photographs of the economics paper and sent it to Tauqeer, who used to give private tuition. Tauqeer circulated the paper among his students about an hour before the examination commenced, police had said, adding, he had received the paper via WhatsApp from Rishabh and Rohit.

The principal of Mother Khazani School, Praveen Kumar Jha, was arrested in July and his name also figures in the chargesheet, the officer said.

The economics paper leak was exposed after an envelope containing four images of a hand-written copy of the question paper was delivered to the CBSE Headquarters in Delhi on the evening of March 26, the day of the exam.

On March 30, the Central Board of Secondary Education announced it would re-conduct the Class 12 economics exam throughout the country on April 25.

Besides the Class 12 economics paper, the mathematics paper of Class 10 had also surfaced online before the scheduled examination.

The Delhi Police had registered two cases in connection with the paper leak. The first case related to the leak of economics paper was registered on March 27, while the other pertaining to the leak of mathematics paper was filed on March 28.

The exams for Class 10 mathematics and Class 12 economics papers were held on March 28 and March 26 respectively.

After reports of the leak surfaced on March 28, the CBSE had announced it would re-conduct the economics exam on April 25.

The board had decided against holding a re-examination for mathematics, saying the examination was ""largely an internal segment"" of the school education system.

The results for Class 12 and 10 boards were announced on May 26 and 29 respectively."

A muffled traffic buzz manages to intrude the 'silent' confines of a library on the busy Cowly Brown road in Coimbatore. The unassuming two-storey building is nevertheless the district central library, the largest public library in the city, which seems to be in a hurry to go 'paperless'.

A register at the entrance with a pen strung to it, where visitors sign in and sign out, does not give away much about the library that provides access to about 3 lakh books of all categories for a modest annual membership fee of Rs 60, and is just a month away from implementing the tracking technology, radio frequency identification (RFID).

There are 199 libraries (including village and grade two levels) tucked away in various parts of Coimbatore. Starved of a meaningful upgrade for more than five years now, a Rs 7 crore grant by the state's Minister for Education K A Sengottaiyan, this year, has come as a welcome move that can bring about a substantial overhaul in terms of book replenishment, says N Manikandan, district library officer in charge of Tirupur and Coimbatore districts.

For instance, in 2015-16, the central district library added 7,090 books valued at Rs 1,073,126 to its collection. While 2016-17 didn't see any addition at all, 2,781 books costing Rs 1,195,554 were added in 2017-18.

Started in 1952, the central district library has about 62,000 members on its roll and 700 visiting it every day, which includes newspaper loyalists, while the second biggest branch library in Coimbatore's busy Town Hall with about 80,359 books, has 230 visiting it on a daily basis.

Students at the research section

About 110,000 visitors have used the district library in the year 2017-18, with a large proportion of them having benefited from its research material. These numbers suggest libraries have become centres of allied activities - a shift from the passive role of a book lender to engaging visitors in enterprising projects. For instance, as part of the district library's non-customary programmes, a group of retired professors have been mentoring civil service aspirants for the past one year.

""The lectures we organise have drawn a lot of interest, and this is one way to encourage library visits,"" said Manikandan, who sits at the district library headquarters in Town Hall, which also hosts the branch library.

This has also redefined their purpose, which has acquired a more academic character. A key role of the library today is to put vast resources at the disposal of students preparing for civil services and competitive examinations, which include online access to important data. He cites Megastar, an online resource platform that gives access to 250 magazines, as an example.

Though a handful of youngsters poring over bulky books and handwritten notes in the research chamber of the district library appear to recreate a classroom environment, they are a content lot. ""I refer books here from morning until evening,"" says Elakiya Ravindra Kumar, a civil service aspirant. Pointing to a pair of computer systems, she says they can access research material and get ready assistance from librarians to locate books and other material.

So, sceptics who are weighing libraries' relevance in the digital age may have to settle for the truth that these repositories of books are not hastening to fade into oblivion, as the district central librarian P Rajendran vouches: ""Physical books are not going away anywhere soon, though we are digitising library management at all levels possible. Our transactions, lending and sorting of books returned, are digitised, and the implementation of RFID is only going to make tracking easier and circulation operations more efficient and faster.""

RFID will also limit all sorts of losses to the library such as book theft, said the librarian. However, he said with a smile, the library treats this 'offence' with leniency as it's love of books that triggers this temptation, though, he said, it will deprive an equally deserving reader of a book that has been 'unceremoniously' taken off the shelf.

Some limitations even with a reasonable extent of digitisation is the difficulty in locating 'mislaid' books. Visitors browsing through the shelves may inadvertently leave a history book in the literature section, where it will languish for years.

Every section of readers from men, women and children to the physically/intellectually challenged has a place in the library that has 60 per cent Tamil and 40 per cent English books, said Rajendran.

Stepping into the hallway of the library, the outstanding facilities for the differently-abled don't go unnoticed. A carefully designed section is fitted out with the gear that help the blind and other physically- and intellectually-challenged visitors experience library 'moments'.

Specially adapted computer keyboards like low vision/large print accessory, braille books, 'magnetic minds' for hand and eye coordination, tactile graphics for the visually challenged, specifically designed chess boards, and geometry and algebra kits are a small part of the paraphernalia helping the differently-abled readers, about 15 of them who visit the library mostly during the weekends, experience reading in a library.

Books for differently-abled children sit on low-built shelves

Low-built shelves and a wheel-chair ramp and trained staff at the section said a lot about the thought that has gone into making the library accessible to all.

Rajendran said with the aid of the 'read easy' device, which supports an audio format, some of their visually challenged scholar readers have gone on to acquire a PhD. The library also arranges volunteers to assist the visually-challenged with their exams.

The colourfully designed children's section, if one ignores some of the broken soft toys and ill-matched furnishings, stands in stark contrast to the adjoining reading room with its conventional carrels, and empty shelves waiting for 'new arrivals'. While there is a separate book-lending section for children, next to the women's reading section, this enclosure is used for story-reading.

""We have expert teachers volunteering to read stories to about 50 children during the weekends,"" Rajendran said, adding, summer camps coordinated by the library is very popular, and about 50 to 70 children attend them on an average.

The branch library in Town Hall

The branch library in Town Hall, though modest, is a place where neighbouring residents spend some quiet time and keep the library tradition alive. An incomprehensible combination of numbers and letters pasted on the books sitting on rudimentary iron shelves are ""the codes holding the description and location of books,"" explained chief librarian M Manimekalai.

Used mostly by students preparing for civil services, the library is also visited by the older generation, especially to read newspapers and know the day's happenings, she said.

The library landscape of Coimbatore is dotted with university libraries, which of course, provide limited access to their resources. For the purpose of this article, the Bharathiar University, which has the third-largest collection of books in the state, next to only the Madras University and Madurai Kamaraj University, was selected.

With a book stock of 2 lakh, the sprawling university campus is home to one of the most technologically advanced library facilities. ""We have a reading lab fitted with 40 computer systems, which the students use to read, download material from and for reference,"" said university librarian Dr R Sarangapani.

""Students use internet protocol address, mostly, to access a vast source of professional journals and books for their dissertations,"" he said.

A leading example of source for research was INFLIBNET, an autonomous inter-university centre of the University Grants Commission under the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD). ""It was available for five years, from 2012 to 2017, but now the services have been suspended. The MHRD is in talks with the government to restore it,"" said Sarangapani.

Bharathiar University's e-resources also comprise the opulent publications database built by its faculty. The university has been ranked thirteenth for research development by MHRD's National Institutional Ranking Framework.

In order to stay relevant and more useful, libraries have indeed moved beyond facilitating reading for pleasure. Its custodian's role, too, has expanded from just physically curating operations to managing and streamlining electronic content.

Why we need a building when the world is turning 'bookless' is a question that may have to wait, perhaps forever, as books emanate an energy that is palpable and libraries would remain the top-shelf option as long as there is a zeal for credibility and community.

Perhaps, this thought was on French philosopher Jean-Paul Satre's mind when he described his library moments as a child: ""I set off on incredible adventures. This meant climbing chairs and tables, at the risk of provoking avalanches which might have buried me.""

Walking through the silent alleys of the district library, I traced my fingers along the spine of the books, content to realise they will continue to serve readers through the twenty-first century, with e-books and devices supporting alongside the pursuit for limitless information and knowledge."

When a Bollywood celebrity like Naseeruddin Shah says he fears for the safety of his children and that the death of a cow has more significance than that of a police officer, it is seen by India's Muslim community almost as a validation of their fears. Except, if you listen closely, it isn't validation. It is an insult.

Shah has been cheered and celebrated for (finally) speaking up in a film industry that has largely remained silent, or has been silenced.

""If tomorrow, a mob surrounds them [my children)], and asks 'Are you a Hindu or a Muslim?' they will have no answer"", Shah said.

Hate to break it you, sir, but the mob won't ask. The mob never asks.

And it doesn't matter to the mob if you are a praciticing Muslim or not. So if you choose only to speak on behalf of the non-practicing Muslims, it otherises an entire community.

Muslims suffer, Muslims struggle, and Muslims are killed in India.

Contrary to what many will have you believe, this isn't a post-2014 phenomenon in India. If you think India was a safe and fiercely secular nation before the 2014 elections, you aren't just in denial, you are ignorant.

What is, however, a post-2014 phenomenon is an overt realisation that as Muslims, we are largely left with two options: We either die speaking up against the atrocities inflicted on the community, or we die keeping silent. Many are beginning to choose the former, however late it might be.

In the interview, an anguished and harrowed Naseeruddin Shah emphatically says, ""I feel anxious thinking about my children, because they don't have a religion"". He adds that while he had some religious education in his childhood, his wife (Ratna Pathak Shah) received next to none. ""We chose to not give any religious education to our children"".

Also read: What explains the Muslim silence in the face of BJP's aggressive Hindutva?

Shah's emphasis on how his family is 'liberal', and how they ensured they do not give a religious upbringing to their children, is rather perplexing. While it may be of importance in some other context, it has little to no relevance here. This repeated need felt by elite Muslims to insist on their lack of piousness and belief while speaking against Muslim killings, is heartbreaking.

""I am not that much of a Muslim but even I feel scared..."" is a sentence you will hear often in debates about intolerance in India. What is that supposed to mean? That Muslims who are believing and practicing Islam somehow have it coming and hence deserve to be lynched? Or does it somehow justify their murder? Or even makes it understandable?

It doesn't. The crime continues to be as abominable and horrific as it would be if non-practicing Muslims are attacked. A five-times praying Salman or Iqbal deserves as much of a shot at a dignified life as the rest of humanity.

Nor should explicit markers of a Muslim's religious identity - the burqa, hijab, skullcap, or public offering of namaz - preclude one from a living a secure life. This shouldn't have to be spelt out, but unfortunately, that's what it has come down to.

Naseeruddin Shah's comments, as well-meaning as they were, risks playing into the hands of the good Muslim vs bad Muslim binary that is in vogue in Indian public debate today."

This comes after a division bench of the Calcutta High Court quashed a single bench order that had given a go-ahead on Thursday to the ambitious roadshow of the saffron party.

Party sources said state and central level leaders were in the meeting, which was called after a division bench of the Calcutta High Court quashed a single bench order that allowed the mega event and asked it to hear the case afresh.

Party leaders said that they will wait for the High Court verdict on the 'yatra' and if needed will move the higher court for permission.

""The TMC is afraid of BJP,"" state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said while entering the party office before the meeting.

""We will wait for the court's verdict. We have full faith in the judiciary. The state government is trying to stop the Rath Yatra on the basis of assumption that it might create problems,"" he said.

BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said if needed the party will move the higher court to seek justice.

According to BJP sources, the party for the time being will organise rallies in various parts of the state against the state government's decision to not allow the 'yatra'.

On Thursday, a single-judge bench of Justice Tapabrata Chakraborty gave a go-ahead for the event. After the verdict, BJP leaders decided on tentative new dates for the programme starting December 28.

The court heard BJP lawyer Surendra Nath Kapoor for about an hour. Kapoor had maintained that the state had denied permission on the basis of assumptions. Advocate General Kishore Dutta had questioned whether the court can intervene on the decision of the state's denial of permission.

Earlier, on Saturday the state government had denied permission saying there was an apprehension of a law and order situation if the yatra was carried out. The state also said that if the yatra was carried out for 45 days with the participation of organisations such as RSS and Bajrang Dal, it could give rise to communal flare-ups.

Following this BJP resorted to High Court again and a single bench of Justice Tapabrata Chakraborty gave the conditional permission on Thursday.

The lawyer for state police cited Lal Krishna Advani's rath yatra during the 90s which sparked much violence and claimed 13 lives including that of a police officer. He said that it was not an ordinary rally or meeting and was rather a mixture of politics and religion.

However, after today's order there is uncertainty once again over the 'yatra' that was to cover all 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state ahead of the 2019 general elections.

The division bench of Chief Justice Debasish Kargupta and Justice Shampa Sarkar Friday quashed the single bench order and asked it hear the case afresh to consider intelligence inputs by the state agencies. The division bench also asked the single bench to dispose of the case expeditiously.

State education minister Partha Chatterjee said that people were not in BJP's support. ""They themselves are trying to deteriorate law and order situation here. Any such attempts will be strictly dealt with,"" he said.

CPI(M) MP Md Salim said that it was only a poll campaign for BJP and the TMC had ended up providing them a lot of support. ""If they want to carry out a poll campaign why veil it with a 'rath yatra'? The TMC has destroyed democracy in Bengal and that has helped in the ascent of BJP here,"" he said."

""In many areas, we are witnessing that the death of a cow has more significant than that of a police officer,"" Shah had said.

In the video, Shah also expressed fears over his children's response if they were asked about their religion. ""I feel worried about my children. They do not have a religion.

In order to favour a girl student, an Una-based teacher allegedly leaked the CBSE Class XII economics paper in March this year, stated the chargesheet filed by the Delhi Police in the paper leak case, a senior police officer said on Friday.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) G. Ram Gopal Naik confirmed that a chargesheet was filed on December 20 in a city court. The police has filed a chargesheet of 482 pages against 10 persons in the paper leak case.

The chargesheet has cited 78 witnesses including the girl student, for whom her teacher leaked the paper and some students who had received the papers through WhatsApp, said another officer.

Recovered mobile phones, handwritten notes, question paper written by the girl student and other data retrieved from cell phones have been cited as evidence.

""The teacher, Rakesh Kumar, wanted to favour a girl student and with the connivance of bank officials, he got the economics paper and brought it to his residence. He called the girl home and she copied the paper. He then clicked pictures of the paper and circulated it. The girl is one of the witnesses in the case,"" said the officer. Since the teacher had access to the papers, he also leaked Class 10 mathematics paper in the same way to favour a relative in Ferozpur whose son was appearing for the exams.

Along with Mr. Kumar, branch manager of Union Bank of India Sheru Ram, head cashier of the same bank Om Prakash and a 40-year-old woman, who had circulated handwritten question papers of Class XII economics and Class X mathematics through WhatsApp from her mobile phone, were also arrested and have been named in the chargesheet as accused.

Two others -- Amit Sharma and Ashok Kumar -- who worked at the DAV School along with Mr. Kumar, have also been named in the chargesheet. In another development, the police had also busted another module being operated by two teachers of Mother Khazani Convent School in Bawana.

In the Bawana module, three men, including two teachers of the private school, were involved. The teachers -- Rishabh and Rohit -- had taken photographs of the economics paper and sent it to Tauqeer, who used to give private tuition. Tauqeer circulated the paper among his students about an hour before the examination commenced, the police had said, adding, he had received the paper via WhatsApp from Rishabh and Rohit.

The leaders of Odisha BJP are working overtime to make Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the State on December 24 a success.

Mr. Modi's visit is likely to give a boost to the sagging morale of the BJP workers in the wake of their party's defeat in the recently concluded Assembly polls in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

Apart from dedicating IIT-Bhubaneswar campus to the nation, laying foundation for the campus of Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Berhampur, and inaugurating the Archaeological Museum, Lalitgiri, Mr. Modi is scheduled to address a public meeting at Khurda to commemorate the Paika rebellion.

Mr. Modi is visiting the State a few days after a three-day-long visit by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat to Bhubaneswar to strengthen his organisation ahead of the simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in the State.

As the BJP's national leadership expects a better performance in the forthcoming general elections in eastern India, Mr. Modi is likely to visit Odisha twice next month - Baripada on January 5 and Berhampur on January 16.

After coming second in the panchayat elections in February 2017, the BJP had pinned high hopes on Odisha. But after that the party failed to register any noticeable electoral victory. The BJD has wrested control from the BJP in all the bypolls held after the panchayat elections.

The disillusionment among cadres with top-rung leadership seemingly not working in cohesion has added to the problem and the party remains a divided house with its leaders leading their different camps. A viral video clip in which former IAS officer Aparajita Sarangi, who joined the party recently, was purportedly seen trying to instil discipline among cadres indicated the cracks in the State BJP. Although several Congress leaders have joined the BJP in the past few months, the party has suffered a jolt with senior leaders - Bijoy Mohapatra and Dilip Ray - quitting it weeks ago.

As the BJD remains strong, the new-found energy in the State Congress after its State polls victory has also sounded alarm bells for the saffron party, which is realising that the going may not be smooth in the coming elections."

According to the SDG India Index, the nation as a whole has a score of 58, showing the country has reached a little beyond the halfway mark in meeting the sustainable development goals adopted by India and 192 other nations in 2015. The index covers 13 of the 17 sustainable development goals, including healthcare, gender equality, clean energy, infrastructure, education, peace and building strong, accountable institutions.

Four goals, including climate action and sustainable use of marine resources, were left out because of lack of data at the state level.

Kerala's overall top rank (69) is attributed to its strong performance in providing good health, reducing hunger, achieving gender equality and providing quality education. The rank shows the distance each state has to cover to reach 100 -- the point at which it fully meets the sustainable development goal.

Himachal Pradesh ranks high with a similar overall score in providing clean water and sanitation, reducing inequalities and preserving the mountain ecosystem. Tamil Nadu has a score of 68. Among Union territories, Chandigarh takes the lead with a score of 68 on account of its track record in providing clean water and sanitation. Performance in providing quality education has also helped Chandigarh achieve the high score.

Tamil Nadu topped the states in poverty reduction, while Kerala topped in providing quality education, closely followed by Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh.

Kerala and Tamil Nadu also topped in facilitating good health and well-being. Gender equality, however, is an area all states and the nation as a whole need to improve upon. The toppers in gender equality, Sikkim and Union territories Andaman and Nicobar islands and Chandigarh have crossed the half way mark in reaching the goals.

Jharkhand, Odisha and Nagaland are also among the states that have a lot more ground to cover in the overall rankings.

The scores represent the current status of achievement in meeting the goals. NITI Aayog chief executive officer Amitabh Kant said that the index, which is also available for reference in the form of an online dashboard, will be updated in realtime. ""This will lead to a lot of changes at the grass root level. Competition among states is key in achieving the SDG,"" said Kant.

NITI Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar urged the fifteenth finance commission (FFC) member Ramesh Chand, who was present on the occasion, to use the index as a tool while finalizing its recommendations on sharing of central government's divisible pool of tax revenue with states. ""Unless development becomes a mass movement,  I do not think we can achieve what we want to,"" said Kumar. In an interview, Chand said that the SDG India index relies on the most recent data and will be a useful resource for the FFC. India's progress in achieving these goals are crucial for the world as it is home to about 17% of the world population, said a statement from NITI Aayog."

In a video message on YouTube, Shah had said that more importance is being given to the death of a cow than the death of a police officer in some areas.

He also said that he is worried about his children who did not receive any religious education.

The organisers of the Ajmer Literature Festival on Friday called off an event, set to be addressed by Naseeruddin Shah, after protests by right-wing groups over the actor's recent remarks on mob violence, according to a PTI report.

Strong protests were oragnised by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and other right wing associations for his controversial statement.

The 68-year-old actor was supposed to deliver the keynote address of the fifth edition of the three-day literature festival here. Before the event, many right-wing activists protested outside the venue. One of the protesters also hurled black ink on the poster of Shah.

Raas Bihari Gaur, coordinator of the festival, said, ""Shah was scheduled to inaugurate the festival but he did not come because of the protest by some locals over his comments.""

He was also scheduled to launch his book in the opening session, which was also called off due to the protests.

In a TV interview, Shah had said that he fears for his children in this country. He has reportedly said, ""In some areas killing of a cow receives more importance than lynching of a police officer...""

Police officials in Ajmer confirmed that right wing demonstrators did protest against Shah. However, no FIR has been lodged.

TROLLS ASK SHAH TO LEAVE INDIA

Shah became the target of online trolls as well as right-wing groups, with many accusing him of being a traitor.

A mob descended on the site of the Ajmer Literature Festival and resorted to vandalism to lodge their protest.

Criticising Shah for his remarks, Rajya Sabha MP Rakesh Sinha said, ""Naseeruddin Shah should first ask Rohingya to leave Hindustan as according to him India is unsafe for him and his family. An artist should not be part of a sinister design of anti-civil society propaganda. His statement shows his low thinking.""

BOMBAY TO KARACHI

The criticism took a near-comical turn with Uttar Pradesh Navnirman Sena claiming that they had booked a flight ticket for Shah to Pakistan.

Booking a ticket from Mumbai to Karachi for August 14, Pakistan's Independence Day, party chief Amit Jani said, ""If Naseeruddin Shah is scared in India, he should not delay in leaving for Pakistan. I have booked a ticket for him for for August 14 Pakistan Independence Day, so that India has one less traitor.""

""NOBODY SHOULD TELL US TO GET OUT FROM OUR COUNTRY""

Yesterday (December 20), Lt Gen Zameer Uddin Shah, former V-C, AMU and brother of Naseeruddin Shah said, ""I entirely afree with what my brother says. But, I am not afraid. I am disgusted by seeing what is happening in the country.""

He said, ""This is not fearmongering at all. This is dissidence expression of one's view and this is not disloyalty.""

NASEERUDDIN SHAH ON RELIGION

In a video, Shah says, ""I was given a religious education. But my wife, Ratna, did not get any religious education and we chose not to give a religious education to our children.""

He adds that he believes 'good and evil have nothing to do with religion' and so his children were not brought up in a religious environment.

""So, I fear for my children. Because if a mob gathers around them and asks them are you a Hindu or Muslim, they will not have any answer... Because they have no religion,"" he said.

In his first conversation with Pervez Musharraf, Manmohan Singh gave the general a professorial tutorial on exercise of state power. You and I are both accidental leaders of our nations, he said. We were not expected to reach where we have. Which Musharraf could have disputed, as anybody who gets commission as an officer in Pakistan's army knows he is a candidate for the top office, and we don't know if he did. But, to get back to serious stuff, the professor told the general that holding public office is like public trust. You can't have it, and do nothing with it. His point, therefore, was, let's get a move on with the peace process, whatever our respective political capital. How close the two coincidental, if not accidental, leaders got to an agreement has now been revealed quite authoritatively, and notably, by former Pakistani foreign minister Khurshid Kasuri. For more details, wait for his forthcoming book.

It's a question I wish Singh had asked himself at various points in his second term when his party, 10 Janpath and its commissars persistently destroyed his authority. They ruined his name and legacy, and diminished the prime minister's office so much that a disgusted electorate turned to Narendra Modi for his promise of an all-powerful PMO, Gujarat style. But while there is no alibi for his in-house tormentors, I wonder if he sometimes also repeated to himself the line he had spoken to Musharraf. If he actually believed public office was public trust, did he do enough to justify it in his second innings? Or did he fail the test he had himself set for national leaders?

Let me first get disclosures and disclaimers out of the way. I was an admirer of Singh, and continue to be one. He gave me the gift of time and trust that we journalists value. In my own writings and in the newspaper I then edited, his economic and foreign policies, particularly the nuclear deal, found robust support. In his quiet power struggle with the party I weighed in on his side, believing that only he, among top Congress leaders, had the combination of intellectual, moral and TINA (There Is No Alternative) clout to save us from a return to rotten povertarian socialism.

Since I am old-fashioned and do not accept the new ""norms"" where off-record conversations are revealed, confidences not kept and sources betrayed, and with self-righteousness, I will not reveal whatever he may have shared with me during our many conversations. But I will reveal one point I once made to him, cheekily, saying that history will blame him for many things, but give him no credit for the bad things he saved us from in a political set-up where awful new ideas floated twice a week. He shrugged me off then, with disapproval. But now, as he prepares to go to court, accused of corruption and criminal breach of trust, he will reflect on the amount of time, energy and political capital he lost fighting these bad ideas, stalling or diluting them to minimise the damage, as with NREGA, Right to Education and Food Bills. On land acquisition, he lost out fully as Rahul had been convinced by his Kautilyas this was his party's ticket to a third term.

In these five years there were many junctures when he could have drawn the line. The first blow was his party repudiating the agreement he reached with his Pakistani counterpart at Sharm el-Sheikh to resume the dialogue process suspended after 26/11. It was the first time in our history that a party had vetoed its own prime minister on a key foreign policy issue, and in public. He fretted to close aides over his environment minister writing letters to him on controversial issues taking a line at variance with his, and leaking them so he would ""read them in newspapers"" first. His do-nothing defence minister wouldn't listen to him, not moving on purchases, slowing progress, including joint exercises with the US, and once most notably in early 2012 invoking ""higher-ups"" to veto a decision so important for national security it could have only been the prime minister's and Cabinet Committee on Security's.

His party's old ideologies came back to blight him on economics as well as foreign policy. Through these 10 years, there was hardly any top-level exchange with Israel, although it continued to be akey strategic ally in those years. In the aftermath of 26/11, P. Chidambaram was forced to cancel US and Israel visits for fear of ""political implications"" (read Muslim vote). And as worries grew with the economic slowdown, not only did Pranab Mukherjee, the Last Statist, refuse to listen to him on the retrospective tax, he even dismissed his plea that the RBI governor (then D. Subbarao) be nudged to cut rates. You ask him, you gave him a two-year extension, not I, he is believed to have said in the presence of a couple of senior economic officials before walking off.

Sonia and her advisers started the practice of writing letters to him on populist issues and making them public. This had a twin objective: to give the Family credit for all ""pro-poor"" policies and to distance them from anything vaguely risky or reformist. He wasn't allowed to pick his people in the PMO, forced to drop his loyal media adviser, and while it is simplistic to say that files were taken to Sonia, key decisions, even bureaucratic appointments, were cleared with her. Lutyens' Zone is brutal, like the core of any capital city. Once it figures where the power rests, the rest don't matter, whatever their designations.

His admirers, including this columnist, watched his frustration as he allowed himself to diminish in moral stature and political authority, becoming the butt of nasty jokes.

When Rahul tore up in public that corruption ordinance while Singh was overseas, we had hoped that this was enough humiliation. But he disappointed his admirers, who watched in frustration as he declined, going into silences, refusing to say anything in public on key issues as if in a sulk or self-pity. And I can promise you that he is not inarticulate. Far from it. His last televised full interview was with me, in the run-up to the 2004 elections, and he spoke with passion, intellect and conviction. He was no 'Maun Mohan'. In his first term, he showed flashes of it, as on the nuclear deal. In the second, he was on a maun vrat, undermining himself, his government and his party.

Why did he give up his moral and constitutional authority without a fight? He confessed often that he was an appointed prime minister, not an elected one. But then why did he not insist that he contest for Lok Sabha, particularly in 2009? I think his party bosses were quite happy to see him that way, a bureaucrat-like, compliant prime minister serving at their sufferance. But if he had insisted that to have real authority he had to be in the House of the People, his party would have been compelled to give him a safe seat, much as it may have preferred to keep him a bonsai.

It is useful to look at what the scholar Moises Naim, currently at Carnegie and formerly editor-in-chief of Foreign Policy magazine, says in his book The End of Power: From Boardrooms to Battlefields and Churches to States, Why Being In Charge Isn't What it Used to Be. The world over, he says, ""power no longer buys as much as it used to"", power is eroding. It is easier to get, but harder to use and easy to lose. Further, with 24-hour TV, social media and the tyranny of real time, ""power players now often pay a steeper and more immediate price for their mistakes"". Flush with its victory on the nuclear deal, the UPA won its second, much larger mandate in 2009. Then began the spiral of mistakes, compounded by Singh retreating without a fight. His power, authority and political capital now were lost rapidly, as Naim explains. By 2010 he was a lame duck. Unless the terms of engagement were changed to restore his basic authority, he should have threatened to quit. My belief is Sonia and Rahul would have relented. They were not about to trust Pranab with the job. That he chose not to do so is the real disappointment and it is worth exploring why.

J.N. ""Mani"" Dixit was his first pick as national security adviser. He never tired of telling me that he had served with every PM in India's history and that Manmohan Singh was the most selfless of all. Dixit passed away, sadly, early in his tenure or we would have had the benefit of his insights as to why Singh did not stand up for his office. As we watch the tragedy of our most self-effacing, clean and intellectual prime minister walking in and out of the courtroom, we have to ask him a rough question: did he himself flunk the test he had set for Musharraf? If he treated public office as public trust, he wouldn't have let it be undermined. If he didn't, did he then put his feudal loyalties-to the Family-above that public trust? Did he think he must not embarrass the Family, whatever the cost to me and my office? He probably did. And though not even his worst enemies would believe the court will finally find anything on him, and I still think history will judge him more kindly than journalism, he will also be remembered as a great leader and patriot who denied himself real greatness by putting his feudal loyalty above the diktat of public trust."

After Naseeruddin Shah stoked controversy saying he feared for his children in today's India, Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Mahendranath Pandey hit back at the actor saying the actor is taking one of his roles as a Pakistani too seriously.

Hitting back at the actor, Pandey told ANI, ""Naseeruddin Shah is a good artiste. In one of his movies, he played the role of a Pakistani agent. Mujhe lagta hain unka yeh bhaav thoda iss samay zyada jag gaya hai (I think this time he is feeling that role a little too passionately)"".

Actor Naseeruddin Shah on Thursday said that he is worried for children in today's India. He's worried because he imagines a situation where his children may be surrounded by an angry mob and asked: ""Are you Hindu or Muslim?""

""My children will have no answer,"" Naseeruddin Shah says, ""Because we chose not to give a religious education to our children.""

Shah was speaking in reference to the Bulandshahr violence over cow slaughter that left two dead, including a police officer.

Shah also said that there is a ""poison"" that has spread in the Indian society.

As his comment earned him a lot of criticism and support from various quarters, Shah defended his statement on Friday and said, ""What I said earlier was as a worried Indian. What did I say this time that I am being termed as a traitor? I am expressing concerns about the country I love, the country that is my home. How is that a crime?""

""It will be very difficult to capture this djinn back into the bottle again. There is complete impunity for those who take law into their own hands. In many areas we are witnessing that the death of a cow is more significance than that of a police officer,"" he added.

On December 3, Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh and a student, Sumit Kumar, were killed in mob violence in Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr district after cow carcasses were found strewn around.

The Bollywood actor on Thursday said that he is scared for his children with the lives of cows being valued more over lives of policemen. With tensions boiling over Shah's remarks, Dutt took to Twitter and asked the actor whether he felt scared during the previous terrorist attacks and riots in the country.

""Those who are scared for their kids today, Naseeruddin Shah, were they not scared during the 1984 riots, or the 1993 Mumbai blasts or during the attacks of 26/11?"" he wrote.

The athlete further questioned Shah for signing the mercy plea of Yakub Memon, who was given a death sentence in July 2015. Shah was among the several eminent persons who had signed the plea written to the President Pranab Mukherjee. ""When a terrorist group kidnapped Indian and Bangladesh citizens, and later released Bangladeshis because of their religion, but killed all the 39 Indian citizens - were you not angry then? Were you not afraid while signing the mercy plea of the terrorist Yakub Memon?"" Dutt asked.

The 2012 Olympic Bronze medallist further asked Shah to not refer to himself as a patriot after sympathizing with the terrorists. ""We are equally upset for all those who lost their lives in Bulandshahr, but you were not afraid during the previous riots and terrorist attacks in the country when innocent citizens lost their lives. This shows whose side are you on, please do not call yourself a patriot after sympathizing with terrorists,"" he said.

Government schools have to resort to buying water from tankers when the borewells fail or there is a problem with electricity to pump the water up. Cooking mid-day meals, water for washing the dishes, for the small garden which they sometimes have and above all water for using the toilets becomes a challenge in the absence of a reliable source.

One way of addressing the problem and providing supplemental water for schools is to build a rainwater harvesting system which collects rooftop rainwater in underground sump tanks. Thanks to funding from WIPRO Cares and some good work by Manjunath, a self-trained plumber, 10 schools now have rooftop rainwater harvesting systems. The school heads and teachers met recently to discuss how the system was working, the challenges encountered in maintaining them and what lessons were learnt from the experience. The Block Education Officer turned up, which was a pleasant surprise to the teachers assembled. She exhorted them to continue the good work, maintain the systems and to strike partnerships with companies for CSR funds and NGOs for implementation of water and sanitation especially since the region was dry and water tables were falling.

Apart from the water supplement that it brings, rainwater harvesting teaches many lessons for the children. For example, with the help of a small rain gauge they learn how much it rains in their school area. Even a rainfall of 500 mm over a 200 square metre roof area means 100,000 litres of rainwater to collect and harvest, a figure that usually surprises them.

With small experimental testing kits and guidance, they check the quality of rainwater for its pH, its bacterial content and its chemical content. They learn how rainwater filters work and how sump tanks need to be maintained for cleanliness. The usage of water for drinking and for cooking, for the toilet and for washing dishes is calculated and they learn the demand put on water. They learn to notice where the used water goes and whether it is treated or left untreated.

Children also become aware about aquifers, groundwater, its quality and its challenge in terms of fluoride, nitrates and other contaminants that are becoming common. They learn to test and identify good groundwater sources in their villages and towns.

It requires sustained hand holding and an interested and committed group to make this possible. Funds from companies and other donors is of great value. Working with teachers and the school management council is a skill that takes time and patience to acquire.

Above all, it takes a local committed plumber like Manjunath to be in constant touch with schools, repair pipes, clean filters and generally counsel and assist the school in taking care of its water and sanitation systems.

In the great endeavour of a clean India and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 6- Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, it is necessary for a society and a nation to invest in schools and the schoolchildren to help them become water literate and be wise stewards of water in the future.

In this lies water wisdom and in this we must not fail."

""I had received regional education as a child. Ratna is from a liberal household, so she had next to none. And we chose not to give any religious education to our children. Because I believe that being good or evil has nothing to do with religion.

""We taught them what our beliefs are. I did make them learn a few verses from the Quran Sharif because I believe reciting them improves one's articulation, Just like one's Hindi articulation improves after reading the Ramayana and Mahabharata in its original (form),"" he said.

Elaborating on why he feels anxious about his children, Naseeruddin said: ""Because tomorrow if a mob surrounds them, and asks, 'are you a Hindu or a Muslim?'... They will have no answer. It worries me because I don't see the situation improving anytime soon.

""These matters don't scare me. They make me angry. And I want that every right-thinking person should feel angry, not scared. This is our home, who can dare to evict us from here?"" he asked."

According to reports, the aspirant Safina Khan Soudagar accused the inspecting officials conducting the NET in Panaji of not allowing her to appear for the 18th December exam because she refused to remove her 'hijab' (headscarf).

She reached the exam centre at 1 pm on Tuesday 18th December and stood in the queue waiting for the entrance checking where the officer asked her to remove her hijab as it is ""against her religious belief"".

Speaking to News18, Safina said, ""When I told them I couldn't do that, they insisted I had to show my ears for a photograph. After much debating, I said I would re-adjust my hijab so that my ears were visible and requested them to direct me to a washroom to do the same,"" she further said.

She alleged that officials refused to allow her to go to a washroom and instructed her to re-adjust her hijab right there. 'Removing hijab in public is against my Islamic belief because there were a lot of men around,"" Soudagar said.

She chose to keep her religious faith above her academic loss and didn't enter the exam hall after she was informed that she would not be allowed to enter the examination hall with her headscarf.

A Muslim woman from North Goa on Thursday alleged denial of right to appear for the National Eligibility Test (NET) with hijab by the authorities in Panaji.

In a complaint addressed to Nila Mohanan, Secretary for Education, with copies marked to various other authorities, Safina Khan Saudagar (24), a writer and a post-graduate degree holder in Psychology, narrated the entire sequence of events that allegedly led to her being denied entry to write the NET earlier this week.

At a press conference in Panaji on Thursday, she said she would write to Union Minister for Human Resource Development Prakash Javadekar and approach Goa State Human Rights Commission over the issue, ""so that such injustice does not affect other persons, irrespective of communities, in future"".

She said women of different faith have had to bear the brunt of ''derogatory'' rules and forced to remove their belts, hair-clips, jewellery and sacred threads.

Upon reaching the gates at 1:30 pm on Tuesday, Ms Saudagar said she was denied entry during the security check and was asked to remove her hijab (religious head covering) to go ahead for the examination. When she informed the man that she cannot take off her hijab as it pertains to her religious belief and modesty, he insisted that she remove it. His senior officer, a lady, asked her to comply or she would not be allowed to answer her exam, she said.

""She informed me that my ears need to be visible for a photograph and I agreed to it. I asked them to show me to a washroom to be able to redo my hijab to accommodate their request, but they refused and instead asked me to do it in the open with no privacy,"" said Ms. Saudagar.

She was further told that she would have to sit through the entire exam without her headscarf or she would not be allowed to answer, she added

""Article 14 of the Indian constitution provides that I be treated equally. Article 21 of the Indian constitution provides that I cannot be deprived of my personal liberty. Articles 25-28 provide that I have freedom to practice my religion. Therefore, such behaviour is unacceptable in a secular State and is a matter of harassment,"" Ms. Saudagar said in her complaint.

She further said that there were no rules specified on the NET website or elsewhere with regards to restrictions on the hijab or a particular dress code. If there were changes made to the rules, the candidates should have been informed of the same much prior to the examination date, she said.

Ms. Saudagar also pointed out that she was in a hijab in the photograph attached to her online application, and if there had been a change in rules, her application should not have been accepted and the reason should have been specified.

""It has cost me time, effort, money and has also raised questions on my religious identity, humiliated me and belittled my beliefs. Furthermore, I have appeared for NET exam previously, there were no such restrictions forced upon us then. I would like to know on what basis was I not allowed to appear for the exam when there are no specific rules mentioned,"" she asked the authorities in her complaint.

""I would want to know on what authority did the officials at the gate decide to restrict me from answering. I would like to know if it were a matter of security, why weren't arrangements made to protect a woman's modesty or religious belief with no disregard to security measures when it could have been made possible,"" she asked.

When contacted for her reaction to the complaint, Ms. Mohanan initially said that she could not comment till she saw the complaint. When contacted later in the evening on Thursday, Ms. Mohanan added that she had been extremely busy with a Cabinet meeting on Thursday and had not seen the complaint till then.

However, she assured The Hindu that she would see Ms. Saudagar on Friday, discuss with the Department and then respond."

The cloak that reaches below the knees is usually made of either of wool or jamewar which is a mixture of wool and cotton.

The order was originally meant for the state secretariat. In September, the General Administration Department of the Civil Secretariat in Srinagar asked government officials to ""be attired in proper formal dress while appearing before any court of law and while attending offices in the State of Jammu and Kashmir and strictly avoid casual or party attire"".

The decision was a security directive. However, the zonal education officer (ZEO) in Langate, following the civil secretariat directive, issued an order last week banning the pheran in educational institutions.

A stream of protest erupted on Twitter criticising the ban, forcing the school department to retract the order. However, the security protocol at the secretariat remains.

Former chief minister, Omar Abdullah, tweeted: ""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned! This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn.""

He added: ""My father and I have worn pherans to official functions many times over the years and will continue to do so, silly government orders notwithstanding. #dontbanourpheran #revokepheranban.""

Mohammad Shafi War, the chief education officer of Kupwara said that the order was withdrawn on Tuesday. He said: ""There is an official dress code but we cannot ignore the significance of pheran. That is why we have withdrawn the order issued by ZEO Langate.""

Kashmiris love their 'pherans'. These loose, warm outer garments are typically worn during winters.

'Pheran' has a long history in Kashmir, and is believed to have a tradition of at least 660 years. Worn over centuries by the inhabitants to brave the harsh winter chill, the garment has worked as a great leveller of the Kashmiri society. It has traditionally dissolved the class difference, being the preferred dress for both the rich and the poor during the cold season. Even when modernity permeated the lives of Kashmiris over the years, the pheran continued to remain a badge of its culture.

Though the etymology is a little unclear, some believe the name pheran is derived from the Greek word 'apron'. Many contend that the tunic owes its origin to the Persian word for shirt,'perahan'. The Tajik word 'peraband' is also closely associated with the Kashmiri pheran. Since Kashmir has a distinct central Asian cultural link, that may well be the case"

Tina is married to fellow IAS topper Athar Aamir Khan, who hails from Kashmir.

Tina and Aamir had got married earlier this year. Since then, the all India number 1 rank holder IAS officer changed her social media description to address her as a proud Kashmiri bahu (daughter-in-law). She later also added Khan in her surname.

Shah's reference to the mob violence in UP's Bulandshahr, where clashes over alleged cow slaughter led to the death of a police inspector early this month, drew sharp reactions from the BJP and right-wingers, just as superstar Aamir Khan's fears about 'rising intolerance'did three years ago.

Shah said he doesn't see ""the situation improving any time soon"" and voiced his anxiety about his children's future in a communally charged environment.

In a video interview to Karwan-e-Mohabbat India, a collective focused on highlighting and combating hate crimes and lynching, Shah said he felt anxious about the future of his children.

""I feel anxious for my children because tomorrow if a mob surrounds them and asks, 'Are you a Hindu or a Muslim?', they will have no answer.""

""They (his children) do not have a religion. I had received religious education as a child. Ratna (his wife who is a Hindu) belongs to a liberal household, so she had received none,"" said Shah.

On December 3, inspector Subodh Kumar Singh was killed in mob violence over alleged cow slaughter in Bulandshahr. Five people have been arrested so far. However, the main accused is absconding. Shah said he is ""angry"" and believes ""every right-thinking man must be angry and must not fear"". He added: ""This is our home. Who can dare to evict us from here?""

The actor condemned the ""impunity provided to those who take the law into their hands"". ""The poison has already spread and it is difficult to put this djinn back into the bottle,"" said Shah.

Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant termed Shah's statement ""a blunder"" and said that he ""deplores"" the actor's comments. ""If his children are caught in a mob they should say they are Hindustani (Indians) Why are they scared?"" Sawant asked.

The actor also expressed anxiety over the well-being of his children, who he said had not been brought up as followers of any particular religion and would not be able to identify themselves on religious lines if confronted by a bloodthirsty mob.

Shah's comments evoked outrage among certain social media users and soul-searching among others. Shah, who is married to actor Ratna Pathak Shah, said they chose not to give any religious education to their children -- Imaad and Vivaan -- as he believed ""being good or evil has nothing to do with religion"". ""I feel anxious for my children because tomorrow if a mob surrounds them and asks, 'Are you a Hindu or a Muslim?' they will have no answer,"" he said.

Shah's remarks in an interview with Karwan-e-Mohabbat India were viewed as an apparent reference to the recent violence in Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr district, where a policeman and a civilian were killed during protests over alleged cow slaughter. After the incident, the state police said investigating who committed cow slaughter was the most important aspect of the case.

In the interview posted on YouTube on Monday, Shah said the ""poison has already spread"" and it will now be difficult to contain it. ""There is complete impunity for those who take the law into their own hands. In many areas we are witnessing that the death of a cow is of more significance than that of a police officer,"" he said.

The ban on the pheran, the result of a supposed misinterpretation of a Jammu and Kashmir government order asking officials to ""be attired in proper formal dress"", may have been withdrawn, but not before it created a storm on social media.

The local education officer who had issued it subsequently withdrew the order, but lovers of the pheran were already pouring out their anger on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram by posting their own pictures wearing the state's best-known fashion creation - one that it has been most identified with since Sharmila Tagore dimpled her way through Kashmir Ki Kali in 1964 wearing a pheran with flowers in her hair.

Also read: This is not the first time the pheran has been caught in Kashmir crossfire

Leading the online storm were two Kashmiri women - Shazia Bakshi (@shazia on Twitter), granddaughter of former Jammu and Kashmir prime minister Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed, who runs a travel agency in Delhi, and Roohi Nazki (@chaijaai on Instagram) in Srinagar, the brain behind the well-known tearoom, Chai Jaai (tea place in Kashmiri). Bakshi tweeted under the hashtag #Saynotopharanban and tagged well known Kashmiris and her close friends, among them IAS officer Shah Faesal and R.J. Nasir. Nazki, the wife of former PDP powerhouse and well-known economist Haseeb Drabu, started a contest on social media with the hashtag #pheranlove asking people to post pictures of themselves wearing the pheran on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, and add a line on why they love their pheran.

Bakshi says she started her campaign after noticing former chief minister Omar Abdullah's tweet on 17 December, which said the ""regressive order"" made no sense. ""Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter aside from being part of our identity,"" he tweeted along with pictures of himself and his father wearing pherans. Indeed, pherans are practical because they are large enough to carry the kangri inside, which can only be described as a portable coal heater. Bakshi who asked people to post their pictures wearing the pheran with the additional hashtag #proudtobeakashmiri is delighted the ""stupid ban"" has been revoked. The Lady Shri Ram graduate was an administrator with Delhi Public School Srinagar and founder member of the youth wing of CII in Srinagar.

Nazki, whose intricately designed cafe sits atop the famous Mahatta's photo studio, says the ""Pheran is not just a garment for us, but also a piece of history and heritage that we wear on our sleeves as it were"". She says she wanted to make the point that the ban is socially unacceptable and culturally offensive but in a ""positive way"". The contest asking people to express their love for the pheran has been flooded with entries. ""We are sharing 24×7 because we want to honour the sentiment of all those who have shared their beautiful memories with us,"" she says. And indeed from cherubic babies to pretty girls in red lips to cool kittens, the photographs say it all. There are over 800 posts hashtagged #pheranlove so far, while Bakshi's #saynotopharanban post on Twitter has over 660 likes.

Proof that even in these times of social media being used to divide and deride, some good can come out of deploying it for a just cause. So, the next time Bollywood's half-Kashmiri rising star Alia Bhatt decides to wear the pheran, as she did in Imtiaz Ali's Highway (2014), it won't be merely a fashion statement, but perhaps also a political expression?

The Committee observed that this would serve the twin purposes of promoting of ease of doing business and better corporate compliance.

The liability under section 447 which deals with corporate fraud would continue to apply wherever fraud is noticed.

Castes of the students were found written before the names of the students in the attendance register of both the schools. In Vaishali school, they were even segregated in classrooms on the basis of their religion and caste.

Education department primary director Giriwar Dayal Singh suspended acting principal of GA Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya Meena Kumari at Lalganj block in Vaishali district and Kamlesh Kumar Swalambi of Uchha Vidyalaya Tenua at Kalyanpur block in East Champaran district after the district education officers of respective districts submitted a report in this connection.

The school also had separate sections for students belonging to separate castes. Acting principal Meera Kumari said, ""This practice was prevalent since 2014 and it was started by former principal Phool Chand Ansari as a tool to save time and quick implementation of government schemes catering to particular caste.""

The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the long-pending Consumer Protection Bill 2018, paving way for effective protection of consumer rights and safeguarding their interests.

Speaking to DNA, Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said, ""Since the introduction of the crucial bill in the Parliament, we have lobbied a lot for its passage at the earliest. It is noteworthy that the bill has been passed by the Lok Sabha. Hopefully, it would be passed in the Rajya Sabha soon.""

The bill focuses on three important points. One, it aims at strengthening the rights of the consumers and it is important that the consumer rights need to be protected. Second, the inclusion of severities in the bill against misleading advertisement. Third, the bill will check adulteration.

The development is crucial especially in the current scenario wherein consumers are forced to go through the hassles of getting defective products replaced and/ or claiming refunds in addition to misleading through deceptive advertisements.

The bill puts the liability of product quality on manufacturers, said Pritee Shah, chief general manager, Consumer Education and Research Centre (CERC). While e-commerce marketplaces will be responsible for the sale of counterfeit products, celebrities will also be responsible, along with the advertisers, for endorsing a product.

""Manufacturers will have to be diligent before the launch of products. They will have to mandatorily recall faulty products. In the case of misleading advertisements, companies will have to withdraw advertisements and bring in corrective advertisements. Celebrities will not be able to blindly endorse products. They can seek clinical reports from manufacturers before endorsing,"" said Shah.

When contacted, executives from HUL, ITC, Dabur, Marico, Mondelez, Godrej, Samsung, LG and Panasonic were not available for comment. Queries emailed remained unanswered at the time of going to print.

It certainly is a necessary a wake-up call for consumer goods makers to become more responsible, said N Chandramouli, chief executive officer, TRA Research, a brand insight company. The onus gets clearly pinned on the company, but more importantly, if convicted, the brand's trust also will get impacted.

""Consumer should be the ultimate yardstick for judging any such act. And if the consumer has a better say, it's a good thing. However, there can be truant customers too, and companies will have to deal with a small portion of such false claims. All-in-all, if the companies become more responsible towards consumers, it is a good move,"" said Chandramouli.

The bill proposes the creation of five bureaus catering to different consumer verticals. These bureaus will have suo motu authority to take actions against unfair trade practices and even force companies to recall products. Moreover, the jurisdiction has been liberalised. Cases of up to Rs 50 lakh will be dealt with District Forums, those up to Rs 10 crore by State Commissions and those beyond Rs 10 crore will be dealt with by Central Commission. With online sales getting traction, e-commerce marketplaces will be liable for selling counterfeit and illegal products as well.

The bill has strong provisions to check adulteration and misleading ads penalise manufacturers with a hefty fine as well as imprisonment. ""False claims in advertising is as bad for customers as false news is for readers. Such falsity misuses inherent vulnerabilities in the consumer, who inherently trusts brands, till proven otherwise. Claims must be based on strong research by credible third-party studies and not by the brand's own studies. This is perhaps the most important part of the bill,"" said Chandramouli.

Knowing the loopholes in the law, consumer companies have been misusing it so far. Be it packaging, advertising or POPs, the gullible consumer is being taken for a ride by many big and small brands alike. ""We've all been taken in by claims like -- 'Strongest', 'Best', 'Improved', 'Extra iron added' so far. Now it's time for brands to be cautious about claims like this,"" said Chandramouli.

The Consumer Protection Bill has strong provisions to check adulteration and misleading ads, and to penalise manufacturers with hefty fine as well as imprisonment. Making use of the loopholes in the law, consumer companies have been misusing it so far."

Veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah has said that he is worried for his children in today's India.

He's worried because he imagines a situation where his children may be surrounded by an angry mob and asked: Are you Hindu or Muslim? My children will have no answer, Shah says, Because we chose not to give a religious education to our children.

In a statement issued to NGO Karwan-eMohabbat for their YouTube channel, the actor said that he is worried for children in today's India. The actor says that there is a poison' that has spread in the Indian society.

It will be very difficult to capture this djinn back into the bottleThere is complete impunity for those who take the law into their own hands, Shah says. We have already witnessed that the death of a cow has more significance than that of a police officer.

Shah was referring to the recent Bulandshahr violence in which a police officer was killed by a mob. The violence was sparked by the discovery of cow carcasses.The Uttar Pradesh Police has arrested five people in connection with the alleged cow slaughter. The policeman's killers remain free.

In a video, Shah says, I was given a religious education. But my wife, Ratna, did not get any religious education and we chose not to give a religious education to our children.

He adds that he believes good and evil have nothing to do with religion' and so his children were not brought up in a religious environment.

So, I fear for my children. Because if a mob gathers around them and asks them are you a Hindu or Muslim, they will not have any answer... Because they have no religion,"" he says, before signing off with, I am angry and I believe every right thinking man must be angry and must not fear.

Criticising Shah for his remarks, BJP MP Rakesh Sinha said, Nasiruddin Shah should first ask Rohingyas to leave Hindustan as according to him India is unsafe for him and his family. An artist should not be part of sinister design of anti-civil society propaganda. His statement shows his low thinking.

Sena MP from South Mumbai Arvind Sawant said: Shah's statement is a blunder. If his kids are caught in a mob; His kids should say they are Indians /Hindustani. Why are they scared? People like him, who are celebrities, should not leave their balance.

He added, I feel bad and sad because people like Shah who have spent his entire life in India and is a noted actor...should not destroy the harmony of the country, I deplore his statement. Such statements will hit at the roots of the country which are still strong.

India's largest online food-ordering service, Swiggy, has raised a mammoth $1 billion in fresh funding led by South African internet and media conglomerate Naspers, pulling its valuation up to $3.3 billion. This represents a fivefold increase in the company's valuation since the start of 2018.

The latest round is also the single-largest investment in India's fast-growing food-tech sector, where Swiggy is engaged in an intense battle with rivals such as Zomato, FoodPanda and UberEats. Apart from Naspers, the round also saw participation from Tencent, and hedge funds Hillhouse Capital and Wellington Management Company.

According to sources, about $200 million of the $1-billion investment in Swiggy will go towards buying shares from existing investors. Business Standard was not able to ascertain the names of investors involved in the secondary share, but no investor is understood to have fully exited its investment in Swiggy yet.

""We first partnered Swiggy in April 2017 because we recognised the Swiggy team had built a sustainable, long-term business, that stood out amongst others in India,"" said Larry Illg, chief executive officer (CEO) at the food and ventures division at Naspers. ""Now, nearly two years later, we have even more confidence (that) Swiggy has the winning formula.""

Naspers, one of the leading tech investors in the world, has been active in India over the past couple of years. The company has sunk millions of dollars into Flipkart, PayU, and ibibo Group, among others. The Cape Town-headquartered firm also led a $540 million investment round in education firm Byju's earlier this month.

Swiggy has shown phenomenal growth since launching the service in Bengaluru in August 2014.

The company is present in over 50 Indian cities and towns with a network of 50,000 restaurants seeded on its platform. The company says it has signed up 35,000 of these only in the last six months. As of November, the company had witnessed 25 million monthly transactions on its platforms which is expected to have gone up further now.

""As we add more firepower to our vision of elevating quality of life for urban consumers by offering unparalleled convenience, we're pleased that visionary global investors share our purpose and have made such a significant investment in our future,"" Swiggy's CEO Sriharsha Majety said in a statement.

Swiggy plans to use the capital to grow its supply chain, apart from investing in new initiatives such as setting up of cloud kitchens.

Even though India's food-tech space is seeing significant traction from global investors, almost all players operating in this space, including Zomato, Foodpanda and UnderEats, continue to burn huge amounts of fund in wooing new customers.

For example, even though Swiggy had more than tripled its revenue to Rs 4.4 billion in FY18, the company's losses also mounted to Rs 3.9 billion from Rs 2.05 in the previous fiscal year. Zomato, its closest rival, saw its revenue growing by 40 per cent during the same period to Rs 4.66 billion though it managed to cut losses by nearly 80 per cent to Rs 1.06 billion. The losses are only expected to go up further as since March this year all the big players in this space have gone on a spending spree to acquire new customers, expand their reach to newer cities while also offering huge discounts to customers and cutting commissions earned from restaurants.

Experts say India's food-tech sector, like online retail, will see just two or three large players surviving at the end. Already, there are just four large players in the market, with Swiggy and Zomato leading the pack. One wave consolidation happened back in 2016 when a number of food-tech firms such as Tinyowl and Holachef had to wind up their operations, another such consolidation is expected to come in the next couple of years.

""Food services is one of the biggest categories in the market. You are looking at over 100,000 organised restaurants and underlying market of at least around $30 billion,"" said Karan Sharma, executive director and co-head of at digital & technology investment banking at Avendus which advised Swiggy in this transaction."

The driver of the excavator, which was digging an adjacent plot and was being driven too close to the wall, was also arrested.

The school owner, Amit Bhati, told TOI that in March 2017, he had given the plot to Sanjeev Jha, principal of the school, and Raghvender Solanki, vice-principal, against Rs 10,000 a month. He denied any share in the school's profits. Asked about the affiliation, Bhati said he was not aware of it.

""Jha and Solanki told me the school was registered with some board. I was there at the time when the wall collapsed and helped the local residents in the initial rescue operations. But the villagers started blaming me for the accident and beat me up. I ran for my life,"" Amit said.

Circle officer Swetabh Pandey, however, said that Amit had started the school under the name, Devi Kunj. He closed the school for three months after the education department sent a notice but resumed classes after changing the name of the school to KM Public School, the police said.

According to Amit, the adjacent plot that was being dug, too, belongs to him. ""It belongs to me on paper. My uncle Deshraj Bhati is in no way involved,"" he said. Deshraj Bhati has been named in the FIR in connection with the case.

Police contested Amit's claim. ""He is trying to save his uncle. In the investigation, we have found that the adjacent plot belongs to Deshraj, who is also an accused in the case. Deshraj did not take permission to undertake construction on the land,"" Pandey said.

The district administration has announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh for the families of the two students who died, but are yet to release the money. ""The administration is doing nothing for us.

It is recognised that the power of the police to fulfil their functions and duties depends on public approval of their existence, actions and behaviour and on their ability to secure public respect. Key phrase above is the 'Public approval'. As society progressed, world waked up to the idea of modern policing. The very existence of Police as a separate entity having civilian functions can be traced back to 19th century. Unlike 'Metropolitan bobby' policing model prevailing in London that time, India( British blue-eyed colony) however could only manage to get Royal Irish constabulary policing system in place from its British masters.

The Indian model was designed to infuse fear and awe in the public. Whereas London model revolved around civilian policing which propounded "" Police is public and Public is police"". Former emphasised on Police being a Force, the regime force. Revolt of 1857 against British shook the very foundation of it's empire whose tremors reached up to Britain itself. Result was ""Indian police act 1861'' was introduced in India which stood prophetic even after 157 years. After attaining independence in 1947, minor changes were made to Police law in the forms of Bombay Police Act, Delhi Police Act etc, mostly they were replica of Indian police act 1861.

British Legacies prevalent

Institutionally, it is bizarre to govern the 21st century land and people by the 19th century laws. It brings a yawning gap between the reality and idealism. To cite few examples, laws like Indian Police Act 1861, Indian Penal Code 1860, Indian Evidence Act 1872 etc are still there on the hot seat of police and law governance. The criminal and civil laws have been amended now and then which in turn often breeds ad hocism as the amendment in the law caters to a particular case or situation setting aside the wider application. Being an ally of convenience and not conviction, the humongous growth of piecemeal amendments erode the stability of legal jurisprudence as laws are interrelated ,one change requires changes in other laws too. Section 25 of Indian Police Act 1861 defines responsibility for a police officer to obey lawful orders of his superior. The much bigger audience to whom he is responsible to and accountable to is common public. The narrow narrative of legal responsibility sometime defeats the much wider directive principle of Article 38 of the constitution( welfare state). Thomas Jefferson sounds right when he says"" when a man assumes public trust, he should consider himself a public property"".

Police Ailments

"" It is not that they can't see the solution. It is that they can't see the problem"". G.k Chesterton words seems apt. The best way to assuage popular disaffection is to first admit, yes the problem lies here. Then work on them. From culture of immunity and unaccountability, abuse of power to culture of impunity, problems are too many. Lack of autonomy is an initiator to the vicious cycle of despair, stress, low work efficiency, self estrangement, poor interpersonal relations, alienation and in extreme cases even suicide. Political interference in personnel administration of police make things worse through politicisation of police.

Nithari kaand, Jessica Lal cases highlight the rampant corruption practices in the system which aggravates the already growing trust deficit between citizenry and police. Poor service conditions on the other hand is a nightmare.

Overburdened police, more than 5 lakh vacancies, diversion of major chunk of troops for BandoBast ( VVIPs and politicians security)and Adm duties deprive police of their regular policing duties. Mostly they have no festivals, poor living conditions, family being away which all pile up to result into Bad policing.

Training has seldom dared to make pace with the changing times and modern crimes. Police constabulary has faced the worst burnt of inadequate training. More emphasis on physical aspect( Drill, PT etc) neglects the cognitive development which is of dire need in the streets of India. Cyber crimes, new ways of human trafficking, cruelty by intimate partner, persecution for dowry, insult to modesty etc need much more than a 400 meter sprint by a cop. Human rights education, e- education, making them tech savvy would be few steps to train them according to current demand of situations. Even to maintain status quo these days one has to move continuously with the background. Because ""If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change"".

Committees and commissions

Plethora of recommendations from Superabundance of committees has helped nobody except the members of the committees. In 1902 Frazer commission gave negative, oppressive, inefficient and terrifying picture of British police. Thanks to financial paucity, no committee was set up in stating years of post independent India. National Police Commission (NPC) was appointed in 1978 under chairmanship of Mr. Dharam Vira. NPC came up with 8 reports, main recommendations being- replace Indian Police Act 1861 by new one, set up 'State Security Commission' to act as one stop centre of policy making and entertaining complaints of common public against erring police officers, tenurial security of DGP ( 4 years), gradual separation in police wings dealing with law & order duties and crime investigation. Fall of government at the centre ensured putting of old recommendations in cold storage.

In 1995 Public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Prakash Singh and N.K Singh asked for the enforcement of NPC's recommendations. In reply to the Supreme Court, new government labelled NPC's recommendations as old and rather pressed for a new committee. Then started the game of committee committee.

The extended family of committees on police reforms- 1998 Julio Ribeiro committee, K. Padmanabhaiah committee, Kamal Nath committee set up to study 627 old recommendations, soli Sorabjee committee. Fate was same for all of them, one bogged down by another. People needed more on ground and less on paper. But no one found the ground. Someone has to tell that how much is too much. Implementing the suggestions can be life saving as, a wrong decision is not forever, it can be reversed. The losses from a delayed decision are forever; they can never be retrieved.

Reforms on the street

Civic action programmes, Police public meets, cricket matches etc all aim to have proximity of public with khakhi. But few men do it everyday, every moment singlehandedly without any budgetary support as a daily routine.The turmoil ridden state of J&K which has been on a boil for past three decades, has often witnessed the utmost cynicism in public eye for state officials. Man with a rank of Inspector General of Police ( IGP), and name Basant Rath(IPS) while discharging his duties as IG traffic J&K, implemented many committees recommendations of improving public trust, make public as active participants rather than passive recipients of services in administration. Such was a trust and hope story scripted by him and exhibited by his team that people used to surround him and click burst of selfies with him. Euphoria for a policeman was unprecedented. His approach having two ends, on one end it was,'Leadership by moving around'(His office being the macadamised floor and footpaths) and on other end it was Broken window approach (violation of traffic rules dealt strenuously and strictly. From women to school children, from an octogenarian to a toddler everyone started connecting to this public official. Result: challans increased tenfold, helmet sales soared, matadors overloading reduced, students allowed to travel on half fare, women to get priority seats in public transport. And seat belts got a hug from the car drivers at last.

Question arises why this 'Servant first approach' ( best ruler is, which is best ruled )could not be emulated by others at mass scale. Why did not he gave excuse of police reforms for his failures. Why he did not accuse the state for his lacunae. Presumably he had faith on himself and constitution of India. Much faith on the powers given by All India services, and extreme faith in people whom he served.

The way forward is every time state and government cannot be blamed for our inactions. Ultimately what matters is what you have done with the things at yours disposal. Esther Dyson puts it rightly,"" I think of who I am as what I have done"". There is no dearth of opportunity to do justice to one's job towards general public. Or other lane to dooms day is to wait for the gospel reforms which would turn the world upside down. Latter is an utopia. Because those gospel reforms again would need implementation. Time is ripe for action. Selfless Acton. Action for people of India. By the people of India.

On Police commemoration day this year, Prime Minister of India emotionally said"" words can never describe the valour and dedication of our Policemen, their bravery. Their sacrifice will always inspire us.""

Instead of declaring us unfit for combat roles without giving us a chance, dare us and we shall prove you wrong. The media quoted you as saying that ""she will say somebody is peeping, so we will have to give a sheet around her"". Please tackle the Peeping Tom and not the woman objecting to him.

I am committing the temerity of questioning you and the wisdom and experience of your outstanding career in the Indian army. As a citizen of India, I have full respect for your leadership and will come to the point without any further ado. I am writing about a statement attributed to you a few days ago, voicing your doubts regarding the assigning of combat roles to women in the Indian army.

I was brought up to believe that I have the freedom to choose the career I want and the life I wish to lead. I am well aware that far too many of my sisters across the country have not been as fortunate in this regard. For centuries, we have been ""boxed"" into certain roles that you have mentioned. We do not question the beauty and strength that comes from being nurturers. We are proud to be home-makers, mothers, sisters and wives. But what if we also want more -- for instance, the freedom to choose?

Many men have helped us in our many struggles to come out of the box. I thought that you are one such supportive soldier, instead of being the one to tell us, nay order us, to be what you consider we ""should be"". Do not let me and millions like me down, General.

You know how tired we are of being told that we are second-grade citizens. You are also well aware that within families, many of us are made to do with left-overs as our food. Spending on our health and education is minimal. We are not safe on the roads and most unsafe in public spaces after dark, or so our families think. There are so many restrictions on our movements and hurdles to our growth.

Advertising

We have just about managed to come out of confined spaces and we are slowly gaining confidence in our own capabilities. It has not been an easy journey, as you know. But we have been steady and determined to make full use of the equality and freedom bestowed on us not by any individual but by the Constitution of India. We are in the process of utilising our rights and opportunities to develop our full potential. I am distressed that instead of rejoicing at our marching ahead in full steam you would want us to retreat.

Mistake it not, General, all we want is the freedom to choose. See how Mary Kom made the country proud when she chose the unconventional sport called boxing. At 35, her home is full of the well-deserved medals and also with the children she loves. There was no ""ruckus"" when she became pregnant nor did child birth or child rearing adversely affect her performance or commitment to her sport. And look at her husband who respected her choices and supported her.

In fact, the last Asian Games show that girls have finally arrived. Vinesh Phogat (wrestling), Rahi Sarnobat (shooting), Swapna Barman (heptathlon) must have been told that they cannot, yet they did. I am sure that they drew their strength from their families who believe that girls can indeed balance homes and careers.

General, many of the flights that you and I routinely take have women either as captains or first flight officers. Was it possible in India, say 60 years back? With both men and women accepting and supporting them, girls in India have dared to touch the forbidden clouds. Not to forget Bachendri Pal who became the first Indian woman to climb the Everest way back in 1984 followed by so many adventurous and ambitious girls. Then why should we shy away from the combat role?

Instead of declaring us unfit for combat roles without giving us a chance, dare us and we shall prove you wrong. The media quoted you as saying that ""...she will say somebody is peeping, so we will have to give a sheet around her"". Please tackle the Peeping Tom and not the woman objecting to him. Some doubts about the combat role for women in the Indian army are expected, but not from you, General. You, in your position of leadership, are expected to innovate and encourage new ideas, lead us on the uncharted roads. How can you become a prisoner of the age-old stereotypes that you are supposed to discourage and discard?

Anyway, the message on the wall is clear for all to see. We, the women of India, have realised that we are not only the mistresses of our destiny but also capable of creating our destinies. There is no stopping us now. ""Combat or no combat"" will be our choice and not anyone else's. Sorry for being blunt, General, but in my school, I learnt that equality and freedom of choice are the soul of our Constitution and I internalised it. With no apology, I claim my right to choose.

Warm regards and season's greetings

The Sambalpur Police Thursday formed a special team to investigate the torching of the office of the Board of Secondary Education (BSE), here on Wednesday.

A special team has been formed under the leadership of Sadar Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) to investigate the incident, said Sambalpur Superintendent of Police, Sanjeev Arora.

The SP said, a case has been registered under various sections of IPC in connection with the torching of BSE office and the police team has begun the investigation to identify the people involved in the incident.

Action will be taken against those found involved, he said adding that the police team has also been directed to collect CCTV footage of the nearby area of the BSE office for identification of the culprits.

The incident took place in the afternoon on Wednesday. Around 8 to 10 unidentified people barged into the BSE office when the staff were working, police said.

They asked the office staff to leave the building and allegedly set the office on fire after ransacking it. Many important documents, furniture besides certificates were gutted in the fire, police said.

Deputy Secretary of the BSE, Sambalpur Zone, Suryamani Majhi said: ""we are yet to assess the loss. We will check the office in presence of police on Friday. The actual data on loss of documents besides certificates could be ascertained after the checking.

Shah sparked a controversy after he apparently referred to the incident in Bulandshahr where violence erupted over the allegations of cow slaughter, leading to the death of a police officer and a civilian in the riots. In a YouTube interview, Shah said ""We have already witnessed that the death of a cow has more significance (in today's India) than that of a police officer.""

On December 3, violent clashes took place between protesters and police after the former allegedly discovered cattle carcasses in a forest and claimed that the cattle had been 'slaughtered'. In the ensuing riots, police inspector Subodh Kumar Singh and a civilian, identified as Sumit, were killed. Naseeruddin Shah's comments spark row: 'Cow more significant than a cop; I fear for my kids in India' - WATCH

Reacting sharply to Shah's criticism of the 'intolerant' atmosphere in the country, BJP leader Ramesh Bidhuri reportedly said that Shah should take his kids to Pakistan ""and settle there"", as per Indiatvnews.com. BJP MP in Rajya Sabha, Rakesh Sinha, also did not take Shah's comments too kindly and said that his statement showed his 'low thinking.""

In his tweet, Sinha said, ""Nasiruddin Shah should first ask Rohingyas to leave Hindustan as according to him India is unsafe for him and his family! An artist should not be part of sinister design of anti cil society propaganda. His statement shows his low thinking (sic)"". He also accused Shah of being a part of a conspiracy to ""defame India.""

BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra also told Times Now that he believed that Shah's comments were simply a ""PR stunt."" He said, ""This is not a tolerance and intolerance debate. This is a PR stunt.""

Meanwhile, rebel Aam Aadmi Party leader, Kapil Mishra, also slammed Shah on his statement, asking him why he had not raised a voice during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots or when Kashmiri Pandits were forced to flee their homes in Jammu and Kashmir in 1990s due to militancy.

""When the Sikhs were massacred in 1984, Naseeruddin Shah did not get scared. When the Kashmiri Pandits were killed in 1989-1990, Naseeruddin Shah did not get scared. Not a sigh, not a statement. Today Naseeruddin Shah is scared. This fear is political. He must have taken payment for this acting as well,"" Mishra said in his tweet.

On the other hand, the Congress party lent it support to Shah and said that it concurred with the renowned Bollywood actor. In a tweet on its official Twitter account, the Rahul Gandhi-led party posted, ""#NaseeruddinShah we concur, do not fear the hate, fight it. ""

In the video that has created a furore, Shah said, ""I am worried for my kids...if tomorrow, a mob surrounds them and asks which religion they belong to, they will have no answer."" He added that he and his wife Ratna Pathak Shah chose not to give religious education to their children. He added that said that ""poison"" has spread in the Indian society and it will be very difficult to ""capture this djinn back into the bottle""."

Addressing the media were Dr (Prof) Ajit Kumar Mohanty, retired professor of psychology, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, Prof. Bhaswati Patnaik, Head, Department of Psychology, Utkal University, Lalita Patnaik, Education Specialist and Officer-in-Charge, UNICEF Odisha and Alka Gupta, Communications Specialist, UNICEF Odisha.

Setting the context to the media round-table Ms. Lalita Patnaik said, ""Children who grow up healthyand educated, loved and protected, are more likely to develop into responsible, productive adults. However, we know that today millions of children across the world are losing out due to poor health, nutrition, and lack of positive stimulation in their lives. Investing in the early years of a child needs multi-disciplinary action: by parents; government, civil society and private sector, working together.""

Addressing the media, Professor Ajit Mohanty said,"" The earliest years of life from birth to eight years of age, are the most important period of development when the brain is developing the fastest. Research shows that for optimum brain development children need good nutrition and health, as well as positive stimulation and protection from violence, abuse and neglect. The poorest and most disadvantaged children face the biggest risk of missing out. Poverty, malnutrition and psychosocial deprivations adversely impact the developing brain of the child.""

Prof. Bhaswati Patnaik speaking on the importance of knowledge management said,"" Generating evidence and knowledge management of interventions that have worked are critical to understanding early childhood development. The Department of Psychology, Utkal University is contributing towards this effort.""

The sustainable, long-term economic growth of any country nation is related to the overall development of its youngest citizens, its children.The price of not investing in these early years of children leads to poorer health, fewer learning skills and reduced ability to earn as well as greater burden on health, education and welfare services, promoting an inter-generational cycle of disadvantage and inequity."

The bill was passed with 27 amendments that were recommended to the proposed draft bill.

Despite multiple interventions by the community, the bill failed to include measures which are necessary to make society more inclusive, since the community has long been shunned and denied job opportunities. Furthermore, the bill criminalises 'begging', which has long been the primary source of income for major constituents of the community. Hence, the bill effectively takes away their source of living without providing a sure alternative.

In addition, some say the bill violates the Supreme Court's landmark National Legal Services Authority judgment of 2014, which recognised the right of transgender persons to identify their own gender.

Why the bill falls short of expectations of the community

Definition of Transgender

A transgender person was, as per the original definition in the bill introduced earlier, '""neither wholly female nor wholly male; or a combination of female or male; or neither female nor male; and whose sense of gender does not match with the gender assigned to that person at the time of birth, and includes trans men and trans women, persons with intersex variations and gender-queers.""

But the definition was later amended to read - ""a person whose gender does not match with the gender assigned to that person at birth and includes trans-man or trans-woman (whether or not such person has undergone Sex Reassignment Surgery or hormone therapy or laser therapy or such other therapy), person with intersex variations, gender-queer and person having such socio-cultural identities as kinner, hijra, aravani and jogta.""

Transgender community protesting against the bill in Bengaluru.

While the second definition is clearer, it isn't without its own set of confusing statements. ""Gender is a construct, and an internalised identity. Hence it would make more sense to state that for a Transgender person, ''their sense of gender doesn't match the gender assigned to them at birth''. Why do I need someone to affirm my gender? Why are we medicalising the process?'' argues Abhina Aher, associate director: Sexuality, Gender & Rights at India HIV/AIDS Alliance

Abhina adds - ""The bill assumes that an intersex person is a Transgender. This is not true. Any intersex person is free to identify with the gender assigned to them at birth, or can alternatively choose to identify as a Transgender. To impose an identity on them is illiberal and coercive.''

Right to self-identify

To be identified as a transgender, a person has to get a certificate of identity from the district magistrate, which will be issued on the basis of recommendations made by a District Screening Committee, consisting of a chief medical officer, a psychologist or psychiatrist and an officer nominated by the government, a member of the transgender community and a district social welfare officer.

As aforementioned, the bill takes away a transgender person's right to self-identify, an aspect which was the cornerstone of the NALSA judgement. ''It (the bill)enforces our identification to be subject to screening, which could be a harrowing experience, considering the discrimination faced by us in the society at present. I am at their mercy,'' Abhina argues.

'No reservations means no inclusivity'

Keeping in view the often harrowing experiences faced by the community, it would've been prudent to provide for them reservation in jobs and education. But this is not the case, much to the chagrin of the Trans-community. Furthermore, begging has been criminalised, and the bill prescribes a jail term of six months to two years for anyone who makes any transgender person beg. This is in variance with the practices of the Hijra gharana, which has for eons been seeking alms by going from door to door. The community feels the bill impinges on their customs and seeks to alter their mode of living without guaranteeing inclusivity in the society.

Family and Transgenders

Abhina speaks about how the bill does not take into account 'adopted families' and only talks about birth families. Many transgenders have a Master and Disciple relationship, that is essential to their traditional way of life. The bill does not take into account traditional businesses and only highlights mainstream professions that the community can, or should partake in. It effectively delegitimizes transgender community ties.

Referring to the clause in the Bill that states how the State will ensure the ""rescue, protection and rehabilitation"" of transgender persons, Abhina opines that ""trans people do not need rehabilitation, they need equality and empowerment.""

Transgender and the IPC

Another major problem area for the community is that the demand for robust anti-discrimination clauses and proportionate penalties for sexual offences committed against transgender persons, in line with section 375-376 of the IPC was unheeded. Clauses 3 (prohibition of discrimination) and 19 (offences and penalties) of the Bill were passed without any changes.

As a result, there is no effective remedy for discrimination and sexual violence will be treated like a 'petty crime', punishable with six months to two years imprisonment -- thereby clearly violating the constitutional guarantee of equality before law, says Abhina. ""Our call for a gender-neutral law with respect to rape laws has not been answered. There is no justice if a trans-woman is raped, within the law. It is discriminatory and devoid of equality.The Bill does not refer to important civil rights like marriage and divorce, adoption, etc., which are critical to transgender persons' lives.''

With only four MPs addressing the debate which lasted less than the time allotted of two hours, the community's perception is that there is no tone of support in the entire bill. Whether it will be passed by the Rajya Sabha or not, or will popular dissent force the government to rethink its approach, is for time to tell."

For close to a year now, data privacy and security have been the hot topics. And Facebook took most of the heat with the Cambridge Analytica issue.

While data is collated and collected in different forms, by itself it serves no purpose. It needs to be analysed, categorised, understood and interpreted for it to be of any use. Having said that, it is this analysing, categorising, understanding and drawing interpretations that landed companies such as Facebook in a fix.

Cambridge Analytica and its alleged manipulation of electoral processes put the spotlight on India, especially now that the world's largest democracy is due for general elections early next year.

To clear the air on the Cambridge Analytica issue, and how serious the social networking company is about data privacy, Facebook's Rob Sherman spoke to select media, including YourStory, in Bengaluru on the steps taken by the social-media giant to ensure data remains private and users have absolute control over it. Edited Excerpts:

YourStory: Post Cambridge Analytica, how important is data privacy for Facebook?

Rob Sherman: A couple of weeks ago, I did a data privacy session in Bengaluru and Delhi with the civil society, looking at the best practices for privacy. We are trying to bring expertise to the table, to hear from experts outside the company about what we should be doing and ideally the goal is to develop learnings that can help Facebook. We also realise that privacy is very individual. Different people will have different ideas about privacy, and our approach there is to make it easier.

YS: As innovation and technology improve, you are accessing more and more of our data. How do you build a policy and look at privacy from a futuristic perspective?

RS: As technology evolves, people are more focused on privacy and are becoming more sophisticated in thinking about what they want. It's good that people are becoming more aware. Also, as technology evolves, there is going to be new benefits and data will be used in a way that may not be very beneficial.

A part of it is going to be transparent about how organisations are using the information. Organisations have an individual responsibility. It's not right to put all the responsibility on people and say that you have to make all the choices for yourself.

It's important to think broadly about what responsibility looks like and how to think about the future outcomes, particularly when it comes to legislation. We often think about the outcomes of technologies - if somebody uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a telephone, we are looking at that outcome.

YS: Election is a sensitive time for most technology companies. How are things working and playing out?

RS: We have seen the power of Facebook and social media platforms to promote people's ability to engage and there's a lot. We have seen people share information - we have built a cross-functional team that is focused on election integrity and making sure we work with governments and other stakeholders around the world.

When I spoke about the steps I am taking as an FB service to build better communication control, one of the things that has been a significant focus for the company is also thinking about third parties - ensuring that we build a robust process to make sure that something like Cambridge Analytica can't happen again.

YS: What are your learnings from the past year?

RS: One of the things we learnt was doing a better job with Facebook's privacy. We need to do more, communicate the choices we make about how we build privacy products and what our privacy policies are. Asking for these things is basically asking for feedback and hearing what people want us to do.

YS: With data privacy legislations becoming important, what is Facebook's inputs on this?

RS: Like I said, everybody has the right to privacy and legislation will addresses the power companies hold over people's information. There is a lot of discussion on what the right approaches are. But I think there is a real opportunity for leadership in India to communicate through new models of privacy that recognise the need for strong privacy limits and empower people.

We are trying to do a lot more to talk to experts - society, industry and the government. Some of the conversations we have had with experts has been about how we can build services that recognise the unique context we have.

YS: Are you open to building different storages for data?

RS: We are working around different ways to see how localisation can work for global companies without impacting too much, especially in terms of cost and other factors. But we feel there can be a solution that can work for both.

YS: What about companies and advertisers using data?

RS: Another area where we get a lot of questions is around advertising and how we use information for advertising. Our philosophy is to protect people's information. Sometimes, we are asked if we are selling people's information or not. We have created a model where advertisers can come to us and ask us for information so that they can deliver the right ad to the right person. We do it without sharing the information with the advertisers.

YS: How does that work?

RS: So whenever you see an ad on Facebook, you have the ability to ask ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" The next screen will actually give you the information about why you are seeing the particular ad. You have the ability to say: ""I don't want to see this ad."" There are other controls as well.

YS: How do you think privacy will work for FB?

RS: Privacy is hard to define. It is different for different people. But privacy is also central - each one of us needs to have privacy control and information in some way. So a lot of what we think about is letting people make choices and also being responsible. We are setting standards to make sure that everybody across the ecosystem is looking up to the standards.

YS: How does it work?

RS: The perspective that we have, and we are going to talk a little bit about here, is where we are investing - building better data policy, setting control, education, and the steps we are taking to achieve this. We are investing heavily on privacy at Facebook, and one of the changes we have made is that people who are working on privacy are centralised. It is about building new features to help people control their information and also building the backend engineering and infrastructure to make sure people's information stays protected.

Before that, privacy is still under control. One way we can capture that is by building controls that let people easily make choices about who they are sharing with and what they are sharing.

YS: What are the key tenants?

RS: We are focussed on how we are collecting information and here's how we are using it. We have redesigned our policy to be easier to read, but also to generate answers. So it's answering in human-readable language. People shouldn't have to go and look at our privacy policy to get information.

Earlier, there used to be 40 different choices in different parts of Facebook concerning privacy. What we have tried to do now is redesign the setting page and made it easy to see all those settings - it's all buckled in an easy to understand page.

Another thing we have done is built a centralised space for people to learn about their privacy - this is redesigned as privacy shortcuts so that people get access to all the important privacy choices in one place. Things like making the account more private - all of that is now available in one place."

Speaking about the launch of this program, Mr. Anshu Budhraja, CEO, Amway India, said, ""At Amway India, we are committed to use our vast global experience in nutrition and wellness to contribute to the Government of India's National Nutrition Mission to raise the nutrition levels in the country. From our experience, we understand that the foundation for a healthy development and overall well-being starts with optimal nutrition in the first 5 years of life. With the launch of the Power of 5 campaign, our aim is to raise awareness on the issue of childhood malnutrition and bring in the much-needed behavioral shift in mothers and communities at large. This program has been very successful globally - benefitting over a lakh children across more than 23 countries every year. We are pleased to launch this initiative in India and hope to make a positive impact in the lives of as many children and families as possible.""

Mr. Sundip Shah, Chief Marketing Officer, Amway India, said, ""The first 5 years in a child's life are particularly important for the overall development and hence, appropriate intake of healthy and nutritious diet is crucial. The current situation of low nutrition levels among children up to 5 years is acute in India with around 8 million children suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition, as per the statistics released by World Bank report 'India's Malnourished Children: Call for Reform & Action'. The rate of mortality with severe malnutrition among children up to 5 years is over 20% and the key contributors include inappropriate feeding practices, inadequate food intake, recurrent infections. Such issues can be addressed with proper education and guidance. With the launch of Power of 5 campaign in India, we aim to reach out to children under 5, their mothers and communities at large to educate them on how best to make use of their resources to ensure nutritional wellbeing of the children. To be adequately nourished, it is important that mothers understand what constitutes a good diet, as well as have the skills to make good food choices for the children. The Power of 5 initiative is aimed at providing this much-needed awareness to the mothers and communities to contribute to the healthy growth of children.""

The campaign aims to mobilize communities to encourage participation and to empower individuals by raising awareness of the services and entitlements among beneficiaries. Additionally, ASHA workers, ANM & Anganwadi workers will be sensitized to drive the behavior change among the parents and communities to establish synergies for timely inclusive service deliveries to the identified target beneficiaries. With MAMTA Health Institute for Mother and Child as its implementing partner, Amway will reach out to and benefit around 10,000 children directly through mothers and 30,000 individuals indirectly (parents, caregivers and community members) in West Delhi's Kirari area in the first pilot year.

Commenting on the partnership with Amway, Dr. Sunil Mehra, Executive Director, MAMTA Health Institute for Mother and Child, said, ""There are many underprivileged children residing in this area who face health problems that can otherwise be simply tackled by slight changes in their nutritional intake. The Power of 5 campaign will have a monumental impact on the lives of these children as it seeks to bring about a fundamental change in their daily diet. We are really optimistic about the final outcome of this initiative.""

About Amway India CSR initiatives

Amway India's CSR initiatives are based on the belief that social responsibility is much more than the incurrence of a cost or a resource or a charitable/ philanthropic act of social benefit. It is an opportunity to bring in social innovation and change. This belief is articulated in Amway's vision of helping people live better lives. When it comes to commitment to corporate citizenship, Amway India makes a serious and concentrated effort to reach out and help people improve their lives.

A few days before that, may be a month or two, a youngster came to me for some ailment when I was working in Dr. Kamala Raman's Nursing Home. Somehow I still remember his face vividly as a trim pleasantly mannered youth of early twenties. He had enrolled as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Indian Army.

After the end of the 11-day war, I was deeply saddened to hear the news that this boy, 2nd Lt. Ashok Mutgikar succumbed to the enemy bullets. He was the eldest son of Prahlad Rao Mutgikar who was working in Railways, Mysore. The 93-year-old Rao resides with his third son Mukund Mutgikar in Mysore. His second son Dr. Mohan also lives in Mysore.

After his early education in Hubli and Gulbarga, Lt.Ashok graduated from Sarada Vilas College, Mysore, as his father got transferred. He was a brilliant sportsman captaining Table Tennis, Hockey and Tennis teams of his college. Being an Officer of the NCC Wing of his College he got qualified to enter the Army as 2nd Lieut. His first posting was at Jammu border where he was privileged to man the Russian Tanks in the Chamb sector during the Indo-Pak war which was fought simultaneously at East Pakistan also. A letter written to his father from his Commanding Officer Lt. Col. M.K. Menon says that Ashok continued his action of firing his machine gun despite serious multiple bullet injuries hit by an air attack. The Lt. Col. has showered all his appreciations for the brave and gallant way Ashok fought [See letter below].

Within a few days after Lt. Ashok's heroic departure, the then Mysore Municipal Council headed by one Jogi Siddayya promptly named the Circle near RTO Office in his memory [See Deccan Herald clipping]. But unfortunately his name has disappeared sometime back and replaced by some other name now. To remember Lt. Ashok Mutgikar I pray the City Corporation authorities to restore it in honour of his martyrdom. I thank Mukund Mutgikar for providing the photo and documents."

Tencent Holdings Ltd. joined Naspers Ltd. in a $1 billion investment in Indian food delivery service Swiggy, which gains a potentially valuable ally in China's largest social media and gaming company.

Naspers led the financing, which snagged new backers Hillhouse Capital and Wellington Management in addition to existing investors DST Global, Meituan Dianping and Coatue. The funding round, which Bloomberg reported on in October, marks Swiggy's third for 2018 and largest to date. Naspers, Africa's most valuable company, said it put up $660 million.

Swiggy is one of a clutch of fast-growing Indian startups capitalizing on rapid smartphone adoption across the country. Its value was said to have risen to more than $2 billion after Cape Town-based Naspers led two previous funding rounds, becoming the firm's biggest shareholder. Since the last funding six months ago, Swiggy has expanded to 42 additional cities in India, the company said in a statement.

Food delivery is a favorite business of Naspers, with investments in Germany's Delivery Hero and iFood in Brazil. It's also taken a shine to India as it seeks to replicate a blockbuster early bet on Tencent, where it owns about 31 percent of the stock. This week, the Cape Town-based company took park in a $540 million investment in Indian education startup Byju's. It owns slices of other Indian businesses such as MakeMyTrip and OLX, and made a $1.6 billion profit from selling its 11 percent stake in e-commerce startup Flipkart this year.

Dhage said that along with illegal constructions of 2,30,000 square feet, Zeal institute did not leave 12-metre space for the road which is mandatory under the Town Planning Act. ""Hence approached by the PMRDA and after three hearing finally we got the demolition order,"" said Dhage adding PMRDA has not taken any action so far.

VAN DHAN YOJANA

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has launched a game-changing initiative for tribal people - The Van Dhan Yojana, with the launch of the first Van Dhan Vikas Kendra at Bijapur by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi on 14th April, 2018. It aims to provide skill upgradation and capacity building training and setting up of primary processing and value addition facility.

As per the plan, TRIFED will facilitate establishment of MFP-led multi-purpose Van Dhan Vikas Kendras, a cluster of 10 SHGs comprising of 30 tribal MFP gatherers each, in the tribal areas. This initiative is aimed at mainstreaming the tribal community by promoting primary level value addition to MFP at grassroots level. Through this initiative, the share of tribals in the value chain of Non-Timber Forest Produce is expected to rise from the present 20% to around 60%. About 3000 such Van Dhan Kendras are proposed to be set up in two years in the forested Tribal Districts of the country. To begin with, this initiative is proposed to be taken up on priority in the 39 Districts with more than 50% tribal population and to then gradually be expanded to other Tribal Districts in India.The initiative aims to promote MFPs-centric livelihood development of tribal gatherers and artisans. MFP or what may be more aptly referred to as Non Timber Forest Produces (NTFPs) are the primary source of income and livelihood for about 5 crore tribal people in the country.

""The pontiff has recovered from the surgery and is in good health,"" the mutt's administrative officer S. Vishwanath said from Tumakuru, about 70km northwest from the state capital.

The pontiff was flown to Chennai from Bengaluru on December 7 in an air ambulance for the operation to treat his liver and bile duct infection and was flown back after his recovery to Bengaluru on Wednesday.

""The swami was able to travel by road to Tumakuru after he was airlifted to Bengaluru from Chennai,"" the official said.

Known among his followers as a walking god and an incarnation of 12th-century renowned social reformer Basava, the Lingayat seer is also the head of the Sree Siddaganga Education Society, which runs about 125 educational institutions in the state -- from engineering colleges to business schools.

The over century-old Swamiji has been in and out of hospitals of late for treatment of symptoms related to his advanced age.

The seer complained of fever on December 1, following which he was taken to BGS Hospitals where it was found that three of his stents had come off. In a one-and-a-half-hour procedure following this, two more stents were placed and he was discharged on Monday. However, the fever returned on Wednesday night. Doctors were called in who examined him at the mutt and treated him and were able to stabilise his condition.

Later on December 7, Shivakumara Swami was airlifted from Bengaluru to Chennai for further treatment after having been diagnosed with cholecystitis.

Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder which occurs when there is a blockage of the cystic duct due to any gallstones or biliary sludge. While acute forms of the condition are not life-threatening, if left untreated, it can pose greater complications.

Born on April 1, 1907, in Veerapura village of Ramanagara district in Karnataka, Swami is involved in philanthropic activities and was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Union government in 2015. (MR, Inputs: Agencies)."

Justice Paresh Upadhyay sought the footage to peruse during a hearing of a petition challenging the electoral victory of education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama. The HC posted further hearing on Friday. The Congress candidate, Ashwin Rathod, challenged Chudasama's slender 327-vote victory. He alleged that Chudasama's victory came through unfair means. Rathod claims that Chudasama won by just 327 votes while the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 postal ballots. The number of rejected votes was thus higher than the victory margin.

Rathod also contended that the serving deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer, was transferred after the model code of conduct came into effect. Dhaval Jani was appointed in his place with a view to help the minister win the election.

The third allegation the Congress candidate made is that the vote counting method in Dholka fully violated the Election Commission of India's instructions that ballot papers be counted before the EVM votes. In this case, election officials started counting EVM votes first. After it became clear that the margin between the Congress and BJP candidates was very slim, the ballot boxes were opened."

All its V-Cs are officers from the Indian Forest Services.

New Delhi: In the 27 years that it has been a deemed university, the Forest Research Institute Deemed University (FRIDU) in Dehradun has never been headed by an academic.

Instead, all of its vice-chancellors since 1991, when it was granted the university status, have been officers from the Indian Forest Services (IFS).

The premier science institute, the only one in the country dedicated to forest research, was set up in 1906.

Since acquiring university status, the FRIDU does not even officially have a designated post of vice-chancellor. The civil servant who serves as the director of Forest Research Institute, which is on the same campus, holds additional charge as the university vice-chancellor.

The facts came to light recently when the appointment of current FRIDU vice-chancellor Dr. Savita, an IFS officer, was challenged in the Delhi High Court by a former scientist, Hilaluddin, who had worked at the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE). The ICFRE is on the same campus as the FRIDU.

Also read: India has global ambitions but not enough IFS officers to fulfil them

The scientist claimed that many of the civil servants who served in the post did not have the requisite qualifications as prescribed by the University Grants Commission (UGC). As per UGC norms, the vice-chancellor of a university should have at least 10 years of experience as a professor and an overall experience of 21 years as an academic.

In case of those appointed to FRIDU, all of them have been IFS officers who have had 25 years of work experience in administrative spaces such as development officer in a forest and not in academic spaces.

The Delhi High Court, however, dismissed the plea saying the vice-chancellor of the university was merely 'designated as VC' and there was no such sanctioned post.

Since the HRD Ministry conferred the status of deemed to be university upon FRI and ""the FRI has no sanctioned posts of vice-chancellor and faculty members (Asstt. Professor, Associate Professor, Professor etc.)"", therefore, the director, FRI, has also been designated as vice-chancellor, the court said in its order dated 22 November 2018.

The mandate of FRIDU is to impart education in different branches of forestry and environment, conduct research and advancement and dissemination of knowledge in the field of forestry and environment.

It is the only government institute of its kind in India conducting research and study on forestry. It offers programmes such as M.Sc. Forestry, M.Sc. Wood Science & Technology, M.Sc. Environment Management, M.Sc. Cellulose and Paper Technology. It also offers specialised PhD programmes on the subjects.

""The appointment of a bureaucrat and not an academician at an institute of such repute is not good for overall academic excellence. A bureaucrat would know management issues more than basic science such as Pathology, Entomology,"" said a senior scientist at the university.

""It is important for the head of an institution to know these things because he or she will also head the academic council, which is the highest academic body in a university.""

The appointment of non-academics as vice-chancellors has been in controversy previously too when the appointment of Zamiruddin Shah as Aligarh Muslim University V-C was challenged in court. Shah, a retired Brigadier was appointed as V-C in the university, whereas, UGC rules say that the post should be occupied by a professor.

A check and (batch) mate game appears to be on in the first bureaucratic reshuffle of 40 IAS officers by the Gehlot government.

The 1993 batch officers who were holding the top most portfolios in the chief minister office and the secretariat till now have been replaced by their juniors belonging to the batch of 1994, and there is reason for this.

When former chief minister Vasundhara Raje assumed office on December 13, 2013, she appointed Tanmay Kumar as her secretary within a week. A 93 batch officer, Tanmay emerged a power centre and gripped his clutches in the CMO and the secretariat.

After his appointment to the highest office, his batch mate IAS officers, who got training along with him -- Akhil Arora, Aparna Arora, Shikhar Agrawal and Alok -- got appointment on cream posts.

Arora, who has been made principal secretary in social department in Tuesday's transfers, was till now appointed in planning department while Agrawal, after returning from deputation from New Delhi, was rewarded the post of Jaipur Development Commissioner (JDC), a much sought after post among the bureaucrats.

As the Gehlot government resumed office, the 94 batch officers fell out of favour and all were shunted out. It could be called a coincidence or a 'deliberate' exercise that their one batch junior officers of 93 batch were appointed on important posts as the new government took charge.

Kuldeep Ranka was appointed principal secretary to the CM, replacing Tammay who got posting as Commissioner of Command Area Development. Along with Ranka, his batch mates were 'crowned' with important portfolios.

Ever since Anjali Kumari, a Class X student of Bihar government-run GA High School in Lalganj, spoke up against the caste-wise sitting arrangement at her school, all benefits she is entitled to under various government schemes have been put on hold, allegedly by the school administration.

On Wednesday, the girl, in a written complaint to Lalganj Block Education Officer (BEO) Arvind Kumar Tiwari, maintained that ""making students enrol and sit in classrooms on lines of caste (social groups) is violation of our fundamental rights.""

Another Class IX student of the school also said the practice has been going for the past four years.

The segregation of students on castelines came to light after the Vaishali District Education Officer sent a team to the school on Monday. A detailed inspection report in this regard has been sent to State Secondary Education Director.

According to school records, the GA High School has more than 1,500 students in Classes IX to XII, and castes of each student is mentioned against their names on attendance sheets, reportedly to ""help the school administration to easily identify beneficiaries"" of all government schemes.

The attendance sheets have been seized by the Vaishali District Secondary Education Office.

Under various government schemes, a Class IX student is entitled to Rs 3,000 to purchase a bicycle; girl students from Classes IX to XII are entitled to Rs 1,000 for uniform and Rs 150 for sanitary napkins; students from Classes IX to XII are also entitled to Rs 1800 scholarship annually.

All the benefits are, however, given only against 75 per cent attendance.

Claiming that the report of compliance on government schemes are sought every month, and at times fortnightly, the school's in-charge principal, Meena Kumari, said: ""My predecessor, Phool Mohammed Ansari, had introduced segregation on caste lines in attendance register in 2014 and I have been following it because it has comes as handy to identify beneficiaries and prepare the reports.""

Dismissing the allegations of ""dividing students on caste lines"", she, said: ""One should know that we have only six classrooms, which can accommodate maximum 600 students. As we have a daily attendance of 50-60 per cent, we have to merge two sections (of a class) daily... There is no feeling of discrimination on caste lines.

Following concerns raised by investors regarding angel tax notices sent to startups, Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu said he has taken up the issue. ""We have taken up the issue,"" Prabhu replied in a tweet to chairman of Manipal Global Education T V Mohandas Pai, who had earlier tweeted: ""Draconian Angel tax torturing start-ups: It's killing genuine innovation.""

A top income tax department official said the ""notices issued on angel tax to startups may be for those that are not recognised by the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP)"".

Several startups have raised concerns on taxation of angel funds under Section 56 of the Income Tax Act. Under the Section 56(2)(viib) of the Income-tax Act, companies with closely held shares, when issuing shares, are charged 30 per cent tax on the difference between funds raised as per the actual valuation and the fair-market value of the company. This is known as the angel tax.

The notices consider the value of funding received by startups, which is over and above the enterprise value, as 'income from other sources' and therefore, consider that as taxable.

Advertising

In April, the government had tweaked the definition of startups to provide some relief wherein they were allowed to avail tax concession if total investment including funding from angel investors does not exceed Rs 10 crore. As per a notification by the Commerce and Industry Ministry, an angel investor picking up stakes in a startup should have a minimum net worth of Rs 2 crore or should have an average returned income of over Rs 25 lakh in the preceding three financial years.

ExplainedCalculating 'fair market value' holds the key

Startups incorporated after 2016 and recognised under the Startup India policy are exempted from the levy of 'angel' tax. During the initial round of investment or angel funding, startups are often valued higher than what is considered the 'fair market value'. The taxman uses traditional methods like discounted cash flows for gauging the correct value of a company, but investors and entrepreneurs say this method is outdated. The tax notices being faced by startups not recognised by DIPP or the ones incorporated before 2016, have created concerns among investors.

In February, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had directed income-tax commissioners not to take coercive measures against startups to recover the outstanding tax amount in case valuations have been modified or rejected by an assessing officer. The CBDT had also said that in all the cases that are pending with the Commissioner (Appeals), necessary administrative steps should be taken for expeditious disposal of appeals, ""preferably by March 31, 2018"".

Startups can avail income tax benefit for three out of seven consecutive assessment years, but they have to approach an eight-member inter-ministerial board of certification for getting such concession.

A startup incorporated after April 1, 2016 but before April 1, 2021 is eligible for this tax incentive. As per the DIPP definition, startups set up as private limited company or limited liability partnership and incorporated after April 1, 2016, would be eligible for tax concessions and will have the status of startup up to seven years from the date of incorporation, or up to 10 years if it's in the biotechnology sector. The company, however, loses the startup tag if its turnover in any year exceeds Rs 25 crore.

Tax experts said the angel tax provisions for startups need to be appropriately modified and provisions need to be reevaluated to cover all startups. Vikas Vasal, national leader - tax, Grant Thornton India LLP said, ""The angel tax provisions need to be appropriately modified to carve out an exception for the startups or may be these cases should be referred to a panel before initiating any penal action to distinguish and protect genuine startups vis-a-vis tax avoidance schemes and arrangements. It's not an easy task, however, to encourage entrepreneurship and employment in the country these provisions need to be reevaluated and softened a bit to cover all startups and not just the ones registered with the government."""

Context: The Lok Sabha has passed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016 to give transgender persons equal rights and protection under law through a voice vote.

The Bill had gone to the standing committee, and as many as 27 amendments have been accepted by the government.

The amendments passed include a change in the previous definition of transgender persons as ""neither wholly female or wholly male"", which was criticised as being insensitive.

According to the new definition, a transgender person is somebody ""whose gender does not match the gender assigned to that person at birth and includes trans-men or trans-women, persons with intersex variations, gender-queers, and persons having socio-cultural identities such as kinnar, hijras, aravani, and jogta"".

Several civil society groups have been vocal about their opposition to the Bill The Bill disregards many of their suggestions as also some of the crucial points raised by the standing committee report of July 2017.

The Bill must recognise that gender identity must go beyond biological; gender identity is an individual's deep and personal experience. It need not correspond to the sex assigned at birth. It includes the personal sense of the body and other expressions such as one's own personal inducing proceeds.

Mains Question: Critically examine why the recently passed Transgender bill fails to address the systemic discrimination faced by transgenders in India.

Context: Women and child development ministry has drafted a policy dedicated to the protection of children. Until now, protection of children was only a part of the broader National child policy 2013.

The Supreme Court had asked the centre to consider framing the national policy on protection of children.

Key provisions and highlights of the draft policy:

The Policy should address four aspects- creating awareness, prevention, reporting and responding. The draft needs to go into all these aspects, especially reporting structure involving various nodal bodies and monitoring mechanism for implementation of the guidelines.

The policy makers should take the opportunity to go beyond the role of Institutions and look at the role of individuals.

The norms should be designed in such a way that organisations can customise the policies according to the nature of their work.

Context: A group of researchers at Nagpur-based Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology have developed a new technique which promises to help produce high value graphene from discarded dry cells batteries.

Since graphene is made out of graphite, its production is both expensive and has significant environmental impact. The new technique helps both reduce the cost and preserve environment.

Graphene has been touted in the global electronics industry as a ""miracle material"" given its strength, electrical conductivity and elasticity, and has been seen as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries since its discovery in 2004. It is a form of carbon that can be used to develop smaller, slimmer batteries but with higher capacity.

Graphene is a carbon material that is one atom thick. Its thin composition and high conductivity means it is used in applications ranging from miniaturised electronics to biomedical devices. These properties also enable thinner wire connections; providing extensive benefits for computers, solar panels, batteries, sensors and other devices.

Context: The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has started the process of ""comprehensively amending"" the backbone of forest governance in India -- the Indian Forest Act, 1927 (IFA).

According to the 1996 Supreme Court order, the dictionary definition of the word forest is taken to be the legal definition too. It covers all statutorily recognised forests, whether designated as reserved, protected or otherwise for the purpose of Section 2(i) of the Forest Conservation Act (1980). As per the Court order, the term forest land, occurring in Section 2, will not only include forest as understood in the dictionary sense, but also any area recorded as forest in the government record irrespective of the ownership.

The Indian Forest Act, 1927 was largely based on previous Indian Forest Acts implemented under the British. The most famous one was the Indian Forest Act of 1878.

Many reports like the MB Shah report of 2010 and the TSR Subramanian report of 2015, have talked about amending the IFA.

Mains Question: The recent amendments to the Indian Forest Act, 1927 will create new markets & jobs for poor communities. Critically analyze.

Context: The Tamil Nadu government has distributed 200 Navic- powered satellite- enabled communication devices developed by ISRO to 80 fishing boat groups.

NAVIC is an independent regional navigation satellite system designed to provide position information in the Indian region and 1500 km around the Indian mainland.

IRNSS would provide two types of services, namely Standard Positioning Services available to all users and Restricted Services provided to authorised users.

It is a regional system and so its constellation will consist of seven satellites. Three of these will be geostationary over the Indian Ocean, i.e., they will appear to be stationary in the sky over the region, and four will be geosynchronous - appearing at the same point in the sky at the same time every day. This configuration ensures each satellite is being tracked by at least one of fourteen ground stations at any given point of time, with a high chance of most of them being visible from any point in India.

Why it is necessary to have indigenous global navigation system?

Having a global navigation system bolsters the ability of a nation to serve as a net security provider, especially through the guarantee of such assurance policies. It can also play a significant role in relief efforts post disasters such as the tsunami in the Indian Ocean region in 2004 and the Pakistan-India earthquake in 2005.

Mains Question: Write a note on the objectives and significance of NAVIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation).

The 7 round of India - South Korea Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) negotiations were held in South Korea from 11 to 13 December, 2018.

South Korea imports around 15 lac tones of raw sugar annually and the Indian sugar industry is making efforts to export raw sugar from India during 2018-19 sugar seasons.

India and South Korea will reduce duties on 11 tariff lines in a bid to expand bilateral trade by updating their existing free-trade agreement, called the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA).

In 2017-18, India exported goods worth $4.4 billion to South Korea while imports from the latter were worth $16.3 billion.

CECA - Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement

CEPA - Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement

The major ""technical"" difference between a CECA and CEPA is that CECA involve only ""tariff reduction/elimination in a phased manner on listed/all items except the negative list and tariff rate quota (TRQ) items. CEPA also covers the trade in services and investment and other areas of economic partnership"".

So CEPA is a wider term that CECA and has the widest coverage.

Usually CECA is signed first with a country and after that negotiations may start for a CEPA.

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, gave details on the status of implementation of National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) Project.

The funding of NeVA is through Central Sponsored Scheme i.e. 60:40; and 90:10 for North East & hilly States and 100% for UTs.

It aims to bring all the legislatures of the country together, in one platform thereby creating a massive data depository without having the complexity of multiple applications.

Highlights of NeVA:

""Das can work under any government. He follows the rule book,"" the Minister added.

Well, Das's critics may hold a different view, but being a true-blue Babu seems to have worked in his favour. In times of difficulties, it's always the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officials who seem to be the fall-back persons of ministers.

Yet, take stock of the year gone by and bureaucracy seems to have lost its sheen. Many who are still serving have been tossed around from one ministry to another or prematurely repatriated without being given an opportunity to explain. Some have been intimidated by politicians -- take the case of Delhi Chief Secretary or the shocking sentencing of former coal secretary HC Gupta.

Jawhar Sircar, a former IAS officer who has held key positions as Culture Secretary and CEO of Prasar Bharati, feels that usually working in the Centre is more systematic and impersonal than in the States. But that has changed now, with a pall of fear over the civil servants. Transfers and repatriations happen without any prior warning.

Talent expert Hemant Sharma, former HR head of Sun Microsystems, feels that bureaucracy is losing its sheen is because it is no longer an aspirational job for the brightest minds of our country. ""Till the eighties, getting into the IAS was the dream of educated youths and attracted the best minds of the country. Initially, post Independence, people joined the government, driven by ideals of contributing to nation building. Later, in the 1970s, the power of these roles was a big draw,"" he analyses. Today, the role models for the brightest minds are the Satya Nadellas and Sundar Pichais of the world.

In short, what civil servants today need is a role model -- their own Nadella or Pichai.

To be fair, the Department of Personnel & Training (DOPT) has been attempting to introduce meritocracy in promotions, with concepts like SPARROW -- Smart Performance Appraisal Report Recording Window -- and a 360-degree feedback tool for officers in line to become Additional Secretaries or Secretaries. This June, it even came out with ads for lateral recruitment to senior positions in the government for 10 Department/Ministries.

Although the ad attracted 6,097 applicants, the candidates seem to have fallen short of expectations. Now the task of sifting through the applications has been given to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). On December 11, UPSC asked the candidates to fill a Detailed Application Form, the last date to submit which is January 1, 2019.

But, despite all these moves, some serious rethinking is needed when it comes to management of the bureaucracy. Sharma suggests building employer branding to attract better quality talent. ""While they are called public servants, there is, however, no customer orientation or service orientation in the bureaucracy,"" he says.

Most feel there needs to be greater consistency in postings and specialised expertise is much needed, particularly for the social sector. As Sircar says, ""Today, unfortunately, the officers are not making use of even half of their capabilities because of fear of uncertainties which can follow them even after their retirement.""

Says Dhir Jhingran, Founder Director of Language and Learning Foundation, ""I favour offering specialisation opportunity to interested IAS officers early in their career so they can build domain knowledge and expertise in specific areas. In this time, it has become crucial to understand domains like health, education or any other sector to be able to learn from the best practices across the world.""

Probably this is where lateral entry could work. But even as efforts are being made, why is there such widespread disillusionment within the service?

Sharma cites two reasons. ""The young bright minds join the service with the desire to change things in the country, but they soon lose the motivation, given the rigid rules and regulations which prevent them from implementing out-of-the-box ideas. At a societal level, to the common man, bureaucracy is not necessarily the IAS officer but the Block Development Officer at the grass-roots level. Here, the common citizen encounters corruption at every step of government interface to get public services delivered to him/her.""

Anil Swarup, former Coal and Education Secretary, feels that ""while there is transparency in performance appraisals, similar transparency is missing in selection of officers to senior-level posts. There is absence of communication between those that are responsible for selection/empanelment and those that are not considered for selection. A sincere conversation with those that are left will enable them to improve and will not lead to demoralisation.""

As former IAS officer Vivek Rae, who was also a member of the Seventh Pay Commission, says, there is need for a more rigorous system to recognise and reward merit and punish weak performance, both at the Central and State level. Automatic career progression to higher pay scales, especially through non-functional upgradation, has to stop.

And there is mixed signalling everywhere. As an in-service officer says, ""When we meet the Prime Minister for meetings he calls, we all feel motivated and convinced...but..."".

It's time the government stopped this mixed messaging and put some trust and faith in the civil servants of the country."

A senior police officer said: ""Forgery of documents, such as identity proof, fake educational or experience certificate, has become easy. There are several cases where people, especially Rohingya Muslims, have procured fake identity proofs.""

Explaining the modus operandi, the police said that fraudster manage to get one identity proof through a known agent, and using this fake ID, procure PAN card, driving licenses and Aadhaar card.

Chaitanya Kumar, DCP task force, said: ""Not just fake documents, but also education certificates can be procured by editing original certificates on Photoshop.

Prabhu was responding to a tweet by Manipal Global Education Chairman Mohandas Pai, who had asked for urgent government intervention to resolve the matter.

Several startups have been raising concerns about being sent notices demanding tax on angel funds under Section 56 of the Income Tax Act.

Section 56 of the IT Act is used to tax the excess income a company receives from charging a greater than fair market price for shares it issues.

Previously in April, the Centre had allowed startups to claim tax concessions if the total funding they received, including from angel investors, was within Rs 10 crores.

To avail such concessions, startups are required to receive certification from an eight-member inter-ministerial board.

""Notices issued on angel tax to startups may be for those that are not recognised by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP),"" speculated an income tax officer.

Angel Investors are those individual's who invest their personal funds in startups. As per rules of the Commerce and Industry Ministry, an angel investor is required to have a minimum net worth of Rs 2 crore rupees, or an average returned income exceeding Rs 25 lakhs in the three previous financial years."

Absurd. Ridiculous. Embarrassing. Trump'. That is what a headline in The Washington Post screamed last year when a doctored video clip was released by US president Donald Trump. What has happened in Uttar Pradesh in the past two weeks since the lynching of station house officer Subodh Kumar Singh by a mob in Bulandshahr on 3 December, over alleged cow slaughter, indeed evokes a similar outrage. Replace US president Donald Trump with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his cops and the picture is complete.

File image of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath. PTI

First, the state police went after the Muslim men for alleged cow slaughter and put them in jail for two weeks on the basis of a complaint filed by the main accused in the mob lynching incident, Bajrang Dal convenor Yogesh Raj. Then on Tuesday, the four were released after the SIT constituted to probe the violence found them innocent. The SIT then arrested three more Muslim men for alleged slaughter of cows with a bizarre narrative: ""They were part of a gang that hunted cows and shot them with a double-barrelled gun. They would slaughter the cows using sharp instruments like knives and share the meat."" They were not named in the original FIR, nor their relations to the 3 December mob lynching incident is at all clear.

For the first time, two others have also been arrested for mob violence, but the main accused Yogesh Raj and a local BJP Yuva Morcha leader Shikhar Agrawal are roaming free. There is no word yet on why they have not been arrested or what actions have been taken to arrest them.

This reverses investigation of cow slaughter, rather than the mob lynching, was set into motion by none other than the chief minister. Two days after the incident, he held a review meeting and gave instructions for 'strict action' against cow slaughter, which he described as a 'conspiracy', but said not a word on the SHO's killing. That was a signal for the Uttar Pradesh Police and the latter announced later that they will first go after the cow slaughter and then look at the mob lynching, even though the victim of this lynching was one of their officers. A couple of days later, Yogi went on to claim that ""No mob lynching happened in Uttar Pradesh, what happened in Bulandshahr is an accident"".

This was ridiculous, to say the least. There is enough video evidence to show that it indeed took place in broad daylight. Besides, mob lynching is no ordinary crime or just a murder - and former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje was rightly called out for saying a mob lynching as a murder in the same week.

That is why the Supreme Court had asked, in July this year, the Centre and state governments to create a special law for mob lynching and provide adequate punishment to instil fear for the law among the people involved in vigilantism and lynching. Sadly, no government has shown any inclination to follow this. Nor the apex court's directive to give wide publicity to its direction that lynching and mob violence of any kind will invite serious consequence under the law. Had that been followed the SHO's killing could have been averted.

This open display of hostility towards one community and undermining of the process of justice are not only creating deep fissures in society but also demoralising honest police officers and jeopardising professionalism in the force - which has dangerous consequences. Both the chief minister and his police force are obliged to act fairly and impartially to ensure justice is done and peace and order is restored, not divide society on the basis of religion or intimidate a section of society. It is even more reprehensible when elected representatives join the bandwagon and celebrate the transfer of inconvenient police officers in company with fringe groups, instead of helping the cause of justice or law and order.

Uttar Pradesh is not only known for high crime rates but also for poor governance and backwardness. It is the most populous state with the maximum number of poor - 17 percent of India's population and 22 percent of its total poor, as per Census 2011. It continues to remain a low-income state along with Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and its GDP growth rate has remained below the national average. Its human development indicators also remain very poor. It was ranked 18th among the Indian states in the UNDP's India Human Development Report (2011) which measured long and healthy life, education and a decent standard of living. As per Census 2011, its literacy rate was 67.7 percent- lower than the national average of 74 percent.

With such credentials, the chief minister and his official machinery should have been more focussed on improving governance and indicators of economic and human development, rather than divisive majoritarian politics which unfortunately is the case. An economically stronger state with a better human capital will not only lift millions of its population out of poverty and backwardness but would also turn into an engine of growth for India. Unfortunately, all the energy is being dissipated in creating social disorder and disquiet.

The move comes after a wall collapsed in Noida's New KM Public School in Salarpur village, killing two children and injuring three students. The BSA said they will demolish all unsafe government school buildings and identify illegal private schools to close them down.

""We have written to block education officers to ensure that the private agencies are selected in each village to demolish unsafe government school buildings and construct new ones. The private agencies that will build the new school buildings will be finalised through an open auction in the respective villages. Earlier, due to technical reasons, we could not hire private agencies to reconstruct government schools,"" Balmukund Prasad, BSA, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.

According to officials, there are several government primary and middle schools in various villages across the district that are operating in old, unsafe buildings.

The education department has also written to the block education officer in Dankaur to inspect private schools and shut them down if they are violating norms.

As per the education department, there are 174 illegal schools in the Gautam Budh Nagar district. Over two lakh students study in these schools, that are housed in illegal buildings with no safety measures in place, officials said.

""After a 2017-18 survey, we identified 174 illegal schools in district. Most of them were shut down. Now, to identify more illegal schools, we have formed two teams that will submit monthly reports. The allegations of parents that we were aware of all illegal schools operating in the district are false and baseless,"" Prasad said.

""The block education officer needs to inspect Children's Academy in Chhijarsi; Dayanand Public School, Bahlolpur; Vivek Vidyapeeth, Chhijarsi; Gyandeep School in Chotpur, HI Public School in Chhijarsi; Geeta Public School in Chhijarsi; Jagriti Public School in Chhijarsi and Naveen Gyan Hari Singh Public School. If these schools are illegal, then we will shut them down immediately,"" Prasad added.

The other schools that are to be inspected by the education department are CBSE Public School, Prayag Public School and Sai Public School in Yakubpur village; and Royal Public School, Gayatri Public School and Beena Public School in Sadarpur village.

Pradeep Yadav, whose son was killed when New KM Public School's wall collapsed on Monday, said,""If these 174 schools were illegal and unsafe for children, then why did the education department not act earlier. We demand that the UP government file an FIR against education department officials for laxity.""

Prasad said,""Parents are responsible for checking whether schools are approved or not before they admit their wards. We have decided to seek information from the public about schools they think are illegal as well. We will inspect them and take appropriate action.""

According to him, there are nearly 1,000 legal schools in the district, including private and government schools."

New Delhi: For long, the pheran, a traditional long cloak worn by both women and men, has been a quintessential part of the Kashmiri winter. That, however, hasn't protected it from controversy over the years.

The latest row involving the pheran came last Tuesday, when the Jammu and Kashmir education department's Langate office issued a circular banning its officials from wearing the garment on official visits to the office.

It was later withdrawn after a furore with even former chief minister Omar Abdullah, known to wear the pheran, weighing in. ""My father and I have worn pherans to official functions many times over the years and will continue to do so, silly government orders notwithstanding,"" Omar had tweeted, with the hashtags #dontbanourpheran and #revokepheranban.

But this isn't the first time that there has been a controversy over the garment, which is synonymous with the Valley. The pheran went through a turbulent phase during a dark period in Jammu and Kashmir.

At the peak of militancy, young Kashmiris wearing a pheran suddenly began being viewed suspiciously. As the security scenario worsened, those wearing a pheran, which is usually stitched loose in order to let the traditional fire pot, Kangri, to be carried inside it during chilly winter days, began to attract attention from security forces.

The forces suspected that militants could use the garment for carrying arms in 1990s. Although there was no ban then, it made the people wary.

Thus the period in the 1990s led to the decline of the pheran being worn outside the home. It, however, continued to remain the favourite attire to be worn at home.

In the last six to seven years, the pheran has made a comeback with modern fits and designs, closely resembling overcoats. It has become fashionable winter wear with people even wearing it to office these days.

The latest controversy was sparked by the education department circular dated 11 December which has since been revoked.

""All officials visiting the office are advised to visit in proper dress code during any official visit,"" reads the circular issued on December 11, by Zonal Educational Officer (ZEO) Langate Agha Abdul Rashid. ""It is recommended that no official will visit this office wearing pheran, traditional trousers and sleeper/plastic shoes.""

The Langate region is in North Kashmir.

While the ban has been revoked, local reports say that in the state civil secretariat the pheran is on the list of ""barred items"" that need to be removed near the security gate."

The nation grew very fond of this 19-year old emerging artiste from Kerala ever since a Malayalam movie's less-than-a-minute-long song teaser released in February featured her as a schoolgirl who winks in response to the playful advances of a classmate.

If you are a millennial with an internet device permanently in hand, chances are you are also familiar with minutiae of information about her personal life that has been making rounds on social media almost every day since February.

As many were floored by her wink, the video went viral almost overnight. She propelled into one of India's quickest internet celebrities ever. She now ranks among Instagram's most popular accounts in India, with 6.2 million followers, adding an unprecedented 606,000 followers in a day. The BBC called it ""The Wink That Stopped India"". ""Why weren't you in my time?"" lamented veteran Indian actor Rishi Kapoor on Twitter.

How could such an event of extreme popularity be complete without controversy in India? As it happens, religious clerics in two states found the ""wink"" tantamount to an insult to their religion and filed criminal cases against Priya and others involved in making the film. And while the song, Manikya Malaraya Poovi, has been a part of Kerala's culture for at least four decades, Islamic clerics found its depiction in the movie as hurting religious sentiments. The wink was seen as against Islamic beliefs, according to these scholars, as the song describes the love between Prophet Mohammed and his first wife Khadeeja. Eventually, the case was squashed by the Supreme Court.

That she has rocketed into some dimension of fame far beyond anyone else's experience is borne out by Google India's annual search rankings released on Thursday. Priya was the most searched personality in the country among the search engine giant's Indian users, the report said, putting her in the league of actresses such as Sunny Leone and Priyanka Chopra, other A-listers who climbed up in the list over the years.

*****

After days of trying to fix an interview -- the networking consisted of sending recommendations from several prominent people, including a local MP who is also a film star -- it felt a bit surreal to meet Priya at her home in Thrissur.

For Priya's father Prakash Varrier, a customs officer sporting a big moustache that curls upward at its ends, taking personal interview requests from journalists like I has become a chore. He is trying to limit them to as few as possible, or get them done over the phone. Taking her outside the house for an interview on short notice is a strict no-no, as he worries of a mob attack by selfie-seekers.

Just before we met on Sunday, I pointed out to him that interviewing Kerala's communist chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who is notorious for not giving as many interviews as publications would want, has not been this difficult. He shot back saying: ""The CM has Black Cat security. My daughter has only me to protect her.""

The customs officer is both her manager and guardian. This week was particularly hectic, he said. She was in London for most of the week, acting in a promo of a yet-to-be-titled Bollywood movie. After landing back in Kerala, before she could even get over the jetlag, she went to see off a friend who was going to Muscat. And then came Google India's annual search rankings, followed by a flurry of calls from journalists seeking interviews.

But every so often, she has to return to her humdrum existence as a college-going student in Thrissur's women's-only Vimala College, a precondition to finish her commerce graduation. ""It (the film career) should not collide with her academics. I don't want others to tell my daughter later that, oh you have studied only until plus two,"" said Prakash.

*****

Close to the heart of the city, Priya lives with her family in a two-bedroom flat that ends not so long after it begins, filled with regular furniture and other items except for a huge flat screen TV hung on the wall. It has little to suggest that it is the house of a tinseltown A-lister who reportedly charges lakhs for endorsing everything from snacks to a shopping mall.

The father repeated his demand that the interview not take too long (of course, we overshot his deadline of 15 minutes) as she has to later attend a function in the city. The mother and another woman remained in the kitchen. A tall, jolly man walked by the door introducing himself as the grandfather.

Priya soon emerged from one of the bedrooms, having finished her makeup for the photo shoot and wearing a purple dress. She took a seat in front of us, hunched her shoulders and leaned a little forward, as though tired. The photographer with me later said he was worried if the pictures would look good if she remained in that pose.

But once she started talking, the excited and giddily laughing 19-year-old who took the internet by storm was back before us. Her large round eyes were bright, describing the strange tales of the wonderland she has slipped into this year.

""I'm enjoying it,"" she said. ""The best thing happened this year was the song's release. After that, I started working, which is the (next) best part... at this age... I always wanted to be an actress."" She added: ""And when I am not working I go to college.""

Life is the same and not quite the same.

""We have always been a middle-class family. I have always thought of myself as a middle-class background. I still take the local bus to travel to college. At the beginning (after she became famous) my parents were very scared of me going out. But I love going out, I can never stop doing that. Sometimes it is bothersome. Even when you are eating, they come up and ask for selfies. But now I enjoy it.""

She counts moments from multiple film award functions and movie launches to which she was invited, and meeting the who's who of the Indian film industry, as some of the most cherished memories the year has brought. The virality, still, remains a puzzle to unlock.

""Maybe there was a freshness to it. Nowadays everybody is on their phones... texting... even while talking they are on their phone. Their faces don't express anything. Maybe when that (wink) came out, (people thought of it as) something innocent, fresh thing, striking,"" she said.

She looks forward to 2019. Apart from the Bollywood movie, she has said yes to a Telugu and a Tamil movie. The Malayalam movie Oru Adaar Love that featured the song is also set to release on 14 February. The number of movies was deliberately kept low so her movie dreams do not come in the way of her college exams, said Prakash. ""Of course, I want to continue working. But I don't want to interrupt my studies. Definitely, my parents would not approve of it. They want me to complete graduation. I'm trying to balance both,"" said Priya.

*****

It's tempting to see Priya's rise to fame as a sort of Indian version of the so-called American dream. A woman from nowhere reaches everywhere.

Priya has surely achieved a degree of independence in her life, even before reaching her 20s. Many would dream to be in her shoes for sure. But then, it is also hard not to miss the contrast between the bright side and the other side of her life, and that of other women.

The internet that made her has slowly started eating her up. In the months after the song went viral, she was at the receiving end of wide-scale targeted attacks in the online space. It first started with allegations of marketing gimmicks behind her virality, and then slowly built an image of her as an arrogant, untalented, brash young girl. Her dress sense, more modern than traditional, also came under attack. From sexist jokes to morphed nude pictures, the internet unleashed a monster upon her.

On YouTube, people have made almost a troll empire around her. Two brand advertisements she did during this period did not fare well and ended up as fodder for further trolling.

""Initially, it was disappointing and disheartening, the hate comments. Because these were the same people who brought me up and then they started putting me down. But then, I understood this is a part of the system. If you're famous, if you are a public figure, then you are up for this. You have to face this,"" said Priya.

What she also has to face is the system at her college. Vimala College, run by the nuns of the Syro-Malabar Church, the largest Indian Catholic church, emphasizes canonical culture and morality. Part of the reason why parents send their kids to Vimala is that there are no boys to get entangled in relationships, which means the very act that made Priya a star, winking at a boy, would have had a very different ending if she had tried it in real life.

Vimala College's unforgiving discipline rules are famous in Kerala, even as it remains a sought-after higher education institution. Forget watching viral videos or using the internet, students are not allowed to carry cell phones to the college or hostel. A board outside the front entrance reads: ""Visiting students during working hours is strictly forbidden."" Inside, dozens of closed circuit cameras closely monitor students' movements.

""Every college in the neighbourhood has similar disciplinary rules, only that ours get hyped a lot,"" said Beena Jose, the pleasingly warm principal of the college and a nun herself, sitting in front of a television that monitors visual feeds from all surveillance cameras.

She said she doesn't know much about Priya, as she was appointed to the post only a few months ago. She then invited another tutor who is directly involved with Priya's academics.

""She is a very studious student, she got in with more than 80-90% marks, and still scores about 70% marks in exams despite her busy schedule,"" said the tutor, who did not want to be named. ""She never had an air that, oh, she is so famous. But in general, we don't draw attention to such things. Other students will feel left out. I actually would like her not to pursue the movie career, but her academics,"" she said.

When told of this exchange, Priya said she is aware of such talk. ""From a very young age, I wanted to do what I wanted to do, whatever people might say. I didn't want to go by the perception of the society. The people here are very judgemental about whatever girls do. They can never accept me.""

By the time we left the college, it was late afternoon. There was a small commotion outside the main gate that seals the high-walled compound. The girls gathered there wanted to go out for some reason, but the security guard refused to open the gates.

When we arrived, he slowly opened the gate, just enough for a bike to be let out. We could hear the girls grumbling at the gate while driving past: ""Run, Run, let's run out of the gate.""

Maybe they should try winking in front of a camera.

She was arguably India's biggest internet sensation of 2018, rising to fame after her wink in a promo video of her debut Malayalam film went viral. She was called India's national crush, the winking sensation, the wink queen, among others, in national and international publications, making her an overnight star.

The rise

In one day, she attracted as many as 606,000 fresh Instagram followers. Such a rise in followers is unprecedented among Indian celebrities. Soon after, with 6.2 million followers, she also beat some of the global giants on the popular photo-sharing platform in terms of followers, including Instagram and Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg.

The search

She emerged as the most searched after personality on the internet in India, according to search engine giant Google India's annual analytics report released on Thursday. She toppled actress Sunny Leone, last year's winner, and is second only to Priyanka Chopra's spouse Nick Jonas after their wedding was prominently featured on the news.

The controversy

She also made news of the other kind after some Islamic clerics said her video went against the tenets of their religion. Criminal charges were filed against Priya and the movie's makers also claiming that the song, long part of Kerala's culture, hurt religious sentiments. However, these charges were later squashed by the Supreme Court.

The upshot

It's tempting to see Priya Varrier's rise to fame as a sort of Indian version of the so-called American dream. A woman from nowhere reaches everywhere. While society may rely upon personal success stories like hers to redefine the idea of womanhood and freedom, it does not mean the system now has changed in favour of women."

Read : Order banning pheran on official visits withdrawn What is a Kashmiri pheran?

A pheran is a traditional Kashmiri attire worn by men and women. It resembles a long loose coat or cloak. Traditionally made from wool or tweed and worn as protection from the winter, it is now also stitched from cotton for summer.

The etymology of the word remains unclear, but could be derived from the Persian word for shirt, 'perahan', the Greek word 'apron' or even the Tajik word 'peraband'. The attire dates back to around the 15th century, when it was traditionally worn in bright colours. It is now, however, found in nearly all hues. Kashmiris consider it an integral part of their culture and identity.

Advertising Controversy over Kashmiri pheran

On December 11, a government order was passed prohibiting officials from making official visits wearing a pheran and slippers. The order stated: ""All the officers visiting this office are advised to visit with proper dress. It is recommended that no official will visit the office wearing 'feral' traditional trousers and slipper/plastic shoes."" This was, however, withdrawn yesterday after public outcry.

Omar Abdullah was among those who took to social media to protest the order. Calling it regressive, he tweeted, ""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned! This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn.""

Kashmiri poet and cultural commentator Zareef Ahmad Zareef told The Indian Express, ""Pheran is one of the last vestiges of our culture. Any attempt to ban it from public life is a misrepresentation of our culture because not only is it intrinsic to us culturally, it is also necessary due to weather. Security concerns over pheran were something Army and other security forces raised, is this now a concern for civil administration also?"""

Six persons, including principal Sanjiv Jha of New KM Public school, were earlier booked in the case. The others are absconding.

Another FIR has been filed by the education department on Monday against the same accused for running the unauthorised school.

""In August 2017, we had shut a similar unauthorised school at the same site. However, soon after they changed the name of the school and reopened it. We are hopeful that the accused will be arrested soon,"" said basic education officer, Balmukund Prasad.

The administration has also approved a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each for the families of the deceased students and the families are hopeful it will be transferred to them soon.

The incident occurred around 9.30 am on Monday in Salarpur village, while an exam was going on inside the school.

According to principal Jha's statement, the victims were standing outside to either use the washroom or to drink water. Since he was busy inside the school as examinations were going on, he didn't know the exact sequence of the event, said police officials.

Five children were trapped under the rubble of the boundary wall when it collapsed. All five had been rushed to nearby hospitals after they were extricated from the debris by the locals, the police and a team from NDRF.

Two of the students identified as Vivek Yadav (7) and Bhupendra Singh (11) died while three others were critically injured. One of the injured students was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday while the other two continue to recuperate.

According to police, construction work was in progress on the adjoining plot. The sand from the construction site was kept along the boundary wall of the school, which was about 10-feet high, and the weight of it allegedly weakened it thereby, leading to its collapse.

Police had registered an FIR against six persons, including the management of the school and the neighbour on whose plot the construction was taking place. The persons who have been booked are Amit and Sumit Bhati (owners), Deshraj Bhati (neighbouring plot owner), Sanjiv Jha (principal), Raghvendra Solanki (school manager) and the operator of the earthmover ( yet to be identified).

The FIR has been registered under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 338 (causing grievous hurt) and Section 75 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

US-based Mayfield Advisors, a venture capital that invests in consumer and enterprise companies across non-tech, tech-enabled, and technology verticals, has backed several companies, including meat start-up Licious, online food ordering platform Box8 and education start-up Simplilearn.

""In 2015, Milkbasket was created as India's first micro-delivery service for today's busy households to fulfil their grocery needs by eliminating the hassles associated with traditional offline and online grocery buying,"" said Anant Goel, co-founder and chief executive officer, Milkbasket.

The company aims to remove ""the listing habit"" that people have before buying groceries. ""I never saw my mother making a list to buy groceries. She used to buy vegetables on a daily basis from the sabjiwala. If someone realizes that they are short of some ingredient we don't want them to wait for 2-3 days till their grocery gets delivered,"" Goel said in an interview.

In May, Milkbasket had raised another $7 million as part of its Series A funding round led by Kalaari Capital, bringing its total Series A fund-raise to $14 million.

The firm will use the funds to improve its technology infrastructure, hire new hands and expand its services to at least one new city. ""Currently, Milkbasket operates in Gurugram and Noida, and we are looking to start operations in either Mumbai, Pune or Hyderabad,"" said Goel.

Goel, a former Infosys executive, had teamed up with consultant Ashish Goel, Yatish Talavdia, Anurag Jain and Ekwe Chiwundu Charles to launch Milkbasket. The app-based start-up delivers milk, bread, vegetables, dairy products and grocery for orders even as low as ₹5. It claims to have completed 5 million orders, serving 50,000 families and 600 communities.

In the micro-delivery space, Milkbasket competes with Sequoia-backed DailyNinja, Noida-based MrNeeds and Snapdeal-backed Supr Daily, among others.

Food delivery startup Swiggy and online groceries startup BigBasket are also looking to double down on the micro-delivery segment.

Bigbasket, which was in talks to invest in DailyNinja, has already entered the segment through the acquisition of RainCan, a subscription-based company, and MorningCart."

There is a glaring disconnect between the 70-year-old Indian state and the 5,000-year-old Indian nation.

Who is to say which idea of India is correct?

The recent assembly elections have again brought to the forefront our vacillating efforts to search for the idea of India that is the most appropriate for our well-being.

I wish that the ground level conditions prevalent in India today were such that a constructive interchange between (any) party in government and (any) party in the opposition were of the type that normally prevails in a true, healthy democracy for there is no doubt that democracy is the best form of government.

Today, the fundamental problem we face in our country is that the idea of India proposed by the party in government and the main opposition party are in stark contrast. There is no common ground -- not even a bit.

This lack of an intersection is what has polarised the environment to such an extreme extent that any civilised discourse between political parties and even between ordinary citizens with differing political views is becoming increasingly impossible.

The main opposition party has not done well for itself if its record over the last 70 years is any indicator of its performance. There may be those who say that 70 years is not enough to test the opposition party's idea of India, and that it has done well enough. This is a matter of opinion.

The current ruling dispensation has been in power for far too short a period to really say anything about whether or not their idea of India is more suited this ancient country.

One idea of India is based on an ancient tradition, history, fact, fiction and custom. The other is based on our Constitution, a document written 70 years ago by a group of well-meaning, largely educated people. The first model is time tested. The second model is so new that one can hardly hope that this document is a perfect one. One should not make the mistake that it is written in letters of stone.

And, yet, what is clear is that there is a glaring disconnect between the 70-year-old Indian state and the 5,000-year-old Indian nation.

Who is to say which idea of India is correct?

Or would either model work if the extent of corruption were not so all-pervasive? And that it's a matter of corruption rather than the Constitution itself which is at fault since 1947? And that the Indic model too would fail in the presence of endemic corruption?

In the end, the idea of India that we the people must choose is the one that lifts us up the ladder of progress, education and enlightenment in the shortest possible time. It's about economics finally. And all of us are groaning today because the economy is struggling -- each and every single one of us citizens of this most unfortunate country.

What would the writers of the Constitution say if they were allowed to have a peep into the India of 2019?"

Ltd, an education technology (edtech) startup, has raised $35 million in a Series C round led by education-focused investor Kaizen Private Equity, venture debt firm Alteria Capital and Brand Capital, the investment arm of media house Times Group, said a senior executive.

Toppr runs an app providing education content for students from Class 5 to Class 12. This includes test series, question banks, chats for solving doubts and preparation for entrance exams in engineering, medicine, law and chartered accountancy.

Existing venture capital investors of Toppr -- Eight Roads Ventures, Helion Ventures and SAIF Partners -- also participated in the round.

While 40% of the funds will be used for advertising and brand building, the remaining will be allocated towards product development, increasing engagement and investing in technology, Zishaan Hayath, the founder and chief executive officer of Toppr Technologies, told Mint.

India's education technology space is dominated by Byju's, which has raised $540 million at a valuation of $3.6 billion, in a funding round led by South African internet giant Naspers. The funding has made founder Byju Raveendran a billionaire overnight.

Byju's investors include Tencent, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners and private equity giant General Atlantic.

Although Byju's is bigger, Toppr's Hayath claimed students spend 110 minutes a day on the Toppr app, almost three times as much as Byju's.

""Our challenge is to demonstrate engagement, and that is what we are focussed on. Five years ago, no investor would have touched the education sector. We have established a category,"" Hayath said.

The Toppr app currently has about six million users, according to Hayath, a figure he hopes will jump to 30 million by 2020.

""Students are moving away from coaching classes, and our focus is on increasing their engagement time with the Toppr app, and substituting local tuitions with a digital platform,"" said Hayath.

In May this year, the startup raised $2.3 million (₹15.5 crore) from Alteria Capital.

Prior to that, it raised $7 million in October last year from Helion Ventures, Eight Roads Capital and SAIF Partners.

Hayath said that Toppr is already in talks to raise $80-100 million for its next round from new as well as existing investors.

He declined to elaborate.

The latest deal also marked education-focused Kaizen's second investment this year, after it co-invested in Varthana, a lender to private schools catering to students from low-income households, in April.

""We are very impressed with Toppr because they are focused on learning outcomes in a personalized manner. We have been tracking them for four years, and they have kept spending low and been investing in an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven algorithm,"" said Sandeep Aneja, managing partner at Kaizen.

He also said in the next funding round, Kaizen would like to increase its stake. It has picked up under 10% stake in the current round.

About 40% of Toppr's users are from Tier 1 cities, with the rest from smaller towns.

As the company expands, this could change, because Toppr does not have a geographical focus, and is looking for growth from all segments."

With Digital Dalit asserting herself politically, Kanshiram finds an audience.

A new feature film on the life of Bahujan Samaj Party founder Kanshiram was recently released on several YouTube channels simultaneously. In less than 48 hours, the movie has been watched by more than 2 lakh viewers. Shambhu Kumar Singh, editor of National Dastak, one of the channels where the movie was released, hopes that the number of viewers on his channel will cross the 1 million-mark (or 10 lakh) in two weeks.

The producer and director of the film, The Great Leader Kanshiram, is Arjun Singh, a 25-year-old college dropout. He borrowed money from friends and relatives to fund the project, one of whom filed a case against him after his cheque bounced. Made with a small budget of Rs 45 lakh, almost all the actors in the movie are first-timers and some are active in local theatre. There was no money to promote the movie, and as the sole distributor Arjun Singh managed to release the movie on just 20 screens. The film flopped miserably. So, he released the movie on YouTube to at least generate revenue and repay the loan.

First reason could be that there is a vibrant and expansive Dalit-Bahujan public sphere in India where the movie resonates. This 'underclass' of Indian society is starved for content based on their icons and will not let issues like quality of filmmaking and craft of storytelling stand in the way.

The second explanation for the surprising online success of The Great Leader Kanshiram could be that there is a digital audience that is curious about the person who founded Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). The Digital Dalit is an empowered being today - s/he is a product of decades of education, employment and reservation policies of Babasaheb Ambedkar, and also owes much to Kanshiram's visionary politics of mobilising the government workforce in the 1980s. The Digital Dalit is connected - in terms of technology, politics and mobility of ideas. Contemporary politics is as important as securing Dalit historiography for the Digital Dalit.

There are approximately 450 million internet users in India and the numbers will cross 500 million very soon. The number of subscribers for social media apps like Facebook and WhatsApp has crossed 250 million. We do not have data to exactly identify the sociological background of this population. But it is safe to assume that a large number of internet users in India are SCs, STs and OBCs. Consider the number of subscribers and followers of video channels and social media platforms catering especially to these groups. National Dastak YouTube channel has 2.1 million subscribers. Bahujan TV has 0.6 million, Awaaz India has 0.4 million and Dalit Dastak and Dalit News Network have 0.3 million subscribers each.

The prowess of this Digital Dalit was on display on 2 April 2018, when a Bharat Bandh was called by Dalit organisations against changes in the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Like Arab Spring, this movement originated on social media. Another instance was the controversy over Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey holding an anti-Brahminical patriarchy poster. Dalit groups refused to stay silent and organised themselves on social media.

There is not much content available on Kanshiram online. At the age of 50, he started the BSP. Without any support from either big corporates or media, the party became the third largest party in India in three decades, in terms of vote share. In 1995, BSP leader Mayawati became the chief minister of the most populated state, Uttar Pradesh. This is a miraculous achievement for a person who comes from a poor family and the shoemaker community in Punjab, which does not have any social and cultural capital. Daily humiliation and persecution in his early years was a given.

He resigned from his position as a junior officer in the government to enter politics, driven by his conviction in the ideology of equality and fraternity as envisaged by Buddha and B.R. Ambedkar. He was an alchemist in Indian politics and formed new coalitions of castes and communities.

The movie begins with his childhood in Ropar, Punjab and concludes at the transformative point when he forms the BSP. The story moves from Punjab to Pune to Nagpur to Delhi. Kanshiram wrote no autobiography, so all the movie sequences are based on oral history and folklore. The film shows a young school-going Kanshiram cutting his hair and telling his mother - Mujhe kisi bandhan mein nahin rahna hai (I don't want to be chained). There is a powerful scene where he is shown organising a mass protest against wrongful dismissal of a Dalit employee. In another standout scene, he hears about Mayawati for the first time from a karyakarta who describes her as telling a minister - Agar hum harijan bhagwan ki aulaad hain to kya tum shaitan ki aulaad ho? (If Harijans are children of God, are you all children of the devil?)

This is not a complete biography of Kanshiram. Many important landmarks of his life such as the Lok Sabha elections after 1984 and the formation of the SP-BSP government in Uttar Pradesh have not been covered. This movie is meant to be hagiographic, and there is a class of viewers who are lapping it up.

On Monday, two children, aged 10 and seven, were killed in the incident that reportedly occurred due to the impact of a heavy machine and the weight of construction materials against the wall in the adjoining plot in Salarpur village. Three students sustained injuries in the incident. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath had ordered a magisterial-level inquiry soon after the incident was reported.

Kumar was among the six accused named in the first information report against the school authorities and a heavy machinery vehicle driver. This is the first arrest made in the incident.

Social media was abuzz on Tuesday, the day after Rising Kashmir reported that the Jammu and Kashmir school education department had banned people wearing the traditional pheran in its zonal offices. The paper added: ""The development comes in the backdrop of a similar ban on the pheran in the civil secretariat (Srinagar) where the commoners visiting the administrative departments have to relinquish it at the main gate.

The report drew sharp criticism from several quarters. ""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned!"" tweeted National Conference leader and former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah. ""This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn.""

He also posted a photo of his father Farooq Abdullah and him wearing the traditional attire.

Before long, the #saynotopharanban hashtag gained prominence on Twitter, with Kashmiris posting photos of them wearing the double gown.

In September, the General Administration Department of the Civil Secretariat in Srinagar asked government officials to ""be attired in proper formal dress while appearing before any court of law and while attending offices in the State of Jammu and Kashmir and strictly avoid casual or party attire"".

The order was passed a month after the state High Court asked the government to announce an official dress code for officials attending court. The court issued the directive after it found a government officer in court not ""in proper dress"".

The order does not mention any particular form of attire. But, since the pheran is considered to be a casual dress, it is considered by some to be inappropriate in government offices.

According to the Rising Kashmir, the zonal education officer in Langate tehsil, following the civil secretariat directive, issued an order last week banning the pheran. However, the chief education officer of Kupwara told Scroll.in that the order was withdrawn on Tuesday. ""There is an official dress code but we cannot ignore the significance of pheran,"" said Mohammad Shafi War. ""That is why we have withdrawn the order issued by ZEO Langate.""

However, as Rising Kashmir reported, people visiting the secretariat in Srinagar are asked to take off their pherans and put them atop iron poles outside the gates. Officials explained that this is part of security protocol, since the pheran is a voluminous garment that could be used to conceal banned items."

When the Indian startup ecosystem - then mostly limited to Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR - was witnessing a funding frenzy in 2015, Hyderabad was still recovering from the turmoil in the wake of Telangana's birth. Known for its IT legacy, over the years, macro-economic factors had hampered growth and 2015 was almost the year for a fresh start.

Three years on, the city has acquired a serious reputation as a growing startup hub. It's not just about the funding that Hyderabad-based startups have raised. The number of entrepreneurs choosing to start up in the city is growing, as are the number of partnerships among startups, academic institutions, corporates, and the government.

One strong indicator of growth is funding raised. According to YourStory Research, Indian startups raised $8.3 billion in funding in 2015. Startups from Hyderabad raised $43 million that year - just 0.52 percent of the total. Cut to 2018: Indian startups have raised $11.23 billion so far. Of this, Hyderabad-based startups accounted for $400.95 million - that's 3.5 percent of the total.

The sheer number of startups too shows strong growth. In 2015, the Nizam's city was home to around 1,500 startups. Today, that number has grown to 4,000, according to the Telangana State Innovation Cell (TSIC).

""Hyderabad has always had a strong entrepreneurial DNA. The IT legacy is testament to that. But in these three years, there has been growing awareness and push towards new-age technology startups. Each year, at the Centre of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE), the kind of startups that come in are different. The entrepreneurs are maturing and growing,"" says Ramesh Loganathan, a professor at IIIT and a mentor and guide at CIE.

There is also a growing number of students looking to start up, he adds. According to the CIE, there are 18 student-driven startups at IIIT today, up from just eight in 2015. In all, CIE is currently incubating 78 startups versus 54 in 2015.

The push to increase startup activity in the city comes from government quarters as well - while different states have announced startup-friendly policies, for Telangana, the idea was more of a 'need to have' than 'nice to have'.

Jayesh Ranjan, IT Secretary, Telangana Government, says,

""Being one of the youngest and newest states in the country, our first agenda was to build an ecosystem of technology and innovation. Post bifurcation, Hyderabad needed to catch up, and that needed to be done fast. We felt the quickest way to do that was by encouraging startups. So, we began with a basic framework and policy, and ensured it was translated on ground.""

The state government's policy framework focused on physical infrastructure and programme management capabilities, which facilitated the setting up of T-Hub in a public-private-partnership involving active participation from three academic institutes - IIIT-H, Indian School of Business (ISB), and NALSAR.

In the first phase, 2016 saw T-Hub become operational. It is spread over 70,000 sq ft and currently houses over 200 startups. The policy document by the government states that in the second phase, the facility will be spread over 3 lakh sq ft and will house over 3,000 startups.

T-Hub offers a co-working space that gives startups a chance to forge partnerships with companies, investors, and mentors, among others. Gayam Motors, a electric vehicle (EV) startup, which was incubated out of CIE and T-Hub, was selected to be a part of the Summit Mercedes-Benz EQ Global Fellowship.

""One-third of Telangana is government land so it can be easily given to set up labs and central government institutes. What we need to push is an output and get in a stronger density of companies,"" says Phanindra Sama, Chief Innovation Officer, TSIC and Co-founder of redBus.

The CIE is now planning to set up an accelerator that will focus on health/medical technology startups.

""We realised there were growing number of healthtech and healthcare startups in the city. These needed special attention and focus; hence, we thought of developing an accelerator inside CIE itself. Many startups in the space could be a part of the incubator,"" says Ramesh.

In October this year, the government also announced the first phase of T-Works to focus on manufacturing and product startups. Sujai Karampuri, CEO, T-Works, says, ""The idea has been to create a platform and a framework where converting an idea into a product becomes easy for hobbyists, engineers, makers, engineers, entrepreneurs, etc.""

T-Works wants to lower the barriers-to-entry for prototypes and create an environment where failure to develop a product is not frowned upon.

Sujai says that as a nation we have embraced software-related solutions and businesses, but, the ""same is not the case when it comes to developing a product in the domain of mechanical, electromechanical and electronics"".

IT Secretary Ranjan says that with the legacy of IT and corporate tie-ups, stronger collaborations would be the way forward. ""There are currently 40 incubators in the city, but they need to collaborate to grow faster. Collaboration always helps and makes the city grow faster. It is like the fuel that pushes strategy into action. We have all the different aspects of the ecosystem.""

The five must-haves for a startup are idea, implementation, market, a team, and funds. To create a sustainable funding model for startups in the city, the government also set up the T-Fund last year. With an initial corpus of Rs 100 crore, it invited startups to apply so that it can fund them. The T-Fund is also planning to start a Rs 600-crore seed fund that will take contributions from private investors.

Government efforts are clearly in place, but what of the private sector and its faith in the Hyderabad startup ecosystem?

In 2018, in all, 32 startups raised $400.95 million. In 2015, this number was $43 million across 33 deals. The mix across stages also was healthy, with 2018 seeing 15 pre-Series A deals, two PE rounds, four Series A rounds, and one each in Series B, C and E. This is a big change from 2017, when no Hyderabad-based companies raised Series B, C, D or E rounds. And in 2015, while there were 22 Pre-series A rounds, there were few others in the growth stage.

Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar's interest in startups by investing in city-based USPL and Smartron gave the city a big boost. Investors agree.

""Startups in Hyderabad are as good as startups in Bengaluru, Delhi, or Mumbai. We don't invest in startups on the basis of the city or the region they are based out of,"" says Vaibhav Agarwal, Partner, LightSpeed Ventures.

While there is increased interest in the ecosystem, there are few funds or investors with offices in Hyderabad. The one that stands out is Endiya Partners. The Hyderabad-based early-stage venture capital firm was started by Sateesh Andra, Dr Ramesh Byrapaneni, and Abhishek Srivastava. The two-year-old fund has approximately Rs 200 crore to invest, and focuses on SaaS, security, mobility, semiconductors, fintech, digital healthcare, and medical devices.

Of the eight companies in Endiya Partners' portfolio, two - Ekincare and Darwinbox - are based out of Hyderabad.

""We believe Hyderabad has a strong base of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. There is a strong product and growth focus in startups here. Also, when it comes to investments, we are sure we will soon add more Hyderabad startups to our portfolio,"" says Sateesh.

A seed investor based in the city says, ""The founders are getting a little more mature, and the startups here are understanding the focus on product.""

What would put Hyderabad on the startup map in a bigger way, say mentors and founders, is having a big startup from the city. Anu Acharya, Founder of Mapmygenome, says startups from the city are more driven towards enterprise tech, software, and healthcare. The last is, in fact, one of the top sectors garnering investment. This year, healthcare has accounted for $130 million of the total funding raised by Hyderabad-based startups.

Also, ThinCI, which is registered in the US, but runs its operations from the city, raised Series C of $65 million this year, reinforcing its image as a favourite for SaaS startups.

""I am guessing this (focus on healthcare and SaaS) is driven more by the legacy of healthcare and IT in the city,"" says Rohit Chennammeni, Co-founder, Darwinbox, an HR-tech startup.

Endiya's Ramesh Byrapaneni, a cardiologist-turned-investor, says that while the existing healthcare ecosystem has enabled the growth and development of several healthtech startups, a complete ecosystem would help.

""We already have large pharmaceutical companies and hospital chains here. What is needed is an ecosystem of interaction. Currently, I feel many startups lack an understanding of ground realities. If they begin working with the hospital chains and pharma companies, they can build solutions for real-world problems. I see that happening now,"" he says.

Healthtech startups based in Hyderabad include StanPlus, Nephroplus, Call Health and Ekincare.

Mahesh Lingareddy, Chairman of consumer tech firm Smartron, says, ""When we talk of startups, there has been a push or focus towards B2C or more consumer internet companies. Now, we believe there is a need for real product innovation. Hence, I founded Smartron out of Hyderabad. When I came back (from the US), I knew I wanted to do something more than IT services, which was strong in Hyderabad. I wanted to put product innovation from India on the world map.""

To this, Sujai adds that over the last 10 years, Indians have been slowly gravitating towards building businesses around hardware, both mechanical and electronics. ""We have companies that make wearables, electric bikes, IoT gadgets, and medical devices right here in Hyderabad. With Industrial Revolution 4.0, creating products has become democratised. Indian startups are bound to take advantage of this trend and T-Works will become a great enabler,"" he says.

""There is a redBus mafia, a Flipkart mafia, a FreeCharge mafia - we need something like that here,"" says Phanindra. ""Each of the larger companies should give birth to 30 more companies; that will create a vibrant ecosystem. We need one big ingredient - a strong mix of a mentorship network of people who have built large companies and old traditional businesses. At TSIC, we are working to bring in that round of collaboration,"" he adds.

While ThinCI might have created waves for Hyderabad, it is still missing a big name like Flipkart or Paytm.

Ramesh says the number of applications from students to be a part of CIE has gone up as against those from people with experience. ""There is an increased number of students willing to experiment and try out. Three years back, we had to build more awareness and tell students that they could look at entrepreneurship as an option. Today, students themselves approach us. However, there can still be more number of students coming in,"" he adds.

Over the last three years, Hyderabad has been going all guns blazing - from policies and infrastructure, to funding, mentorship and even education. What remains to be seen is how it succeeds and how the Hyderabad startup ecosystem evolves in the days to come."

The 46 students of GPS Satlaka have to brace a school building falling apart at its seams. There are five classrooms, but all classes take place in only one, as the condition of the rest is terrible. ""One can spot cow dung on the floors, broken benches, blackboards and doors. Across the building, the seepage is so heavy that during monsoons this year, the roof of one classroom collapsed,"" said Virender Singh, guest teacher.

TOI also spotted dogs roaming in the classrooms. ""This entire building is unsafe and unfit for tiny tots. Since there is no guard, cows wander in and take shelter inside at night. I'm not paid to clean up the dung,"" said Rahisa, the school's sole sanitation staff. Since the building was constructed in 1972, no teacher has spent more than a year in this school.

Shivji Park Primary School

Shivji Park Primary School doesn't even have its own building. It operates out of Government Senior Secondary School Kadipur, whose classrooms are in a shambles. ""Students are forced to sit in the school hallway or even in the open, as none of the eight classrooms we've been allotted are usable,"" said head teacher Satpal. Even teachers of the Kadipur school are unaware when the crumbling walls were last repaired.

Govt Primary School, Kadipur

One look at the building of GPS Kadipur is enough to tll you that a disaster is waiting to happen. ""There are 180 students in this school. Every now and then, chunks of plaster fall off, making it dangerous for them. The old building has been declared a threat, and a new building is being constructed. Unfortunately, construction work stopped six months ago,"" said a teacher, requesting anonymity.

Govt Primary Feroze Gandhi School Shivaji Park

The 70 tiny tots who study in GPFGS Shivaji Park, have to cross mounds of garbage and pools of stagnant water to enter the premises every day. ""Every day, locals throw trash in front of the school. We've spoken with the authorities, but this doesn't stop,"" said a teacher, requesting anonymity."

A few departments have failed to upload accurate information on the information resource book (IRB) portal for the NIRF rankings -- data that is used to evaluate the university.

The discrepancies begin with department of laws and psychology department saying they have zero research scholars, according to the internal quality assurance cell (IQAC) of the university. The fact is that the former has 250 and the psychology department 65 research scholars.

The department of community education has submitted it has only one research scholar as against last year's 23. The IQAC has communicated these inconsistencies to the chairpersons of all the departments. According to the IQAC report, the environment department has mentioned only 12 research scholars in contrast to last year's 38.

The departments have also faulted on higher studies and placement data. There is a huge gap in the information with the placement cell and departments. It has been observed the departments have not informed the placement cell about the data.

The report has pointed out that some departments have not even updated the data about their faculty members. ""Since we had some of the faculty information through personal level, we realized the faculty data provided by the departments was unreliable.

The task of correcting the mismatch was done by the IQAC as there was a serious risk that in the absence of accurate faculty data, PU might lose its status in NIRF altogether,"" stated the communication to the chairpersons.

'NIRF gives 2 days to correct data'

Explaining about the procedure, IQAC director M Rajivlochan said the NIRF officials give an opportunity to correct the data. ""On earlier occasions, we have made efforts to collect data at the second level and correct it on the website of the NIRF. They give two days to correct the errors. Moreover, the NIRF itself runs checks which allow it to spot discrepancies and point them out to us,"" he added.

It is also suggested that if the departments feel overburdened, the administrative work could be handed over to registrar's office, as it happens in all private universities. The IQAC has requested the departments to submit the correct data.

Moreover, discrepancies were also found in the sponsored research project details of the departments. The IQAC verified the data with the information available with the finance and development officer (FDO) and found ""serious mismatches"". The IQAC then used the data available with the FDO to prepare a report for NIRF submission."

Indicating that a further simplification of the Goods and Services Tax is on the anvil, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his government wants to ensure that ""99 percent things"" attract sub-18 percent GST slab.

Before the implementation of the GST, registered enterprises numbered 65 lakh, which has now risen by 55 lakh, PM Modi said at a media summit in Mumbai.

""Today, the GST system has been established to a large extent and we are working towards a position where 99 percent things will attract the sub-18 percent GST slab,"" Modi said.

Modi indicated that the 28 percent GST slab would only be restricted to a few select items, such as luxury goods. He said the effort will be to ensure that 99 percent of all items, including almost all items used by the common man, would be kept at 18 percent or less.

4. Indian Mobile Users Second Most Spammed in the World

The pain inflicted upon mobile phone users by unsolicited commercial phone calls and SMSs seems to be far from over. Indian mobile phone users received the second highest number of spam calls worldwide in 2018, according to Truecaller's Insight Special report for 2018 released on Tuesday, 18 December.

Over 6 percent of the overall calls received by Indian users in 2018 were spam calls, the report said, without disclosing the total number of such calls. An average Indian phone user received 22.3 spam calls a month in 2018, the second-highest in the world.

Brazil topped the list, with its users receiving an average 37.5 unsolicited calls a month. However, average uninvited calls received per user in India is 1.5 percent less than the previous year, when India topped the list. Interestingly, spam communications in India seem to originate from telecom operators themselves.

7. Binny Bansal Eyes $100 Mn Payout After His Abrupt Exit

Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal is negotiating fresh terms to receive cash payouts from Walmart after he resigned from the online retailer as chairman and group chief executive officer (CEO) last month, two people familiar with the matter said.

According to his earlier contract, Bansal would have received cash from Walmart for over half of his 4-4.5 percent Flipkart stake that is worth more than $850 million after August 2020, sources said. However, after his resignation Bansal might receive an immediate, smaller payment of about $100 million, sources said.

Last month, Bansal abruptly resigned as Flipkart chairman and group CEO following an internal investigation into an allegation of ""serious personal misconduct"" against him.

Binny Bansal would use the payments from Walmart to invest in startups, the two people cited earlier said. He already has investments in more than 20 startups, including SigTuple, Roposo and Ather Energy, according to data from researcher Tracxn.

Shocked by the incident, the school sent out a flurry of notices to parents warning of strict action if students below the age of 13 (Class VI onwards) are found having their own social media accounts. The notice includes an advisory on how to monitor social media activities of students.

A senior cyber crime officer probing the case said police have sought legal help to understand whether using an open device without the explicit consent of its minor owner can be construed legally as hacking and secondly if it's a cognizable offence if some of the accused are under-age.

However, this is not the first incident where students have used social media to make fun of teachers or post rude comments full of slangs. In fact, as TOI found out, it is quite common among students of city schools to create online communities and pages to disparage teachers and, in some cases, they have openly named their schools.

In a similar incident at another top boys' school, a group of students hacked into a social media account of a student to post offensive comments on certain issues and teachers forcing the school to call in the cyber crimes cops, who identified the culprits.

Schools begin to track students' cyber footprints

The school stopped short of expelling the boys but dealt with them severely. Now the school has set up a secret group of tech-savvy teachers who keep an eye on students' cyber activities.

Rude online activities are not restricted to boys alone. ""We had a girl mentioning an intimate incident involving the school on Facebook. She posted rude comments without mentioning the name of the school, but it was clear which school. We called the parents and took her to task. We are keeping strict vigil,"" said the principal of a leading central Kolkata girls' school.

Concerned by the rise in such online behaviour, city schools are taking steps to keep an eye on their students' cyber footprints.

""We have a vigilance group that is keeping an eye on the social media activity of senior boys. We are holding regular parent-teachers meetings to get the former oriented about the kind of trouble their wards might get into,"" said T H Ireland, principal, St James' School.

Agrees Aruna Gomes, principal of Loreto House. ""We keep ourselves pre-warned and our value education classes are full of advisories,"" she said.

Teachers feel it all starts with the idea of having fun but soon gets out of control. ""Accepting this, we are trying to tell our boys that such negative activity is not fun but a crime. Criticising teachers is an ageold thing but taking it to the level of social publishing is something one never dreamt of. We are organising workshops where we are getting cyber experts to talk to boys,"" said said Mukta Nain, principal, Birla High School for Boys.

Shane Calvert, secretary, La Martiniere schools, advised students to make judicious use of social media.

""Stop, think and connect is what I am asking students to do. They should stop to think every time they get the urge to play pranks on social media. Judicious use of the internet can take them places whereas irresponsible use can bring a lot of harm,"" he said."

""When I told them that my mother is a lawyer and father a business man, they asked me if my parents have not taught me to respect teachers. Then they forced me to say sorry... I feel very guilty and ashamed,"" she wrote in her letter.

The girl, who is said to have even stopped eating after the treatment meted out to her, said that the taunting started after she failed to stand up to wish her Hindi teacher who came to her class when mathematics class was ongoing.

""Since the child was not feeling well she did not stand up and wish the teacher. Taking this as a disrespect the teacher took the child to the headmaster and was then forced her to apologise in front of other students. The child is now very disturbed,"" said Achyuta Rao of BHS.

The traditional Kashmiri pheran (the loose gown worn during winters) is at the heart of a controversy in Kashmir valley after the education department in Langate banned the dress in its offices.

Leading the campaign against the pheran ban is National Conference vice-president and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, who has started a campaign on Twitter to revoke the ban. Drawing flak, the education department withdrew the order in a bid to calm tempers.

The controversy started when the zonal education officer of Langate issued a circular banning pheran, traditional trousers and sleeper/plastic shoes in his office.

""All officials visiting the office are advised to visit in proper dress code during any official visit. It is recommended that no official will visit this office wearing pheran, traditional trousers and sleeper/plastic shoes,"" read the circular.

The issue snowballed into a major controversy with people taking to social media calling it an assault on the Kashmiri culture. ""My father and I have worn pherans to official functions many times over the years and will continue to do so, silly government orders notwithstanding,"" Omar tweeted, with hashtags #dontbanourpheran and #revokepheranban.

People posted pictures wearing the pheran on Twitter to register their protest and oppose the ban. Omar too posted his and his father's pictures, wearing the pheran during functions.

""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned! This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter, aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn,"" Omar said.

Under fire, the education department on Tuesday withdrew the order in a bid to put an end to the raging controversy. ""Teachers were coming to the office wearing sleepers and trousers. He the (zonal education officer) had reprimanded them not to do so. Then he issued an order in which he also included the pheran. Since pheran is our cultural dress, we have withdrawn the order,"" Mohommad Shafi War, chief education officer, Kupwara, told DNA.

Officials said the directions were issued with an aim to maintain office decorum and discipline. ""Since the pheran ban became an issue, we withdrew the order completely,"" said War.

Pheran is a traditional dress of Kashmir and both men and women take pride in donning it. Older Kashmiri women wear it throughout the year while men prefer to wear it during winters to keep warm.

People also use a 'kangri' (traditional fire pot) under the pheran to keep themselves warm. In 2014, the Army had to withdraw its advisory urging journalists not to wear pheran while visiting its Corps Headquarters."

Patel was appointed after Dr Dipendrasinh Jadeja from Faculty of Arts, who was handling the charge of OSD submitted his resignation citing personal reasons.

With this, the Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya has got a third OSD in recent times to handle its affairs which have got messed up due to severe infighting amongst warring factions of students and teachers.

Before Jadeja, professor Adhya Saxena, head of the history department, was handling the charge of OSD.

Since March this year, the Mahavidyalaya is surrounded by controversies related to paper leaks, sexual harassment and alleged favouritism by teachers.

The internal rivalry between the warring factions had taken a new turn when a group of students had accused two staffers Praful Purohit and Chetan Pandya of passing lewd comments at them.

The representations against the duo by students group state that the duo have been misbehaving with them since the last two years and in the past too a similar complaint was filed against them in 2015.

After repeated complaints, the university had debarred the duo from undertaking any academic responsibilities including exam duties.

The university has also formed a committee to look into the allegations against the duo which both Purohit and Pandya have refuted.

On the other hand, a group of students have also come out in support of the duo, who they say are being targeted by their rivals.

Although the university has appointed another OSD to handle the affairs of BSM, the internal affairs are unlikely to change at the institute.

There is also a feeling inside some sections of BSM that the university itself is not keeping any concrete long-term that can resolve the issues at the institute as all the OSDs appointed so far are those who are out of sync with its affairs."

It is recommended that no official will visit the office wearing 'feral' traditional trousers and slipper/plastic shoes.""

Speaking to The Indian Express, Rashid said, ""People used to walk into offices wearing pherans and carrying kangris, and I had asked for that to be banned. Today the chief education officer (CEO) called me and asked me to revoke the order, so I have.""

He denied that there was ""any official line"" on banning the outfit from public offices. He said he had passed the order in his capacity as ZEO, and revoked it after being asked to.

Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the order regressive. ""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned! This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn,"" he tweeted on Tuesday.

The NC vice-president also tweeted pictures of himself and his father Farooq Abdullah sporting pherans at public events.

Kashmiri poet and cultural commentator Zareef Ahmad Zareef asked if the administration was adopting operating procedures of the forces. ""Pheran is one of the last vestiges of our culture. Any attempt to ban it from public life is a misrepresentation of our culture because not only is it intrinsic to us culturally, it is also necessary due to weather. Security concerns over pheran were something Army and other security forces raised, is this now a concern for civil administration also?"" he told The Indian Express."

Authorities of Bihar's education department were unaware of the regressive practice being followed at the GA Higher Secondary (Plus 2) School at Lalganj in Vaishali district so far. After the matter came to light following a recent inquiry by officials, a shocked state government ordered an inquiry on Tuesday.

While all students of the school usually come to the institute together and leave the premises together, they are made to sit in different classrooms as per their castes and religions according to a system followed for the past four years, said sources. Students from Dalit and Muslim communities are reportedly never allowed to visit other classrooms.

There are also separate sections and rooms for students belonging to Hindu and Muslim communities at the school, said sources. Similarly, separate classrooms have also been allotted for students of each class belonging to the upper castes, OBCs and Dalits. The school also uses separate attendance registers for different social groups of the students.

""An inspection of the school made it clear that such a system indeed prevails there. We are sending a detailed report to the district education officer for instructions on suitable action on the matter,"" said Arvind Kumar Tiwari, the Block Education officer (BEO) of Lalganj.

School headmistress Meena Kumari, however, claimed that the social segregation of students has been proving useful in many ways. ""This system is in place in order to facilitate a smooth educational process and also to ensure that the execution of government schemes becomes easier. There is no discrimination on the basis of caste or religion,"" she said.

""There have been no negative effects of this system at the school so far. Besides, there has never been a complaint against this system, which is running smoothly,"" argued the headmistress.

Bihar education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma expressed shock upon learning of the segregation of students along caste and religious lines at a government-run school.

""It is very unfortunate if it is really happening. I have ordered a thorough investigation of the matter. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against whoever is found responsible for it,"" he added."

Eastern Mirror Desk

Dimapur, Dec. 18: Nagaland is the sixth best state in India for teenage girls to live, according to the Teen Age Girls (TAG) Report 2018 released on Tuesday. Kerala was listed first with an index value of 703.1; Nagaland's index value was 625.

Between Kerala and Nagaland were Mizoram, Sikkim, Manipur, and Himachal Pradesh. A total of nine indicators that best represent the wellbeing dimension in the survey were taken into consideration for arriving at this index.

The announcement was made during a dissemination workshop for TAG Report 2018 which was organised by the Naandi (Sanskrit for 'new beginning') Foundation and its dissemination partner, 'Helping Organisation for Poverty Alleviation and Rural Development,' at Hotel Acacia in Dimapur on December 18. The resource persons include chief policy officer of Naandi Foundation, Rohini Mukherjee; member of Naandi Foundation, Sudhir Kumar Sharma; and senior medical officer, Dr. C Tetseo.

Summation of percentage value of nine indicators for each state was ranked according to their index value. It includes: currently enrolled in educational institution, never married between 13-19 years, do not go for open defecation, hygienic menstrual protection, normal haemoglobin levels, normal body mass index, five or more 'new age skills'*, own mobile phone, and age appropriate schooling.

The report is stated to be India's first ever teenage girls' survey, which was conducted by Naandi Foundation in 2016-17, under the aegis of Project Nanhi Kali (Hindi for 'small buds') and KC Mahindra Education Trust. The survey findings have been used to prepare an index to indicate the status of teenage girls in India. It also shows how each state is performing on status of teenage girls and allows comparing between states.

Founded on Nov. 1, 1998 at Hyderabad, Naandi Foundation has been implementing Project Nanhi Kali for over a decade, supporting girls to complete ten years of basic schooling in different part of the country. More than 3,00,000 girls from 15 states have been a part of Nanhi Kali.

The project's current operations are spread across Maharashtra, national capital region, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, supporting 1,50,000 girls in the programme.

In reaffirmation of commitment to the cause of girl child, Project Nanhi Kali conducted a nationwide survey last year, to understand 'what it means to be a teenage girl in India today.' Close to 1000 women surveyors visited over 70,000 households in rural and urban areas in 30 states of India, interviewed teenage girls and took height and weight measurements using digital devices 'without the use of pen and paper.'

The data collected during 2016-17 were analysed and published as the TAG Report 2018. It was released by the founder of Project Nanhi Kali and Chairman of Naandi Foundation, Anand Mahindra along with three other members -- Geeta Phogat, Heena Sidhu, and Poorna Malavath in Mumbai on Oct. 25, 2018.

The report contains various findings about aspirations, challenges, and status of teenage girls.

According to Mukherjee, the team surveyed 22 girls each from 75 urban and rural areas in Nagaland for a duration between four to five months. While talking to Eastern Mirror about the project, she explained that the objective was to eradicate the misconception about teenage girls being vulnerable and weak.

""We want to highlight the fact that she, as an individual, can be educated, healthy, and can contribute to society and to the economy. This surveyed report will help everybody understand the current status of teenage girls and the critical contribution that she can potentially offer to the country,"" asserted Mukherjee.

According to the census of India 2011, Nagaland has a teenage girl (13-19 years) population of 1,57,169 out of the total population of 19,78,502 with an adolescent (10-19 years) sex ratio of 935.

In the TAG Report 2018, Nagaland has topped more than 22 states, scoring above 50% mark in almost all the nine indicators. As indicated in the graph, the currently enrolled in educational institution is 89.4%, never married between 13-19 years is 99.2%, do not go for open defecation is 78.9%, hygienic menstrual protection is 74.2%, normal haemoglobin levels is 85.3%, normal body mass index is 72.2%, five or more 'new age skills'* is 47.5%, own mobile phone is 30.8%, and age appropriate schooling is 47.5% with an index value of 625.

List of 'new age skills' covered in TAG survey includes:

1. Ability to make and receive calls on a mobile phone.

2. Fill forms in English or local language.

3. Search for information on the internet, send, and receive emails.

4. Use social media.

5. Write a document in English on a computer.

6. Withdraw money from an ATM, bank, or post office.

7. Ask a male stranger for directions or help.

8. Travel alone on a journey longer than four hours.

9. Live alone.

10. Go to a police station to file a complaint."

Despite artificial intelligence's promise to help marketers reach consumers in ways that are better, faster and cheaper, executives can wind up wasting time and money when they actually try it, according to industry experts and analysts.

""Every marketer wants to be famous and wants to say, 'I'm using AI,'"" said Stéphane Bérubé, chief marketing officer for Western Europe at L'Oréal SA. But they also think they're experts on the topic just because they've been to a few conferences, he said. ""Instead of saying, 'What can I do with AI?' they need to say, 'Here's what I would like to do with my dialogue or relationship with consumers, and can AI help?'""

Marketers think the technology is the hardest aspect of AI, said Bérubé. ""I think it's the easy part. The tough part is finding the purpose.""

L'Oréal could have better thought out the chatbot it introduced last year to encourage people to buy products as gifts, Bérubé said. It asks both potential gift-givers and the potential recipients a series of questions before suggesting options. ""The consumer experience ended up being a bit complex,"" he said.

ALSO READ: Now, take a perfect selfie in one shot, thanks to artificial intelligence

L'Oréal improved that bot over time, Bérubé added, and introduced a ""virtual skin expert"" this year with stronger traction. It developed both bots with Automat.ai, which builds conversational marketing bots for brands.

L'Oréal also has found success with AI in areas such as using image recognition to enable virtual product testing and skin analysis, fueled by its acquisition this year of augmented reality and AI company ModiFace, he said. ""How can a consumer be on her phone at home or wherever, in a store, and be able to try a product without necessarily trying it?""

It's tempting to spend time and money on something sexy like a skill for a home voice assistant when unglamorous applications could pay off better, said Sucharita Kodali, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research. ""When I'm in the middle of a grocery store, why can't I shout, or talk, and say, 'Hey Kroger, where is the light brown sugar?'"" she said.

ALSO READ: Miscreants, beware! Mr Artificial Intelligence is the new cop in town

""Voice exists, and there are use cases that I have in the store, but nobody has married that together to provide something that's useful to me,"" Kodali added. ""Those solutions, unfortunately, are built by Silicon Valley bros who often don't even understand what customers want and therefore don't build useful solutions.""

Retailers are more effectively using machine learning to prevent fraudulent transactions, Kodali said. ""Those are things that are pretty categorically strong investments.""

Choosing partners

Brands are panning for gold in a flood of AI promises from vendors that might not have the expertise necessary to deliver. ""Most of them have no idea how the technology truly works and don't have the talent required to put it into practice,"" said Andy Mauro, co-founder and chief executive of Automat.ai. ""And that's where you get into trouble.""

A marketer should put two questions to any AI vendor, Mauro said: How many PhDs are on staff, and does the company focus on the marketer's category? ""There's no free lunch in any of this,"" he said. ""In order to do a good job in AI, there does need to be a certain degree of specialisation.""

Testing is wise at the start, but too much caution can be counterproductive, executives said.

""We see clients that say, 'Oh my God, this is available, let's do a test,'"" said Or Shani, founder and CEO of Albert Technologies, which offers an AI marketing platform to brands. ""And they give you the worst brand they have in the worst market they have and then they don't understand why it doesn't work.""

Commitment also requires marketers to prepare their teams to welcome the machines, Shani said. ""They sign off and we start dealing with their marketing team or media team and they see us as a massive threat,"" he said. ""They need to do some internal education to make sure people understand, 'Guys, this is online to make your jobs better.'""

Setting limits

When the fashion design house Natori Co deployed AI from Albert Technologies to optimise its advertising in social media, the return on its ad spending soared, according to Ken Natori, president of the company. But there was a problem: ""Some people commented that we looked like a discount website because so many sale items were being advertised on Facebook , "" Natori said.

Albert was increasing the number of sale ads that Natori ran because they were working -- a reasonable response for a system instructed to maximise ad performance. But Albert didn't consider whether too many sale ads could hurt a brand's image.

""We said, 'Listen guys, love the return here, but the percentage of ads that are promoting sale product is too high and we're not comfortable what it's doing for our brand,'"" Natori said. The company fixed the mix by setting some limits."

Some have termed it as an onslaught on Kashmir culture.

Former chief minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah termed the move as regressive.

""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned! This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn,"" wrote Omar Abdullah and shared pictures with his father Farooq Abdullah wearing the dress to official functions.

Zonal Education Officer(ZEO), Langate in north Kashmir's Kupwara has issued an order prohibiting the wearing of Pheran for officials.

""All the officials visiting this office are advised to visit with proper dress code during any official visit. It is recommended that no official will visit this office wearing 'Feran', traditional trousers and sleeper/plastic shoes (sic),"" the order read.

Pheran, a loose outer garment often worn over warm clothes in winters, was introduced in Kashmir some 600 years ago from Middle East. Despite differences in the culture, social status and dialect of the local communities, the Pheran worn over the years to brave the chilling temperatures of winter, has been a great leveler of Kashmir society.

Of late this traditional baggy gown has turned fashionable in valley, serving a double purpose for the youth of looking trendy and braving the winter chill. Strapped shoulders, raglan sleeves and contrasting buttons, the Pheran is now tight like an overcoat but covering like a traditional cloak would.

The order saw widespread criticism on social media.

Veteran journalist Yusuf Jameel was scathing against the order. ""The officer who has sought to ban wearing of pheran in office appears to be suffering from 'hum angrezon ke zamane ke sahab hain' syndrome. Get a life! We do take pride in our culture, customs, traditions and living styles,"" he wrote.

A restaurant owner, Roohi Nazki criticized the order saying ""This is illogical, insulting and a cultural put down. Who comes up with this kind of nonsense?""

""Let's not reduce a 'pheran' as purely a cultural artefact. It's more than that - pheran is necessary love in winters,"" wrote Anees Zargar, a Srinagar resident.

However Srinagar mayor Junaid Azim Mattu, who also wears Pheran in his office, appeared to be striking a middle path. ""Every workplace has the right to have a reasonably non-invasive general dress code. Nobody has declared a war on Pherans. Most workplaces ban denims. Relax. There are far more pressing issues that deserve our outrage and attention. There is no 'cultural invasion'. Let's move on,"" Mattu wrote.

Kupwara chief education officer, Mohd Shafi War acknowledged that one of his ZEOs had issued the order. ""Since the mention of Pheran in the order became an issue owing to its cultural significance, we are withdrawing the order,"" War said."

In its latest report, the online social network platform for professionals, LinkedIn said that automation in various industries will disproportionately impact women's jobs in 2019.

""The automation trend is especially challenging for women because they tend to be employed in more routine tasks than men across all sectors and occupations, making them more prone to automation,"" says the report, titled 'Big Ideas for 2019: What India can expect in the year ahead.'

According to this report, the resourcefulness of machines will be superior to the resourcefulness of human beings. It quotes the new research by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which estimates that 26 million women's jobs in 30 countries are at high risk of being displaced by technology in the next 20 years. This means 180 million women's jobs globally.

To be clear, the report says that six of the 15 hot emerging jobs of the past year relate to artificial intelligence (AI). But Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of IMF, opined that women need help to get the skills they need to succeed.

""Education and training will be key -- including greater emphasis on lifelong learning and STEM,"" she says, giving examples of coding programs like Girls Who Code in the US, or tax deductions for training like in the Netherlands.

She stressed that gender gaps in leadership positions should be closed and women must have equal access to finance, bank accounts and connectivity.

But there is little good news for women workforce. In 2018, the courageous #MeToo movement took down several powerful men from the journalism, media and entertainment industries in India. Although LinkedIn's research finds that while the movement will now spread to mid-level leaders and less visible industries, some disgraced executives will make a comeback.

According to this report, which included ideas from LinkedIn Influencers and Top Voice honorees, creativity and soft skills will be more important in the coming year because that's what can't be automated.

On the other hand, the report expresses hope that diversity in the workforce will be a core priority for employers in 2019.

It added that for the first time in modern history, five generations - including Gen Z- will be working side by side and said,

""While most big companies are already trying to move the needle on gender balance, the scope of inclusion will expand to differently-abled professionals, and an out and the proud LGBTQ community.""

Nathan SV, Chief Talent Officer at Deloitte India, the part-time work culture to cut across age and experience as retirees, early retirees, and young mothers look to restart their careers.

""Project-based hiring suits employers too since mid-to-senior-level employees drive up payroll costs. Net-net, organisations will be gauged on how well they manage the integration process, predicts the HR influencer,"" he says in the report."

Mysuru: The death toll following poisoning of prasadam at Hanur temple in Chamarajanagar district rose to 15 with the demise of another victim Dundamma (50) at Cauvery Hospital here this morning.

Doctors attending to the poison victims at various hospitals in the city said that most of the patients were responding well to the treatment and recuperating.

However, the condition of two patients at K.R Hospital is critical, according to hospital sources. Most of the patients who are undergoing treatment are likely to be discharged in the next two days after approval from the District Surgeon, the sources added.

Doctors said that it might take a couple of days to declare the patients out of danger as the pesticide residues may take a long time to discharge from the human body.

Today too there was a steady stream of visitors to K.R. and other private hospitals from various villages of Chamarajanagar and Kollegal.

More than 90 victims of the tragedy continue to undergo treatment at K.R. Hospital, JSS Hospital, Apollo BGS Hospital, Suyog Hospital, Cauvery Hospital, Columbia Asia Hospital, Brindavan, Bhanavi, DRM and Shanthaveri Gopalagowda Hospitals in the city.

This morning, State Backward Classes Welfare and Chamarajanagar District Minister C. Puttarangashetty, Hanur MLA R. Narendra, accompanied by Chamarajanagar Additional Deputy Commissioner C.L. Ananda and Mysuru District Health Officer Dr. B. Basavaraju, visited most of the hospitals and enquired the health of patients.

Rs. 5 lakh compensation

Later, speaking to reporters, Puttarangashetty said that he and local MLA R. Narendra will be distributing cheques of Rs.5 lakh to each of the families of the victims. The cheques will be handed over directly this evening to the nearest kith and kin of those who died in the tragedy. Apart from this, groceries for one month will be given to them free of cost.

Appreciating the gesture of Alva's Education Foundation Chairman Mohan Alva to adopt the orphaned children of Mailybai-Krishnanaik couple of Hanur temple tragedy victims, the Minister said that Alva had also promised to fund the entire cost of education and ensured jobs to them.

On the demand for Government jobs for these children, the Minister said that he would discuss the issue with the Chief Minister.

Meanwhile, the Police and Intelligence officials continued their investigation with the questioning of two Seers of a Mutt in Chamarajanagar and two priests of Maramma Temple and their family members."

The government school in her home town, Chopasni village, can now give competition to city schools after it was upgraded with help from donors. Chanchal and her elder sister Pratibha study in the village school now.

Several people from the village who shifted to Jodhpur city just to provide better education to their wards have returned to the village. Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school. Along with the villagers, I wrote a letter to ONGC and HPCL requesting help to construct two separate toilets for girls and boys as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR). The school thus got two toilets that cost Rs 3.5 lakh each,"" said Ratnoo.

""Several girls who dropped out after a certain age due to lack of toilet facilities in school returned to study here,"" said Tima Ram Dhandhu, a villager.

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground. Several others, including the village panchayat, contributed to construct classrooms in the school and install CCTV cameras,"" said Ratnoo.

Jay Narayan Gehlot, sarpanch of Chopasni village, said that the entire village made it a vision to give a good school to the children of the village. ""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same. From a single village we managed to bring 50-60 new students to join the school, ""said Suresh.

Sarla Ratnoo, a student of class 12, said: ""I can dream big now as I can continue with my education. Had the school been far away or without facilities, it would not have been possible.""

The school has a strength of more than 350 students and provides Identity cards and uniforms. ""CCTV cameras have been installed in the classes. The teachers and I keep watch over every activity in the school. We keep organising sports and other extra-curricular activities from time to time to give boost students' exposure,"" said the proud principal."

There are 174 illegal private schools operational in villages without requisite approvals for the buildings, officials of education department in Gautam Budh Nagar district said.

The Uttar Pradesh government on April 23, 1976, had established the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) and, according to the Master Plan 2021, the city is spread across 2,031 hectares, comprising 81 villages and 168 Sectors including residential, commercial and Industrial uses.

The Noida authority has the mandate to regulate buildings of all kinds, including schools, in urban and rural areas. It has the power to issue notices and seal illegal and unsafe buildings.

After the twin building collapse in Greater Noida's Shahberi, in July 2018, killed nine persons, the Noida authority had conducted a survey and identified illegal buildings in all villages.

On August 3, the Noida authority had identified 1,757 buildings, which were constructed without approvals.

""However, we did not count unsafe buildings, which are being used for schools in villages. The administration and education department should look into this issue,"" a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to media, said.

Noida authority chief executive officer Alok Tandon and additional chief executive officer RK Mishra were unavailable for comment on the issue despite repeated attempts to reach them. The authority' officer on special duty, RK Singh, refused comment on the issue.

Over 70 of 174 illegal schools are operational in Noida villages, officials of education department said.

""We had acted against illegal schools in 2017 and over 85 were shut down then. We are taking necessary action in this regard and schools, which are illegal, will face tough legal action,"" BN Singh, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.

Officials of the district administration may also write to the Noida authority as to why it did not act against owners of buildings, where illegal schools are operational.

These illegal schools cater to over 1 lakh students. They do not have affiliations to the Uttar Pradesh state education board, the Central Board of Secondary Education or any other board. These schools mostly cater to the children of factory workers and daily age earners, who cannot afford to send their children to recognised private schools.

""Each school, on an average, accommodates over 1,000 students and the fee is in the range of ₹800 to ₹1,500 a month. All these schools are sheltered by the education department. These school buildings do not have any safety measure in place. Some schools have over 1,000 students studying in small and dinghy buildings that have no setback area or fire safety systems in place,"" a school teacher, requesting anonymity, said."

Police have lodged an FIR in the matter against six persons. They were waiting for the education department and parents of the deceased children to lodge separate FIRs in the matter.

""Two more FIRS are expected in the matter -- from the education department and the parents of the deceased children. The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) will also take action against one of the accused who had kept sand and construction material on the plot adjacent to the school, without covering it,"" Shwetabh Pandey, circle officer 3, said.

Police are also going to ask the education department to explain why school was allowed to function without requisite clearances. ""The school was closed around six months ago by the education department for want of approval. But, it again started functioning under a different name. We have asked the education department to submit their report on the issue,"" BN Singh, district magistrate, said.

Police have launched a manhunt to nab the accused, including the owners, management and staff of the school. Police detained Sanjeev Jha, principal of the school, on Monday around 9.30pm from his residence.

The UP pollution control board officials also visited the site to identify the total area on which construction work was going on and the other violations at the site.

""Our officials have visited the site. We will be sending our recommendation to the city magistrate to impose fine on the person who was undertaking the construction work without following the norms prescribed by the National Green Tribunal,"" Anil Singh, regional officer, UPPCB, said.

The UPPCB will impose a fine of Rs 20,000 on Deshraj, one of the main accused in the case.

He was carrying out construction in the plot next to the school and had kept sand and other building material near the wall, which collapsed under the weight of the material on Monday morning.

Police,too, said that prima facie investigation has revealed that the wall had collapsed under the weight of the construction material. The total area of the under-construction site was around 3000 sqft and the construction material was lying uncovered.

Recently, the district administration had started taking strict action against those found flouting National Green Tribunal norms.

The district magistrate had complained to the chief judicial magistrate against two government agencies for causing pollution in the district.

The district magistrate, using his power as per Section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act,

New Delhi: A prominent angel investor has blamed civil servants for stymieing India's startup growth, saying a review of the current approach was necessary for the country to become the next global superpower.

Venktesh Shukla, the former global chair of the world's largest entrepreneur network, The IndUS Entrepreneurs ('TiE'), and now a general partner in the US-based startup investment firm Monta Vista Capital, was speaking at an event organised in Delhi Monday by the Centre for Policy Research (CPR).

A former Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer himself, Shukla, 64, said civil services officers were the ""worst"" people to decide policies for startups because they had very little experience in entrepreneurship, investment or running a business.

""They have never created a job in their lives,"" he added.

""Take a nonsensical policy they created... [that] startups of less than three years don't need to pay income tax,"" Shukla said, adding, ""Startups at that stage anyway don't make money to pay income tax. Policies like this only allow bad actors with ill intentions to position themselves as startups.""

Another policy he cited was the 30.9 per cent tax levied on a portion of the investment an angel investor makes.

Angel investors are those who invest in a startup much before there is any proof that it will make any money, which means they may or may not get any returns on the investment. In fact, an estimated 90 per cent of startups fail.

Also known as ""angel tax"" and introduced as a measure to curb money laundering, the levy has long been criticised by experts as a detriment to investments.

""The taxing structure and the reasoning behind this policy was so convoluted, angel investors like us had to take it right up to the PM's office to find some sort of solution to it,"" Shukla said.

According to Shukla, it is the lack of technological innovation that has kept India a poor country.

""We have some of the greatest minds and people in India,"" he added. ""Yet we are one of the poorest countries.""

In the ""four most life-impacting and lucrative sectors... electronics and communications, aerospace and aviation, pharmaceuticals, and medical instruments, how much innovation does India have? Zero"", he said. ""How can India expect to be a great country?""

By ""changing their behaviour"", the government and the civil servants running it can make a big difference to this ""sad story"", he added.

Shukla said he saw no reason why India couldn't harness new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to become a global superpower, the same way it became the biggest benefactor of outsourced IT services (estimated to be a $150 billion industry in India).

""AI, ML, and the other cutting-edge technologies will afford the next big opportunity for India to become the next big superpower,"" he added. ""Except maybe China and Pakistan, the world is rooting for India to be the next big power, they would like to see India doing well,"" he said.

It was with a view to harness the same technologies that the union Cabinet, earlier this month, approved a national mission, with an outlay of Rs 3,660 crore for five years, for research and development in the area.

Shukla, however, said the government's role in this respect went beyond fund allotment. ""One thing they can do is revamp the higher education system to foster innovation,"" he added.

He said innovation was anyway very difficult to foster because ""it happens at the intersection of various disciplines"".

""But in India, we have made the problem worse by setting up separate educational institutes that are geographically distant and teach disciplines in silos, so that there is very little chance for collaboration,"" he added.

""Our education system is not geared towards creating innovators; it's geared towards creating practitioners, be it in institutes to train engineers, pharmacists, nurses, or for liberal arts,"" he said.

I am planning to purchase a residential flat in Mumbai from an NRI; the cost would be ₹45 lakh. What would be the TDS implications and things I need to ensure before proceeding with the purchase?

-- Ankit Jain

Under the India income-tax law, if the seller qualifies as non-resident in India during the relevant financial year, the buyer is required to deduct TDS (tax deducted at source) at specified rate (plus applicable surcharge and health and education cess) on taxable capital gain on sale of immovable property. The specified rate is 20% (plus applicable surcharge and health and education cess) in case of long-term capital gain (LTCG) and 30% (plus applicable surcharge and health and education cess) in case of short-term capital gain (STCG).

If the seller qualifies as resident in India during the relevant financial year, the buyer is required to deduct TDS at the rate of 1% on sale consideration if the sale consideration exceeds ₹50 lakh.

Any immovable property held for a period of more than 24 months is classified as a long-term capital asset. In case of a long-term capital asset, taxable capital gain will be net sale proceeds less indexed cost of acquisition (i.e. adjusted as per cost of inflation index or CII) less indexed cost of improvement.

The seller is entitled to exemption in respect of LTCG tax under specified provisions subject to fulfilment of attached conditions thereon.

If the taxable amount of capital gain is nil, there will be no TDS implications. There are penal consequences if there is a default in deposit of TDS. Thus, it is very important that the residential status and the taxable amount of capital gain is calculated accurately. You may obtain an affidavit-cum-declaration for residential status and taxable capital gain from the seller.

Alternatively, you may approach the income-tax officer to calculate taxable capital gain on sale of immovable property and/or obtain a lower or nil withholding tax certificate.

As part of TDS compliance on purchase of immovable property from a non-resident, you will need to do the following in consultation with your tax advisor:

1. Obtain a Tax Deduction Account Number (TAN) ;

2. Deduct TDS at appropriate rate and deposit TDS with the income-tax authorities within seven days from the end of the month in which the payment or credit has been made.

3. File Form 27Q (withholding tax return) within 31 days from the end of the quarter (31 May for the quarter ending Mar) in which the payment or credit has been made.

4. Issue Form 16A within 15 days from the date of filing the withholding tax return."

Owners of plots in various sectors of Gurugram have been asking for this for more than a year now.

On Monday, members of All Haryana Residents Welfare Association met HSVP chief Chandrashekhar Khare and demanded the constitution of the committee for recalculation of enhancement charges. HSVP officials later confirmed that according to notification, the committee would hold discussions with the resident welfare associations (RWAs), allottees and petitioners at the zonal level under the chairmanship of the zonal administrator befor recalculating the enhancement charges.

The committee will include the estate officer and the district town planner of the urban estate concerned as well as the land acquisition officer of the zone concerned. According to the notification, the committee will draft fresh proposals and send it to the headquarters for approval. Apart from this, a copy will also be sent to a chartered accountant (CA) for auditing. Once approved, the revised enhancement charges will be conveyed to the plot owners so that they can make payments accordingly.

The government has directed the immediate recalculation of enchantment charges and so the process would be started at the earliest, said Tejinder Singh, the secretary of the association. On December 14, the chief minister had made the announcement in this regard, which came as a relief for All Haryana Sector Enhancement Sangharsh Samiti, an association of people who have been allotted HSVP plots and flats. The members of the samiti had been asked to pay more for their real-estate properties after compensation to be paid to those whose land was acquired for housing pro'jects had been increased.

Samiti president Kapil Vats said the move would help cut down the enhancement amount by 60-65%, thus bringing huge relief for plot owners. Due to heavy enhancement charges, residents of more than 46 sectors and their families are being affected, according to Vats. ""We are middle-class and working families and have a lot of liabilities including home, education and business loans. The heavy enhancement charges, along with 15% interest, would prove disastrous for all residents of all sectors,"" he added.

On November 1, the state government had launched a rebate scheme for settling of enhancement dues. However, the rebate was lesser as compared to the rebate offered in the scheme of May 2018. At that time, the state government had offered a rebate of 40% and HSVP had collected Rs 850 crore against total dues of Rs 1,400 crore."

He has joined his father Kandhasamy in their ancestral land in Jakeri, a sparsely populated village in Kelamangalam administrative block of Krishnagiri district. In two acres, they cultivate roses and carnations in two poly greenhouses under controlled conditions, using Israeli technology.

The neighboring farm belongs to Srinivasan, a general manager in a multinational software company. He drives down from Bengaluru on weekends to attend to his hi-tech rose farm. He plans to take the plunge and become a full-time farmer.

Across four administrative blocks in Krishnagiri District -- Kelamangalam, Denkanikottai, Shoolagiri and Hosur -- poly greenhouses and shade net structures are ubiquitous. Those that drive the hi-tech horticulture boom are young engineers, management professionals, employees from information technology (IT) sector and the like.

Rain-fed Agriculture

The trend negates the battle for survival of the average Indian farmer, and the children not seeming keen to pick up the mantle. According to the Annual Status of Education Report - 2017, released by the non-profit organization Pratham, just 1.2 percent children of farmers aspired to be a farmer.

In Krishnagiri district, the major cultivated area is rain-fed. Over the last few decades, the district witnessed a shift to horticulture, due to its climate and proximity to Bengaluru, the major market for horticultural crops. The undulating dry terrain from Rayakottai to Hosur has no perennial water source and is unsuitable for water-intensive crops.

Fruits like banana, sapota, aonla and guava, vegetables like brinjal, capsicum, and onion, spices like turmeric and pepper, and flower crops like rose, gerbera and carnations are cultivated in over 49,576 hectares.

Hi-tech Farming

Hi-tech horticulture's beginnings in the area coincide with IT boom in Bengaluru, with the last five years witnessing phenomenal growth, aggressively pursued by sons of small and marginal farmers, besides first generation farmers.

Anamaiah Gowdu (33) quit his corporate job and returned to Chettipally, his native village, to modernize his ancestral farm. He grows colored capsicums.

""Liberal subsidies for poly greenhouses, shade net structures and micro irrigation along with technical and input support, has fuelled the growth of hi-tech farming,"" Ganesh, assistant director, Directorate of Horticulture and Plantation Crops, Denkanikottai taluk, to VillageSquare.in.

As part of the hi-tech system, farmers install rainwater-harvesting structures, for micro irrigation.

India-Israel collaboration

According to Satyendra Yadav of Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project's (IIAP) Vegetable Cluster and IIAP Centre of Excellence (CoE), use of hi-tech green houses, naturally ventilated poly houses , anti-insect net houses, and walk-in tunnels significantly increase yield.

""The structures reduce use of pesticides and other inputs, prolongs harvest time from 3 to 9 months,"" Yadav told VillageSquare.in. ""As against an yield of 3.5 tons of cucumber per hectare in open cultivation, the yield under protected cultivation is 45 tons. The yield of capsicum in open cultivation is 12 tons per hectare while under IIAP technology it's 72 tons.""

IIAP's goals are to increase crop diversity, productivity and resource use efficiency. CoEs started under IIAP provide a platform for Israeli agro technology, knowledge transfer and training, focusing on nursery development, cultivation methods, irrigation and fertilizer management.

Controlled Cultivation

Crops cultivated in the open, under natural conditions, are more susceptible to sudden changes in temperature, humidity, light intensity and other conditions that affect quality and yield. The Israeli technology helps control them and the four vital elements for photosynthesis.

The poly green sheet filters ultraviolet and infrared rays, allowing radiation measuring 400 to 700 nano meters, under which photosynthesis happens. Micro irrigation system ensures the roots get required water, cutting water use by 90%. Carbon-di-oxide emitted by plants at night is retained inside the enclosure, boosting starch production.

""This is achieved by manipulating temperature, humidity, light intensity, ventilation, soil media, disease control, irrigation, fertigation and other agronomical practices throughout the season, irrespective of the natural conditions outside,"" Arumugam S, horticultural officer-in-charge of CoE, Thally, told VillageSquare.in. ""This means farmers can get seven times more produce.""

The degree of sophistication of poly green and shade net houses varies from a simple naturally- ventilated poly house with polyethylene film covering, to highly sophisticated, fully automated drip and fogger systems, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) lightings.

Subsidies

Putting up a naturally ventilated poly green house in one-acre costs about Rs 28 lakh. Under the National Horticulture Mission, farmers get a subsidy of Rs16.88 lakh for poly green and shade net structures in one acre. The drip irrigation system is also heavily subsidized.

Raising nurseries under controlled environment is catching up too. Farmers get Rs 14.2 lakh per acre for shade net nurseries. Drip irrigation subsidy is Rs1.13 lakh per hectare, plus Goods and Services Tax (GST), under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) scheme. Banks too offer loans because of high returns.

One acre of poly greenhouse cultivation fetches an annual income of Rs25 lakh per annum, as against Rs5 lakh in open cultivation. ""The loan can be repaid in a year and the returns thereafter are profit for the farmer,"" said Ganesh.

Profitable Farming

Subramani K. (32) of Chettipally village in Kelamangalam administrative block, had to discontinue his schooling and take up farming when his father passed away. ""Cultivating groundnut and ragi in three acres under rain-fed conditions, I struggled to sustain,"" Subramani told VillageSquare.in. But he broke the cycle growing green and colored capsicums in two poly green houses, each over one acre land.

Subramani sells capsicum at Rs 50/kilo at the farm gate. Buyers from Bengaluru pick the produce every day, pack them and transport to various markets across the country. In one acre poly greenhouse 14,000 plants can be grown, each costing Rs8.5 including seed cost and wage. Three months after planting, capsicum is harvested nine months a year at a rate of 60 tons per acre.

In the case of roses, 28,000 to 32,000 plants can be raised in an acre. The cost of planting is Rs 12 to Rs 15. Six months after planting, one or two flowers can be plucked from every plant on alternate days. The market price of roses swing between Rs 100 to Rs 200 per bunch of 20 flowers.

Intensive Management

""The spectacular results and returns are not coming easy,"" Srinivasan told VillageSquare.in. ""In naturally ventilated houses, increase in outside temperature entails semi-manual washing of plants to keep them cool.""

Each rose bud has to be capped with synthetic mesh to control its size. Rose stems ready for harvest during sunny days have to be precooled. Soil and water need to be tested regularly. According to Sudeesh one cannot succeed in hi-tech farming without personal attention. ""We keep updating ourselves with new techniques and news about market conditions,"" said Srinivasan.

Also Read : How Climate Change is Altering Farming in Spiti

Protected cultivation does not guarantee pest-free environment. The climate inside these structures is conducive for pests like thrips, mites and leaf minor. Farmers spend considerable time spraying pesticides. ""Nets and improvised door systems reduce pest infiltration,"" said Arumugam.

Worth The Risks

Subramani recalled his childhood days, when they could hardly buy two sets of clothes a year. He could not afford to repair the house. ""Today I have two motorcycles and a car, and I have rebuilt our house,"" he said.

About 2,000 acres are under hi-tech cultivation in Krishnagiri district. In Chettipally, there are 200 poly green houses, and new ones are coming up.

Farmers like Sudeesh double up as fabricators and consultants. Farmers are diversifying into other crops like radish, double beans, cauliflower, cabbage and carrot. Villagers are leveling dry and rocky lands to put up poly green and shade net houses, as the ensuing prosperity seems worth the risks.

The students of KM Public School were writing their Hindi paper in the open in the absence of enough classrooms to house 150 students in total.

Police said the construction material used to build the wall was of poor quality. But residents of nearby villages said the wall gave in because an earthmover was digging an adjacent construction site and had made the soil at the base of the wall loose. The accident occurred around 9.30am.

Vivek Kumar (7) and Bhupender Singh (10), both students of Class I, were declared dead on arrival at hospitals. Those battling serious injuries have been identified as Naitik (8), Amit (7), Ashish Kumar (8) and Akash (9). The students were writing their test within metres of the wall as the sun was shining bright on the area on a chilly Monday morning.

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has directed the district administration to conduct a speedy investigation and bring the culprits to book. The adjacent plot that was being dug is owned by Deshraj Bhati and his son Sumit. Despite a notice to shut it down, the school was being run by Deshraj's nephew Amit Bhati.

An FIR has been lodged on a complaint by the district administration against Amit Bhati, principal Sanjeev Jha, school organiser Raghvender Solanki, and owners of the adjacent plot Sumit and Deshraj Bhati.

The school has 150 students in total from nursery to Class VIII. As it has only five rooms, including that of the principal, the students are often made to sit in the open. Police said the wall collapsed around 9.30am. The excavator had entered the plot and had been removing mounds of earth. When its wheels reached near the wall, it collapsed on the students who were sitting on the other side.

The commission asked state government to introduce acts to ensure that such people get immediate medical assistance. The order was issued based on a case registered on the death of Tamil Nadu-native Murugan in August last year. Murugan was allegedly denied medical care after a road accident.

""There must be legal provisions to constitute teams consisting of representatives from police and NGOs in every district to take such accident victims to primary health centres or hospitals with adequate facilities,"" said the order issued by HRC member K Mohankumar .

Murugan from Thirunelveli died at the Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, after he met with an accident at Ithikkara in Kollam. He was allegedly denied treatment by five hospitals.

The commission asked state government to form a network of government and private hospitals along major corridors, which can provide emergency trauma care, ventilators and service of neurosurgeons to accident victims. District medical officer and medical education director must ensure such facilities in the district-level and state-level respectively, HRC said.

The bill, tabled by Union social justice minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot, is expected to be introduced in the Upper House in the Winter session, which ends on January 8. The bill was introduced in 2016 and referred to a standing committee chaired by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Ramesh Bais, following nationwide protests by transpersons.

The committee submitted its report with multiple recommendations in July 2017. The new bill incorporated some recommendations, such as medical insurance for sex reassignment surgery, and introduction of persons with intersex variations as a distinct category. ""The bill is complete and there is no need for more discussion,"" Gehlot said.

But activists point out that the bill still mandates a district screening committee, comprising a Chief Medical Officer among others, to issue identity certificates, a provision they say violates a landmark Supreme Court judgment in 2014 that affirmed the right of transgender people to self-identify their gender.

""The bill is unscientific and goes against global best practices. It doesn't prevent but encode discrimination,"" said Karthik Bittu Kondaiah, an assistant professor at Ashoka University, who has testified before the committee.

Another unfulfilled demand was that of reservations. Grace Banu, a Dalit and transgender rights activist said, ""We want horizontal reservation across education, jobs and other entitlements...the bill doesn't provide social justice.""

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor moved a number of amendments, which were defeated. Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar of the Trinamool Congress, Supriya Sule of the Nationalist Congress Party, Bhartruhari Mahtab of the Biju Janata Dal were among those who opposed the bill. ""The bill is flawed...,"" said Tharoor.

Among the major changes of the bill was the definition of ""transgender"". The 2016 version defined transgender as ""neither wholly female nor wholly male, a combination of female or male, neither female nor male"".

The new bill has changed the definition to ""a person whose gender does not match with the gender assigned to that person at birth and includes trans-man or trans-woman (where or not such person has undergone Sex Reassignment Surgery or hormone therapy..), person with intersex variations, gender-queer and person having socio-cultural identities as kinnar, hijra, aravani and jogta.""

The focus now shifts to the Rajya Sabha, where the National Democratic Alliance doesn't have a majority. Tiruchi Siva, a Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam member who had drafted a private members bill that was passed in the Upper House in 2016, said he would strongly oppose the new draft legislation."

The school education department has banned the traditional Kashmiri attire 'Pheran' in its zonal offices in the Valley.

The development comes in the backdrop of a similar ban on the Pheran in the civil secretariat (Srinagar) where the commoners visiting the administrative departments have to relinquish it at the main gate.

Following this, the Zonal Education Officer, Langate issued an order last week banning the wearing of Pheran for every official visiting the office.

""All the officials visiting this office are advised to visit with proper dress code during any official visit. It is recommended that no official will visit this office wearing 'Feran', traditional trousers and sleeper/Plastic shoes (sic),"" the order reads.

As per sources, the orders on similar lines are being issued at the behest of verbal orders from the Chief Education Officers in the Valley.

The civil secretariat security staff has put the Pherans on the barred items category.

The decision comes close on the heels of Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) removing Kashmiri from the online portal 'BashaSangam' following a complaint by some Kashmiri Pandits.

And all these decision of interfering with the Kashmiri language and indigenous Kashmiri dress is being looked in the Valley as a cultural onslaught carried by New Delhi on the Kashmiri people.

The move of the government banning the traditional Pheran leaves one wondrous with the former chief minister and National Conference Vice President Omar Abdullah being seen donning the Pheran frequently while the commoners are discriminated.

In 2014, Omar Abdullah had asked the Srinagar-based Army's 15 Corps to withdraw its order asking the journalist fraternity to refrain from wearing the Pheran.

""If the army has in fact told journalists not to wear a pheran to Corps HQ events that is unacceptable & the order should be withdrawn (sic),"" Omar wrote on Twitter in 2014. ""People wear their pheran with pride. It's part of our identity aside from the best way to stay warm in the cold. Can't ban pherans.""

Later the Army while retreating the order had termed the guideline as ""inadvertent"".

Peoples Democratic Party President Mehbooba Mufti also used to wear the Pheran frequently as chief minister while the commoners visiting the Srinagar civil secretariat had to keep their traditional attire atop the iron poles outside the secretariat premises.

Kashmiri politicians across ideological divide have been wearing the Pheran publicly, many times to strike an emotional chord with the local populace.

The Hurriyat (M) Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Faroooq along with Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front Chairman Muhammad Yasin Malik may not be wearing the Pheran for political reasons but they, because of their public profiles, also have been popularising the Pheran as a preferable formal dress in winter by choosing to wear it outside their homes in winters.

The Pheran was further popularized among the Kashmiri youth by Bollywood film actors including ShahidKapoor, RanbirKapoor and Salman Khan who during their film shoots in Kashmir chose to wear Pherans on and off the film shoots.

The Pheran is believed to have been brought into the Valley around 700 years ago from Central Asia where it was used as a cloak under the Persian name ""Pairahan"".

The Central Asian Pairahan is believed to have been adopted by the English who later called it the 'Apron' now donned by the doctors world over.

Over the years, the sale of the tweed cloth for the Pherans in the Valley has witnessed an upsurge while the tailors in the summer capital Srinagar been blending the traditional design of the Pheran with the English coat designs.

With attractive motifs, the popularity of designer Pherans in Kashmir is increasing by the day and Pheran have now crossed the geographical boundaries.

For centuries, Pheran has served as traditional apparel for Kashmiris to combat the harsh winter.

It is used with the traditional fire pot (Kangri) in tow, which serves as a reliable means to keep people warm."

The success of any task or activity depends upon the quality of preplanning and whether accomplish or not the objective must be attempted to solidify. To start with a strong monitoring mechanism is imminent in the School level and a rational commitment is needed from all the stakeholders. In my 20 years of continuous selfless attachment in Service Association work like ANSTA & NSEAOA what I personally observed is a logical working system is in the offing particularly management policies at all level and emphatically requires more inputs on academic interest. And to achieve its goal a tangible policy is impending to formulate through the blessing of political will to improvise its traditional tag. In this regard I would like to lay down the following humble suggestions as a measures for improvement of academic acceleration towards qualitative education in the department.

1. Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

Google will invest more than $1 billion to expand its New York City presence, the search giant said in a blog post Monday.

The Alphabet Inc. division said it had reached lease agreements at 315 and 345 Hudson St. and signed a letter of intent at 550 Washington St. to make up the new 1.7 million-square-foot (158,000-square-meter) campus, to be called Google Hudson Square.

Google aims to move into the new Hudson buildings by 2020 and the Washington Street location by 2022, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in the blog post. The move could allow the company to more than double the current 7,000 people it employs in the city over the next decade.

The Google expansion joins a flurry of other announcements from the US's largest tech companies, as they seek to show off investments in their home country. Amazon.com Inc. recently announced it had split its new second headquarters in half, between the Washington, D.C., suburbs and Long Island City, in the New York borough of Queens. The online retailer initially intends to develop about 4 million square feet of commercial space in New York to accommodate 25,000 new workers.

Apple Inc. said last week it would invest $1 billion to grow its operations in Austin by constructing a new employee campus in the area, large enough to house 15,000 additional employees. It also announced plans to expand in New York, Pittsburgh and Boulder, Colorado, in the next three years and set up new sites in several other US cities.

New York is the largest market for technology talent, behind San Francisco, according to a report from brokerage CBRE Group Inc. that looked at the US and Canada. New York had 254,270 tech employees last year, with the labor pool growing 17 percent from 2012 through last year. The city also has the highest annual asking rent for office space, at $74.88 a square foot, as of the first quarter.

Google's New York investment also follows other new offices and data centers opened this year outside of its California headquarters in locations including Detroit, Boulder, Tennessee and Alabama.

Google's first foray into New York, 18 years ago, was far less dramatic than Monday's announcement: a one-person sales team working out of a Starbucks on 86th Street. A more official office, in Times Square, followed soon after.

The company's New York employees focus on maps, advertising, YouTube, cloud computing, technical infrastructure, sales and research. And its real estate purchases rank among the largest ever in Manhattan. In 2010, Google bought 111 Eighth Ave., its New York headquarters, for $1.8 billion. Earlier this year, it paid $2.4 billion for the nearby Chelsea Market.

Google has agreed to lease offices at Pier 57, under development along the Hudson River. It also plans to fund construction of a landing dock for water transit and provide community space for culture and education programs at the project."

Modern skyscrapers housing corporations and ambitious startups tower over the mega-city of 13 million people - among them is Wu Yebin, 35, who runs his own tech firm from his 35th floor office.

His own story mirrors those of countless others who have risen from modest backgrounds following the reforms spearheaded by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, which the Communist Party ratified on December 18, 1978.

The son of poor farmers, Wu arrived in the city in 2005 and over the years he assembled devices similar to Apple's iPad or MacBook, joining Shenzhen's army of people making ""shanzhai"" - creative knock-offs of foreign electronics affordable for local population.

""Germany, the United States, Japan, South Korea... All developed countries have done this to develop their manufacturing industry,"" Wu said. ""You have to do that to gain experience.""

While this economic model used to be ""very popular, it is no longer viable today,"" he said.

He now leads his own electronics firm, MeegoPad, which boasts an annual turnover of $28 million making products such as miniature PCs.

""We are now very attached to intellectual property and patents,"" Wu said.

'Made in China 2025'

Shenzhen, which lived off fishing and rice paddies, became a testing ground for Deng's reforms when it was designated as the country's first Special Economic Zone in 1980.

It grew into a massive manufacturing centre, with factories churning out gadgets, computers and phones for foreign firms, which today include Apple and Samsung.

Today China's own global corporations, such as telecom company Huawei and internet giant Tencent, have made Shenzhen their headquarters and the city of tens of thousands of factories is dubbed the ""Silicon Valley of Hardware"".

The metropolis is now seeking to reinvent itself as the home of Chinese innovation, in line with Beijing's ""Made in China 2025"" plan to dominate key hi-tech industries such as robotics, electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.

""China is becoming a world leader in this field,"" Wu said. ""Shenzhen is turning into a meeting point for creative engineers from around the world.""

Now talent from abroad is flocking to Shenzhen.

Meng Jie, who is French and in his 30s, left California's Silicon Valley in 2017 to create Maybe, a company that makes smart speakers that help people learn Mandarin.

""Silicon Valley is still way ahead in artificial intelligence. But you can find the electronic or mechanical component you need three times faster in Shenzhen,"" Meng said.

""It's like going from a road to a motorway,"" he said.

Pointing to the skyscrapers outside his office, he said: ""People see Silicon Valley as the tech Mecca. They underestimate Shenzhen a lot because they don't know what's happening here.""

""This place was just sand and water 20 years ago. In 10 years, Shenzhen will be a very important world city. It will be the capital of innovation,"" he said.

US fears

Some of China's hi-tech ambitions are running into suspicions about its intentions abroad, with the United States and others fearing that they pose security and espionage risks.

Telecommunications equipment giant Huawei's own global expansion has faced setbacks, with some of its services rejected in certain Western countries and its chief financial officer detained in Canada on a US extradition request over alleged Iran sanctions violations.

But those who have witnessed Shenzhen's rise marvel at its evolution from hi-tech copycat to creator.

Shenzhen is ""really nice fertile ground for innovation,"" said Duncan Turner, managing director of HAX, an incubator for startups based in the city.

""The Chinese government sets up clear plans for innovation in particular sectors that they want to invest in,"" Turner said.

If a company matches those plans, ""you've got a nice path for development and onward funding,"" he said.

Turner, who moved to Shenzhen in 2009, said the biggest change he has see in the past decade is how young people who used to make fakes are ""becoming incredibly inventive, entrepreneurial R&D (research and development) experts that are leading the way of technology in certain areas"".

Improved higher education has created a new generation of engineers, such as Zhang Zhaohui, chief executive of Youibot, which set up his company in HAX's incubator to make the first autonomous maintenance robot for buses.

""Shenzhen has huge potential,"" Zhang, 26, predicted. ""The city could very quickly catch up to Silicon Valley."""

Yeida aims to provide sewage, drainage, drinking water and other facilities under the smart village project.

The motive behind the project is apparently to appease farmers, whose land is being acquired for the international airport project at Jewar along the Yamuna Expressway. Around 500 farmers have filed their objections seeking around Rs 3,500 per square metre for their agricultural land identified for the proposed airport. But the UP government wants to give only Rs 2,300- Rs 2,500 per square metre for the agricultural land meant for airport project. To pacify the farmers, the Yeida is trying to lure the farmers in the name of development in villages.

Yeida has allocated a budget of Rs 100 crore for the development of villages located around the Yamuna Expressway. The money will be spent on development of civic amenities at par with the urban areas. The authority has decided to conduct a surenjoy vey to make a detailed project report to develop the 'smart' villages.

""We will develop first two smart villages to start the project. And later we will provide all basic civic amenities in all villages. We will also appoint two safai karamcharis in each village for better cleanliness,"" said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida.

A survey will be conducted to identify two villages, which will be developed into 'smart villages'. Later, each of 96 villages will the facilities such as drainage, sewage, education and better health infrastructure, among others.

At present, the villages do not have drainage, sewage and drinking water facilities. Village rs depend on ground water for their drinking water needs. The rain water is wasted in the absence of drainage network in almost every village. And sewage is also dumped in the open in all these 96 villages. The Yamuna expressway authority wants to develop basic amenities so that the villages do not dump their sewage in the open.

""The Yeida should focus on the development of required civic facilities without further delay because the villagers do not even have excess to basic things,"" said Mahendra Singh, an advocate and resident of village Parohi.

In 2001, the Uttar Pradesh government had established Yeida for development in areas between Greater Noida and Agra. The objective was to setup industries to generate employment and develop urban areas. Around 2 lakh hectares from 1,187 villages of six districts, Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahar, Aligarh, Hathras, Mathura and Agra, were notified under YIEDA. However, the authority has been able to acquire only 16,000 hectares of land along the e-way."

Bengaluru: Byju's, an Indian education startup, more than doubled its valuation to $3.6 billion after a funding round led by Naspers Ventures and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

The company raised $540 million, which will be used to fuel an expansion into English-speaking countries, Bangalore-based Byju's said in a statement on Monday. The new valuation puts it among the top five on CB Insights' ranking of India startups.

Byju's has attracted millions of users in India, where there is often a lack of good teachers, helping to teach students from kindergarten to year 12 subjects including math, science and English. Its existing backers include the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, founded by Facebook Inc. co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, as well as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Sequoia Capital.

""The company has aggressive plans for international market expansion and will make bold investments in technology that will help to further personalise learning for students,"" it said in the statement.

The aim of the Catalyst Series is to guide technologists in understanding, experimenting with, and developing cutting-edge public blockchain protocols. In India, less than 1% of the country's developers have exposure to blockchain development, and experience is limited to platforms such as Hyperledger and Ethereum. Catalyst aims to bring India to the global blockchain frontier through community participation and developer education.

This series is a first-of-its-kind EOS workshop and hackathon, kicking off with a three-weekend-long curriculum covering the EOS protocol architectural design, developer tooling/environments, and smart contract and dApp (decentralized application) development. Hundreds of applicants sought the opportunity to attend the workshops, which featured sessions by international blockchain experts across Ukraine, China, Korea and the United States.

The workshop concluded with India's first EOS Hackathon on November 24, 2018. Teams were tasked with building an EOS dApp within one day for a prize of INR 70,000. Numerous innovative ideas and use-cases emerged from the hackathon, such as utilizing blockchain to streamline and audit government benefit schemes, decentralized predictive markets and augmented reality-based gaming platforms with tokenized virtual goods.

Dunya Labs launched and conducted this event in partnership with pioneers from the blockchain industry including local leaders Incrypt and Koinex, as well as international EOS block producers EOS Canon, EOSYS, CryptoLions, Attic Lab, AlohaEOS, EOS Nation and Meet.One.

""The Catalyst Series is the first blockchain programme in India focused on the frontier protocols which are emerging in the space. Our goal is to give the Indian developer community a taste of cutting-edge innovations in decentralized technologies, and equip them with the knowledge and skills to build on the decentralized Internet of the future,"" said Cathy Guo, Co-Founder and CEO, Dunya Labs.

(iStock / Representative Image)

Eight-year-old Zoya Khan, weighing 39 kg, on Friday underwent a revision bariatric surgery, said the doctors from the Mumbai-based Surana Group of Hospitals, terming her ""the youngest in the world to undergo this operation"". The surgery, used to treat obesity, involved restricting the part of the stomach that gives rise to hunger.

The doctors that treated her believe that the surgery will result in a weight loss of 5-6kg within a span of 15-20 days. ""It was a one-of-its-kind case and we will publish the report in an international medical journal. We will also provide the patient lifelong treatment free of cost,"" said Dr Prince Surana, chief executive officer (CEO), Surana Group of Hospitals.

Zoya weighed 19 kg at 11 months. At the time, she had undergone a bariatric surgery.

According to her mother, Taj khatun, Zoya lost 3 kg two months after the surgery. However, she had to recently undergo a revision surgery after failing to control her weight.

Taj khatun said that as Zoya was growing up, she started consuming food once every half hour. ""By the time she was six, she already weighed 20-25kg. From that year onwards, her weight started to increase rapidly. She was unable to move or sleep and suffered from other health complications, so we admitted her to Nair Hospital,"" said Taj khatun.

Taj khatun explained how Zoya's obesity interfered with her schooling.

""Because Zoya had difficulty moving, no school was ready to admit her. Her father [Yusuf] used to carry her to her tuition classes for her primary education,"" she said.

Zoya was shifted from Nair hospital at the behest of Surana.

""I approached Samajwadi Party leader Rais Shaikh, who has knew social workers at Nair Hospital. Through him, we asked the treating doctors if Zoya could be transferred to our facility,"" said Surana.

Dr Mohit Bhandari, head of bariatric surgery, who headed the team, said that at the time of admission, Zoya's body mass index (BMI) was 35 and she consumed 2,600 calories a day - six times that of an average eight-year-old. ""She had severe sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension [high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs and heart] and fatty liver. We performed a CT scan and endoscopy to realise that her stomach had dilated to the size of an adult stomach,"" said Dr Bhandari.

The team of doctors ruled out the option to conduct a gastric bypass surgery, which involves changing the size of the stomach to reduce food intake. They said it could have led to micro-nutrient deficiency.

""Since medication for weight loss is not approved by the food and drug administration (FDA) in paediatrics, we had no option but to perform a banded sleeve gastrectomy. The surgery restricted the part of the stomach that gives rise to hunger,"" said Dr Bhandari.

The team has also roped in a nutrition expert who will consult Zoya on her dietary intake following the surgery."

Someone opens the door and stage whispers my name. ""You've four minutes,"" she says, and asks if I would like some tea. The cuppa loses to the questions and I wade through droves of fans with phone cameras on the ready, special guests, and bouncers as sturdy as oaks, into a room at the Park Hyatt hotel. One of India's most recognisable men is seated on a chair, filling it like he did the throne when he played Mughal emperor Akbar.

Hrithik Roshan, in jeans and a denim Beatles jacket, 'love' embroidered on his muscled bicep, rises to shake my hand. There is a Skeleton strapped to his right wrist. ""If I had to pick a favourite watch right now, I'd pick the Skeleton,"" says the Bollywood actor, who was in the city last weekend to launch the latest from the Rado collection at VR Mall.

Hrithik has been Rado's ambassador for six years now, but the brand is a childhood memory. ""When I was a kid, I was fascinated by how the watch looked on my father's wrist. I didn't know the brand then. Years later when Rado approached me and I saw the collection, I recognised the watch that first enamoured me,"" he says.

Hrithik has been the Hindi film industry's Adonis for nearly 19 years now, his career peppered in equanimity with box office smashes and duds. He's played the workaholic lover boy (Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara), angry young man (Agneepath), heroic Army officer (Lakshya) and super hero (Krissh series) in equal measure, and has an untitled film with Tiger Shroff on the cards.

But as he pushes 45, Hrithik cheerleads the story of a common man and a gifted mathematician who inspired youth to successfully ace the entrance exams to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT). Super 30, scheduled for release on January 25, 2019, is a bio-pic on Patna-based Anand Kumar, best known for his Super 30 programme that coaches economically backward students for one of India's toughest entrance exams. It is a story that mirrors poverty and genius and showcases the struggles of youth in a classroom with unplastered walls, tutored by a man who sells papads in the evenings to supplement the family income.

Hrithik, who plays Anand, says the film called for a lot of prepping and not just in the scruffy looks department. ""I've played emperor and the common man. But this was especially different and difficult as I did not speak Bihari and since it is based on a person's life, the responsibility is so much more. I had to get into the skin of that character and I truly enjoyed doing it.""

Would the film be endorsing India's craze for the IITs? ""If the film endorses anything, it is the spirit of education, the spirit of teaching,"" says Hrithik. ""Even if you are not a teacher, it should inspire you to add growth to the people around you, to help them pursue their dreams. Somewhere, it'll strike a chord to do more for the people who work for you.""

With Krissh 4 due for release in 2020, has he thought of revisiting his roles in Lakshya or Jodhaa Akbar considering he still has the Greek-god attributes to carry off a sequel? ""That really is the call of the director. I wish I could think of things I want to do but I have to depend on filmmakers and the things that inspire them. My favourite role has always been the one I am currently doing, whichever film that may be.""

What does Hrithik, an exercise freak who endorses a fitness startup and has his own line of fitness merchandise, listen to when he works out? There's a pause before his eyes crinkle with laughter, ""The workout is very intense. But I love grand orchestral music and old Hindi songs on my playlist. Something that is calming. I love the contrast.""

And just like that, the minute-hand sweeps past the allotted four minutes."

When I was growing up, someone was always asking a member of our family, ""Where are you from?"" Usually, it was my mother. She has high cheekbones, deep, wide-set eyes and light brown skin with prominent freckles.

Since we grew up in an area with a small black population, her appearance drew more notice than I think it would have elsewhere. Whoever was asking usually wanted to claim her as their own.

Once, my sisters, our mother and I were in an epic, four-way fight in the car while holiday shopping. As our mother steered us out of the parking garage, the lot attendant waved her payment away. He was from Ethiopia and assumed she was too. He complimented her on what a great mother she must be -- our windows had been rolled up, so he hadn't heard the yelling.

I don't look like my mother. When I was younger and people asked, ""Where are you from?"" they usually wanted confirmation of my West Indian heritage. ""My dad is from Barbados,"" is how I usually answered the question of why I had the face I had.

""Where are you from?"" is a question we sometimes think we can find an answer to with DNA. One of my first jobs out of college was coordinating a community African-American genealogical class in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. It was run by a married couple from New Jersey, a former police officer and a former private investigator who dedicated their retirement to black genealogy. They had said in the class that DNA testing was a tricky thing for black people trying to trace their past.

Different DNA testing companies have different proprietary DNA databases. This means you can get a different result depending on which company you use. If the company you've chosen doesn't include information about your particular genetic background in its database, it may simply report that you don't have that ancestry.

If you have African ancestry, it becomes even trickier. The African slave trade to the United States ended, with some exceptions, more than 170 years ago. If you are matching your DNA to a database of African populations you are usually comparing yourself with present-day population samples, not the DNA of someone who may have lived in that area 170 or even 200 or 400 years before. Also, there is more genetic variation among African people than among Europeans, yet much of the information in the most popular commercial DNA databases contains only a fraction of the full African DNA spectrum.

But people still believe in DNA and want it to reveal some ""truth"" about the depth and reach of family history. The scholar Alondra Nelson, author of the book ""The Social Life of DNA,"" wrote about the ""democratization of DNA analysis"" and asked this important question: Why is DNA analysis deemed to proffer more valuable or reliable information about a person's familial history than their own words?

For my mother's family, like all African-American families, the question of ""Where are you from?"" is a complicated one. My great-grandfather on my mother's side was Lumbee. The Lumbee are a tribe from North Carolina that includes the descendants of free Africans who married Native Americans. They were not recognized by the federal government and by some other tribes because of this.

A DNA test would not reveal any of this history. It would not tell me anything about one of the enduring stories in my family, that my great-grandfather helped to found schools for his people at the turn of the last century and was forced to leave North Carolina when his entire town was burned to the ground, presumably by people who disliked the town's organizing.

He came north. He went to Dartmouth College. He studied there in the early 1900s, amid the rise of eugenics movements. He was with a handful of other black students. One of them, lighter-skinned, remembered him only as ""that little black man."" His skin was the darkest of all of them. When he graduated from Dartmouth, he was still listed in the New Hampshire census as a popcorn seller.

Many northern white universities would not hire a black English professor in 1910. He left his family to travel the South for decades, teaching at black colleges. He created my grandmother, one of the strongest, most-loving, smartest women I ever knew. I was terrified of her for most of my life.

She moved to an all-white suburb of Boston at the start of the 1950s to make sure that her children had access to a good education. She worked for years as an administrative assistant at Harvard University and opened her doors to international students in the Boston area every Thanksgiving. She, too, had a school -- an informal one she ran for my mother and her siblings during the summer so that they could be twice as good as everyone else once they got to school in the fall.

If I were to have a child now, its DNA would not contain any trace of any of this story and would certainly not act as evidence to support it. I would, perhaps, look to see whether it loved books and education as much as its maternal ancestors did. But DNA would not reveal whether a child I had now would have the fortitude to survive the world it would be born into.

If I had a child now, it would be a part-black, part-Jewish child in a country where white supremacist attacks do not look to be ending anytime soon. It would be a country that could lose much of its coastline to rising sea levels.

The morning after the 2016 election, overwhelmed with what felt like the inescapable pull of history and biology, I told my mother: ""I guess this means I'm never having children. I can't imagine giving birth to a child under Trump, and in four years it will be too late for me.""

She wrote me back to tell me she loved me with all her heart and to assure me that she never regretted having any of us. She reminded me that black and biracial babies will always be born, no matter who is president. ""Maybe the child would grow into someone who carries on this legacy of finding a way to make a difference in the world,"" she wrote.

My mother understood what I was grappling with, and said: ""I do not wish you had been born in another skin or body, as painful as being a person of color can be. There is also great pride, great joy and an inner strength that can feel the pain and rise through it."" She continued: ""We will survive this through our strength as a family and as a people. We each have to reconcile it for ourselves, but we will.""

I think about what people are looking for when they talk about ancestry. When they take a DNA test, is it this history they are hoping to find, or an alternative to what we know of the past?

Malinda Maynor Lowery is a historian of Lumbee tribal history. This fall, she wrote on Twitter about the concept of genograms. Originally, they were a resource for families -- you write down the diseases that occur in your family tree so that everyone can be aware of what you might inherit. But Professor Lowery argued for expanding what we include in a genogram, citing the work of Jessica Lambert Ward. What if we mapped the strengths passed down, for the things that helped our ancestors survive in a hostile world?

Isn't that an echo of what we are looking for when we try to determine which tribe in West Africa we may have come from, which kin group we might claim? Sometimes we're looking in our blood for a map from our ancestors, when it has always been here, in how we talk to and love one another."

""Either a special officer must be appointed to administer the college, or the government should take over the college entirely. The college's move amounts to betrayal of the public's trust,"" said P Shanthi, president of AUT.

The DB Jain College, an A grade NAAC-accredited institution, has over 3,800 students. The college must seek the government's nod to even discontinue a course. ""How can it convert the college into an self-financing one,"" asked AUT general secretary N Shettu."

Is the case of two 'meticulously selected' IPS officers to head the CBI a reflection of a deeper malaise that has afflicted the civil service? Is it just the tip of the iceberg? Is there something wrong with the process of selection? Despite a much-touted 360-degree assessment, why are so many senior officers being shifted so often? There are many more such questions that beg answers.

Why was Rupak Dutta, an IPS officer with impeccable credentials and with a long tenure in the CBI, shifted and attached to the home ministry? Why wasn't he considered for the post of director? Why were Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana brought to the CBI when they had no experience of working in the organisation? Were competence and integrity not the criteria to select officers on these critical and sensitive posts? Were they not assessed through a '360-degree' evaluation?

As many as 17 ministries/departments have each had four-five secretaries or more during the past four years. Not all these postings were necessitated on account of superannuation. The social sector has suffered the most. The rural development ministry has had five secretaries, same as the case with crucial ministries/departments like health and school education. How can these sectors develop with such frequent changes at the top?

Secretaries are supposed to be selected after due diligence (read 360-degree). If that was the case, then why were two home secretaries - L.C. Goyal and Anil Goswami shifted even before they could complete their tenure of two years? Some other changes were equally baffling. Vrinda Sarup, rated as one of the finest IAS officers and with a very high experience in the school education sector, was shifted out suddenly. J.S. Deepak, then secretary, telecom, was attached to the ministry of commerce in an overnight order while he was representing the country at an international conference in Barcelona. Anuj Bishnoi who was ultimately considered fit for Central Administrative Tribunal, was shifted three times during his tenure as secretary. Why was C.K. Mishra shifted out of the ministry of health and family welfare? And if he wasn't good enough, how did he end up getting the ministry of environment and forest?

A large number of public sector undertakings (PSUs) have been left headless and without directors for months together, adversely impacting the performance of these entities. Coal India Limited is one such example where the absence of a CMD has created havoc. The coal sector was going through a serious crisis on account of coal shortages till 2014. The infamous coal scam was an outcome of this shortage. However, this was turned around on account of the outstanding contribution of Sutirtha Bhattacharya who headed the company for three years. Coal production saw an unprecedented jump in the years 2014-15 and 2015-16 primarily on account of his efforts. The incremental growth of 32 million tonnes was more than the cumulative growth during the previous four years. However, on completion of his tenure, Coal India Limited was left with an officiating chairman for more than a year. The consequences are there for everyone to see. There is yet again an acute shortage of coal in the country. The situation is gradually improving because there is a full-time CMD now. This is true of a number of public sector undertakings.

Every time one interacted with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one could not but be impressed with his sincerity of purpose and clarity of thought. The intent was always there and this reflected in his thought, expression and action. There were indeed some brilliant initiatives and decisions. The setting up of secretaries' groups, getting trainee IAS officers for a three-month stint in Delhi, posting of some senior level officers well ahead of the retirement of the previous incumbent, amendment to Section 13(1)(d)(ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act were indeed praiseworthy and reflected the positive intent of the Prime Minister in the context of human resource management. But then, where did it all go wrong? Why and how did human resource management get messed up? Who is advising the Prime Minister in taking these crucial decisions that are repeatedly going wrong?

The answer perhaps lies in the humongous task of managing India's army of civil servants. With almost everything getting concentrated in the hands of a few civil servants, the task has become too big to handle. This has also led to enormous delays in decisions related to postings resulting in vacancies for long durations. There is indeed something amiss. Can some of the work be delegated to different levels? Will it help? Can competence and integrity, and not allegiance, become the criteria for selection? These are, as they say, million dollar questions that beckon answers. Only those that matter can perhaps answer them. However, before they are answered, someone will have to muster the courage to ask these questions.

Even as cyclone Phethai makes landfall along the Andhra Pradesh coast, Hyderabad, the capital city of neighbouring state Telangana, will not stay untouched, says private weather forecaster Skymet.

For the next 12-18 hours, dry weather will continue, but cloud cover increased over the city in the last 24-36 hours because of the cyclonic storm over Southwest Bay of Bengal. It could lead to increase in surface winds with light to moderate rain and thundershower activity possible over the entire city.

SCR has made elaborate arrangements to tackle any situation arising due to the impending 'Cyclone Phethai', which is expected to make a land fall on the Andhra Pradesh coast by Monday (17 December).

3. TRS Unlikely to Fulfil Promises: TDP

The Telugu Desam Party Telangana State unit has expressed doubts that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi led Government was trying to delay the implementation of its promises like Rs 3,016 a month unemployment allowance to youth and doubling the quantum of social welfare pensions that are being given to different sections.

TDP polit bureau member Ravula Chandrasekhar Reddy, in an informal chat with reporters here, said Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's claims on providing unemployment allowance from the next financial year after studying the implementation of the scheme in other States was a pointer to the moves to delay the implementation of the scheme. The TDP was committed to mounting pressure on the government in a democratic manner for ensuring the implementation of the scheme at the earliest.

By Indulekha Aravind & Ram Mohan

In the end, Kalvakuntla Chandrasekhar Rao's welfare juggernaut rolled over allegations of corruption, talks of anti-incumbency and the 'mahakutami' or grand alliance of the Congress, Telugu Desam Party, Telangana Jana Samithi and CPI in Telangana. Analysts, voters and members of the victorious Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) cite KCR's welfare schemes, his constant communication with voters and a relentless social media campaign as the main reasons the party scooped up 88 of the 119 seats, a big leap from the 63 seats won in 2014.

In fact, even the TRS members had not quite foreseen the December 11 landslide, insiders say. The Congress was reduced to 19 seats, TDP to 2 and BJP to one. KCR followed the model of ""saturation welfare coverage"" that chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy (YSR) had popularised in undivided Andhra Pradesh, says Jayaprakash Narayan, the founder of Lok Satta Party and a former IAS officer. ""YSR had said that targeting beneficiaries was difficult due to corruption in bureaucracy."" He said YSR's solution was to launch schemes for nearly all sections of society, thereby ensuring saturation coverage and KCR followed the same model, making it a mission.

""KCR also benefited from his stature as the creator of Telangana, maintaining law and order after the bifurcation of Andhra and improving power distribution and management."" TR Ganesh, who retired from NTPC as deputy general manager and has been living in Hyderabad for 15 years, agrees. The TRS government did not make any false promise.

""There are no corruption charges against the ministers. There is 24-hour electricity for farmers. The water problem in Hyderabad has come down a great deal. The government did not make any false promise.""

The TRS has perfected the model of authoritarianism with welfarism that J Jayalalithaa and NT Rama Rao had started, says academic and political analyst G Haragopal. ""When welfare helps people, other factors become marginal.""

In politics, cultivating the perception that you are working hard is as important as the hard work. Helping the TRS disseminate its welfare bonanza messages was a strong social media team, directly under the supervision of KCR's son KT Rama Rao, referred to as KTR.

The party had been using social media aggressively since the days of statehood agitation when the mainstream media in Andhra Pradesh was against the bifurcation, says Dileep Konatham, Telangana government's digital media director.

Once the state was formed, a TRS social media wing was set up. KTR has led it since then. He is active on social media, has 1.4 million Twitter followers and responds to requests directly.

The party had also appointed 200 ""opinion leaders"" to spread ""positive"" messages and counter Opposition attacks, says Konatham. ""These leaders come from different walks of life -- as diverse as someone in an MNC in the US to a bike mechanic in Kukatpally.""

The TRS leadership, including KTR and his sister K Kavitha, a member of parliament, met these ""opinion leaders"" seven to eight times a year. For reaching out to voters for the assembly elections, TRS used ShareChat, Instagram and YouTube apart from the usual Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter. ""As ShareChat's reach increases, we'll start allocating more resources to it,"" he says.

A war room with 150 employees was set up, overseen by KTR, apart from separate teams of five to ten for KTR, Kavitha, KCR and his nephew and state minister Harish Rao.

Party sources say specific roles were played out by key leaders on social media. For instance, KTR attacked rivals while Rao highlighted the party's strength and KCR spoke on welfare schemes, said people active in backroom strategising.

""The comments sections on opposition parties' social media pages were regularly attacked by our supporters ensuring the Opposition had to focus more on addressing this onslaught than their own pages,"" says a source, requesting not to be named.

Soon after coming to power, the TRS was accused of harvesting data for its own purposes, when the government launched a survey of 83 lakh households, which asked for details on 94 parameters including education, employment, income bank accounts and mobile numbers.

The Hyderabad High Court, however, quashed petitions questioning the intent and execution of the survey and gave the government the go-ahead.

Dileep Konatham, too, denies that any information from the survey was used by TRS, though observers say this is what helped the party deliver targeted messages. With KCR now turning his attention to New Delhi and cobbling together a ""Third Front"", the TRS¡ social media activity may soon be asked to create more buzz."
