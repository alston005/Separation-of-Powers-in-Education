Teen Kills School Mate Because He Wanted To See The School Shut Down","indiatimes.com",FALSE,"Teens go through a lot of transformation in their lives, making them more prone to being angry, depressed and anxious. If not given enough attention this can have dire consequences like death too.

14-year-old Dev Tadvi, was hacked to death in a bathroom at Bharti School in Vadodara's Wadi area. On Friday, Dev became an unfortunate victim to the design of the 16-year-old accused who wanted to disgrace the school. The accused wanted to disgrace his school for being reprimanded by a teacher. The accused wanted to see if the school closed when he killed Tadvi, who he met a couple of minutes before, in the bathroom of Bharti School. The accused revealed this to police after he was held from Valsad on Friday night.

The boy, who was at his aunt's house in Valsad, told police he was agitated as a teacher had scolded him for not doing his homework two days before he committed the crime.

Officials say that he felt insulted and wanted to get the school closed. He then planned to kill someone in the school so it would be forced to shut down. According to the police, the boy's planning was almost foolproof and that if two schoolboys hadn't been in the washroom and seen him commit the crime, the killer would not have been identified. The boy even removed his shirt before stabbing Tadvi so it wouldn't get stained.

After stabbing Tadvi, the accused fled to his aunt's house and changed his clothes. When his father came to know of the incident, he boarded a bus with his son and reached Valsad.

However, by the time they reached Valsad, the two boys who were witness to the crime, revealed the killers identity. The accused were nabbed once they reached Valsad with the help of local police there. ""Tadvi collapsed after the first stab, but the perpetrator repeatedly stabbed Tadvi in his neck,"" said ACP S G Patil."

The 14-year-old boy was found dead with ten stab wounds on his body on Friday, Deputy Police Commissioner RS Bhagora said.

The 17-year-old accused, a student of the same school located in the city's Baranpora area, was caught in Valsad town in South Gujarat, Vadodara Police Commissioner Manoj Sashidhar told PTI. He became a suspect in the case after officials spotted him on CCTV camera footage entering the washroom along with the victim, the police said.

The Class 10 student, according to the Hindustan Times, has confessed to the murder and told the police that he had planned it to force the school to close as revenge for teachers scolding him. Sashidhar was quoted as saying in the report that the accused had no animosity towards the victim but had displayed behavioural problems in the past and was scolded by his teachers.

Jagruti Pandya, chairperson of the Gujarat State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said the mental condition of the accused will be examined.

Earlier, Bhagora had said that the murder could have been the result of a fight between the two children.

The victim had joined the school only a week before he was killed and had been staying with his maternal uncle. His parents live in Gujarat's Anand town, the police said.

The Vadodara case is eerily similar to the murder of a seven-year-old student in Gurugram's Ryan International School in September last year. The Class 2 student was found in a pool of blood, with his throat slit, in the school's washroom on 8 September. An inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation had found that a Class 11 student had killed the child to have the school shut down and a parent-teacher meeting and exam postponed.
