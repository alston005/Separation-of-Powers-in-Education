The 2015 batch of the All Nagaland Ad-hoc Teacher's Group (ANATG) issued a press release on Wednesday informing about the development.

The group asserted that it had considered what it claimed to be ""sympathetic concerns"" from various other groups based on which the agitators had resolved to temporarily suspend the indefinite hunger strike and ""all other democratic acts of resentment"" from July 1 until further notice.

The handout from the group stated: 'The ANATG-2018 batch on 30th June by considering sympathetic concerns from the All Nagaland School Teachers' Association (Ansta), the Naga Students' Federation, and the Eastern Naga Students' Federation, has resolved to temporarily suspend the indefinite hunger strike and all other democratic acts of resentment from 01-07-2018 until further notice. It is also to be noted that a final agreement is yet to be finalized with the government/department along with the Ansta/NSF/ENSF and the ANATG-2015 batch likely on 5th June 2018 (sic).'

The group stated that it had launched its indefinite hunger from June 29 and was to pursue it further. However, owing to the appeal by students and teachers' groups, the agitators 'acknowledged the kind concerns and gestures' temporarily suspended the strike.

The press release mentioned that according to the ""official legal statement"" made by K Sema, senior additional advocate general, 'the regularization of ANATG-2015 batch cannot be processed till any of the two legal options are being enforced i.e., till writ petition no. 145 (k) / 2017 is disposed off or till any order is passed by the court modifying the interim order dated 28-07-2017 favouring the ANATG-2015 batch.'

In view of the aforementioned legal options 'from the government,' the irregular teachers of said batch ""was compelled to opt for the second legal option i.e., urging the government / department to immediately file the Interlocutory Application before the court to avail any order that modifies the interim order dated 28-07-2017 which favours the ANATG-2015 batch, and redress our genuine aggrieved matter at the earliest.'

The group also sought to clarify that 'it was only due to the recruitment policy of the government of Nagaland that the present aggrieved grade-III ad hoc teachers had to occupy the vacant state sanctioned post on ad hoc basis.'

""Had the government conducted recruitment test before the appointment, the present aggrieved teachers could had followed the recruitment policy in order to occupy the sanctioned post on regular basis,"" the press release claimed.

""But the present aggrieved grade-III teachers had to complete a minimum of three years of service and appear the suitability test of which all the present 1166 grade-III ad hoc teachers have successfully cleared the departmental suitability test, spot verification of documents (sic) on 20th May 2017, with all other necessary clearances from the esteemed P&AR department."""

After multiple cases of miscalculation of marks being reported during the re-evaluation process of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class X and XII exam papers, the board has served notices to several schools across Delhi and asked them to suspend five teachers.

The board has received thousands of applications from the aggrieved students for the re-evaluation of marks. According to officials at the CBSE, similar action is likely to be ordered by regional offices against schools where evaluation errors have been found. ""The re-evaluation saw some students in the Delhi region getting 50-55 marks more than what they had initially got when the results were declared in May this year. In one case, a student, who had initially failed in Urdu, passed after re-evaluation. A detailed report is being prepared in the matter,"" a senior official at the CBSE said.

The notices have been sent to three government and two private schools. ""Five teachers from the Delhi region; three from government schools and two from private schools are supposed to be suspended. Schools concerned have been asked to take the prescribed action,"" the official said.

The board, however, claimed to have witnessed lesser number of mistakes in calculations this time around. ""Last year, as many as 20,162 students from the Delhi region had applied for the re-evaluation and mistakes were found in only 5 per cent cases. However, this year, of 11,000 re-evaluation requests, marks were changed in 3.26 per cent of the cases,"" said the official.

The CBSE started the process of re-evaluation for those who had appeared for Class X and XII board examinations on June 1. The board had declared both the Class X and XII results in the last week of May. However, candidates who were unsatisfied with the marks they were awarded were able to apply for the re-evaluation process."

So far, five teachers from the Delhi region -- three from government schools and two from private schools -- have been suspended after anomalies of up to 50-55 marks were found during the re-evaluation of Class 10 and 12 examination papers.

Maintaining that the most glaring examples of miscalculations in the Delhi region have already been reported, CBSE officials said a detailed report regarding the matter is being prepared. The re-evaluation saw some students in the Delhi region getting 50-55 marks more than what they had initially got when the results were declared in May this year. In one case, a student, who had initially failed in Urdu, passed after re-evaluation.

The Class 12 marks are especially crucial as Delhi University conducts admissions based on the board examination results. While such cases of miscalculations have been reported in the past too, this is the first time that such action has been initiated.

The CBSE, however, maintained that the percentage of mistakes have come down. For instance, in 2017, a total of 20,162 students from the Delhi region applied for re-evaluation, and in 4.97% cases, the marks were increased after re-evaluation. This year, 11,083 students from the Delhi region applied for re-evaluation, and marks were increased in 3.26% of the cases.

The CBSE had, on June 1, started the process of re-evaluation process for those who had appeared for the class 10 and 12 board examinations this year. The CBSE had declared both the class 10 and class 12 results in the last week of May. However, candidates who were unsatisfied with the marks they were awarded were able to apply for the re-evaluation process.

In 2017, the CBSE had decided to abolish the re-evaluation process but had to reintroduce it on a 'first-come, first-serve' basis after some students approached the Delhi High Court and the court intervened. The board had, last year, also set up two committees to look into the problems related to the evaluation process after receiving complaints from students and parents.

While the first committee was responsible for all looking into the evaluation and post-examination processes to identify and analyse discrepancies and suggest corrective measures to strengthen the process, the second committee was responsible for studying, analysing and suggesting systemic improvements in the evaluation process to make the system robust.A source said the first committee was also responsible for fixing responsibility by finding out the teachers/evaluators responsible for the evaluation errors.

According to the CBSE, the percentage of students applying for verification of marks in 2014, 2015 and 2016 were 2.31, 2.09 and 2.53 respectively."

Kohima, June 26 (EMN): Following the assurance from the department to file an interlocutory application for modification of the court's interim order through the director of School Education, Wonthungo Tsopoe, the All Nagaland Ad hoc Teachers' Group (ANATG) has suspended its proposed indefinite hunger strike on June 27 'for the moment.'

Informing this to Eastern Mirror, ANATG spokesperson Bendang Ozukum said the assurance came after a meeting with the director and other officials which lasted more than two hours.

Besides the assurance to file an interlocutory application, Ozukum said the department has also offered to enhance the scale of pay of the agitating teachers. However, he said the members have not decided anything on the offer of scale of pay offered by the department.

In the light of this development, he said the members have decided to suspend its proposed hunger strike which was to begin on June 27. At the same time, he acknowledged the move made by the director.

Meanwhile, Ozukum also informed that it has called for a meeting with the general members of the group wherein a final decison on whether its sit-in protest will continue besides other agendas will be arrived at.
