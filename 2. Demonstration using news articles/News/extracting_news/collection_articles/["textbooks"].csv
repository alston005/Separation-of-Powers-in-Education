The feat comes as another feather in the cap of Bengaluru government schools, where science and maths are no longer dreaded by students, thanks to initiatives like setting up of STEM (science technology engineering mathematics) laboratories in the institutions by NGOs and volunteers.

""I have designed a smokeless train using solar panels. I am experimenting with wind energy to make it faster and more efficient,"" said Ravi Kumar D, a class 7 student from the Hebbal school. The other winners are Mithun from class 6, who came up with a waste management model, and Anil and Vasant Kumar from class 8, whose project was based on wind energy.

""Our students were on a par with their private school counterparts, who have access to good science labs,"" said Umme Salma, science teacher at the government school.

The school has had a science lab for long but it was not used due to shortage of time and logistics. Mobile science labs began visiting the school and teachers started holding classes at a science centre set up on the campus by an NGO. The enhanced quality of education reflected in the numbers -- admissions went up from 425 in 2017 to 535 in 2018.

""When we started mobile science labs for students in government schools, the excitement to learn was palpable. Some of the kids are quick learners. That's what made us set up this centre. Students from 10 nearby government schools can visit the centre, innovate and experiment,"" said Dilip Gowda, head of the science centre set up in the school by Agastya International Foundation.

The foundation runs about eight science centres in government schools in Immadihalli, Electronics City, Yelahanka, Sarjapur Road and Kengeri, among other places.

Ramesh Atloori, son of a construction worker and resident of a 100sq ft tenement in Viveknagar, has two foreign jaunts to his credit. In 2016, he represented a robotics team at Robocup International in Leipzig, Germany, and he visited Japan the next year to take part in the event's 2017 edition. He was accompanied by his schoolmates Aravind Reddy, Ramakrishna and Lawrence Aga, who have a similar background like his. ""It was a dream come true. It was our teacher's motivation which took us to these places,"" said Ramesh.

The quartet was from Seva Bharath Trust Government Telugu Higher Primary School, Viveknagar, and was drawn to robotics during their STEM education classes.

Sridhar P, an IISc graduate, who left his cushy job to train government school students in robotics, has taken students from six government institutions to international competitions. ""STEM labs help in students' overall development, instilling qualities like peer learning, leadership and creativity in them. They give students the confidence that they can make something work. They also connect science and maths to real-world problems. Unconsciously, the students become computer literate too,"" said Sridhar.

""Thanks to the robotics project we started on a pilot basis in Seva Bharath Trust Government Telugu Higher Primary School, students wanted to spend more time in class. They created LEGO robots, a humanoid and what not. Students are bright enough to grasp concepts; it's all about giving them access,"" said Sushmita Ananth from Akshara Foundation.

Vandana P, a teacher from RT Nagar Government School, said that lack of access to labs and rote learning of science with focus on theory make students fear the subject.

""When students are made to do experiments their textbooks cite, they begin to love the subject,"" said Praveen Kumar from Swami Vivekanand Youth Movement, which is currently teaching STEM in 25 primary and 25 high schools in Bengaluru and Dharwad each."

Social science textbooks, sources said, would bear the bulk of the cuts, with those for mathematics, science and the languages unlikely to change much. The changes will kick in from the new academic year.

""For example, there is a chapter on the history of cricket in Class IX social science books, which is totally unnecessary,"" the source added. ""Things like that will be removed from the syllabus.

""Science, mathematics and the languages do not need much reduction, just some pruning of content here and there,"" the source said.

""The science syllabus for higher classes like Class XI and XII especially does not need any reduction because that is a level at which students need more study material,"" the source added.

Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar had announced earlier this year that the content of National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) books being taught in schools will be reduced by half in the coming years to ease the burden on students.

Following the announcement, the NCERT constituted a committee to work out where and how the syllabus can be cut, and the panel has now submitted its report to the council.

Sources in the NCERT say that while it is not possible to reduce the syllabus by half, they are working on reducing portions wherever possible.

For the exercise, the HRD ministry had also invited suggestions from the public, with everyone from parents to teachers, and even people interested in the field of education, encouraged to weigh in.

The government received more than one lakh suggestions.

According to sources, while a large number of people said the syllabus should be reduced by 50 per cent, many others suggested a calculated approach not driven by this target.

Some people, meanwhile, suggested increasing the syllabus in some of the subjects, especially science, to bring it on a par with international standards, the sources said.

The NCERT is now studying the suggestions of the panel as well as the public to finalise the cuts.

A comparison of the syllabus for the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (ICSE), which includes some NCERT books, and that of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), where they form the bulk of the curriculum, shows that the latter is anyway lighter.

In a report submitted to Medical Council of India (MCI), Dr Indrajit Khandekar said the test, which can be psychologically devastating for women, continues to be perceived as a clinical tool by virtue of being taught in medical schools, and therefore in certain instances has even been ordered by courts to decide cases. The doctor's letter, based on a study of nearly 30 MBBS and forensic medicine postgraduation textbooks, has also been sent to the Union health ministry on December 26.

The report stated the textbooks not just vividly taught students about virginity and techniques of hymen inspection for size or tears, but also spoke of ""false"" and ""true virgins."" Interestingly, while volumes were devoted to teaching female virginity, there was hardly any mention of male virginity in any textbook, Khandekar's letter said.

""Numerous studies have shown the inspection of hymen cannot give conclusive evidence of vaginal penetration or any sexual history. In fact, abnormal hymenal features such as laceration or an enlarged opening are found in females with or without a history of sexual activity. Yet our textbooks continue to teach future doctors about this unscientific test,"" said Dr Khandekar, who teachers at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Sewagram. He medical students continue to be asked questions about virginity in exams. ""Till it stays in the curriculum, textbooks will devote chapters on this and students will continue to learn and perhaps practice when asked to perform such a test by the police or courts,"" said the forensic expert.

The SC had in 2013 banned use of the two-finger test on rape victims. Maharashtra was one of the first states to implement the ban and change medico-legal proformas. Recently, the state introduced genderintegrated modules in five disciplines. The Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes (CEHAT), along with the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) and Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS), worked on the modules across five disciplines, including forensic medicine, to bring in gender perspective in medical education. ""These changes have started to reflect in textbooks taught in Maharashtra. But it needs to change across India,"" said Padma Deosthali of CEHAT."

The BJP-ruled state governmentissued a notification to this effect on Monday, and asked schools to implement the directive from January 1, 2019.

""To inculcate the spirit of nationalism in children from childhood, all government, granted and self-financed schools should instruct students of classes IX to XIII to say 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat' instead of 'Yes Sir' or 'Present Sir' during attendance,"" the notification said.

State education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama confirmed the news. ""A teacher from Rajasthan who was awarded by the ABVP for his contribution to the education sector shared some of his ideas during the ABVP's national convention.

One of the ideas was to replace 'Yes Sir' with 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat'. It would definitely go a long way in inculcating the spirit of nationalism,"" Chudasama said.

Sandeep Joshi, the teacher who was feted by the ABVP, had said while receiving the award, ""A child goes through school saying 'Yes Sir' or 'Present Sir' thousands of times over and over again. If we replace this with 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat', the student will use these words instead and understand the true meaning of nationalism.""

The Gujarat education minister, present at the event, took serious note of the suggestion, and two days later, the state government issued its notification.

Joshi also shared a few other ideas regarding education. ""We have introduced monthly textbooks to deal with the heavy school bag issue. There is no point carrying textbooks with initial chapters all the way until March. So we will have monthly textbooks which will work well with the students. We have also introduced bagless Saturdays. Students can design their own curriculum on these days, to study what they want to,"" he said.

Regarding these, Chudasama said, ""We have already reduced the weight of bags in the state. As of now, we have taken the 'Jai Bharat, Jai Hind' initiative seriously, and have implemented it."""

The State Cabinet's prompt move has come in for praise from civil society groups.

The State Cabinet has taken a slew of decisions, ranging from the elimination of educational qualification for Panchayati Raj elections, the reopening of universities and removal of Deendayal Upadhyaya's logo from official documents to direct elections for Mayor's post and the appointment of a committee on eligibility for the waiver of farmers' loans.

Health Minister Raghu Sharma said after the Cabinet meeting here that the State government would review all the decisions taken by the previous government in the last six months. Minister of State for Education Govind Singh Dotasara has also announced a review of school textbooks and other reference materials that were revised by the BJP.

The State government has abolished the criteria of educational qualification of candidates for Panchayati Raj bodies, introduced by the BJP regime through an Ordinance in 2014, to ensure that each citizen gets the right to contest. The qualification of 'Class X pass' was set for the Zila Parishad and Panchayat Samiti polls, and 'Class VIII pass' for Sarpanch elections.

The People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) has welcomed the move, saying it had done away with a ""highly discriminatory"" provision that had led to the exclusion of 73% of the population above 21 years of age in rural areas. ""This was an elitist law, denying equal opportunities to citizens who did not have the means for securing education,"" PUCL-Rajasthan president Kavita Srivastava said here on Monday.

Ms. Srivastava pointed out that a special leave petition challenging the amendment to the Panchayati Raj Act was still pending in the Supreme Court. ""After the State government's decision, we will argue in the apex court that the right to contest elections ought to be recognised as a fundamental right,"" she said.

The Congress government has also ordered the removal of the logo of Bharatiya Jan Sangh's co-founder Deendayal Upadhyaya from the official letterheads of Ministers and government functionaries. Social activist Sawai Singh, president of Rajasthan Samagra Seva Sangh, said there was no justification for eulogising an Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue and undermining the significance of the Sarnath pillar as the national emblem.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has handed over the Congress party's manifesto to the Chief Secretary with the direction that it should be treated as the State government's policy document. A Cabinet committee will also be constituted to ensure its effective implementation.

Among other decisions, the State Cabinet has revived the Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Law University and Haridev Joshi University of Journalism and Mass Communication, which were closed by the Vasundhara Raje government.

On the social security front, the Cabinet announced an increase in the amount of pension paid to widows and elderly and disabled persons. The Congress had protested against the halting of pensions for eligible beneficiaries during the BJP's rule."

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

The horror of NEET continues

National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) has continued to haunt medical aspirants of Tamil Nadu, particularly those from government schools. Only eight government school students managed to secure a medial seat after clearing NEET this year, according to official data. Despite setting up 412 special training centres, ineffective operation have let down the students. KA Sengotttaiyan, state school education minister, admitted that Rs 20 crore amount sanctioned remained unused and promised better performance in the coming years.

Also, many students were given centres in other states like Rajasthan since there were not enough centres set up here. Strict checking which also led to stripping in few cases took toll on mental health of few examinees. Of the 1.2 lakh candidates, around 60 per cent were unable to clear the entrance, according to official data. However, around 1,300 government school students who cleared the test were unable to obtain the necessary cutoff. With government showing no intent in clearing the bill which seeks a permanent exemption of NEET, private coaching centres have started to mushroom, collecting fees Rs 20,000-Rs 2,00,000 for a year. Some are also travelling to other states for coaching.

Revised syllabus cheers up students

After a gap of nearly 12 years, Tamil Nadu government revised school curriculum. The new textbooks, written based on the revised syllabus for state board students, have received a positive response from almost all the stakeholders. Besides enriching the content, value additions like Quick Response (QR) codes for reading reference materials, Information & Communication Technology (ICT) corners and career guidance sections have made the new textbooks better than the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), said an official from the school education department.

""The book is filled with worked-out examples, colourful illustrations and quick pointers which will help the students understand the concepts better and perform well in not only board exams but also competitive exams like NEET and IIT-JEE,"" he said.

Only one bus for Chennaiites

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy launched a total of 986 government buses this year -- 515 in July and 471 in October. However, despite the Corporation's proposal to replace 245 buses on an urgent basis, the city got just one new bus. According to official records, nearly 250 old MTC buses were declared unfit for operation. Also, more than 70 per cent of the 3,300 buses are being operated beyond the permissible six lakh kilometres.

M Chandran, vice president, Centre of Indian Trade Union (CITU) said a bus must ideally run for seven years. But, MTC buses have been running for more than 15 years. While the year started with the government announcing a steep hike in government and private bus fares ranging from 20 per cent to 55 per cent in January, the failure to replace rickety buses has proved in further losses to MTC, with a major chunk of commuters shifting to suburban trains for travel. When contacted, an official from MTC said that at least 50 new buses will be allocated to Chennai next year.

Now, pay your fine online

In a bid to eliminate cash transaction and ensure transparency, the city police in May this year launched a cashless fine payment system for traffic violators. Police reviewed that it is a major hit. ""From May 10 to December 27, a total of 13,92,442 cases have been registered and fine worth Rs15,44,69,930 has been collected,"" said a senior official from the traffic department. As per the new system, besides swiping cards at point of sale machines already available with traffic police, those served with e-challans can make payments online.

The fine can also be paid through Paytm using QR Code. The fine can also be paid in cash at post offices, relevant courts and state-run e-sewa centres The official further added that when offenders pay digitally, they get an acknowledgement text from the city police. ""Also, from next month, we will announce an updated portal after tying up with the National Informatics Centre (NIC). This will help us know their previous details and nab repeated offenders,"" he said.

Metro yet to become the first choice

Two underground metro rail stretches, Nehru Park to Central and Saidapet to AGDMS were inaugurated after nearly six years of construction in May, this year. The ridership of Chennai Metro currently stands close to 60,000 against the estimated five lakh. Though the inauguration of the two stretches increased the patronage from 30,000 to 60,000, it still has to go a long way. It may be noted that in December last year, Chennai Metro came under fire from the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for several discrepancies in the Detailed Project Report (DPR), it prepared for the phase- II project. Even this year, Union Urban Development Ministry had reasons to doubt the feasibility of the 107 km second phase for which the agency had sent a detailed report to avail funds. An official of CMRL said the ridership will increase once Metro is connected from AG-DMS to Washermanpet via Central.

Chennai is becoming smart

While the Smart City project implemented by the Greater Chennai Corporation made little headway in 2017, an official said as many as seven projects were completed this year and several others have begun. ""The completed projects include exclusive bicycle lane, installation of storm water drains in T Nagar, development of Namma Chennai app for GCC, establishment of 28 smart classrooms in corporation schools, park renovation, establishment of sensory park and conversion of sodium lamps into LED lamps in almost all the areas,"" said an official. While projects worth Rs 26 crore are being implemented on the ground, projects worth Rs 336 crore are in various stages of implementation. Also, work to augment the water supply to city residents and increase the volume of supply, as part of the Smart City Mission, would be underway by March next year."

New Delhi: Caught on camera purportedly exhorting students to commit murder, Raja Ram Yadav, the vice-chancellor of a state university in Uttar Pradesh, is a geophysicist who has spent nearly four decades in academia.

Yadav, 61, an MSc topper from Allahabad University, was appointed the vice-chancellor of Veer Bahadur Singh Purvanchal University in Jaunpur last year. He came under scrutiny over the weekend after he allegedly made deeply controversial remarks in his address to students at an affiliated college in Ghazipur.

A video from the event, held Saturday, shows Yadav purportedly saying that students should not come crying to him if they get into a fight, and should instead beat up the other person, or murder them if possible. ""We'll take care of it later,"" he added.

Delivered in Hindi, his exact quote runs thus: ""Agar aap Purvanchal University ke chhatra ho to rote huye me... mere paas kabhi mat aanaa. Ek baat bata detaa hoon... Agar kisi se jhagda ho jaaye to uski pitaai karke aana, aur tumhara bas chale to uska murder karke aana, uske baad hum dekh lenge.""

With the video triggering calls for the vice-chancellor's removal, the Uttar Pradesh government has asked Yadav to explain his remarks.

According to a report in Hindustan Times, Yadav blamed the media for ""distorting"" his statement in a clarification issued in the wake of the controversy.

""My statement was intended at motivating students and boosting their confidence. I also tried to inculcate zeal and encouraged them towards their goals. Fighting for one's right, if he is correct, is not wrong. He should not pull back,"" the report quoted him as saying.

Yadav's stint with Veer Bahadur Singh Purvanchal University follows a long and distinguished career in education.

An alumnus of Allahabad University, the Bundelkhand native was named the topper when he completed his MSc in physics in 1979. He went on to secure a junior research fellowship, and pursued his PhD at the university while serving a five-year stint with Oil & Natural Gas Commission as a geophysicist between 1983 and 1988.

Yadav has spent most of his career teaching at Allahabad University, where he started as a junior research fellow and eventually became a professor.

In 2010, he was awarded the UP government's Prayag Gaurav Samman for his contribution to the field of education.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, In spite of many schemes including 'School Chalen Hum', running in the state, the number of children in government schools is declining year after year. This has been revealed in the report submitted by the school education department in the last assembly session.

In the last three years six lakh children have left the government schools. Chhindwara district tops in the number of dropouts, whereas Satna and Rewa are second and Shivpuri is in third place.

Children enrolled in government schools through school education department are counted through mid-day meal and free textbook distribution. The number of children in the year 2015-16 is 76,23,522, which fell to only 70,20,008 in the year 2017-18.

All the schemes are aimed at luring the children to the government school. Funds of crores are given under 'School Chale Hum' campaign by the Central Government. The entire budget is also being spent every year, but still the number of children is falling in schools.

Either this budget is being spent on paper, or the schemes are not proving to be effective in attracting children. In order to increase enrollment of children in government schools, the government is running schemes like free textbooks, uniforms and bicycles distribution. In this every year bill of crores rupees is wasted."

The newly formed Congress government in Rajasthan has decided to restore right to contest, improve benefits under social security schemes and review change in textbooks that were made during previous BJP government. In the first cabinet meeting held on Saturday, chief minister Ashok Gehlot reversed the key decisions taken by the previous Vasundhara Raje government in the state. While handing over the party's manifesto to the chief secretary, the cabinet unanimously decided that it would be the policy document of the state government and a cabinet committee would be constituted to ensure its effective implementation. The key takeaways of the meeting included reopening of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar Law University and Haridev Joshi University of Journalism and Mass Communication that were closed by the Raje government, elimination of the provision of minimum educational qualification in the Panchayati Raj elections, and removal of Deendayal Upadhyay logo from official documents. To effectively execute its loan waiver announcement, the Gehlot government decided to constitute an inter-departmental committee to waive the short-term crop loan. The chief minister has been authorised to nominate members in the said committee that will set the eligibility criteria for the waiver in cooperative banks, nationalised banks, and regional rural and land development banks. Putting an emphasis on the social security schemes, the government announced increment in the pension received by old-age, widow and disabled persons under its old-age pension scheme. The Congress, while in opposition, had called out the Raje-led BJP government for halting the pension of eligible beneficiaries. ""For the past five years, the Raje government didn't increase the pension that was previously set by our government. Keeping in mind the present scenario, we have increased the pension from Rs 500 to Rs 750 for men and women above 55 years of age and from Rs 750 to Rs 1000 for the pensioners in the age bracket of 75 years and above,"" Master Bhawarlal Meghwal, minister of social justice and empowerment in the Rajasthan government, told The Wire. ALSO READ: Rajasthan Cabinet turns manifesto into policy doc, to ensure implementation The state council also decided to constitute a committee for resolving the issues of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) workers, para-teachers, Urdu para-teachers, anganwadi workers, education workers, panchayat assistants and a few others working on a contractual basis in state. During Raje's tenure earlier this year, several NRHM who showed black flags to PM Narendra Modi demanding permanent employment were arrested for 'sloganeering' and 'obstructing police personnel in discharging their duties'. The government also decided to abolish the criteria set by the previous BJP government for the educational qualification of candidates for panchayati raj and local body elections to ensure each person gets a right to contest elections. The state government under the BJP had brought in an ordinance a few days ahead of panchayat polls in 2014 making it mandatory for candidates contesting zila parishad and panchayat samiti polls to be Class X pass and those contesting sarpanch elections to be class VIII pass. In the scheduled areas, the criteria was class V pass. It later led to an amendment to the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Act, 1994. Civil society members who have been consistently fighting to restore the right to contest have welcomed the step. ""The law was discriminatory and elitist.

It was maliciously brought in Rajasthan to break the Congress control over the panchayats. After its implementation, 65% of the elected representatives were under 35 and it completely ruled out the older people and tribals who had no adequate means for education. The law was basically brought in to woo the youth, the only base of the Bhartiya Janta Party in rural areas,"" Kavita Srivastava, Rajasthan president of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, told The Wire."

The Medical Council of India (MCI), and indeed, the government, should pay keen attention to what a Maharashtra-based forensic medicine professor, Dr Indrajit Khandekar, is saying in his report on virginity tests. Khandekar highlights the unscientific basis of the test and how it violates human rights and fans entrenched gender discrimination. The virginity test is an examination of female genitalia to ascertain whether a woman/girl claiming rape is 'habituated to vaginal intercourse' or not. Khandekar shows that the test can't prove this conclusively, and points out that some medical textbooks even speak of 'true virgins' and 'false virgins' without quoting any scientific literature or study. However, this still remains part of the medical syllabus at the MBBS level. Many medico-legal experts worldwide have called for junking it, given both vaginal laxity and broken hymen can occur due to many other, non-sexual reasons.

The call for MCI to scrap it from the medical education syllabus is a sane one, given how the test can be physically and mentally scarring for a rape survivor, and reinforces social and judicio-legal biases related to sexual history and rape claims. It is indeed difficult to understand why a virginity test should be pertinent for a rape investigation. It just biases the authorities against rape claims by sexually active women and, in some cases, women who haven't yet commenced sexual activity, if the hymen didn't get ruptured (in cases of digital rape)or got ruptured earlier due to some physical stress or disease. In any case, focusing on a woman's sexual history is abhorrent, more so when such tests are not demanded of men."

India holds an advantageous position on the global map. Not only does it enjoy a favourable demographic dividend with the largest population in the age group of 15-24 years, but it was also ranked 27th out of 80 countries on the global English Proficiency Index 2017. This substantial English-speaking population makes India an attractive market for new, advanced educational products. The country already holds a prestigious rank in the quality of higher education in the world. However, there is still a long way to go, particularly if we look at education delivery in schools, where institutions are only beginning to accept and adopt blended learning.

The year 2018 witnessed rising digital influence in education. After the US, India emerged as the second-largest market for e-learning. The market size is projected to touch $1.96 billion, buoyed by 9.5 million users by 2021. The expanding mobile and data network is playing a major role in the growth of distance education, focused on training and skill development. Edtech and blended digital learning are transforming both higher and K12 sector.

This implies that 2019 will witness an accelerated shift towards blended concept-based learning -- moving away from the traditional rote learning. More emphasis would be on the application of knowledge and the development of core skills, to prepare students for eventually joining the workforce. This goes beyond textbooks and involves group discussions, problem-solving and research-based assignments. Without exhaustive libraries in all schools, online learning tools and resources will be the need of the hour. Some proponents contest that given the future favouring the tech-savvy, schoolchildren should be introduced to digital media at an early age.

The recent Union government directive to reduce homework for school students and the weight of school bags are some steps in this direction. However, an effective solution that will ensure to also deliver these objectives would be to introduce digital curriculum and content in schools. A few state governments have gone a step further and launched online educational resources (OER) on portals with thousands of web resources.

The allocation for school education under Union Budget 2018-19 increased by 14% and focused on strengthening existing initiatives and refining quality. This allocation is expected to rise year-on-year, and it is estimated India's higher education sector will emerge as world's single-largest provider of global talent by 2030, with one in four graduates from India.

Thus, with renewed focus on quality education, with technology as the pivot, the education sector in India is set to make several major positive changes in the years to come. In addition, the rise in digital technologies will bring new innovations, and reduce gaps in delivery of education. As the leading educator George Couros said, ""Technology will never replace great teachers, but technology in the hands of a great teacher can be transformational."""

Icons have always been a part of memory and heritage, carrying the seal of the sacred. Classical iconography was, in fact, the study of religious icons, an exploration of symbols and their meaning. While iconography has a sense of tradition, modern society looks at its icons differently. The perspective did not always carry the mark of the sacred, but combined folklore and propaganda in interesting ways.

Folklore captures a sense of orality and storytelling in plural ways. Each locality has its own version of the hero and his exploits, providing a sense of a modern epic. Yet, the stories can be deeply plural, reflecting different histories and memories. Shivaji is seen in Maharashtra as the great liberator, but grandmothers in south India used to hushing children to sleep, warning them that Shivaji would come. This sense of plurality was critical and gave to each locality a sense of creating its own icons.

Mass culture and state propaganda operate differently. If folklore has a sense of joy, mass culture brings to its icons a sense of frenzy, hysteria, what one can call a modern sense of idolatry. The narrative possesses an official character which creates a grid of uniformity. The stories are hyperbolic, following a grid. Often there is an attempt to rewrite history or give it a caricatured quality. The figure of Rana Pratap is a good example, where attempts have been made to rewrite his fate in the Battle of Haldighati. Modern memory does not take kindly to defeat and populist memory often takes historical memory and alters it. There is a hyperbolic quality to this rewriting but this act differs from a Stalinist rewriting of histories. Stalin took old Russian heroes, stalwarts of the Bolshevik Revolution, especially those who challenged his dominance, and converted them to non-persons, literally erasing their role in history. The fate of the Indian icon has been constructed differently. The poignancy comes from a benign neglect, reducing memory and commemoration to a ritualistic event, an empty marker.

In fact, it is interesting to consider the fate of four great modern Indian icons -- Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and Subhas Chandra Bose. Each followed a different narrative and each suffered what we can call the travails of the modern icon.

The Gandhi of the independence movement was every child's icon, hero and idol. But Indian officialdom and the historian created a one-sided Gandhi, a saint rather than an experimental politician. By museum-ising Gandhi, we put his memory into mothballs. He was reduced to a few select anecdotes, a watered-down version who populated textbooks. The uncomfortable questions he raised, the controversies around him were forgotten. From one of the great monuments of the era, he became a memorial and was soon reduced to mnemonic commemorations on birthdays through official clichés. In 2019, it'll be 150 years since his birth, and one realises he is being strip-mined for official slogans and programmes, where his great quotations become clerical clichés. A Gandhian programme combined the political and the ethical, which Swachh Bharat Abhiyan does not -- it is a mere act of governance, a spectacle which has still to encounter untouchability and the septic tank.

The career of Bose followed a different trajectory, of erasure and temporary revival. Bose's mystique derived from two sources: from the Azad Hind Fauj which was a counter to Gandhi's satyagrahic imagination, and from the mystery of his disappearance. The fact that there is a mystery around his death created a literal industry of inquiries by every opportunistic politician. The sense of possibility, the repeated excitement of the ever revived question, ""what if Bose had lived"", always gave a sense of alternative possibilities and histories to India. Many people felt that the Indian narrative would have been different.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attempt to honour the Azad Hind Fauj tried to cater to this obsession. It was an attempt to play down the Nehruvian imagination. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has attempted to capture history by appropriating Congress icons. It is an act of political envy which reveals that the BJP senses its own national heroes as pygmies before this Congress quartet.

The fate of Nehru has been the most controversial. The memory of Nehru has been battered by opponents ever since the war with China. Nehru has been unfairly constructed as a Pandora's box of errors since then. People even attributed the roots of the Emergency to his sense of administration. Yet, Nehru pops up like a spring flower after every one of these attacks. The Nehruvian imagination stands like a huge aesthetic canvas despite the BJP's attempt to belittle him. One has to acknowledge that his leadership evoked a different style, a different set of memories from Indira Gandhi's. Nehru's ideas of modernisation still have a political appeal. It was his era that saw the building of the great institutions that Indian modernity talks about. One can criticise their decline, but no one can deny that Nehru brought a magic to modernity and institution-building. A.B. Vajpayee's attempt to give a Nehruvian touch to his politics testified to the validity of the Nehruvian imagination and style.

Nehru is a perennial icon, whose ability to survive has made a mockery of his critics. Instead of hyperbolic attacks and hysterical critiques, one senses that a quieter nuanced assessment would have been more devastating and effective. Sadly, balance and fairness elude the fate of the Indian icon who sways between hagiography and hysterical downsizing, both of which reduce Indian history to a comic strip of exaggerations.

The recent events around Sardar Patel capture the travails of a modern icon poignantly. Patel, like Bose, was labelled one of the ignored men of modern history, even when both were larger-than-life creatures in folklore. In fact, they did not need the manicuring of history to make them relevant. The BJP's attempt to appropriate Patel is in that sense pathetic, more interesting as a caricature, a case-study in propaganda than a historical ritual of redemption.

The BJP tried to appropriate Patel by turning from text to spectacle. They did not rewrite history but claimed that Patel was the real exemplar and paradigm of India's future. It became an example of gigantism, of the regime's attempts to create spectacular monuments which seek to enter popular memory for their statistical prowess, their ability to make the Guinness World Records than to alter historical perception. Patel, for a few months, will be the tallest statue in the world, till the monument to Shivaji upstages him. In fact, monumentality and gigantism compete with neglect and erasure for the fate of an icon. If one creates artificial erasure, the other emphasises exaggerated attention, and in doing so pretends it is rectifying historical injustice. Exaggerated spectacles rarely rectify history, which has a nuance and logic of its own. What the Modi regime does to its favourite icons, Stalin did to production statistics. It creates an ideological frenzy which commemorates and celebrates not the icon, but the regime, serving as a diversion, a disguise for its own narcissistic preoccupations.

The humanity, the vulnerability, the ethical genius of each of these exemplars disappears in these acts of exaggeration or downsizing. In fact, it shows that the BJP is afflicted by its own sense of history rather than possessing a sense of poetry, accuracy or authenticity. The sadness is that all four icons understood the limits of power and history. One misses professionalism, the craft of academic scholarship in these moments where contemporary power destroys history for opportunistic reasons."

Maley worked as the British Council's South India (Madras) Regional Director between 1984 and 1988. A well-known author of ELT books and Series Editor for the Oxford University Press (OUP) Resource Books for Teachers series, Maley has also served as the President and Vice President of the International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (IATEFL), and has taught in the National University of Singapore and at Assumption University, Bangkok. Currently, he enjoys writing poetry, short stories, and ELT books. He was in Chennai recently as a resource person at an international conference organised by SSN College of Engineering.

In this interview, Alan Maley recalls his experience in Madras and shares his views on the importance of creativity in the English language classroom.

In the book , you state that ""creativity is an endangered species in the current model of education, which is increasingly subject to institutional, curricular and assessment constraints"". How important is creativity for teachers of English?

Creativity is enormously important for teachers of English on several levels. One level is what they do in the classroom and also for themselves. It is easy to fall into a routine when you are a teacher.

Doing things differently makes you creative. Thinking about doing things differently and doing things more creatively keeps you alive as a teacher and makes you a better teacher. If you are a creative person, it will carry over into your teaching and your students will also benefit from you and that will give an opportunity for them to show their creativity.

Many teachers still think of creativity as the preserve of a particularly gifted group of people. It is not so. Everyone is creative. Creativity is not beyond one's capacity. Anything can be done in more than one way and the techniques can be very simple and feasible, and they are usable in the classroom. Teachers can develop their creativity which can take many different forms and can be exhibited in many ways such as finding a quicker solution to a problem, narrating something differently, making up a joke, and so on. Yes, creativity is important for teachers because creative teachers can motivate learners and enable them to learn a language in an interesting and effective way.

Tell us more about your recent book?

The book was published in May by Cambridge University Press. It is a collection of 50 classroom activities which teachers can use and adapt in their classrooms.

Should language teachers be trained to become more creative?

First, teachers should know the importance of creativity and should have the desire to become more creative. Teachers should feel the need for being creative. Training is also important. Teachers should be equipped with creative techniques which they can transfer in the classroom. In-service training is as important as pre-service training. Teachers should be taught to generate ideas among learners. It means that they should talk less and create more opportunities for students to speak in the class. Teachers should be creative as well as reflective. Creative teaching and reflective teaching go together.

What is your take on learner-generated material?

It is important to use the learner-generated material in the language classroom. It will be more effective than readymade textbooks. As I said earlier, everyone is creative and learners are also creative. I believe that students are quite capable of generating their own material. They should make students believe that they have the capacity to select materials suitable to them. Learners must be encouraged and involved not only in selecting the materials but also in suggesting language activities. Teachers should give their students a chance to generate their own material. It is a creative process.

How to make language teaching and learning more effective and meaningful?

It is important to make learners feel the need for learning. They learn English for a wide range of purposes but they are not aware of their needs. There should be a shift from ""have to learn"" to ""want to learn"". This shift will motivate them to learn the target language effectively.

How important is professional development for teachers?

I think it is very important as they are prone to fall into habits. So, there is a need for them to keep their mind active. Teacher development programmes give teachers the opportunity to listen to fellow teachers, exchange ideas, pick up others' ideas and use them in their teaching, and learn from one another. They should constantly learn something new and update themselves by taking new courses.

About your association with Dr N S Prabhu who popularised task-based approach to language teaching.

I was fortunate to have had NS Prabhu as a colleague (English Studies Officer) and to see his Bangalore Project at first hand. His task-based approach to language teaching has been much discussed and appreciated by experts in different countries where English is taught as a second or foreign language. His departure from a linguistically-structured syllabus to a procedural syllabus based on a series of carefully staged tasks was a critical moment in the development of our current conceptions of English Language Teaching."

Political activist, actor, playwright and poet Safdar Hashmi was violently attacked while performing a street play in Sahibabad, 20 km from Delhi, on January 1, 1989.

Safdar succumbed to his injuries at the hospital the following day. His death lead to a nationwide wave of revulsion, grief and resistance that ignited a resolve among artists, writers, scholars, filmmakers, theatre artistes and cultural activists to resist all forces that threaten the right to freedom of creative expression.

Thirty years later, the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat), created in his memory, continues to be a platform for creative expression that resists communal forces and conducts a Safdar Memorial on the eve of his death anniversary each year at which Sahmat gets together a number of Safdar's associates to perform short creative works.

This year's performance, members of Sahmat feel, will be extremely important as it is being organised in an atmosphere which is reminiscent of the days when Sahmat commenced its activities.

""Ironically enough, we once again seem to be entering a phase of politics when a section is trying to assert the narrow majoritarian view of India's society and culture. Once again there is talk of rewriting history textbooks, and reviving the pernicious ideology of cultural nationalism,"" said members of Sahmat, while talking about the upcoming Safdar memorial performance.

Safdar's brother Sohail Hashmi says, ""It is very important in a democratic society to have creative freedom. You cannot have curbs on creative freedom. The stronger the forces that undermine and attack democracy grow, the greater is the need for a collective of creative people to come up and expand.""

He says that Sahmat has tried over the past 30 years to retain the aspect of creative freedom in a democratic society.

Fighting communalism, Mr. Sohail says, at one level has become rhetoric but to fight the insidious way in which divisive ideologies penetrate the minds of the people, we need culture.

""Over the past 30 years, Sahmat has been able to show how many interventions are possible. The materials we have published have been used by people all over the country who want to show resistance to communal forces,"" says Mr. Sohail.

Recalling the impact Safdar's murder, Mr. Sohail says, ""On January 3, 1989, we brought his body to the CPI(M) party office at Vithalbhai Patel Road. The crowd present there that morning was huge. By afternoon, the funeral procession started moving towards the electric crematorium at Nigambodh Ghat. Writers, poets, film-makers, musicians and several artists walked the distance and were joined by thousands of people who perhaps did not know Safdar but were there to register their protest against communal forces.""

He said Safadar's theatre group Janam went back on January 4, 1989, and completed the performance of Halla Bol, the play that was interrupted earlier.

Sahmat member Rajendra Prasad says what is remarkable is that for 30 years Sahmat has managed to keep artistes united in their fight for creative freedom. He adds that these artistes have over three decades used their work to highlight several important figures in India's freedom struggle and other secular forces in the country's history who spoke for inclusion.

Apart from various performances as well as screening of a film on Safdar, the event will also host an exhibition to commemorate Mahatma Gandhi's 150's birth anniversary. A pack of 100 postcards with prints of Gandhiji by well-known artists will be released.

""Sahmat also plans to release a calendar to commemorate 100 years of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, an event that changed the direction of the freedom struggle,"" he says."

The inception of the Indian History Congress (IHC) can be traced to the efforts of scholars working on India's ancient past as well as modern history, in a bid to counter the colonial claims, while also drawing from Western analytical methods. The Bharata Itihasa Samshodhaka Mandala (BISM) was one such effort that owed its origins to the stalwart Vishwanath Kashinath Rajwade. He founded this institution in 1910 in Pune with the support of K C Mehendale. Another major institution was the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute founded in 1917 by R G Bhandarkar. The first All India Oriental Conference in November 1919 in Pune under the Bhandarkar Institute's auspices focused exclusively on ancient Indian history.

The BISM organised an All India Congress in 1935 to celebrate its silver jubilee. The event organised in the assembly hall of Parasurambhau College, Pune, was a resounding success. The Indian History Congress (IHC) was thus born with about 50 delegates. In his presidential address, the eminent scholar from Allahabad, Shafaat Ahmad Khan outlined the IHC's role. It was to be an academy that regulated the standard of works of history produced in India and would promote impartial and substantive history. This commitment to a fair and scientific history, devoid of bias and politics, has remained the hallmark of the Congress.

Over its 83 years of existence, the IHC has faced a variety of challenges, ranging from the initial efforts at devising an institutional structure to financial dependence on government funding as well as occasional political interference. The decade after its formation was fraught with political instability caused by World War II and the new turn in the Indian freedom struggle. The next two decades were perhaps the toughest given the post-Independence challenges -- dearth of funds and lack of membership led, at times, to the IHC's presidents saying that the body might not remain viable as an institution. However, from the 1970s, the Congress appeared to have attained a visible status as the premier body of historians across the country.

The post-Independence period was also the time when the IHC began to challenge the nature of public historical debates in India. It passed significant resolutions regarding the protection of monuments of historical importance and the role the government and Archaeological Survey of India should play in their preservation. In fact, in 1946, it petitioned the government to allow researchers access to archives. Later, in 1977, the IHC cautioned against the use of communal rhetoric in public life and the dangers of political appropriation of monuments. The IHC also began to engage with the history taught in schools and colleges. In 1948, it resolved to contribute to the syllabi in universities and colleges across the country. Decades later, the efforts to rewrite history textbooks from sectarian and communal viewpoints were debated at the 53rd session at Warrangal and the 62nd session at Bhopal. The 'Proceedings of the Indian History Congress' have been published annually without any break, a rare achievement for any independent professional body.

It was with a justifiable sense of pride, and much expectation, that the proposal of the vice-chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) to host the 79th Session of the IHC was accepted by the executive committee in December 2017 -- Pune is the institution's birthplace. This year, the number of scholars who had taken or renewed their membership from Maharashtra alone numbered around 400; about 1,200 delegates were expected. A large number of people had paid the local delegate fee, made travel arrangements and spent considerable effort in researching and writing their papers to be presented at the Congress. However, on December 12, the SPPU announced that it was calling off the event with insensitivity towards the losses and inconvenience suffered by delegates, both from home and abroad. The subsequent misinformation and contrary statements by functionaries of the university only added insult to injury. This is unprecedented in the annals of the IHC. The only times when sessions were not held were in times of national exegencies -- 1942, 1962 and 1971.

The three-day Congress in Pune was to have been inaugurated yesterday. We hope the SPPU and Maharashtra's economy prosper enough for it to host the session in the not-so-distant future, as the ostensible reason for calling off the IHC was the lack of finances. The IHC's 79th session will definitely be held, at a later date and at a different venue."

""My music is an extension of my thoughts and beliefs. When people hear my music, they should know what my principles are,"" says Ricky Kej, a Bengaluru-based music composer who brought home the Grammy in 2015 for his album Winds of Samsara, that is dedicated to environmental consciousness. Though the musician has visited Andhra Pradesh multiple times, this is his first visit after being appointed as the celebrity UNICEF supporter for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in December this year.

Ricky recently performed at the Visakha Utsav and enthralled the audience on the first day of the festival at RK Beach. Apart from Winds of Samsara, the musician also performed the song One With Earth, a composition that he says was inspired by the farmers of Araku Valley.

Earlier in July, Ricky toured tribal hamlets in the State for over two weeks. The 37-year-old studied traditional farming techniques and composed One With Earth. The song highlights the importance of natural farming and the need to give up chemical fertilizers. It also features a melodious blend of English lyrics and the tribal dialect.

Speaking of the song that was launched at the United Nations Assembly after the Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu's address about natural farming, Ricky explained, ""I lived with the tribals in Araku Valley and tried to understand their lifestyle. The song is not just about natural farming but also about their simple lifestyle. For composing the song, along with modern instruments I also used the traditional instruments they play to that add a local flavour.""

The idea for the song also came from Andhra Pradesh government's ambitious plan to scale-up the practice of Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) and spread it to over six million farmers of the State by 2024.

Ricky is known internationally for taking a stand about the environment and making music about the threat to Nature. He has released albums like Shanti Samsara, Winds of Samsara and Earth love, which are all about the world and the urgency to save it from destruction. It is not just about making music for Ricky. He has worked closely with the governments of several states to teach students about sustainability through his songs. A collection of 27 songs called My Earth Songs is an endeavour to familiarise school children with sustainable lifestyle and the urgent need to embrace it. The songs are included as part of their English textbooks. ""The textbooks also have a QR code. Scanning this with a smartphone will lead the user to the songs,"" he says.

Ricky is currently translating these songs in Telugu which will be a part of the school textbooks in Andhra Pradesh for the academic year 2020."

He says the macro research may not have changed in academic world but in policy world there are sure changes.

Has economics changed since the crisis? As usual, the answer is: It depends. If we look at the macroeconomic theory of PhD programs and top journals, the answer is clearly, no. Macroeconomic theory remains the same self-contained, abstract art form that it has been for the past twenty-five years. But despite its hegemony over the peak institutions of academic economics, this mainstream is not the only mainstream. The economics of the mainstream policy world (central bankers, Treasury staffers, Financial Times editorialists), only intermittently attentive to the journals in the best times, has gone its own way; the pieties of a decade ago have much less of a hold today. And within the elite academic world, there's plenty of empirical work that responds to the developments of the past ten years, even if it doesn't -- yet -- add up to any alternative vision.

For a socialist, it's probably a mistake to see economists primarily as either carriers of valuable technical expertise or systematic expositors of capitalist ideology. They are participants in public debates just like anyone else. The profession as the whole is more often found trailing after political developments than advancing them.

......

Many critics were disappointed the crisis of a 2008 did not lead to an intellectual revolution on the scale of the 1930s. It's true that it didn't. But the image of stasis you'd get from looking at the top journals and textbooks isn't the whole picture -- the most interesting conversations are happening somewhere else. For a generation, leftists in economics have struggled to change the profession, some by launching attacks (often well aimed, but ignored) from the outside, others by trying to make radical ideas parsable in the orthodox language. One lesson of the past decade is that both groups got it backward.

Keynes famously wrote that ""Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist."" It's a good line. But in recent years the relationship seems to have been more the other way round. If we want to change the economics profession, we need to start changing the world. Economics will follow.

Hmm..

This line- the image of stasis you'd get from looking at the top journals and textbooks isn't the whole picture, the most interesting conversations are happening somewhere else - is quite true. You get far more ideas reading newspapers and blogs (most of which ironically are written by top academicians) than reading journals and textbooks.."

He was an exceptional child as he was born blind in a poorest family in 1991. The monthly earnings of his family was only Rs 2000.

Srikanth's parents were advised to kill him after his birth but destiny had some other plans for him. He suffered humiliation while he was growing. Villagers shunned him and denied him higher education. His family was dependent on farming. After his matriculation, he pursued science in his 10+2 but was not permitted to do so. It was then Bolla filed a case and after a six-month wait, he was allowed to pursue science at his own risk. Bolla topped his class with a 98% on his XII board exams. He was denied admission to coaching institutes for Indian Institute of Technology, where he aimed to study engineering. It all because he was blind.

He challenged the education system and studied by getting textbooks converted into audio books. He really worked hard and it was his determination that took him to study overseas. He became the first international blind student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, USA.

He got many offers from big US' corporate companies but he wanted to do something innovative in his own country. He returned to India and started Hyderabad-based Bollant Industries in 2012. His company manufactures eco-friendly packaging solutions and provides employment to several hundred people with disabilities, with funding from Ratan Tata. Its current worth is approximately INR 50 Crores.

In April 2017, Bolla was named by Forbes magazine in its list of 30 under 30 across all of Asia, one of only three Indians in that list. Disability never stopped Bolla from dreaming. He won the world on his own terms!"

Director: Rohit Shetty

Cast: Ranveer Singh, Sara Ali Khan

Read excerpts from reviews of Simmba here:

Simmba falters badly when it tries to be a meaningful social drama with a message that rings out as loud as the background score... Ranveer Singh's energy and flamboyance ensure that Simmba appears more engaging than it often is, and Ajay Devgn's well-timed cameo rescues the film from being a write-off. Simbba is all about its male movie stars. Sara Ali Khan has fewer scenes than some of the other characters, including Siddharth Jadhav as a member of Simmba's posse. The movie has no use for her Shagun - so much for being on the side of women. Nandini Ramnath, Scroll

Singh's an easy choice to play Simmba. Grinning sheepishly from under his whiskers, he completes the small town cop with just the right accent. That he has a winning comic timing helps a lot but even when the film takes a preachy turn, he hangs in there and ensures his character responds to the situations as earnestly as possible... It's not a film that will encourage one to rethink fundamental theories or alter societal thought, even though it aspires to be at one point. But it's surely a masala entertainer that packs in laughs, drama, dishooms and a lot more -- now that's more than you can expect for a multiplex ticket. Kunal Guha, Mumbai Mirror

Like most rape-and-revenge melodramas, Simmba uses the heinous crime as a dishonest hash-tag; it is designed to exploit the current mood of a nation that often lets movies be its moral science textbooks... The most disheartening part about Simmba is its bipolar pursuit of relevance. The setup was the film; there was no need to embrace the guileless-sermon path. Just letting Singh play the fool, without hindrance, might have finally lent credence to the Rohit Shetty School of non-storytelling. A goofy, lighthearted spoof - or at least a lighter sense of self-importance - might have sufficed. I will perhaps never understand the obsession of mainstream filmmakers to pack as many genres as possible into a single movie. The shift in tone is almost always jarring. Rahul Desai, Film Companion

The year began on a positive note with the government promising to draft non-governmental organisations and corporate houses into helping upgrade facilities in its schools. It maintained the momentum with a promise to enable 381 schools with wi-fi in March.

The introduction of QR codes in textbooks under the new syllabus was a hit with students who enjoyed the freedom of learning at their own pace.

The low point was when School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan announced at a meeting in December that the government was considering curtailing the syllabus as teachers were finding it difficult to complete. Incidentally, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has also suggested a reduction in the NCERT syllabus for Central Board of Secondary Education schools.

Though no final decision has been made yet, educationists wonder if all the good work done over the last two years will come undone if the State and Centre decide against the continuation of the present syllabus. It was not a great year though for higher education. Vice-chancellor appointments in State universities generated a lot of controversy with political parties venting their displeasure.

Corruption, allegations of favours to students in exchange for being pliant, searches by the Directorate of Anti-Vigilance and Corruption officials in houses and offices of V-Cs made headlines.

In February, the DVAC trapped Bharathiar University V-C A. Ganapathy, rendering the institute headless. In March, Anna University's former V-C M. Rajaram faced charges of corruption in the recruitment of teachers. The University was in the eye of the storm with several officials being accused of taking money and helping students pass exams.

In April, a scandal rocked the State with the leak of audio tapes of a college teacher urging students to do as expected by ""higher officials of the Madurai Kamaraj University"" in return for higher marks in their semester examinations, money and admission to higher-level courses in the university.

Political parties continued to target Governor-Chancellor Banwarilal Purohit and alleged that he had received favours in return for appointments. They objected to the appointment of candidates from other States as Vice-Chancellors to Dr. Ambedkar Law University and Anna University.

The situation became tense with MKU V-C P.P. Chellathurai seeking legal intervention. In June, the court threw out his appointment, leaving the University without a V-C, in less than a year since his appointment.

The situation has improved with the V-C search committee finalising a list of 10 persons for the post. In a couple of days the Governor is expected to announce a new V-C for MKU."

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Dr. Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday said that the country needs a renaissance and that proper knowledge of the past coupled with a balance between economic growth and sentiments was important for a new India.

Dr. Swamy who was talking on 'The Idea of a New India: socio-economic perspective', at an event organised by the Hindu Navavarsha Swagat Samiti in Prabhadevi also said that building a Ram temple is the fundamental right of believers.

Stressing on the importance of the past, Mr. Swamy said that new history textbooks were the need of the hour. ""For a new India, we need to have proper knowledge about before the Independence. The present textbooks, which were written by Britishers, have ignored several key facts. There is no evidence of Aryans and Dravidians. Indians have the same DNA and one race.

Mr. Swamy further said that everything from the past must not be followed blindly. He took a dig at Jawaharlal Nehru for Article 370, which gives autonomous status to Jammu and Kashmir, and called for it to be scrapped for a united India. ""Nehru played no role in the making of the Constitution. All he did was included Article 370. This article needs to go for unity of the country,"" the Rajya Sabha MP said.

Commenting on a balance between economic growth and sentiment, Dr. Swamy called for abolishing of income tax for battling corruption. ""The middle class is the worst target of taxation. Abolishing income tax will increase investments and reduce corruption. As an alternative, auction of natural resources can bring more money than income tax,"" he said, while adding that India must utilise its resources appropriately to bring back ₹120 lakh crore of black money accumulated abroad.

Asking Indians to stop imitating the West, he said that Sanskrit needs to be revived as a means of inter-State communication. ""It is our pride. In several parts of the world people are trying to learn the language and we have been ignoring it,"" he said.

The BJP leader also said that the Ram temple is a matter of India's faith. ""Islamic invaders have destructed as many as 40,000 temples. All we are asking for are three temples, including the one at Ayodhya. A masjid can be demolished as namaz can be read anywhere.

In the bureaucratic reshuffle that was carried out by the Ashok Gehlot government last week, were those in charge of education touched? Rajasthan has, over the last four years, become a symbol of ""New India'', both in its changes in school curriculum and in the number of lynching incidents it has seen (seven since 2015).

In May 2016, when Jawaharlal Nehru's name was dropped from Class VIII textbooks in the state, both as our first prime minister and as a prominent leader of our freedom struggle, Gehlot and Sachin Pilot were quick to lash out at Vasundhara Raje's government.

But criticising is easy. Actually undoing what you decry while in the Opposition, requires political will and hard work. Add to that the Congress' apathy towards ideological issues such as the content of school education. So, in 2004, then HRD minister, Arjun Singh, took his own sweet time to change the NCERT texts introduced by his predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi, an RSS member.

These texts taught impressionable teenagers that Muslims sided with the British and barely contributed to the freedom struggle. However, in one CBSE school in Mumbai, the history teacher actually contradicted the text to tell her students that all communities contributed to the freedom struggle. But there may not be too many such teachers in Rajasthan. A recent report in the New York Review of Books quotes a Bohra Muslim teacher in Udaipur dismissing the Mughal-era in class, going along with the new history textbook.

Advertising

Hopefully, it will not take Gehlot and Pilot that long to withdraw these texts. The inconvenience caused by changing textbooks in the middle of the academic year would be far less damaging to students than the lies they are being forced to study. Even one more term to let school children learn that Maharana Pratap defeated Akbar at Haldighati; pre-Independence Congress leaders had no connect with the people; and how Nehru was just a footnote in our history, is one term too long.

In 2004, it was at the end of the academic year that the Sonia Gandhi-led UPA defeated the Vajpayee-led NDA, presenting the ideal opportunity to change school texts. Yet, Arjun Singh used the excuse that sufficient stocks of current texts were already there, to not effect an immediate change.

The same lethargy towards righting what is obviously wrong with Rajasthan's police, was on display in l'affaire Naseeruddin Shah. The organisers of the Ajmer Lit Fest said they had alerted the police. Yet, goons could enter the venue and throw ink on the actor's picture. Instead of caving in after that and telling Shah not to come, why couldn't the organisers have delayed the proceedings till the cops removed these vandals from the venue and provided security for the rest of the day? In this Twitter age, surely the CM and deputy CM could have been alerted immediately?

We don't know the entire story. What we do know is that the Hindutva goons had their way, with the knowledge of the police. The change in regime didn't seem to matter to either them or the police. Mumbaikars are familiar with this behaviour: Whoever rules Maharashtra, no policeman touches the Thackerays. The next day, five BJP workers were arrested in Ajmer, but under preventive detention, a law normally used before someone commits a crime.

This year, Rajasthan was ranked number three by Amnesty International in their state-wise hate crime list. The lynching of dairy farmer Pehlu Khan and the hacking of Bengali labourer Muhammad Afrazul -- incidents which shook us all -- took place in Rajasthan. The police exonerated all six named by Pehlu Khan in his dying declaration, and booked his two companions for cow smuggling. Did any of this matter when the new government transferred 17 IPS officers last week, including its senior most police officer?

Two days after being appointed Deputy CM, Pilot told a news portal that the ""atmosphere of mob lynching and cow vigilantism has to be curbed immediately... (it's) important to give people a semblance of normalcy and brotherhood in society that we have always had.'' To achieve this, changing the police is important; but equally important is changing textbooks."

The course also includes ICT (or information and communications technology) tools such as how to create animation storyboards or audio-visual recordings, how to track a learner's performance online, etc, to help teachers improve their chemistry training methods.

In all, over 2,300 teachers have signed up for the free, online course that ends in February. ""Before this, teachers used to attend offline refresher courses but many times, they could not find time or could not get leave for the same,"" says Vimal Rarh, chemistry faculty and coordinator for the NRCC.

Besides the sciences, refresher courses in business and commerce are also finding takers. Earlier this month, Khyati Vora completed a 21-day on-site refresher course in business management from Bhagat Phool Singh Mahila Vishwavidyalaya in Haryana, a state university recognised by the UGC. Vora, who has been teaching an introduction to business and management course at the BCom level at the Hinduja college in Mumbai for a decade, says she wanted to know more about how business management works differently in areas such as e-commerce and startups.

The course covered topics such as agro-tourism management, social media marketing and contemporary issues in the field of intellectual property rights. ""The case studies were fascinating,"" Vora says. ""Even though commerce textbooks are revised periodically, they have barely any case studies. Here, the speakers shared real-world stories and that really makes sense for someone teaching IT and business management.""

Fellowships are also becoming an important gateway for professors to enhance their research and connect with a global community of experts in their field. Chirantan Chatterjee, associate professor of business policy and economics at the Indian Institute of Management - Ahmedabad is currently on the year-long National Fellows programme at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.

""Since a fellowship lasts a full year rather than a week or a summer, it is even more satisfying and rewarding,"" he says. ""It's also gratifying to be a student again and learn where the latest in research has moved, given that I finished my PhD at Carnegie Mellon in 2011, and it's gratifying to contribute to the discussion as well."""

","Hindustan Times",FALSE,"Anuradha Mandlik's memories of learning maths don't include textbooks or class tests. Instead, she remembers going to a playground and her father using that space to explain how land is measured. In 2002, Mandlik's father Ajit decided to take her out of school and homeschool her. Fifteen years later, Mandlik made history when she became possibly the first student in Maharashtra to have passed board exams without attending school.

Homeschooling means teaching a child at home instead of enrolling them in school. The option is gaining popularity with parents in Maharashtra after the success of homeschooled students like Mandlik and Malvika Joshi, who in 2016 was awarded a scholarship from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) despite not having taken any board exams.

As per current regulations, students must pass at least Class V to appear for board exams as a private candidate. In 2017, Maharashtra's education department announced an open schooling system, which is expected to be in place by June 2019.

This would allow students appear for Class V, VIII, X and XII exams even if they have not attended school.

""Once the state starts open schooling, more parents are likely to opt for homeschooling as it would allow students to appear for periodic exams without going to school,"" said Jayant Jain, president of Forum for Fairness in Education, a city-based organisation that has identified parents with homeschooling experience who can mentor others interested in educating their children at home.

""When I took the step, most people were not convinced about the concept as they thought that not sending their children to school would mean missing out on a lot of things, from academic growth to socialisation. But if you see my daughter now, she is way smarter than most students her age,"" said Ajit Mandlik.

While there are teaching kits available online, support groups like Swashikshan, a pan-Indian community of homeschoolers, are also becoming important resources. In high demand are those who have successfully homeschooled their children.

Joshi's mother Supriya said, ""I used to get 15-20 calls a day from parents across the country. They were all interested in knowing my story and wanted to know if they too can take the step. While I do answer all such queries even now, I often caution parents that homeschooling does not have a set formula. What worked for me might not work for everyone.""

Psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada said it's important to plan this transition.

""Right now, parents who are successfully doing it, are really spending a lot of time in planning it well. But if this becomes a mass trend, not all parents can ensure that the child gets exposed to all round development. One needs to understand that a school teaches a child a lot more than academics,"" he said.

""Many parents often follow the syllabus of a particular board, which turns out to be a big mistake. The whole idea behind homeschooling is to eliminate the structures of knowledge,"" said Hemali Gada, a Malad-based entrepreneur who took her daughter Dhwani out of school at Class VI and has been homeschooling her ever since. Dhwani said in school the teachers only taught what was there in the textbook but homeschooling offers more flexibility.

One concern with homeschooling is that a child may become isolated from their age group. Experienced homeschoolers encourage parents to get their children to participate in activities like sports and music to help them develop a circle of friends. ""My daughter used to go to a music class since she was very young. We would often take her to various sporting events across the city and she had friends in the neighbourhood. Hence, she never really felt that she was alone,"" said Ajit.

Another worry is that homeschooled students may struggle to transition to a formal education system later.

For Mandlik, who now studies in Class XII at SNDT College in Churchgate, this didn't pose a problem.

""Even though I didn't go to school, through my friends I knew what the school atmosphere is. That helped me cope with the changes that happened as I entered college.""

She said that she was only nervous about exams. ""As a homeschooled student, I was not used to facing exams. But after the first exam went well, my anxiety went away.""

Dhwani thinks homeschooling is giving her a more well-rounded education.

""When I used to go to school, students would only talk about studies or related things and lacked a worldview. A few months into homeschooling, I met a lot of children my age who might not be 'academically brilliant' but who could talk about books, art, culture etc,"" Dhwani said."

HYDERABAD: Satabdi Misra and Akshaya Routaray are on a mission to bring more books to the people. On their second pan-Indian tour, they will be travelling across 20 states and 30 cities in a bookmobile to make books more accessible and affordable for every person. Hyderabad was their 6th stop as part of this tour. Their poetry van, which was stationed in Phoenix Arena on Monday, featured hand-picked collection of around 500 titles. This featured English poetry, feminist poets, poetry for children and poetry in regional languages.

The van functioned primarily as a library wherein visitors could browse through any book. They could also purchase the books, the proceeds from which would help to fund the tour. There was an open mic event held alongside which provided an opportunity for reading poetry and dialogue. Visitors were of all ages and from diverse areas: from Bangladesh to Nagole! Srikanth Palwar, an IT professional, spoke about the need for such platforms. ""Today's universities are no more the spaces they used to be. There is no space for open discussions,"" Palwar said.

Satabdi Misra also expressed similar concerns about the Indian education system. She said, ""Schools these day only have academic libraries. There is no focus on fiction, non-fiction or storybooks. By limiting access to such content, we kill the imagination and creativity of young children."" Even textbooks when provided are not used properly, thus access does not translate into interest.

It is to address such concerns that they started their venture, Walking Bookfairs, in Bhubaneswar. It is an independent bookstore, library, publisher and a travelling library and bookstore. Misra further said, ""We are asked standard questions like: How do you sustain? Do you break even? But we don't do this for profit."" Their initiative is a step towards creating a more open and inclusive society. Books and poetry, they believe, are the solutions to these problems. If more people's interests could be addressed by making books more accessible, society can progress."

Deb likened communists to the Mughals and the British rulers, who he said had unsuccessfully tried to destroy Indian culture, IANS reported.

After the conference, Deb wrote on Twitter that he had spoken about ""how in order to promote their Communist ideology, the Left parties over the years systematically removed rich and real history of our motherland from educational curriculum"".

Actor Naseeruddin Shah has been under attack from Hindu right-wingers ever since he said last week that the UP government gives more importance to the death of a cow than the murder of a police officer. In a reference to the incidents of mob lynchings, the actor said he felt anxious for his children ""because tomorrow if a mob surrounds them and asks 'are you a Hindu or a Muslim', they will have no answer"". Last week, organisers of the Ajmer Literature Festival cancelled his programmes after members of the BJP Yuva Morcha threatened protests against his participation. Hindutva trolls and BJP supporters like Anupam Kher, Shah's colleague in the film fraternity, have criticised Shah for his comments; the UP BJP chief Mahendranath Pandey said Shah, a good actor, has begun to resemble the character of a Pakistani agent he played in the film, Sarfarosh. This volley of tasteless comments and threats is outrageous. Shah is a national treasure. Moreover, what he said is not exceptional: Many others have echoed the same sentiment about cow vigilantism in UP and the government's refusal to act against the vigilantes.

That a literature festival in Ajmer, a great centre of Indic spiritual syncretism, hastened to cancel Shah's talk and the launch of his book, is a reflection of the polarised climate, especially in Rajasthan. In the past few years, the state has seen several communal mobilisations against religious minorities and liberals. There have been at least three incidents of lynching in Alwar alone -- the first was Pehlu Khan's murder by a mob that accused him of being a cow smuggler in 2017. Mob sentiment was whipped up during the making and release of the Sanjay Leela Bhansali film, Padmaavat, and the government played along. Instead of upholding the law and the constitutional right to free speech, the Vasundhara Raje government tried to stall the release of the film. The vigilantes did not spare even contemporary art -- the 2015 Jaipur Art Summit had to take down the installation of a plastic cow following protests. In all these incidents, the administration, including the police, was seen to stand more with the vigilante groups rather than their victims. The government's own initiatives to sponsor the rewriting of textbooks according to majoritarian notions of the past only helped illiberal voices to gain influence.

One of the new government's foremost challenges is to reset the norms of public discourse and protect the space for dissent in Rajasthan. Immediately after the Ajmer incident, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted that his ""administration was fully prepared to hold the festival peacefully"" and that it respects the rights and liberties of all citizens. Clearly, Gehlot's administration needs to do more to convince people that it will not let thugs and mobs dictate the terms of debate. India was once a favoured destination for artists who felt stifled or discriminated in their home country -- legendary classical musician Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, for instance, left his home in Pakistan for India to pursue his art. It cannot allow the mob to run roughshod over artistic freedoms now."

Jashn-e-Rekhta, an organisation dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the Urdu language, its literature and culture, recently concluded its 5th edition in Delhi last week. Jashn-e-Rekhta, which literally means 'the festival of Urdu', has been extremely successful in attracting huge audiences to its events built around Urdu. The popularity of the event has led to the establishment of another organization, Rang-e-Rekhta, curated by the Rekhta Foundation, which takes the success of Urdu to other cities. So far it has held three events in Chandigarh, Jaipur and Gurugram.

This apparent success of Urdu also raises an important question about the de facto status of Urdu in India. Scholarly studies show that Urdu has suffered marginalisation and that its social landscape is shrinking. Against this backdrop, many claim that the success of Jashn marks the revival of the Urdu language and literature. For instance, the Bollywood artist Javed Jaffrey said: ""Urdu khatre mein nahin hai, Urdu to qatre qatre mein hai (Urdu is not in danger; Urdu is actually in every drop)."" This pithy line received a round of applause from the audience. Tanweer Ahmad of the Urdu Qaumi Awaz made it into a headline.

Similar claims were made at the end of the 2017 Jashn festival. Malini Nayar of the Times of India dismissed the idea that Urdu was dying. She too echoed the jubilation and enthusiasm about Urdu's revival with her headline, 'Urdu language is not only alive but rocking.' Urdu newspapers followed suit. The Siasat Daily published a report on the role of Jashn in reviving Urdu with the headline, 'Jashn-e-Rekhta has proved that Urdu is not only alive but is creating waves'. Twitter resonated with the excitement of revival too.

Such views about its 'revival' and 'resurgence' overlook the ground reality that Urdu is actually in sharp decline in North India, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, considered its traditional strongholds. Clearly, if there is a revival, it will mean that the young generation, who will be the carriers of the language, is learning it. The attendance at a Jashn festival or a mushaira or a qawwali is not an indicator of the revival of a language.

Sudha Pai, a scholar of political science, notes that other than the two Urdu medium schools run by Aligarh Muslim University, there is not one single primary or junior high school in the whole of UP where Urdu is fully the medium of instruction . The symbolic second language status accorded to Urdu by the UP government has not arrested its decline either. The recommendations of Gujral Committee (1975), the Ale Ahmad Suroor Committee (1979), and the Ali Sardar Jafri Committee (1990) to revive and popularise Urdu have never been implemented.

The situation of Urdu teaching in Delhi is no less gloomy. As per an RTI filed in 2013, a whopping 73% of posts for Urdu teachers within Delhi government schools are vacant. This despite the fact that Urdu has been granted the second official language status in Delhi. Furthermore, 74 out of 80 textbooks needed in Urdu schools were not available in the market. The result was an abnormally high failure rate in Urdu schools in Delhi.

For the claim of Urdu revival to be true, it follows that the young generation has the opportunity to learn its script as well. This point was stressed by Gulzar, the legendary Bollywood figure in the 2017 Rekhta festival. A declining proficiency in the Urdu script can be seen in the mushrooming of Urdu books transliterated into Devanagari found in Urdu Bazar, Old Delhi. Urdu in Devanagari has emerged as a response to the lack of proficiency in the script among the younger generation of speakers in Delhi and UP.

Another indicator of its decline in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi is the loss of the pronunciation of Urdu sounds, especially /kh̲/,/gh̲/, and /q/, as in kh̲uda (God) gh̲alat (wrong) and qalam (pen) respectively. Considered the shibboleths of Urdu as a language, the young generation is increasingly non-observant of these sounds. The decline interestingly is also visible in the pronunciation of words in Bollywood songs; the new generation of singers pronounce words containing these sounds using the Hindi pronunciation norms.

So what does the success of Jashn festival actually mean? In my view, it says little about the 'health' of the language and more about the marketing of the event. First of all, utilising the linkages between Urdu and popular culture, they have successfully galvanised Bollywood celebrities to promote it. Not all the Bollywood stars who have graced the Jashn are stars of Urdu language and literature. But they are all big crowd pullers.

Secondly, on the socio-political front, Urdu is no longer a force to reckon with as it has lost its battle for survival in North India. Such events are, therefore, aimed at the elite - especially the English educated ones. The first few editions did not have the Jashn-e-Rekhta written in Urdu. The recent ones did include the Urdu script. However, the schedules were available only in English. The big 'I LOVE URDU' cut-out where the youth were seen taking pictures was only in English. Both speak volumes about the targeted audience.

The English-speaking elite, however, has not embraced Urdu as it is. This elite has a romanticised and orientalised view of the language of love, beauty, politeness, tahzeeb and romance. Contrary to this, for its traditional speakers, Urdu is a world of myriad lived experiences which include, but are not limited to, love, romance and politeness. For them, Urdu is as much about love (mohabbat) as it is about revolt and revolution (inqilab). The new admirers of Urdu may not know that Urdu has some of the strongest expletives as well.

The success of Jashn-e-Rekhta, then, seems to be analogous to the popularity of sarson ka saag and makke ki roti in elite hotels and restaurants where the dish is an exotica - an occasional item on the menu rather than a lived experience of a villager. For the non-Urdu elites, it is more a matter of yaadgaar - something memorable, butwhich also means an old building - than a matter of rozgaar, or employment."

I'm an American journalist who lives in Beijing, but I just happened to be visiting South Korea when news broke that Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co., had been arrested in Canada on Dec. 1. She was detained at the behest of the US for allegedly misleading financial institutions about the company's Iran business, causing them to violate US sanctions. I called my wife, who works in the Chinese capital too, and joked about this ominous turn in Chinese-American relations: ""Maybe it's safer not to go back.""

The quip turned out not to be very funny after I did return. Within days, Chinese authorities scooped up two Canadian citizens who, despite Beijing's denials, were soon seen by the outside world as pawns in China's attempts to extract Meng from Canadian -- and potential US -- custody. In Vancouver, Meng received a public hearing in an independent court. That's in contrast to China, where it's still unclear why the Canadians were detained and where, more fundamentally, law can be contravened by power and judges are instruments of the Communist Party. Even foreign nationals can vanish into prison cells. For now, the detention of Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat who works for a policy think tank, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, have made expatriate Americans like me worry how much we're at Beijing's mercy. In a similar way, Chinese businessmen saw Meng's arrest as a disincentive to traveling to and investing in the US.

The detentions are the most frightening development yet taken in the widening confrontation between the US and China. What started as a scuffle over tariffs and trade balances, then expanded into a battle for control of future technologies, may be degenerating into an intimate war against each other's people. That makes it directly personal in a way trade and tariffs weren't.

In a remarkable comment when asked on CNBC if a senior US tech executive should be in China right now, Leland Miller, chief executive officer of research firm China Beige Book, said, ""I would not. Too much risk."" According to Reuters, the US department of state is considering issuing a travel warning to Americans about visiting China. ""Now the US and Canadian executives could be a bit nervous traveling to China,"" one Chinese newspaper editor tweeted in the wake of the Meng arrest, ""and even more so for Chinese executives traveling to the US and Canada.""

Is this how far we've fallen? The sad irony is that this ugly saga is unfolding as China celebrates the 40th anniversary of its embrace of the world. It was in December 1978 that paramount leader Deng Xiaoping told party members to ""emancipate the mind"" -- to break with Maoist orthodoxy and revel in fresh thinking to help the nation. That launched his country's capitalist reforms, a central pillar of which was ""opening up"" to end China's poverty-creating isolation and integrate with the global economy. In flowed the capital and technology that contributed to China's economic miracle and built the nation into the superpower it is today.

An often underappreciated aspect of that great integration is the people. Foreigners played an unheralded role in rebuilding China's economy and fortunes. We tend to think of ""intellectual property"" as proprietary software code or secret cola recipes, but it's more than that. It's also the know-how about running modern factories or managing money that countless expatriate executives from the US and around the world imported into China for industries from automobiles to fast food. And there's been a return for that: The riches amassed by the Chinese are being spent on Buicks and Starbucks lattes and filling hotels from Times Square to Walt Disney World.

In the decades since China's opening, Americans and Chinese have for the most part been able to set aside the vast divergence in their political systems to find common ground that their governments sometimes haven't. For Americans, the fascination with the fabulous Middle Kingdom is a modern extension of the wonderment Marco Polo first sparked in the 14th century with tales of great ""Cathay."" China was, and is, a fairytale land of imperial palaces, untold riches, and limitless opportunity. For Chinese, the US remains something of the old ""city on the hill,"" whose lights may have dimmed a bit but is still a beacon of freedom and hope. That's why more than 360,000 Chinese students were enrolled in US universities in the last academic year, the most from any country and a record for China. I myself have become an avid student of Chinese history and philosophy since relocating to Beijing seven years ago.

Now we have to worry that those doors are closing. The Trump administration has started restricting visas for certain Chinese students, fearing they'll steal US technology, and he supposedly considered an outright ban. China's government doesn't go out of its way to encourage its citizens to visit anyway. Beijing's embassy in Washington issued a warning for Chinese travelers this year about the frequent shootings and expensive health care in the US.

China isn't rolling out the red carpet for foreigners, either. Officials sometimes run campaigns with videos and posters warning locals of foreign ""spies."" Although policymakers profess to be wooing foreign talent to China's tech sectors, in practice they're scaring people off. The government in 2019 will increase the tax burden on some foreign residents, rendering the country, with its toxic air and rising costs, an even less attractive place to live. In a 2018 survey of US businessmen by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, a staggering three out of four said they feel increasingly unwelcome in the country. That's due in part to their belief that Chinese regulators do not treat them on equal terms with their domestic rivals. Beijing can also be quick to penalize foreign companies that run afoul of its political sensitivities. Earlier this year, authorities ordered Marriott International to shut down its website in the country after the hotel operator distributed a questionnaire listing Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Tibet as independent countries. (Beijing sees all of them as part of China.)

Perhaps shifting politics in the two countries made such antiforeign sentiment inevitable. In China, a surveillance-obsessed police state has intensified efforts to snuff out any civic action or alternative thinking -- dangerous foreign ideals included. President Xi Jinping's government launched a campaign against ""western values"" and purged foreign content from school textbooks. He'd prefer that educators teach Chinese literature and morality -- or better yet, Communist Party ideology -- that the regime considers more appropriate. The ""opening up"" so core to Deng and China's success has become more rhetoric than reality as an increasingly nationalist government has stalled market reforms in favor of statist programs to develop Chinese champions. In a closely watched Dec. 18 speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of reform, Xi struck a defiant tone, saying no one can dictate to the country. Meanwhile, Trump's ""America First"" mantra paints China as a technology-swindling, job-stealing threat to US national security and economic primacy. In addition to trade-restricting tariffs, Washington has introduced more stringent controls on foreign investment -- a move clearly designed to keep vital US technology out of Chinese hands.

These policies on both sides of the Pacific have already started disentangling two economies tightly intertwined by supply chains, trade, and capital. A recent survey of US companies in China discovered that nearly a fifth of respondents were considering relocating manufacturing operations out of the country because of the trade dispute and deteriorating US-China relations. Trump is encouraging this withdrawal by attacking American companies from General Motors Co. to Apple Inc. for manufacturing in China rather than creating more jobs in the US Chinese investment in the US has plunged, not only because of perceived American hostility but also because China's government has started controlling how its companies can invest abroad.

It then seems not all that surprising that a disengagement of the Chinese and American people would come next. Already, they're divided digitally. China blocks major American social media -- including Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram -- along with a host of other prominent US internet services. That's locked many Chinese in their own digital universe, where they communicate on Tencent Holdings's WeChat instead of WhatsApp, microblog on Sina Weibo, not Twitter, and search on Baidu in place of Google -- all are Chinese companies with a limited international presence.

Economic and political division is bad enough for the US-China relationship. Curtailing exchanges between citizens would arguably be more worrisome. If executives, students, and tourists begin to fear traveling between the two countries -- or aren't permitted to -- maintaining peaceful relations between the world's greatest powers will be more difficult.

What would be lost is the mutual understanding -- of each other's cultures, societies, and ambitions -- fostered by personal conversations and experience. Without that, there might be nothing left to prevent relations between Beijing and Washington from freezing over into a renewed cold war.

Sure, there are signs the current tussle might get resolved. At a December dinner after the latest Group of 20 summit in Argentina, Trump and Xi were able to call a truce in their trade war and restart negotiations. As it turned out, Huawei's Meng was arrested the same day as Trump and Xi's peacemaking dinner -- but in a positive sign, Beijing so far has remained committed to pursuing trade talks anyway. It even appears Xi might be willing to compromise on China's state-led industrial policies, a key concern of the White House that Beijing has previously considered sacrosanct. Trump has hinted (to the horror of those committed to an independent judiciary) that he could intervene on behalf of the arrested Meng to speed a trade deal. Skepticism reigns among China watchers that Xi will sincerely drop the ""state"" from China's ""state capitalism."" But maybe six months from now, tensions will ease and Americans can feel comfortable visiting the Great Wall without worrying about being trapped within it.

Or maybe not. We have to consider that the level of trust between China and the US has diminished to an alarming degree, and rebuilding may take more than cutting tariffs. In the US, China has become in many eyes the new evil empire, a larcenous cheater bent on world domination at America's expense. To the Chinese, the US often seems an overbearing foreign power, intent on frustrating China's rise. Deng's spirit of openness, 40 years later, is in grave danger. That's a setback not just for China and the US, but for the world."

With just three months left for the conclusion of the current academic year, Samagra Shiksha, Keralam, is gearing up to utilise the funds allocated for various projects for school students on time.

The Union government merged the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shikshak Abhiyan to form Samagra Shiksha early this year.

Improvement of academic standards as well as infrastructure development at schools from pre-primary to Class 12 were brought within its ambit. However, there had been a delay in convening a meeting of functionaries of the new entity, which also resulted in many projects getting stuck. As the non-utilisation of allocated funds this academic year may lead to the Centre reducing the funds next year, a State-level workshop is now being held in Kozhikode.

K.J. Harikumar, State Programme Officer, Samgra Shiksha, Keralam, told The Hindu on Sunday that it had been decided to conduct a 'Mikavulsavam' for students of Classes 1 to 7 in aided and government schools to improve academic standards. English teachers in higher secondary schools will be given special training. They would be given Malayalam translations of history, geography and economics textbooks, he added.

According to sources, coordinators of the programme from 14 districts and Block Resource Centre functionaries are participating in the workshop. It has been decided to complete the construction of science parks in all aided and government schools under the aegis of Samgra Shiksha, by the next academic year. The ongoing projects to improve the efficiency of students in science, mathematics, and English, Malayalam and Hindi will be modified and rearranged, if necessary."

The policy is likely to be released by the government in a month or two. Professor Bhargava was here to receive the SIES Sri Chandrasekarendra Saraswathi National Eminence Award on Saturday evening. He also delivered a lecture on the legacy of renowned mathematician Srinivas Ramanujan, whose birth anniversary was on Saturday. The day is observed as the National Mathematics Day.

Speaking to TOI, Bhargava said the education policy has taken a holistic approach and addressed issues ranging from access to communication by scientists. ""The entire process involved thousands of consultations,"" he said, explaining the delay.

Emphasising the need for communications in science education, Bhargava said it was just as important as getting results. ""Ph D programmes do not take care of this aspect. Good writing, good speaking is equally important. Scientists should be able to speak about science in indian languages. Every Ph D programme should have a communication course where you learn to talk about your subject to the general public, to peers,"" he said. Scientists are well known for not being able to speak very well, he added in jest.

In a country where most school-going students are gripped by math phobia, Bhargava was a child prodigy who went on to win the Fields Medal, the highest honour in the discipline. ""Mathematics is an art and the teaching should be more play-based, creativity based and discovery based, where students are described a situation and they are asked to solve it and everybody can come up with different solutions. Mathematics is wonderful - the correct answer is the correct answer. But there can be many paths to get to that answer. Teachers should allow students to discover those paths. That's all,"" he said. ""Because you discovered that path, you will never forget it. If you just memorise something, you learn it for the test and then you forget it,"" he added.

""We have very old textbooks that we continue from year to year and the teaching methods are just passed on from one generation to other. A revolution is waiting to happen there,"" he said. Bhargava felt that research institutions like TIFR and IIT can help bring out the creative side in science and math teaching.

Speaking about the flawed system of board exams and entrance exams in the country, Bhargava said standardised tests waste students' time. ""Students spend all the time just mugging and going to coaching classess instead of actually getting a chance to play with the material...the board exams and the standardised exams are actually a distraction from actual learning,"" said Bhargava. Having one standardised test that you can take multiple times whenever you want would be a lot better than having an exam on one day that determines your life, he said."

Also, do you think readers are slowly shunning physical copies and preferring e-books? Wait, the Hyderabad Book Fair will prove you wrong. From commoners to connoisseurs, the book lovers are thronging the book fair venue which is witnessing an increasing footfall day-by-day.

Almost all of the visitors to whom we spoke share that the touch and feel of the physical copy can't be replaced by an e-version of the same. ""Visual media is just to watch and enjoy but reading books will improve your thinking and thereby imaginative power,"" says Shantha Rao, a theatre activist. He adds that reading a physical copy will lead to hand, head, and heart correlation, which is very important to make an informed decision.

Phani Palavajala, a youngster who was at the fair to buy biographies, expresses a similar opinion when he says that while reading a hard copy, there will be no deviation, unlike an e-book. He adds that catching hold of a book gives immense pleasure. A tenth standard student, M Srija Sree shares that the experience of reading a book is unmatched and they were encouraged by their school management to read books.

Sheik Sadiq Ali, who is an organiser of a stall named Thopudu Bandi, says that it is not true that the reading habit is vanishing. ""Old and young generations, especially school children, love physical books, only those in between seem to prefer digital copies. And, reading a physical copy is more eye-friendly than going for a digital one,"" he shares.

Ali adds that some of the schools are encouraging their students to read and, thus, inculcating the habit of reading among children. ""I have seen a student purchasing books worth Rs 3,500 saying there are no better friends than books,"" he says.

A film actor and writer Paruchuri Venkateshwara Rao observes that visual media is momentary but reading is not. He says, ""Once you develop a habit of reading, it will stay forever."" The veteran actor also feels that the youngsters are fed up with the repetitive visual content and books are providing them with something fresh and new.

Eshwar Kavali, a civil services aspirant who is a regular visitor of the annual Hyderabad Book Fair, says that hard copies have a tangible feeling of touch and smell which will be missing in e-books. E-copies can supplement one's reading experience at the most, but not completely substitute. Eshwar also notes that the place has become an intellectual hangout where one can interact with fellow book lovers and students can also go beyond regular textbooks.

There is much more happening at the fair which is also a platform to develop and improve reading habit, mainly for the children with events such as story-reading, story-writing, one-minute Telugu, etc. ""Exercises such as these will help in building curiosity among children and also in reinterpreting what they read,"" says Shantha Rao who is also the person in-charge of 'Bala Vikas' which is looking after these exercises.

At the 32nd edition of the Hyderabad Book Fair, which is on till December 25 at NTR Stadium in Hyderabad, the organisers are expecting a footfall of around 10 lakhs. With 10-day exclusive events being organised for school children, the team behind the fair is eyeing at 2-3 lakh more visitors this time.

The organisers of the annual book fair are confident that the reading habit has not totally gone and this book fair will prove those who think so wrong. ""Holding a book and reading it are like going back to the mother's lap. Whatever we do and wherever we go, we will finally reach our mother,"" says Rajeshwar Rao, the treasurer of Hyderabad Book Fair.

""As there are more events for school children, we are expecting more numbers with children and their parents visiting the book fair,"" he shares.

""There was a complaint during the last edition that there were fewer books of other languages; we rectified it this year by sending our representatives to other book fairs and bringing other language publishers to the fair,"" says Rajeshwar, adding that the stall owners are very happy with the response they have been receiving."

My mother, like many Indian mothers, was the original environmentalist in our family. In her reign everything was reused from the food delivery plastic containers to plastic bags. We did not think of her as being green. Instead we thought of her as a professional bag lady. When I came back from abroad, she liked the soaps and chocolates I brought back. But more than anything, she liked the fancy plastic carry bags which she would fold as neatly as her saris.

No one was measuring microns but there was an unspoken but strict caste hierarchy in her plastic bag hoard. At the top were the deluxe ones -- Harrods, for example, glossy olive green with golden lettering, redolent of royal nostalgia. Next came Sturdy and Functional - for instance, Dubai duty free, no great shakes to look at but they acquitted themselves admirably. At the bottom of the pile came the plastic bags from local sari shops, bags that crinkled and crackled noisily.

When we needed a bag we would have to put in a request to my mother. She would weigh it and figure out what level of plastic it warranted and dole it out accordingly, accompanied with triumphant lectures about her eternally unappreciated far-sightedness.

When we started reading about an impending ban on plastic bags, panic hit our household not too unlike the dark days of demonetisation when nest eggs all over the country were suddenly rendered worthless overnight.

Habit of thrift

It seems strange to think of plastic bags and going green in the same breath but for us going green was not about being environmentally conscious. It was about thriftiness, of re-using everything.

My grandmother's generation knew how to make vegetable stir-fries with just peels and scrapings that would otherwise have been thrown away. What was not used became compost in my grandmother's flower pots. Everything that could be put to use was put to use or saved for another day.

Somewhere along the way everything changed, every lemon you bought from the sabziwalla came in its own plastic bag; in fact, everything came with too much packaging as a throwaway culture met a delivery culture.

The other day I went to my local bikriwallah with piles of newspapers and bottles. All my life every couple of months we would sell these and use the proceeds to treat ourselves to a family dinner.

The cry of the bikriwallah looking for old textbooks and notebooks, newspapers, magazines and gramophone players was a regular feature of Sunday mornings.

But now even as we are more green conscious, it feels harder to be green in reality. Plastic is easier to find than a jute bag. My local recyclingwallah was more interested in my sturdy American trash bag than any of the trash I had brought in it. Could you leave the bag, he said, as he weighed the newspapers. Newspapers were sold at two prices, one for the local Bengali papers and one for English.

What's the rationale, I wondered. Must be a sahebi hangover, he replied, where we think English has better quality newsprint! He didn't really want any of the heavy bottles we had lugged over. Glass had no market, he said. Only foreign liquor would work as long as it came in its original packaging. What's it used for, I wondered. Film sets, the grey economy, he replied vaguely.

The next time we had a duty-free single malt we carefully saved its packaging, but when we took it over we were in for a rude surprise. No, no, he said, we can't take this. But you said foreign liquor, I replied. Yes, like Johnnie Walker, he said. All these Scottish single malts with their peaty tones were just too foreign. Sometimes it takes so much effort to be green, it's easier to just throw in the towel.

Five years less

But the need has never been more acute. This winter, Kolkata seems under a perpetual grey cloud of smog, a dystopian landscape through which no sunlight penetrates, a smog that leaches into my lungs making me cough endlessly. The landfills of Dhapa, on the fringes of the city's consciousness, are smoking because deep in the piles of refuse, garbage is burning.

The University of Chicago tells us that Indians lose 5.3 years of life to the air we breathe every day but no political party talks about the air even as we choke in diesel smoke and tie handkerchiefs on our faces, like a Band Aid on a gaping wound, more out of hope than conviction in its efficacy.

Even in winter we keep the air conditioning on in our Uber cars, creating a bubble of breathable comfort in the grey smog that never lifts. Meanwhile the rich and famous have lavish weddings where fireworks burn, Beyonce sings and superstars serve food. It's not just trash burning in India, for some Indians money is for burning as well.

I guess that too is a green revolution of sorts in the new India."

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

If so, this article will help you make a good strategic plan to prepare for your exam. The exam draws attention of thousands of candidates every year so adopting coherent and organic approach to preparation becomes indispensable. There is always a fair amount of luck involved in a mass examination, but there is also always a plenty of preparation you can do.

1 Make Sure This Test Is for You

Before embarking on preparation for an examination, decide whether the work is worth it. It's prudent to study the exam announcements and make sure that you meet requirements like:

2 Go back to Your Fundamentals

Once you know you qualify for your exam, you next step should be to decide how to brush up on fundamentals you have not practiced latterly. Dig out your old textbooks and put them where you can see them.

3 Get Up to Date

For civil services aspirants, it's necessary to work on general knowledge and keep it updated. Good grasp of general knowledge will enable you to discuss the current events that affect the bureaucracy or government you aim to join. Daily look at news media on current events will help you stay updated.

4 Consider Paying for Coaching (""Joint Coaching Institutes"")

However, it is not essentially required to enroll in a coaching institute to crack Civil Services Examination and you can do remarkably well without joining any coaching centre also but a good coaching institute can map out right preparation strategy for you, consequently you do not waste time boning up on irrelevant study material. A good coaching institute can extend you:

5 Set Realistic Goals

Consider how much time you are left with until the test date and what are the other activities, you will be involved in - including fun things. Take in consideration the resources you have and your level of ability and then set modest, realistic and achievable goals and deadlines for accomplishing different steps of your preparation. Manage your time so that your preparation embraces each section of the test, with more time allotted to sections which are your Achilles heel.

Make a circle of friends who are interested in preparing for the same or similar examination. It will be extremely helpful in keeping up your morale. It will make you realize that you are not struggling alone - many other people long for success, just like you do. Studying in a group helps you to effortlessly identify your areas of weaknesses and strong suit.

Those who stay positive in spite of facing thousands hurdles emerge as winner at last. There is no guarantee that you will pass the examination in the first attempt but it's also illogical to assume that you will not notch up success. Be patient and support yourself over the long haul.

It may not be difficult to answer all the questions in a test but some aspirants find themselves in a tight spot when it comes to answering all the questions in the allotted time. Solving previous year questions will help you understand whether it's to your own advantage to guess at answers you are not sure of, or whether you should skip these questions. While writing the test, you will make out, how fast you have to work to answer every question that has a chance of increasing your score.

It's important to stay healthy while you prepare. Regular yoga and exercise boost your mental as well as physical strength.

Implementing this technology in the Akumbhe village, in Madha taluka, Disle has been able to increase the area's green cover from 26% to 33%, in just six years.

For his efforts, the National Geographic Society honoured Disle with the National Geographic Innovative Educator award, which comes with the 'Explorer' fellowship, a memento and a certificate. The prestigious award is given to educators who spread environmental conservation awareness among school students. This year, the award has been given to 90 teachers across 28 countries.

Speaking about the technology, Disle said, ""Every tree in the village has been labelled with a QR code. The sensors, which are chip-like, are embedded anywhere in the tree. Whenever anyone tries to cut a tree, a red alert message is sent to the cellphones of local residents. The person who tries to cut a tree is made to donate and plant five saplings within the village limits. Over a period of six years, the green cover of the village has improved.""

Helping Disle in his endeavour are his own students. ""I implemented this project with the help of students from the ZP school. The children prepared an environment report card for the village and identified the areas where it could become more environment-friendly,"" he said.

The students also conducted a tree census, calculated the total area of the village and compiled information on the number of two- and four-wheelers.

In the census, as many as 546 trees were counted and tagged. Each child in the school adopted 10 trees and took care of them. Village sarpanch Sanjay Patole said, ""Due to this innovative technology, there has been a drastic fall in the number of trees felled illegally. In fact, villagers are now planting trees voluntarily as there is increased awareness.""

This is not Disle's first QR code-based project. Earlier, he had also implemented the QR code technology for Balbharati textbooks. The chapters of Class X Balbharati textbooks were first converted into an audio-visual format by him and each chapter was given a unique QR code. Whenever a student scanned the code on the cellphone, s/he got directed to the audio-visual chapter developed by Disle on YouTube. This was adopted by Balbharati this year for all the textbooks."

She was delivering the Annie Mascrene memorial lecture at the Kerala History Congress on Friday on the theme 'My memory versus your history: Oral histories of Independence and Partition'.

""History is very much politicised in India. We know it is at the centre of the debate between the right wing and liberal secular forces.

His statement came soon after the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) announced that syllabus will be halved for CBSE students next year. A senior school education department official said the committee formed to write the new textbooks would proceed with the original plan to not reduce content.

""We might contemplate over this later, after NCERT's announcement is implemented,"" the official added.

Welcoming this, experts called the earlier proposal to reduce content as a retrograde step.

M Anandakrishnan, former IIT Kanpur chairman, said the new syllabus was framed in a a manner to help students in higher education and competitive exams. ""Reducing it will leave them handicapped,"" he said.

Government school teachers, who oppose the 'voluminous syllabus', said the higher secondary students, who were trained under a simple syllabus till Class X, were struggling to cope up with the vast content.

This was decided and announced on Wednesday during a promotional event for the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit 2019.

Talking about the same during the event, Principal Secretary Technical and Higher Education, Anju Sharma, said: ""We are in the process of making a policy for STEM Centre. In the near future, 80% of the total job generation will happen from this centre. STEM is the methodology of delivering education which focuses on learning by doing and it is extremely important for a country like us.""

According to the National Science Foundation, 80% of the jobs that will be created in the next decade will require maths and science related skills.

Introducing STEM will not entail change in syllabus or textbooks but a shift in method to facilitate practical and experimental learning. On January 17, 2019, there will be an international conference on the topic in Science City.

The conference will see more than 2,000 experts from the field of science, engineering and technology, including graduates, post graduates, faculty members and researchers from 65 plus universities in Gujarat, address different sessions on STEM.

Experts and innovators have been invited to present research papers in three categories: Policy reform required to promote STEM, Pedagogical interventions to promote STEM disciplines, and STEM for Innovation & Research. More than 100 research papers have been received from national and international universities. The top three papers will be given awards and cash prizes of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 75,000 and Rs 50,000."

A rejuvenated Congress in the Hindi heartland has halted the rising saffron tide in India's political landscape.

In Rajasthan, where the state BJP government last year reduced Gandhi and Nehru's significance in India's freedom struggle and elevated the status of V.D. Savarkar in school textbooks, where farmers committed suicide facing high loans and low productivity, the party lost 89 seats.

Also, in Rajasthan - where a daily-wage worker, Mohammad Afrazul, was hacked and burnt alive, and Abdul Ghaffar Qureshi and Rakbar Khan were lynched by vigilantes - there India's first 'cow welfare minister' lost the elections by 10,000 votes.

In Chhattisgarh, which Amit Shah claimed was ""almost free of Naxalism"" under the Raman Singh government, the BJP lost 34 seats.

In Madhya Pradesh, the BJP lost 56 seats. In an election rally in Bhopal, the UP chief minister, Adityanath, had remarked, ""You keep your Ali, for us Bajrang Bali will be enough."" Such proclamations could not prevent the BJP's Humpty Dumpty of communal politics from having a great fall.

Apart from Congress's victories, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party reiterated their commitment to secular politics by extending their support to the Congress. This has rekindled the possibility of a joint opposition against the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.

There are other indications for hope.

In the last four years, we have seen the media act as propaganda machines against political opponents. People were turned ""enemies"" of the state overnight. The state machinery was complicit, and police often played spectators to violence carried out by right-wing mobs. Although the Sangh parivar has implanted its ideology into pockets of civil society, students, journalists and activists openly defied the idea of a Hindu Rashtra.

It is difficult for the Hindutva project - borrowed from a European nation with a homogenous religious identity - to whip up a similar political campaign against a religious minority, given India's rooted heterogeneity. That is why the racial roots of anti-Semitism can't be easily translated into the politics of Islamophobia. India is a country of converts.

There is a hybrid culture of belief in India, where Hindus visit dargahs and Muslims celebrate Diwali, where Kabir sings of one god and castigates caste, while Muslim poets elevate the idolatry of the beloved to the status of divine love. Engineered events of violence can create temporary wedges between Hindu and Muslim neighbours, but old, cultural habits of life take over. The still waters of democracy run deep in India.

The pyramidal structure of power exemplified by the Modi government has been both openly and covertly criticised by older members of the BJP. This partly comes from a long political investment in the idea of democracy, despite the right-wing mindset, and partly from a general concern about dictatorial power in India's political culture. The BJP has been the most vocal critic of the dynastic politics of the Congress, but today it finds itself in a similar structure of power where Modi and Amit Shah wield the position of the party ""high command"".

At the World Hindu Conference in Chicago in September this year, held to commemorate the 125th anniversary of Swami Vivekananda's historic speech at the parliament of world religions in 1893, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat metaphorically spoke of Hindus being tolerant enough to ""recognise even the rights of pests to live"", but warned of the risk of the unprotected, lone lion being devoured by ""wild dogs"".

'Pests' and 'wild dogs' are metaphors that leave little to the imagination. Earlier this year, Amit Shah used the synonym ""termites"" for describing Bangladeshi migrants in Assam.

Contrast Bhagwat's language with what Vivekananda said in his address in 1893: ""I am proud to belong to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth"" [emphasis added]. As a ""way of life"", what we understand as tolerance, or offering refuge to the persecuted, Vivekananda and Bhagwat's ideas are quite radically apart.

In his essay, 'Attenborough's Gandhi', Salman Rushdie observes that the film does not mention either the name or the organisation of the man who killed Gandhi. In the film, writes Rushdie, ""the killer is not differentiated from the crowd; he simply steps out of the crowd with a gun. This could mean one of the three things: that he represents the crowd - that the people turned against Gandhi... that Godse was 'one lone nut'... or that Gandhi was Christ in a loincloth, and the assassination is the crucifixion"".

This dangerous game of representation is useful to keep in mind. The deliberate uncertainty accorded by members of the BJP to the lone wolfs and lynch mobs belonging to the Hindu Right is meant to achieve two things: One, to blur the identity of those people. Two, to suggest they are ordinary folks from civil society.

But like Godse, these people are not part of the crowd. They belong to vigilante formations influenced by Hindutva. In Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the shadowy organisations that carry out violence have lost, however narrowly, to the real, ordinary, democratic crowd of voters.

Bhagwat, in the Hindu Conference at Chicago, pointed out what appeared to him a tragic irony: ""Coming together of Hindus itself is a difficult task"". The opposite of unity is not necessarily disunity, but social and cultural diversity. It is the radical heterogeneity of Indian society that frustrates the Hindu Right despite its prolonged attempts at widespread communal mobilisation.

Even the aspirations of the radical Left, which thrive on a homogenised idea of class war, meet this unique resistance. Apart from diversity, another crucial form of resistance to communal politics that represents a Brahminical mindset and order inevitably comes from the political movements of the underprivileged castes.

In a speech delivered on April 4, 1938, Ambedkar made the remark that for the first time in India's history, there was ""a feeling that we are all one... due to the fact that we have a common government."" Governmentality and its juridical document, the constitution, forged the idea of one people among Indians. This basis of India's social unity, for Ambedkar, was in sharp contrast to the lack of unity that prevents Hindus from constituting a society in the modern (Western) sense.

As Ambedkar saw, not only did caste deny Hinduism ""a unified life and a consciousness of its own being"", but caste also ""prevented society from mobilizing resources for common action in the hour of danger.""

Ambedkar's critical point regarding caste hindering the ""militarisation"" of Hindu society faced with a ""catastrophy like war"", acquires the status of a political deterrent when underprivileged castes resist the militarisation of Hindu society based on Brahminical values. Along with the disgruntled and angry farmers, who did not vote for the BJP in MP, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, and the beleaguered Muslims, the small but electorally crucial gains of the Bahujan Samaj Party in these three states are a case in point.

Finally, the avalanche of statues and change of names of roads and railway stations in the country, show a hurry to institutionalise and memorialise exclusively the contribution of Hindus in Indian history and culture.

There is a supremacist agenda behind this project. It is legitimised by sentiments that were aired, among many others, by V.S. Naipaul, when he said about the Babri Masjid demolition: ""The sense of history that the Hindus are now developing is a new thing. Some Indians speak about a synthetic culture: this is what a defeated people always speak about.""

Naipaul was fanning a narrative of humiliation. But you cannot insult a people to remind them of their - real or exaggerated - humiliation. The Hindu Right is currently insulting Hindus' intelligence and ethics by telling them they need to be united for - not against - hatred."

For Komal*, a student of class II at a government school in south Delhi, her pink bag with Barbie doll painted on its front side is not less than a treasure.

Everyday Komal carries the bag on her shoulders, stuffed with at least eight to nine books and copies as she walks up to her school. 'Apart from regular set of books, I carry a diary as well for preparing notes', says Komal as we discuss her daily routine.

Class II Student Carrying a Bag Equivalent to Class IX

With Komal's bag weighing 4.6 kg, she is, unknowingly of course, carrying more than twice the weight that has been prescribed by the Delhi government recently.

In a circular dated 1 December 2018, the Delhi government fixed the weight of school bags for students of classes I to X. For students of classes I and II, the circular states that their bags should not weigh more than 1.5 kg. State governments, including Delhi, have come up with guidelines on the weight of school bags after they were told to do so by the HRD Ministry.

At 4.6 kg, Komal is carrying a bag equivalent to that of a class IX student!

For other classes the maximum weight of school bag, as approved by the state government is as follows:

Classes III to V: 2-3 KgClasses VI to VII: 4 KgClasses VIII to IX: 4.5 KgClass X: 5 Kg

In the same government school in south Delhi, students of class I were sitting on top of a cotton durrie spread across the floor. At 2.1 kg, Leena*, a student of class I, may not be facing any health problem but technically speaking, even she is carrying a bag daily, more than the prescribed weight limit.

Extra Diary Needed for Notes

Himanshi*, a student of class VI in a Rajkiya Kanya Ucch Madhyamik Vidyalaya (government school with classes upto XII) aspires to become a doctor. She doesn't like it when her bag is lighter as compared to other days when it weighs 5.2 kg. A heavy bag gives this sixth grader an assurance that she will do well in exams and fulfill her dream one day.

With five books and an equal number of copies, Himanshi's bag also doesn't comply with the weight limit, as has been suggested by the Delhi government.

""At times, the bag is heavy, but I don't complain as everyone at home will start worrying unnecessarily. After joining a learning center that's being run by an NGO, I prefer carrying an extra copy and diary.""Himanshi (Student, Class VI)

This teaching centre where Himanshi spends an hour daily after school helped in clearing her doubts on LCM (Least Common Multiple) problems in Maths and clarified her doubts regarding identification of a proper noun.

So, that extra diary and copy, meant for preparing notes at the training centre, are something Himanshi can't leave behind at home.

Students in the Dark About New Guidelines

Most of the students that The Quint spoke to were not aware about recent guidelines nor were they told about permissible limit regarding the weight of bags by their respective teachers. Due permission was taken from the principal in south Delhi as well as the mentor of the training centre being run by an NGO after which the interviews of students were recorded.

On being asked how the school will ensure the policy on weight of school bags is implemented in letter and spirit, the principal of an MCD school in south Delhi said:

""We are aware of the recent circular and would be discussing with our staff as to how we can implement the same.""Principal of a govt school in south Delhi

According to an activist associated with an NGO that provides teaching facilities at under-resourced schools, an initiative related to cupboards didn't work out.

'We encouraged students to keep books in a cupboard at TFI-certified classrooms but soon some students started complaining after their books went missing', says the activist who has worked with schools earlier in Ahmedabad and is now managing a training center in Delhi.

Is 'Support Material' to be Blamed for Extra Weight?

For Monalisa*, who would be sitting for board exams in less than three months, it is mandatory to carry books of all the subjects to school daily.

""I have six subjects to study, so, I carry all the notebooks and books along with tiffin and a geometry box. It's actually the Maths and Science books that are quite heavy.""Monalisa, Student (Class X)

On being asked whether her friends also carry books of all subjects to school, Monalisa said, 'it's even worse as other students also carry support material for the subjects of Maths, Science and Social Studies'.

Usually students at government schools prefer NCERT textbooks but some schools also distribute separate books of different subjects, commonly referred to as 'supporting material'.

The supporting material usually has chapters in condensed form with brief pointers and has objective as well as subjective questions in order to give students a sense of the exam paper.

""It's the teachers at our school who suggested that NCERT textbooks are not sufficient and therefore, we prefer 'support material'. When the session began, we were given only textbooks but since exams are drawing near, we have now been given support material as well for all the subjects except Hindi and Sanskrit.""Monalisa, Student (Class X)

Private Schools Fall Prey to Publishers' Demands

While government schools don't mind handing out extra books in the name of 'support material', private schools often fall prey to publishers who offer more lucrative deals.

An educationist who has been working with government schools in Delhi since last two years told The Quint:

""Private schools do follow the syllabus which has been prescribed. However, at times, these schools prescribe books that are not part of the curriculum as they get a commission, and this also results in heavier bags.""

Demand for Re-structuring the Syllabus

For Sharmila, whose children study in class VI, VIII and X respectively, packing bag as per the school time-table is among her foremost priorities.

Compared to the pressure that kids endure these days, measures such as limiting the weight of school bags seem half-hearted to parents like Sharmila.

""They should do something about the syllabus, nothing will happen with just reducing the weight of bags."" Sharmila, Parent

It seems that the policy-makers should have spent more time on the weighty issue of course and figuring out a way of embracing smart classroom instead of merely calibrating bags based on weight!

Some of the collaborations have also addressed issues like the United Nations' sustainability goals, migration and racism.

Imagine your child gets the opportunity to witness the wonders of the world, interact with children from different parts of the globe and learn about current world issues, all while sitting in a room. He or she is given a first-hand experience of the topography of places and their respective socio-cultural make-up beyond what is taught in textbooks, through virtual classes. Express Parenting got in touch with educator Shiva Kumar, a virtual master teacher, to know more about these virtual classes.

Virtual education

More and more children are enrolling in virtual educative tours, which connect them-even those from the remote corners of the country-to educators who make them travel virtual miles to foster learning. One such initiative, from Microsoft, holds virtual tours through Skype whereby children are taught on various topics ranging from history, computer science, mathematics to issues surrounding human rights, cyber security, and inclusiveness, to name a few.

Kumar, Asia's first Skype Master Teacher, who has been conducting the tours for the past four years, quit his corporate job to follow his passion for teaching. ""Education has been my passion from the beginning. After conducting seminars on emerging technologies and being a member of the academic board at prestigious colleges in the country, I soon realised that to bring a real change in the education system, I should begin at the school level. I realised the limitations of school education, given how students are loaded with a huge syllabus followed by examination,"" said Kumar. That's when the opportunity of becoming a Skype master teacher came up. After some reluctance initially, Kumar finally joined the initiative.

This year, the fourth edition of Skype-a-Thon was held in November, which saw participants from 102 countries travel a total of 23 million virtual miles in the span of two days. Nearly 11,000 students from over 300 schools across India took part, covering 4.26 million virtual miles, the most by any country globally.

An attempt towards empowering students and teachers, these tours enable cultural exchange between students across the world, who ask questions and identify one another through their respective traditions, music, dance, and art and craft, informed Kumar. Some of the collaborations have also addressed issues like the United Nations' sustainability goals, migration and racism. They are taught about the latest researches in the field of science, and taken on virtual tours to zoos and historical sites, apart from exploring a host of other areas.

Kumar currently teaches children, between the age of seven and 15, in Andhra Pradesh. ""We started off with only 10 kids. Today, we have around 60,"" Kumar said.

Virtual classes vs regular school

The sessions are usually held once a week. Children are not evaluated through conventional examination. It is majorly based on observation and then guiding and training them accordingly. As healthy as this experiment sounds, convincing parents in India, especially after they have long integrated themselves and their children into the country's conventional education system, has obviously been an arduous task. After all, for many of us, academic curriculum is the pathway to securing a job in future and not merely about the joy of learning.

""Parents were initially worried that it was a waste of time. But once the practical sessions started, they found it to be encouraging. That said, such form of learning is yet to become mainstream. A lot of parents are still unaware or apprehensive. Most of the kids who have enrolled in the virtual classes are those with relatively progressive parents,"" Kumar expressed. In fact, awareness sessions are also held for parents at regular intervals, he asserted.

How to apply

These virtual Skype sessions are mainly held in collaboration with schools although students can also apply individually. ""Anyone applying individually, needs his or her parents or educator to go to the Microsoft education portal, interact with an educator of their choice and filter out the subjects of interest,"" Kumar explained.

Interestingly, schools in rural areas showed better responsiveness compared to their urban counterparts, according to Kumar. ""Children coming from the rural areas are very hardworking and smart, except for their communication skills. But the confidence that these children build through these sessions helps bring down the barrier,"" said the proud teacher. Parents don't really have to worry about affordability. It is accessible as long as one has an internet connection, he stated.

Kumar has also initiated 'Skype2Village', a social drive to assist kids in Indian rural schools to experience learning beyond borders.

Is unschooling the way forward?

Technology may have improved the experience of learning but will it be sensible enough to completely digress from customary educational methods? Isn't the exposure of a regular school as important? Kumar clarified, ""Virtual teaching actually complements regular teaching. Children work on group projects, learn different perspectives, develop insight and are also trained to approach problems better. They get a worldwide exposure.""

According to Kumar, this form of unschooling is a more effective process. For the uninitiated, unschooling is a recent trend in which students lead the way in directing their learning. ""A lot of learning happens when kids are left to explore on their own. With unschooling, there's less rigidity and a better scope of interaction. Creatively, a child tends to lose a lot by going to school, given the kind of curriculum most of them have. One needs to realise that learning is not just about textbooks and marks. Parents shouldn't just be interested in the end product but be interested in the process too,"" he signed off."

Puthi Chandra Sekhar

Puthi Chandra Sekhar sent The Quint a detailed agenda for 2019 which included employment generation and development of IT, financial technology, and other tertiary industries.

""The trusted formula, as proven by Chandrababu Naidu through his huge fan base in Telangana's Hi-Tech City even after separation of the state, is the generation of more employment,"" he says.

Ashoka University showed extraordinary courage to do something as ordinary as supporting the autonomy of teachers.

A relatively new Ashoka University is doing what the University of Delhi with all its gravitas and age could not do. Ashoka University has decided to stand by the decision of Aparna Vaidik, an associate professor, to teach the graphic novel Gardener in the Wasteland by Srividya Natarajan in her 'Great Books' course. They said that teachers have the right to decide their own course and teaching materials. Right-wing trolls and activists said the book was 'anti-Brahmin' and 'anti-Hindu'.

The question we must ask is: Why Ashoka University, already located in a BJP-ruled state, putting itself at serious risk, given the present political atmosphere? Why did it not simply ask the teacher to drop the book in question and replace it with another 'non-controversial' book? After all, that is what even universities like the Delhi University (DU) has done and continues to do to buy peace.

In 2011, the academic council of DU decided to withdraw Three Hundred Ramayanas, an essay by A.K. Ramanujan on the Ram kathas, because of its potential to hurt 'Hindu sentiments'. Disregarding the view of the department concerned, the council discarded the essay. More recently, the university was again in the news after its academic committee sought the removal of books by Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd from the political science syllabus for their 'controversial' content. Earlier, books by Nandini Sundar and Archana Prasad were sought to be removed for they 'glorified Naxalism' and 'promoted religious conversion'. In both the cases, it is now for the academic council to take a decision. One can only hope that it does not repeat the shameful act of 2011 and instead follow the example of Ashoka University.

Also read: Ashoka University slammed for teaching 'anti-Hindu, anti-Brahmin' book

When such controversies arise, we often fall in the trap of the objectors and start a debate on the merit of the book or the course concerned - as we did for Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd or Ramanujan. This is a wrong approach to take.

The simple principle to follow should be that it is the right of the teacher to select her teaching material and no, not even the vice-chancellor can tell her what to teach, and more importantly, what not to. As Ashoka University said, ""The university faculty are free to use a diverse range of materials to catalyze thinking.""

Teachers should, after all, be good catalysts.

When I teach a book, I don't tell my students how great the book is. I teach it with a clear objective in my mind that the students should be able to look at it analytically and critically. Is Premchand beyond the pale of criticism or do students feel encouraged to ask questions about his portrayal of women characters or his attitude towards caste? I have often heard students disagreeing with novelist Jainendra Kumar for allowing his protagonist Mrinal in Tyagpatra to waste herself.

Defenders of faith and the nation argue that students are of an impressionable age and they can get swayed by such 'dangerous' material. But classrooms function not only as sites of transferring existing, 'correct' knowledge from previous eras but also as a living space where new knowledge is created through the interaction between the teachers and the students. The classroom is not a place for propagating ideologies, but a space for dissecting them. The student and teacher should feel safe enough to talk about things that challenge the 'common sense' of their time. Or, even the established notions about the boundaries of disciplines and pedagogy. It would be useful to recall a discussion about the selection of material for schools.

The NCERT, under the leadership of Krishna Kumar, was overhauling the syllabi of all subjects in 2004. New textbooks were being written. Books by authors and historians like Romila Thapar, Ram Sharan Sharma, Bipan Chandra, Irfan Habib were being replaced by books prepared by a team of historians who were very different in their historiography than these doyens. There was a lot of disquiet and anger about this step. A fear was expressed that the children could get confused and de-secularised. A virulent campaign was launched by the Left group against the new syllabus and books. The fact that then minister in charge, Arjun Singh, despite his known friendship with the Left intelligentsia stood firmly behind the NCERT and defended its autonomy, has not been talked about much.

Historian Ram Sharan Sharma was the only one who did not make an issue out of it. I had gone to see him when he was recuperating from a surgery in a Delhi hospital. There, an angry historian complained that the NCERT was now trying to teach history through cricket. He was obviously referring to the inclusion of Ramachandra Guha's article. Professor Sharma, with his mischievous smile, said, ""In our shastras it is said that when the child attains a certain age, she should be treated as equal.""

""Aaj bacche jaldi bade ho jata hai (Children grow up fast these days). Let her read many books, don't constrain her vision by your prescription,"" he said.

It should be for the teacher to decide what is teachable.

I remember when a Left leader jubilantly told me that the name of a particularly respected scholar had been effectively blocked from the shortlist for the post of vice-chancellor of a central university. I asked why. She asked how the teacher could be trusted after she had included Savarkar as a part of the syllabus! I was left dumbfounded. What would be the fate of the teacher who uses Mein Kampf as part of the course on the Holocaust?

By defending the autonomy of teachers, we create a space for students to think on their own and develop their voices. This is what the Ashoka University has done and we must applaud the institution for having the extraordinary courage to establish an ordinary principle: The freedom of the teacher is paramount for a university to call itself a university.

A team of 40 school teachers from across the state have been deployed for the project and they have made about 3,000 videos on various subjects so far.

One of the students, who participated in a shooting in the city recently, said making of educational videos was itself a joyful experience. Just imagine what could be in store for fellow students, who would learn by watching these videos.

""I was scared at first. But during and after the shooting, I was very happy. My parents, teachers and friends have watched my videos in smart phones and appreciated me,"" said Kiruba S, a student who acted in one of the videos.

Making of videos for the third term is under way and the process is expected to be completed by December-end.
