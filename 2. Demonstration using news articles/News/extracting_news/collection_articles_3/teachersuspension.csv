The school's head had segregated students in sections based on their religion, grouping Hindu and Muslim children in separate classes.

""All sections have been homogenised and each class has children from different communities. The school's operation is back to normal,"" said Yogendra Singh Mann, director of press and information for North/East Delhi Municipal Corporation.

The head of school, CB Singh Sehrawat, was suspended on Wednesday after reports of the practice surfaced.

Delhi government and the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) had taken cognizance of the matter and directed relevant authorities to take immediate action.

""Prima facie he was guilty. It was clear that the head of school was at fault. There will be a serious inquiry and a chargesheet will be filed against the head of school,"" Mann said.

""If found guilty, he will face punishment,"" Mann added. If charges against him are proven, the maximum penalty could lead to Sehrawat's dismissal.

On Wednesday, DCPCR had written to the Education Director of North Delhi Municipal Corporation and to the head of school, saying that segregation based on religion would ""potentially have an ill effect on holistic learning and development of the students and also negatively impact the social fabric of the nation"".

The commission had asked for the details of class composition and attendance records before and after Sehrawat joined as head of school in July. Sehrawat was also asked to explain the reasons behind separating Hindu and Muslim students in separate classes.

DCPCR has recommended the education director to form a committee to investigate the matter further and furnish details of the sequence of events that led to the situation at the MCD school.

""We have written to the education director and told him the segregation must be ended within two days' time"" and the current sections must be dissolved. We have also asked them to ensure this does not happen in the future,"" said Anurag Kundu, DCPCR member.

DCPCR has also recommended that steps be taken to counsel and sensitise students at the Wazirabad school."

""What a shame,"" wrote writer-critic Sunil P Elayidom on Facebook, reacting to the incident.

On Friday, Vice-Chancellor G Gopa Kumar removed Pannian as head of the department for a Facebook post condemning his (V-C's) decision to press criminal charge against a research scholar who broke a pane of a fire extinguisher cabinet in the hostel. The student, Ganhoti Nagaraju, was arrested and had to spend five days in prison for the ""misdemeanor"".

Gopa Kumar signed the suspension order on Friday, and pro-vice-chancellor K Jayaprasad circulated it on WhatsApp groups and to the media, without serving it to Pannian. He is yet to get the order.

""By targetting Pannian, the university is challenging the sense of justice and democratic tradition of Kerala society,"" wrote Elayidom.

Josy Joseph, journalist and author wrote: ""We're indeed living in terrible times when democratic and academic values are pushed aside in favour of obedience and conformity. Left-leaning Purogamana Kala Sahitya Sangham (Progressive Arts & Literary Organisation) has also registered its protest against the suspension. Expressing solidarity with Pannian, left intellectual Anil Chelembra said, those who opposed the views of the 'authorities' were being branded as ""enemies of the university"".

To be sure, Pannian on August 11 reacted to the arrest of the Dalit scholar on his Facebook by writing: ""That an act of misdemeanor has been criminalised is deeply disturbing. As far as I understand, this is a minor offence that should have been settled on the campus itself. Mr Nagaraju lost his mother a few months ago and has been going through severe mental stress and agony... He has also not received his fellowship for quite some time. It is extremely saddening to know that our student is lying on the cold floor of the prison cell on charges of breaking a pane.

I strongly condemn this arrest and appeal to the authorities to immediately secure the release of our student"". The suspension of Pannian comes two days after the V-C expelled Akhil Thazhath, a second year post-graduate student of international relations and politics, for a Facebook post.Earlier, he had expelled another student of linguistics, Annapoorni Venkataraman, triggering massive student protest on the campus.

Students who led a relay hunger strike demanding proper food, water, and space in hostel, were not allegedly given admission this academic year. Reacting to the suspension of Pannian and expulsion of Thazhath, students called for an all-party meet on Sunday evening."

Narender has been posted at Government College for Women, Jind, against a vacant post. The order was released on Wednesday.

An assistant professor in history, Narender was placed under suspension by the department of higher education on February 9, 2017. He was also chargesheeted under the Haryana Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules in July 2017.

The main allegations against Narender were that he had approached the local police against then principal of the college Ved Prakash Sheoran for corruption charges and registered an FIR without waiting the response from the department.

He was also accused of tarnishing the image of the department as well as the then principal.

Narender has already submitted his detailed reply against the charges.

In December 2016, Haryana police had registered an FIR against Sheoran for cheating, forgery and related charges on Narender's complaint.

Narender had made several complaints to the directorate of higher education regarding the alleged irregularities committed by Sheoran during his tenure as principal. However, when the department failed to take any action for a considerably long period, he had submitted complaint to the police. Acting on Narender's complaint police had booked the principal."

Incidentally, statehood activists too have supported the employees' demand. They have also objected to the CM's wife, Sunita, serving as a teacher in Ajabpur Kalan (Dehradun), an accessible area for the last 22 years at a stretch.

Be that as it may, the ugly spat between Rawat and Uttara Pant Bahuguna followed after she requested him for a transfer to Dehradun from Jeyestwari, a remote area in Uttarkashi where she is currently posted.

The 57-year-old requested for transfer on the ground that she has served in remote hill areas regularly for the past 25 years and being a widow needed to shift to Dehradun look after her children.

In the video of the Janata Darbar which went viral in social media she is seen making her request politely citing those three grounds.

Rawat too is also seen light-heartedly asking her if she had also cited those grounds at the time of applying for the job.

At this the principal got agitated and shot back saying she had not given a written undertaking to serve in the remote area during her entire service.

Rawat also lost his temper and asked the principal to mind her language and warned her that she would be suspended.

On Friday, she was served a suspension order and education secretary Bhupinder Kuar Aulakh said at a press conference that an inquiry has been ordered into the entire episode.

She said Bahuguna has been absent from her place of work without obtaining permission from her bosses since 19 August 2017 and had also been suspended in the past for dereliction of duty.

She also hinted that the primary school principal can't be transferred to Dehradun as she originally belongs to the Uttarkashi cadre.

Rawat's decision to suspend Bahuguna though has drawn a trenchant criticism from a number of employee organisations who have demanded that he ""immediately withdraw"" his directive.

They, however, admitted that both he and Bahuguna should have maintained restraint.

""The chief minister should have maintained restraint and the teacher too shouldn't have used the foul language against him,"" said Manohar Mishra, the president of the Uttaranchal parvatiya Karmachari Shikshak Sangathan, an organisation of state employees posted in hilly areas.

""However, the chief minister should immediately withdraw his suspension order against the principal concerned as it was issued without evaluating the merits and demerits of the case,"" he said.

Mishra pooh-poohed the ""government's stand"" that Bahuguna can't be transferred outside Uttarkashi owing to the cadre related binding.

""I can cite a number of examples where employees related to influential people were transferred outside their original district and mandal cadres in brazen violation of rules,"" he said.

Rajiv Lochan Shah, a statehood activist cited the case of the CM's wife who, he said ""has been posted as a teacher in Dehradun for the past 22 years during which she also got promotions"".

Another statehood activist Sarita Negi said the chief minister's wife being posted at an accessible place for 22 years is also an open violation of the Transfer Act recently enforced by the state government.

Digvijay Singh Chauhan, president of the Primary Teachers' Association, said the suspension order against Bahuguna should be withdrawn because it was issued without conducting an inquiry.

""Similarly"", added Negi, ""there is a government order, which permits employees nearing retirement to be transferred to the places of their choice.""

The chief minister's media advisor Ramesh Bhatt clarified that there was nothing illegal about his (CM) wife not being transferred outside Dehradun district.

""She got her cadre changed from Pauri to Dehradun in 1996. Besides forgoing her promotions, she was also transferred to several places in the district,"" he said."

A day after entering into a feud with Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat, suspension orders were issued against the government school principal who on Thursday had allegedly used abusive language for Rawat while she was seeking her transfer from a remote location to Dehradun.

On Friday, the Uttarkashi district's education department ordered that Uttara Bahuguna (57), serving as principal of the government primary school in Uttarkashi district's Naugaon area, be ""immediately suspended"" for violating the rules by ""attending Chief Minister's Janata Darbar without the required permission from the (education) department, and for showing disrespect (to the Chief Minister)"".

On Thursday, following Rawat's orders, Bahuguna was taken into police custody but was released by the evening. On the same day, Rawat had also ordered that Bahuguna be immediately suspended for misbehaving with him.

Addressing the media, on Friday, secretary (school education) Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh said, ""A preliminary enquiry has been ordered in Uttara Bahuguna's case. She (Bahuguna) will be allowed to present her case during the enquiry.""

After her husband's death in August, last year, Bahuguna did not join the school where she is posted as the principal. ""She has not joined the school since 19 August, last year, that too without taking any permission from the department. Between August 5, 2015 and April 10, 2017 too, she has been absent from service,"" Aulakh said, adding that Bahuguna had faced suspension twice in the past -- in 2008 and in 2011 - for not fulfilling her responsibilities at work.

On Thursday, Bahuguna had told Rawat that she had been serving in the remote locations for 25 years, and that she needed to be transferred to Dehradun since she needed to be with her children after her husband's death.

""On Chief Minister's orders it will be seen as to what can be done for her (Bahuguna) based on the provisions of the Transfer Act,"" Aulakh said.

However, Aulakh said that since Bahuguna was of Uttarkashi district cadre, she could be transferred only within Uttarkashi district, and not to Dehradun.

""In the list of people who will be transferred out of remote locations, she (Bahuguna) is on the 59th number, and currently there are only 12 vacancies in accessible locations of Uttarkashi district,"" Aulakh said.

However, Uttarakhand Congress leaders, including former Chief Minister Harish Rawat, condemned the Chief Minister's ""disgraceful behaviour"" with the school principal. On Friday, Harish Rawat took to Facebook where he mentioned in a post that while the school principal's behaviour must not be defended, Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat should have had the patience to listen to the lady's problems.

After the suspension orders, the state Congress demanded that the suspension be recalled, ""else we will protest against the BJP government's tyranny"", Uttarakhand Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Pritam Singh said."

The incident happened on Thursday at the 'Janata Darbar' of the chief minister in Dehradun when the principal of a government school in Nagaon area of Uttarkashi district made a transfer request.

According to a government release, principal Uttara Bahuguna ""showed disrespect and used abusive language"" during the Janata Darbar. She was told to put forward her request in a decent manner but she kept on misbehaving.

Bahuguna had requested the chief minister that she be transferred from the remote location to Dehradun. Her claim was that she has been posted at the remote locations for the last 25 years and she now wanted to live with her children.

On being asked by Rawat if she had given any undertaking while securing the job, Bahuguna shot back that she had not stated ""she will live in a forest throughout her life"". On this, the chief minister lost his cool and asked her to put forward her request in a decent manner but she kept on ""showing disrespect"", the release said.

The woman said that her husband had died and she did not want to leave her children as ""orphans in Dehradun"".

""My condition is such that neither can I leave my children alone nor my job,"" Bahuguna said. The school principal also reportedly hurled abuses at the chief minister going on to call him corrupt and a chor (thief), after which she was forcefully removed by women police officers. Government sources said that the principal was briefly detained and later suspended.

After the incident, Rawat said that request for transfers must not be brought to a platform meant for hearing public grievances. ""All transfers of government employees will be done under the state's Transfer Act,"" he said.

Meanwhile, after the incident snowballed into a controversy, the state's school education secretary Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh said that any further action on the transfer request will only be taken in accordance with the rules. She also said that the suspension order was for the interim and the future course of action will be decided after hearing her side.

She also said that Bahuguna was 59th in the list of transfer requests. ""More than 58 people are posted in remote areas for longer duration than her. Her number is only 59th. The transfer is done only turn-wise. She can be transferred only within the district. Her demand that she be transferred to Dehradun falls under inter-dist transfers which, as of now, isn't allowed by the rule,"" Aulakh said.

However, Bahuguna said that she has served as a disciplined employee of the government and she only retorted after the chief minister ordered for her to be removed. ""Ise le jao, ise le jao, kyu vo is tarah se mujhe bol rhe the, kya mera koi puchne vala nahi. Main ek mahila shikshika hu,"" Bahuguna broke down while narrating her ordeal.

Speaking to The Print, Bahuguna also alleged irregularities in transfers and appointments in the state. She said she was transferred from her earlier posting at Jogath after the school fell vacant. She, however, alleged that another person was appointed at the school, who continued to draw a salary for two years, to run an empty school. The posting was only cancelled after much hue and cry. Bahuguna said she will compile the data regarding those principals who have been transferred despite signing the same government bond, which she did. The bond warrants a state government teachers to be posted in schools in remote hill-stations till the government sees fit to transfer them.

A high-voltage drama unfolded during a 'Janata Darbar' session that was held in Dehradun, on Thursday, where Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat instructed the police to 'immediately' arrest a female school teacher, and ordered her suspension after the woman allegedly showed 'indecency' and used abusive language with Rawat while seeking a transfer from the remote location after being posted in such locations for 25 years.

Uttara Bahuguna (57), who is currently serving as the principal of a government primary school in Uttarkashi district's Naugaon area, reached the 'Janata Darbar' on Thursday, and requested Rawat that she be transferred out of the remote village. When Rawat dismissed her request, Bahuguna started arguing with him. That is when Rawat lost his cool and shouted several times into the microphone: ""Suspend karo ise bhi (Suspend her from her job, immediately). Take her into police custody.""

A video of the incident that went viral over social media shows Bahuguna leaving the 'Janata Darbar' hurling abuses at Rawat, before being taken into police custody under section 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (arrest to prevent the commission of cognisable offences). She was released from the police custody by Thursday evening.

After the incident, Rawat received much flak over social media for losing his cool with Bahuguna. The Uttarakhand Congress leaders too objected to Rawat's ""rude behaviour, and lack of patience.""

After the incident, Rawat said that request for transfers must not be brought to a platform which is meant for hearing public grievances. ""All transfers of government employees will be done under the state's Transfer Act,"" Rawat said. The CM also said that suspension orders were issued for Bahuguna for ""showing disrespect and using abusive language"" in the ""Janata Darbar"".

Speaking to The Indian Express after the incident, Bahuguna said, ""I have no problem in doing my job, but I've been posted in remote areas for 25 years. Before the Uttarkashi village, I was posted in a remote area in Uttarkashi district's Chinyalisaur. My husband used to take care of my two children, but after his death in August last year there's no one to take care of my children. Also, I'm too old now to work in remote areas.""

In another incident during BJP's ""Janata Darbar"", a businessman had committed suicide in January this year stating loss in business due to demonetisation and imposition of GST."
