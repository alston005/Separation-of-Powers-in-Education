The move is on the heels of a police recommendation that schools be under CCTV surveillance as a precautionary measure.

The importance of this security measure on school premises was brought home by the alleged rape of a nine-year-old girl inside the toilet of her school in Vashi in September. The victim confided to her mother about the incident. She said, an unidentified person took her to a toilet after covering her mouth with a handkerchief and raped her. The incident took place as she was entering school. Since there were no CCTV cameras installed in the school, the accused was never identified.

Meanwhile, police will send notices to schools to take precautions to ensure the safety of students on the premises. Sudhakar Pathare, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 1), said, ""Apart from requesting schools to instal CCTV cameras, we have also asked schools to hire guards from certified security agencies, who can keep a record of people entering and leaving the school.""

DCP Pathare added, school management and staff should also ensure the CCTV footage be retained for at least a week, and not just for 24 hours, as is usually the practice. NMMC Commissioner N Ramaswamy said this proposal was tabled in the committee in March and the project is underway. ""At this juncture, the project is at tendering stage. All civic schools in the city will be under CCTV surveillance by the end of this financial year. Each school will be installed with CCTV cameras after thorough individual survey. The results of the survey will determine the number of cameras required per school.""

Explaining how installation of CCTV surveillance costs as low as Rs 14 per student, parents will not mind paying a minimal amount to ensure the safety and security of their children. Lopes Diago, Principal of St Xavier's School in Nerul said, ""Our schools are well-equipped with CCTV surveillance. Lack of funds cannot be an excuse for not having one. We have installed cameras everywhere and a student has to pay just Rs 14 more for the security.""Parents will breathe a sigh of relief over the decision, as it will mean improved alertness and security, said an educational activist."

Installation of CCTV cameras in government schools, a new survey to ascertain the level of safety for women in public spaces, and hikes in assistance to Residents' Welfare Associations (RWAs) and leprosy patients were among the proposals passed by the Delhi Cabinet on Tuesday.

At a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the Cabinet passed the Education Department's proposal for administrative approval and expenditure sanction for installing CCTV cameras in government schools, a government statement said.

In May, the Expenditure Finance Committee had approved the ₹597 crore project to instal 1.46 lakh cameras in schools, including inside classrooms. The cameras will cover classrooms, corridors, laboratories, libraries, vacant rooms, parking lots and areas outside washrooms.

The government had decided to instal cameras in schools after a spate of attacks on children inside institutes across the NCR in the past year. In July, the Cabinet had approved a project to instal 1.4 lakh cameras in Delhi's residential colonies and markets.

In order to map the city for infrastructural problems, a proposal by the Women and Child Development Department to conduct a survey with the NGO SafetiPin was approved by the Cabinet, the statement said.

The NGO had done a survey to identify dark spots a few years ago, the statement added. The new survey will involve collection of data on the level of brightness, visibility, number of pedestrians, presence of security or police personnel, condition of footpath, availability of public transport and percentage of women and children in the crowd at different locations in the city.

This information will be crowd-sourced using two apps created by SafetiPin.

The Cabinet also approved the Environment and Forest Department's proposal to double the amount of financial assistance, from ₹1 lakh per acre to ₹2 lakh per acre, to RWAs and NGOs to maintain parks.

The Cabinet also cleared a proposal to give one-time assistance of ₹2 lakh per acre for the setting up of a sewage treatment plant (STP) at parks maintained by the RWAs or NGOs. The STP will draw sewage from the nearest line of the Delhi Jal Board, treat it and then enable the use of the grey water to irrigate the park.

The Cabinet also cleared the Education Department's proposal to rename the existing Vidyalaya Kalyan Samiti scheme to School Management Committee (SMC) Fund in order to empower the SMCs. The Cabinet also approved the department's proposal to increase the rates of remuneration of guest teachers that fall in the ""miscellaneous"" subject category, including music and special education.

Installation of CCTV cameras in school premises was the topic of discussion in the satellite city last after the alleged rape of a minor girl came to light.

The girl said that an unidentified person took her to a toilet by covering her mouth with a handkerchief when she was entering her school and raped her inside it.

The private school had no CCTV camera and hence the police have not been able collect concrete evidences against anyone.

After the incident, parents had also staged a protest and asked the school authorities to install CCTV cameras on the premises.

Mr. Dehadrai told the court that it was not healthy to have cameras inside classrooms where children, including girls, often discuss personal things amongst themselves.

Giving details about the project that will be executed at an estimated cost of Rs 597.51 crore in six months, PWD minister Satyendar Jain said that as per the plan, the cameras will be installed in each classroom and open areas in 1,028 school buildings owned by the Delhi government.

Mr Jain said that once the project is completed, the contractor has to provide the facility to allow access to parents to see their children studying in the classrooms on a real-time basis, adding that LED screen for each school principal will also be provided for live viewing of the video feed.

It comes in the backdrop of Lt Governor Anil Baijal constituting a high-level committee to prepare common framework for the installation and monitoring of CCTV cameras across the city which the AAP dispensation is strongly opposing.

""Parents will be provided user ID and password for the classroom of their child for viewing the video feed on their phone through a mobile app. The storage of video recording of each camera will be available for 30 days at school-level.

""High speed Internet connection of appropriate band width will also be provided to school through Internet service provider,"" the minister told reporters.

He said that tenders have been floated for the project for which around seven companies have participated in the bidding process, adding that work project will be awarded only after the Cabinet gives its nod to the same.

The effort has received mixed reaction from twitterati which divided in two camps. While one argued that CCTV cameras and surveillance is not the solution to any problem, another camp argued that this would ensure that no further incidences like the one at Ryan International School are repeated.

The pilot project to install CCTV cameras in schools was started by the Delhi government in September 2015. ""The government has plans to install CCTV cameras in all classrooms of all government schools...Complaints against teachers coming late or such will also be factually made on record with the help of these cameras,"" Manish Sisodia had said at the time.

In the wake of shocking recent attacks on kids in schools, Delhi government led by CM Arvind Kejriwal has planned to install CCTV cameras in all state-funded schools and give parents access to live feed from classrooms. The plan has been lauded by many but also faced objections from some. ""Reviewed the progress of installation of CCTV cameras in each class in all govt schools. Each parent will be given access to see his child studying in class on realtime basis on his phone. This will make the whole system transparent and accountable. It will ensure the safety of kids,"" Kejriwal had tweeted yesterday. The decision will certainly put pressure on private schools of the national capital to come up with a similar initiative.

Last year, a class two kid was killed in Ryan International School in Gurugram. This week, a class 1 student was stabbed by a girl at a private school in Lucknow. Kejriwal government had started the work on the plan to install the CCTV cameras in schools in September 2015. However, the decision to provide the live feed from the classroom was made public last week. As per reports, the CCTVs will be installed in 1,000 schools within three months.

""It's not Spying. There was a child death in Ryan International. The blame was on a poor man. But if all classes are with CCTV. Even the child will be in good discipline and how much efforts teachers are taking to bring up the career of students parents will know. bonding,"" wrote one user named Cleanio Carvalho while replying to Kejriwal.

However, the new decision has faced criticism on the ground that it may lead to unnecessary ""restrictions"" on children, ""spying"" and, moreover the impact of CCTV cameras on public safety was unclear. Advocate Apar Gupta, who was recently involved in the right to privacy case in the Supreme Court, raised these concerns while replying to Kejriwal in a series of tweets.

Mr @ArvindKejriwal your intent may be good but this is not the method. Being watched & to keep a watch....is not a great sense of security. Watching kids & teachers real time (all the time) would also mean breaching privacy plus will also kill natural social evolution of kids.

""From the literature I have read multiple studies exist and a review of them leads to inclusive, sometimes conflicting results of CCTVs on crime prevention (as opposed to investigation and prosecution). Many label them as what you can call the, ""scare crow effect"" where a predator in time factors the effectiveness of the CCTV based on policing response and not the CCTV in isolation. Look up Google Scholar + SSRN. Take the example at hand. A realtime video tracker in schools will lead to policing of children not only to prevent crimes but their moral choices and behavior. Eg. social interactions (""stay away from X kid""). It will condition children into fearful clients not full individuals.

The district inspector of schools (DIOS) has ordered that all the 45 examination examination centres under the board must have the cameras by January 15.

Many schools have sighted lack of funds under the development category for their inability to buy the CCTV cameras. Sources said the DIOS had asked such schools to take a written undertaking from him allowing them to use funds under other heads to install the cameras as early as possible.

""A similar directive had been issued earlier but it was not mandatory. The board has now made it mandatory for test centres to have CCTV cameras. On Friday, fresh directives were issued at a meeting of all school inspectors with the education minister and senior officials of the board. We had called another meeting of the principals on Saturday and informed them about the decision,"" said PK Upadhyay, the DIOS of Gautam Budh Nagar.

Officials said the decision to install the cameras followed several complaints of copying during exams and imposters writing the papers on behalf of the actual examinees.

A similar order issued two years ago was hardly implemented in the absence of a clarity on funds.

Most test centres of the UP board fall in Jewar and Greater Noida, where many schools do not have CCTV facility in examination rooms.

""We have started contacting the CCTV service providers. It has been clarified that the schools can use the development funds for getting CCTVs. However, if the development funds are not sufficient, the DIOS has said that he can give an undertaking to utilise the money under other heads,"" said Ashok Dwivedi, the principal of Shri Amichand Inter College, Kasna.

The principal of a government school in Jewar said generating funds was easier said than done for schools that did not have their own land and building and relied mostly on fees from students to function.

The department has also directed the principals to hand over to the police any person found writing the paper on behalf of the actual examinee.

""Such complaints had been made around two years back from a private school in Maaycha village. There have been instances when students have influenced principals and got others to write the exams for them. They will now be handed over to the police immediately and the principals do not have to wait for an FIR to be lodged against them,"" the DIOS said."
