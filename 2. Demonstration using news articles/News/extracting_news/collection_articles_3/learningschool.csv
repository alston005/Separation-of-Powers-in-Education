This is being aimed at improving the time that will be dedicated for experiential learning, sports and life-skills.

He emphasised on the need for extra-curricular activities and added that these activities are as important as the syllabus taught in classrooms. He was speaking at an event organised in Pune by Dhruv Global School, India Today reported.

India Today quoted Javadekar as saying, ""We need to have equal focus on experiential learning, sports, physical education and life skills education for the holistic development of the child. We are trying to reduce the burden of classroom syllabus in a phased manner to facilitate this thought.""

Furthermore, the minister added that the government will be reducing the syllabus by 10 per cent this year and 20 per cent the next year so that students can make time for the above-mentioned activities.

He said, ""Under Samagra Shiksha drive, more than 11 lakh schools are being given a special grant ranging between Rs 5,000 to Rs 25,000 for procuring books for library and buying sports equipment separately. Around 3,000 Atal Tinkering Labs have been set up in schools across the country for introducing children to modern science in an appropriate way,"" India Today reported."

Each vehicle is unique in itself -- single seater with no boot space, family passenger car and some resemble a big tow truck. Ask the students what they are doing and they reply in unison, 'We are making a car that doesn't crash.'

The students are given an assortment of raw material to choose from to manufacture the car within a fixed budget; it is up to them how they want their vehicle to look like. Mind you, it is no craft class, it is the Tinkering Lab.

I was curious to see the Tinkering Lab live when I heard of the concept. On a busy Monday morning at 11.30, I find myself attending an 80 min Tinkering Lab session at Lions West Sevaniketan School in Gokulam. After the car is manufactured, an egg is placed in place of the driver and the car is ready for the test drive. The students are given a problem that the car shouldn't crash. They have to find a solution however they want to.

'I don't miss school on Mondays even if I am sick because we have tinkering lab on Mondays,' says Samudyatha, an enthusiastic 8th grader.

Started in 2014 by two ex-techies from Namma Mysuru, with tinkering as a medium, Science Ashram aims to revolutionise the education system with curriculum that encompasses STEM education and beyond. Problems that mimic real-world scenarios empower children with necessary skills and competence to face challenges in the future thus preparing them for life beyond the classroom. Even adults would enjoy dabbling in it. It aims at reorienting education from knowledge acquisition to skill mastery thus granting the students the freedom to innovate and take decisions.

'It is a revolutionary concept aimed at making our children think out of the box. We introduced the Tinkering Labs in 2018 for the students of 6th, 7th and 8th grades and the newly gained confidence in the students is conspicuous,' beams Ln. K.S. Gururaja, the President of the School. 'The entire cost of the project is borne by the school. It is completely free for the children.'

Why the need for Tinkering Labs: The academic curriculum doesn't allow much scope for experimentation and is not application oriented. Conventional teaching is aimed at producing workers for industries but the economy doesn't need only workers, it also needs leaders, consumers, thinkers. Most importantly, there is a need to reinvent our skill sets at every stage hence the concept of Science Ashram,' explains Rohan Ramanuja, an ex-techie from SJCE who started Science Ashram with childhood friend and college mate Dhruva V. Rao.

'The Lions Sevaniketan School was very encouraging when we sent the proposal to them. As of now, we have introduced the concept in 15 schools in Mysore and Bangalore. We plan to increase it to 30 this year and take it to other cities.'

I watch the children work in teams, discussing with each other, helping those who are stuck. 'The world belongs to artificial intelligence. We are very good at reproducing what we have learnt but little deviation from it and we whine the question paper is out of syllabus,' laughs Rohan who is walking me through his Start-Up, the proud smile playing on his lips all through.

What's unique: Unlike conventional curriculum, there is no uniform takeaways for the participants. To each one to his own. The most interesting about the whole concept is it allows children to make mistakes and learn from them. There is no teacher, only a facilitator.

I am eager to evaluate what I have been told. I approach a bunch of students and ask them what they have learnt by making a car that doesn't crash. 'Now I know how to design a car,' says Dhanyatha. 'It also helps us in learning how to take decisions,' adds Harshini. 'After making the car, I like to study Science.'

I notice a shy looking boy who hasn't opened his mouth until now. I lean towards him. 'What is the learning for you dear?'

'Maam, we should always wear seat belts while driving. My egg (read driver) fell out of the car in the test ride because I hadn't put seat belt for him.'"

The sessions are annually held in the month of December and is alternatively conducted by the two institutions. The eleventh batch of students this year have been attending sessions from December 14 which will go on till December 24.

The joint collaborative initiative was started in 2007 and the Radio Physics Laboratory has been conducting the Radio Astronomy winter schools for college students (RAWSC) from 2008 onwards.

The students of the winter school are those who are passionate about astronomy or physics. Most of them want to be part of either of the two institutions. Isha Shailesh who is studying Integrated MSc in Physics and in her third year said that she is part of the group which is experimenting at Inter University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) and has visited IUCAA for the summer course too.

Bhavesh Rajpoot is a 2nd year student of BSc with specialisation in Physics at Fergusson College and he said, ""Apart from academics, the best part of being shortlisted for the course are the experiments,"" said Rajput.

Poorva Bhalerao is a BTech student of computer engineering from MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for women said, ""This course exposes us to all branches of astronomy and is a detailed study of what is in the universe. As a child I would often look up at the night sky and wonder. Now we get to study about the higher elements out there."" Kaustav Goswami from Dibrugarh University found the course to be different from the other workshops that he has attended. ""With the hands on training, it is easier to understand how to apply the theories learnt. Goswami revealed that he plans to pursue a doctorate in Radio Astronomy after which he wants to be part of NCRA. Shantanu Saha who is studying second year BTech in aerospace at IIST Thiruvanthpuram said, ""Lecturers are teaching us all about astronomy besides telling us about future prospects and growth of this field."" Jameer Manur, coordinator and electronic engineer (research) IUCAA said that the winter school was co-founded by Professor Joydeep Bagchi from IUCAA and Professor Bhal Chandra Joshi from NCRA in the year 2008.

""This year NCRA has been hosting the 11th winter school for a period of 10 days starting from December 14. The school provides hands on training program for the second and third year BSc and B Tech students interested in Astronomy in general and Radio Astronomy in particular,"" he said. The students are exposed to a series of lectures by eminent scientists. They also get ample opportunities to carry out simple radio astronomy experiments which in turn exposes them to new developments in radio astrophysics. The students are exposed to radio astronomy techniques, analysis and they learn to interpret from simple hands-on experiments. The students of the winter school are taken on a visit to GMRT (Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope) operated by NCRA, in which they get a see how it functions and how the data processed.

""Motivational speech and interaction with eminent scientists who are pioneers in their fields also takes place. Last year Professor Govind Swaroop , Pioneer in Radio Astronomy and founder of NCRA interaction with the students of winter school. This year, Professor Jayant Narliker, founder and former director of IUCAA will be visiting the students to guide the students on their career path,"" said Jameer.

Subhashis Roy, co ordinator for radio astronomy winter school from NCRA said that it is the only programme which emphasizes on hands- on experiments.

""Majority of students who attend the winter school have gone to some of the finest premier institutes to do their Ph D. The main goal is to provide a platform for training undergraduate students of science and engineering in radio astronomy techniques and instrumentation, thereby generating enough human resources for various national facilities for radio astronomy and also for enhancing Indian participation in international radio astronomy facilities,"" he said."

New Delhi: India's top military officer Monday said the Army, the Navy and the Air Force were in disagreement over the creation of integrated theatre commands.

But he did say the services were moving towards ""jointness"", and the biggest example of this is that wannabe chefs of the Indian Air Force are being taught to cook and serve by the catering school of the Indian Navy -- generally rated the most hospitable force.

Responding to a question at his annual Navy Week press conference Monday, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba said: ""You are right, there are differences.

""The three services have agreed on a permanent chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. The proposal is with the Ministry of Defence.""

A review committee set up by the Central government after the 1999 Kargil war had recommended the creation of the post of a Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) as a single-point military adviser to the government. A 'permanent chairman' is not quite the same.

Admiral Lanba is also chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, and earlier corrected a journalist who had addressed him as 'Permanent Chairman, COSC'.

The chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee is usually the senior-most among the chiefs of the Army, Navy and the Air Force, making him the most senior military officer in the country.

Integrated Theatre Commands (ITC), a concept for a modern military apparatus, has been adopted by most Western countries and also China.

It envisages the creation of a single military machine with a single task -- whether it is for a front or for training purposes -- that would combine under a single 'theatre commander' elements of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.

Proponents of the theatre command concept in India -- most notably the Army -- argue that a multiplicity of commands is obsolete in modern concepts of warfare. Multiplicity of commands also leads to confusion in other spheres.

For example, while China has a single 'Western Theatre Command' on India's north, the Indian Army alone has four commands on the China frontier -- northern, western (which is tasked with the Pakistan front), central and eastern. In addition, there are three commands of the Indian Air Force for the same front.

Such a situation often queers the pitch for India's military diplomacy, as happened in July and August when the Chinese wanted a hotline connection between Indian Army Headquarters in New Delhi and their Western Theatre Command in Chengdu. India rejected the idea on grounds of protocol.

Those who oppose the concept of joint theatre commands -- notably the Indian Air Force -- say the nature of its operations are so fluid that all of India is one theatre. Also, there are issues of who will be the commander of a particular theatre.

The Indian Air Force has proposed a Joint Operations Command (JOCOM).

Lurking behind these differences is the suspicion that senior positions in the IAF and Navy would be subsumed by the Army, by far the largest among the three services.

Admiral Lanba Monday practically brought out these differences into the public sphere for the first time.

""We will have to decide who will be the operations commander here (meaning at headquarters in New Delhi) who would look after all the theatres. Service chiefs cannot be operational commanders,"" he said.

Also read: There is growing civil-military dissonance and acrimony in India's defence ministry

Admiral Lanba's own service, the Navy, will be taking a step towards jointness -- not to be confused with 'integration' -- between January and March 2019.

The Navy's largest drill, called Tropex, that is practically spread across the Indian Ocean Region, will include within it a coastal defence exercise named 'Sea Vigil'. Units of the Army and the Air Force will be involved on both the eastern and western seaboards.

The Navy, as mentioned above, will also be 'catering' to jointness."
"7","1007205835","2018-11-30","http://www.newspatrolling.com/online-learning-and-impact-on-school-education/","Online learning and Impact on School Education","newspatrolling.com",FALSE,"Online education has become popular among working professionals and students in higher education. These categories of online learners find immense benefit in the autonomy, and flexibility, that these courses offer. Online courses can be planned into their schedule, which may include full-time employment, internships and caring for family. It can also help them take out quiet time to study.

Distance learning has been around for a long time, even before technology made it extremely accessible. Traditional schooling is now seeing an increased proliferation of virtual training materials and online courses. Even in a world of tried and tested schooling systems and curricula, the most successful schools are the ones who adapt to the changing times, as well as to the expectations of students, parents and the society. If online education is here to stay, then what are its implications for traditional learning? Instead of focusing on pros and cons, the conversation we should be having today is about leveraging online education to make our education systems more conducive to learning.

Online courses call for a greater amount motivation and self-discipline than a classroom-based course. A classroom has one or more instructors and peers, who can hold a student accountable for their course-work. In contrast, online courses involve setting our own goals, tracking progress and meeting deadlines. One does not learn in isolation, so online courses do offer discussion forums, email and one-on-one support. Technology also adds on to the visual experience by incorporating animations, that can be used interactively for effective teaching, and communication.

The classroom advantage

A school provides structure, support, and a system of rewards and penalties to groom its students. Classroom education has the benefit of face-to-face interactions with peers, which are typically moderated by a teacher. It provides children, especially those in their early developmental years, with a stable environment for social interactions, helping them develop skills like boundary setting, empathy and cooperation. This also allows plenty of room for spontaneity, unlike a virtual learning setup.

Online education in the context of schooling

As students' progress to higher classes, they seek more autonomy and intellectual freedom. Online learning can help them pursue highly individualised learning programmes, possibly even college level courses. These, combined with hands-on exercises, real world exploration, and thorough assessments, can be highly beneficial to their learning progress. They can explore their options, by trying out introductory topics from different fields, before committing to a specialization. Online learning platforms can help these students become more independent learners, before they make their way into college. I believe that we must not hold students back from picking any online course, but instead act as their guide as they navigate through it.

Mobile apps that provide enhanced learning opportunities for school children have become mainstream. Since mobile phones have already found their way into their hands, these apps are being used to supplement classroom learning. Teachers and parents need to act as anchors and mentors, curating the kind of educational content students are exposed to, during the tricky phase of finding the right career to pursue.

Virtual public schools, that offer a full scale K12 education, have already sprung up in some parts of the world. They even offer a combination of the traditional system with online education. There are programmes that provide support to families that wish to home-school their children, in the form of online course material. These programmes bring parents and teachers into the fold, by involving them into their child's education from the get go. However, their effectiveness in the long term needs to be studied.

Online learning programmes will also open up opportunities for children from weaker socio-economic communities, who possess a limited access to learning resources i.e. teachers, text books and infrastructure. It will connect them to a global network of online learners, exposing them to new perspectives. The ideas that they receive, will not be limited by the number of heads in one classroom.

Online education for educators

Online education can also be designed to be accommodating of a variety of learning styles among students. As educators, it is likely that we will have to put in additional efforts to incorporate online learning programmes into the curriculum, in the most suitable manner.

Online training programmes are helping teachers/educators advance their skills in curriculum implementation, policy, education systems and leadership, both independently and with the support of their institutions. It lets them collaborate with their peers, and learn new instructional skills, that are relevant to their career. These programmes can help them develop new skills and capabilities in their students, with the help of technology and interdisciplinary approaches.

As the overlap of the traditional and online educational worlds is becoming more and more inevitable, we owe it to our students to make their education relevant to their future, through our own ingenuity, passion and careful planning.

Now you would definitely expect a group of 12-year-olds to chirp aloud like a group of cockatoos. But, boy oh boy, was I wrong or what? This bunch was busy stacking up paper cups. Now what on earth could they be doing, I wondered. ""They're learning how to code,"" the instructor, Borve Kharsyntiew, tells me.

Cup stack coding, a technique where children are taught the basics of coding, programming and robotics is relatively new and is gaining popularity in city schools slowly. Thanks to Amazon and Play Learn Foundation, the students of this tiny school in a remote village on the fringes of Chennai is getting a hang of STEM education. ""Here, we are teaching them the basics of Mechanics and Physics and how to write a program through day-to-day activities. It's best to start early. By the end of the term, they also get to work with a robot,"" says Borve. These classes are conducted for students between grade II and VIII.

The initiative has also provided the school with LCD projectors and laptops, enabling smart classrooms. The school's Headmistress, Tamil Arasi, notes how these have helped in increasing the enrollment rate in the school and getting children to attend classes regularly. ""These children are very keen to attend the robotics classes where they were taught about motors, the gear mechanism, lever and pulleys, which they learn practically. The attendance is high on Mondays and these children do not skip any class now,"" she notes.

For the past couple of years, Amazon has been working closely with the people of five villages helping the women and children to live better lives. Next, we go to the Amazon Cares community centre in the village. Women and college students are trained here in stitching, embroidery, jewellery making, handicrafts and computers. We speak to Shahida Begum, a young mother, who couldn't control her excitement about her newfound earning. ""In a couple of weeks, I've almost perfected tailoring. I stitch for my family and get orders from the neighbours. That's not just it. A few days ago, the tailor who used to stitch my clothes took a few tips from me,"" she laughs.

It is an 8th grade science class. Students are learning the concepts of Force and Pressure. The lesson starts off with activities, involving them in a game -- a tug of war or arm wrestling each other. Throughout the lesson, there are several images and videos that demonstrate the concepts.

Their homework for the day is to help at home in preparing rotis, which would involve activities such as separating the hardened dough, rolling it etc -- all connected to the concepts that they had studied earlier that day.

This is how a lesson looks like, in a class that uses the application developed by the Bengaluru-based organisation Meghashala (School in the Cloud). Lesson plans for Grades 1 to 8 for the subjects English, Math, Social Studies and Science, which are in sync with the Karnataka State syllabus, are developed by the organization and made available through their app on Google Store since 2017.

""We ensure that our lessons cater to the needs of the students at different learning levels, and of different learning styles. Our lessons include a lot of activities, images,videos and they are always related to real life experiences,"" says Sharvari Tilloo, Product Lead with Meghshala.

Mallikarjuniah teaches Mathematics, English and Science to grades 5th, 6th and 7th and regularly uses the application with the tablet and projector provided by Meghshala to his school GPHS Kodathi in Bengaluru. He observes how earlier he had found it extremely challenging to teach concepts such as elements and compounds, and now through the app, through visuals and activities, students are able to have a deeper understanding of concepts.

His views are echoed by Suneetha T, who teaches at GPHS Chikkadevasandra in Bengaluru. She mentions how student participation and engagement in class have increased since she started using the app two years ago. She mentions how students are able to navigate the app on their own on the tablet and revise chapters in the rare occasions where she has to step out of class to do administrative work. The success that she has found upon using the lesson plans provided by the application has encouraged three other teachers in the school to use the application. Currently they have formed a time table, based on which they access the tablet and the projector.

While there have been several interventions in primary and elementary education in the past two decades such as the District Primary Education Program (DPEP) in the 1990s, or the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) scheme in the early 2000s, most of these interventions have focused on increasing enrollment and ensuring adequate infrastructure in schools; not on quality teaching and learning outcomes. The abysmal learning levels of the students in both government and private schools are evident from the outcomes of the yearly Annual Status of Education Report since 2005.

There is a direct correlation between quality of teaching and student learning levels. Student learning levels are bound to be low if government school teachers are constantly disheartened and demotivated. A significant number of teachers working in government schools face several challenges (varying in degree from state to state) including having to teach in schools that are understaffed where they would have to combine multiple sections/classes, or facilitate learning for students who are at varied grade levels in the same class. Most of the trainings that they receive do not factor in these realities.

There is always constant pressure from the administration to ensure that the syllabus is complete; which takes priority over learning outcomes. The administration seems to value provision of requested information on time, proper record keeping of attendance / midday meals etc, more than learning outcomes.

An earlier article in this series points to poor quality training and curriculum at Teacher Education Institutions, teachers having to spend a large portion of their time on administrative work, promotions being based on tenure and not performance, as some of the reasons for poor quality of government schooling in Bengaluru.

Meghshala believes that the most effective way to transform the ailing education system in the country is by focusing on the heart of the education system - the teachers, by empowering them to lead enlightened classrooms.

""I have been grappling for over a decade with questions of and the need to provide equitable education to all. The sheer number of students in the country that were not receiving quality education was overwhelming, and it wasn't until improvements in technology, that I could think of a solution that could start addressing these concerns,"" says Jyoti Thyagarajan, an educator with over 40 years of experience across the globe, who co-founded Meghshala in 2014.

Once the first versions of the app was designed, thirty government schools in Bengaluru were selected as sandbox or test schools, and a set of one laptop/ tablet and a projector was provided to each school. The app was modified based on the feedback provided by the teachers, and was released in 2017 on Google Play Store.

Currently Meghashala says they support 180 schools in 13 districts of Karnataka. 98 schools located in Bengaluru are provided with a tablet and a projector. One teacher is selected as a Meghshala Fellow from the school, who receives technical support from the Meghshala team, and continues to provide feedback about the tools. Manjunath H M, Implementation Lead at Meghshala says that in several schools the Fellow having found the application to be beneficial has encouraged other teachers to use them as well. And in such schools time tables have been created based on which teachers access the tablet and projector. There have been instances where the school leader has approached corporate organizations to donate projectors, so that more teachers can use the app simultaneously.

Manjunath points to how the response among teachers and schools have been very varied across districts and blocks in Karnataka. In the southern blocks of Bengaluru, the responses from teachers have been positive, whereas the responses from the northern blocks haven't been to that extent. The app is able to capture the teacher usage information, and they are still in the process of analysing the data to understand why certain schools have higher usage than others.

Meghshala plans to develop 10 models schools in the various blocks across 13 districts where they work. Through the meetings called by the Block Education Officer (BEO) who have constantly supported them, they are reaching out to a large number of teachers. During these meetings, the teachers are introduced to the app, are encouraged to download the app on to their phones and use them in class. Manjunath points to how teachers from the blocks and districts where they don't have a presence are unable to use the app, as they are discouraged by higher authorities from using smartphones in the class.

Meghashala is currently in the process of signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Karnataka State Government, which would allow them to conduct their training and introduce the app to Master Trainers at every District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) in Karnataka. The master trainers would then introduce the app to all the teachers during the training at the Block level. The reach would be much higher where all teachers in the state are familiarised with the app and its usage, compared to Meghashala's current interventions at the block level.

At present, based on feedback the app is being revamped, redeveloped and a newer version will be available on Google Play Store by end of November 2018. Lesson plans in Hindi and English based on the NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) syllabus will be an addition to the upcoming version of the app.This would enable and encourage a lot more teachers across the country, who follow the NCERT syllabus to use the application.

There are other initiatives that aim to support teachers such as The teacher App that currently provides resources to teachers in Hindi through interactive videos on core concepts in Pedagogy, Science, Math and Language. Teachers of India, an initiative by Azim Premji Foundation, provides resources in Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and English for teacher educators, teachers and others working in the field of education.

The Ministry of Human Resource Development( MHRD) has in the past year launched a digital initiative called Diksha that provides online resources for teachers in several languages, and is available as app. The content partners for this initiative include Meghshala, The teacher App, Teacher of India, Tata Institute of Social Science and several other organisations.

Several teachers from Bengaluru have spoken about the usefulness of the lesson plans in the app and Meghshala through its advocacy is in the process of reaching out to many more teachers in Karnataka and India.

While Meghshala provides the resource for school teachers to facilitate learning of concepts to children better at different learning levels and different learning styles, there is the need for several systemic changes, in order for teachers to truly benefit from it and other such initiatives. Teachers will only be able to perform average work at best if they have to manage several classes/sections due to shortage of teachers in their school. There will be a shift in teachers taking initiatives to ensure student learning if they work and performance are recognized. As mentioned above quality education and learning outcomes aren't prioritised. There needs to be a move towards this, and away from merely completion of syllabus and administrative tasks."

Since 1957, Anna Kirchgater Elementary School, named after a legendary strict no-nonsense Elk Grove grammar school teacher with high expectations for all students, the school's population has doubled to nearly 700. New to Kirchgater, Principal Cheri Sanchez aims to continue the school's rich tradition of setting high expectations and have all students perform at or above grade level in reading.

Principal Sanchez noted literacy as a long-time goal at Kirchgater, and recent changes have resulted in soaring student success with this year's state assessment scores rising over 8 percent. The state average increase was only 1 percent. With the increased emphasis on reading, the school anticipates double digit improvement each year to eventually become a high performing school within the next three to five years, ranking amongst the finest that the Elk Grove Unified School District has to offer.

The approach is simple at Kirchgater; it is to teach to each child's individual reading level and assess their progress throughout the school year. Principal Sanchez says, ""Our belief is that if we truly understand where each child's instructional needs are, we will be capable of addressing these needs and will be able to bring them up to grade level or beyond in a relatively short period of time."" To uphold this belief, each teacher explicitly teaches their students at their instructional reading levels each day through the use of an approach called Guided Reading -- a method of teaching reading where the teacher guides students in small group instruction to fill in their gaps of knowledge and bring them up to the next level. The increase in student performance has also made a positive change in the school's culture as students are more confident in themselves and caring of others."

By Ritika Jain

Of late, I had been pondering over ways in which I could contribute towards a social cause. I often see intolerance around us and think that it boils down to education to cure people of this malaise. So when a neighbour asked me if I would fill in for her at a local MCD school, I readily agreed to teach English to Grade 3 kids. The classes are for one hour, thrice a week. It may seem like a small step but I'm sure even the smallest pebble causes a ripple. Initially, I had thought taking out three hours in a week isn't a big deal but once you commit, it's a fixed task in your schedule and teaching isn't something you take up casually. For one, the kids get attached to you and actually look forward to the next class. Their eagerness to learn, in turn, is actually what keeps you going.

When I started, the first thing I noticed is the irregular attendance at the government-aided school. Compared to my daughter's reputed public school, where you need to take a leave application for missing even one day of school, this is the norm here because most of the parents are day labourers who themselves don't understand the importance of good education or aren't much bothered about the kid's homework at the end of a hard day. I was also shocked to see the gap in the vocabulary of a third grader here versus that in an elite private school. It's not that the kids aren't intelligent, but just that nobody reads to them and nobody in their vicinity speaks with them in English. In fact, their Hindi is far better than kids in private schools.

I would like to illustrate this with an anecdote. I had figured out a way in which I could have them all engaged simultaneously, by drawing whatever we had learnt in class. Each one of them loves to get a 'star' and a 'very good' at the end of each class. I had asked them to observe and describe their classroom. I would explain the usage of 'There is' and 'There are' as we went along and sometimes offer to translate certain words to Hindi, their first language. I told them rules mean Niyam and cupboard means Almaari. Then, pointing to a map, I said map. Quickly, a bright young spark corrected me and said Naksha. So it wasn't one-sided, I internally chuckled to know I was being taught too.

I hope to keep them interested by way of inclusive activities, where even a non-reader can contribute and gradually pick up pace to match a student that can read an entire passage. As for spoken English, they get bonus points simply for trying, especially when they aren't too confident of using a word. I hope this small nudge will propel them towards better opportunities in the future and make them believe that they can strive for more than what their immediate environment would have them believe they're good for.

If only I could give you a glimpse into this classroom, where naughtiness goes hand in hand with innocence, where the fights are about who will bring a chair for the teacher and who knows more about Halloween; the smiles and 'V-signs' that go up when you take their photograph; so you'll know that kids are kids no matter where they come from. Their upbringing might be different but they all respond to praise and encouragement, and they all want to share their stories."

Both students and teachers should be thanked for setting such a good example for other schools to follow.

To build a strong mathematics base among rural children, the Government Higher Primary School Narayanpur village conducts ""Maggi Suggi"" (recitation of multiplication table) session from 3.50 pm to 4.30 pm every day.

Though it sounds quite common, its impact on children's learning ability is high. The session is being conducted for the past seven years.

Widely known among villagers as 'Maggi Share' (school of table), students recite multiplication table up to 50 and also in reverse order. Even students of lower classes recite table up to 25 and special training is being given every day to those who are unable to catch the pace of learning of other students.

Ambikadevi Malipatil, a student, said: ""We love to memorise tables. Now I am in the 4th standard and I can easily memorise tables from 1 to 50. I can also say tables from 50 to 1 without stopping. The session helps us solve problems in mathematics."""

Education, during one's formative years, is of paramount importance. It is also the most cost-effective in terms of money spent on education at any stage of a child's life. James Heckman, in 2007, showed that the emotional, social and physical development of young children has a direct effect on their overall future development. That is why investing in young children is so important. However, according to the World Bank's 2018 World Development Report and UNESCO, millions of students in developing countries are in schools that are failing to educate them to the level that they should have, with 617 million children and youth of primary- and secondary-school age not learning the basics in reading -- shockingly, two-thirds of them are attending school.

The need to invest early education is clear, as also is the need for data and statistics on learning outcomes of children of primary/secondary school age. Such outcomes are studied and analysed by collecting data on children's ability to read and comprehend what they are reading. The ability to read enables children to access curricula and is thus a good indicator of whether the education system is doing its job. Reading makes them independent learners for life, reduces the cost of schooling, and raises the efficiency of public spending. With appropriate data available, the progress of each student/class/sub-section can be studied and, accordingly, beneficial policy responses can be designed that fulfil the child's development potential. Early grade assessments have produced national learning studies for more than 80 countries, including ASER in India. Such globally-shared metrics of learning, which can be compared across countries and over time, have enormous value. Crucially, they also show that the global learning crisis is deep. But, this is only the first step. Above and beyond metrics of learning, education and learning policies have to be designed and implemented. To that end, the Union government in India tying financial incentives for states, under the centrally-sponsored schemes, to the latter improving learning outcomes is a welcome move."

We value outdoor learning as much as indoor learning and invest a lot of time and planning to provide children with unique, safe, rich and dynamic experiences in our natural outdoor play spaces. Our outdoor activities provide children with a range of engaging and challenging opportunities to explore freely, develop physically, take risks, solve problems and grow in confidence while playing independently and collaboratively.

ELV outdoors offer children opportunities to play in the treehouse, vegetable farm, musical garden, sensory path and sensory fountain. All these activities are on the lines of international practices as the Co - founders of the school-Ms Priya Saxena, Ms Priya Dhawan and Ms Heba Zaidi Khosla, have taught at The British School and other global schools.

At Early Learning Village, ELV teachers work in small groups, with each teacher responsible for a group size of 4 - 6 children. Small group work increases the attention and focus the child receives. A unique feature of the school is that it encourages one of the parent of the child to be present during the first few days of transition.

The teachers at ELV are qualified teachers, who go through initial hand holding and shadow sessions and then work daily to master their expertise. This is important as it helps them align their knowledge and skills with the international curricula that this school offers. They make the children adept in storytelling, rhymes, phonics, coloring, art and crafts, painting, drawing, dance, music, singing, drama, theatre. There are specific classes for gardening, pottery, no flame cooking, etc.

ELV has partnered with 'Music Together' for music sessions, Art of Sport for physical development session and 'My dance academy' for dance session for their children. Field trips and story are a regular feature at ELV. ELV is more than just a workplace, it is a community of like-minded people who have come together for a common purpose - ""children first"".

ELV resonates compassion, love and laugher among all its stakeholders. It is a vibrant place for learning, for one and for all."

Ensuring all children are in school is the first step towards ensuring quality of education. However, India is home to the largest number of out of school children in Asia and second highest in the world.

Estimates of the exact numbers vary, ranging from 226 lakh in the National Sample Survey (2009-10) to 381 lakh in Census 2011 and 60 lakh according to MHRD.

Even greater numbers of out of school adolescents exist. Concrete plans need to be put in place to ensure that these children are not deprived of educational opportunities.

The Right to Education Act, 2009 (RTE) provides for all governments to provide 'special training' for out-of-school children and puts the onus on them to mainstream them into formal schooling system at age-appropriate level.

State governments are responsible for planning, designing and implementation of programmes to bring out of school children into school and ensure age appropriate admission.

Unfortunately, comprehensive national analysis of implementation of accelerated learning provision is missing. We undertook a study on the implementation of this provision for Accelerated Learning in four states which provides some indication on how these are implemented. Standalone studies for accelerated programmes in other states also exist.

While most states have guidelines for implementation of special training, these have frequently not reached the district level and have not formed the basis of orientation of concerned officials. Clear delineation of the roles and responsibilities to specific officials has also not been done resulting in poor roll out.

There is also no consistency in terms of the qualifications and working conditions of teachers providing special training leading to poor quality of teaching.

Poorly qualified teachers frequently fail to understand and transact subject content and are unable to address psycho-social needs of out of school children.

Poor salaries have been found to lead to high levels of attrition among teachers. In all four states studied by us, special training teachers were not satisfied with training provided to them.

Teaching dropouts and never enrolled children is a difficult task and calls for the hiring of the best teachers, which is almost never done. Monitoring mechanisms of these centres have also varied.

This calls for exploring new and different approaches to ensuring that India's youth is educated and no one is left behind through innovative methods. In order to achieve this, the content should be flexible, curriculum, materials and pedagogy accelerated, gender sensitive and inclusive and promote empowerment and psychosocial well-being.

Special training should be undertaken in inclusive and safe learning environments by teachers who are adequately qualified, supervised and remunerated, and who receive adequate opportunities for continuous professional development. The centres must be effectively managed and run in close tandem with the community.

Behind patchy delivery of special training is limited fund flow from the government. Recent budgetary analyses, like a recent study undertaken by CBGA, point towards high disparities between approved allocations and actual expenditure on mainstreaming out of school children."

Today, they can not only read and write difficult words, but can pronounce them with a proper accent, all thanks to the efforts of their teacher.

Meet Radha Kumari K S , English teacher at BBMP Higher Primary School at Tasker Town in Shivajinagar where 121 students are studying from Classes 1 to 7. Her teaching methods go out of the textbook so that every single child recognises words and understands the meaning.

A Bachelor's degree holder in Arts (BA) with English Major, followed by a Diploma in Education, Radha studied in Kannada medium till PU II, all through in government schools and colleges at Kolar. Radha just learnt English like any of her classmates -- to read, write and pass exams.

""When I opted for BA with English Major, I was scared. Initially, it was very difficult to understand. But then slowly, I started reading with the help of a dictionary and I started enjoying the language,'' she said.

Radha adores her teacher Deepa who taught her while she was studying DEd. ""Deepa would teach us English teaching methodology with a passion. I then decided to take tips from her. This is my seventh year at the BBMP school. I make sure the children like me first. Once they like the teacher, they will start loving the toughest of subject,'' she added.

When this reporter visited the school, she was teaching the chapter 'How do Bees Make Honey' to Class 6 students. Instead of just reading and explaining the meaning, Radha had drawings of the bee on the blackboard.

She even got her students to make beehives using cardboard and asking them to cut it in hexagonal shapes while another set of children drew honeybees. Children learnt the word hexa (six) and even started explaining how honey is made. Needless to say, they explained in English.

'Chose profession to help kids achieve their dreams'

Radha uses simple methods. She teaches English words along with Kannada meaning. She also teaches them rhyming words which help children recognise different words with similar pronunciation.

What makes her job all the more challenging is that the children studying here, who are from an economically poor background, speak different languages -- Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil and Urdu. ""This is the most challenging when I am teaching them pronunciations,'' she says. ""I too had dreams like these children to become a doctor engineer or lawyer, but could not become one. But I have chosen a profession that can lay the foundation to help these children achieve their dreams,'' she beams.

Twelve-year-old Steven told TNIE that his father is a cab driver and mother a domestic help. He wants to become a lawyer and travel across the globe. ""I need to learn English to study law. If I travel to different countries, I need English again. I like the way Radha ma'am teaches us.''

Mogan Kumar, who speaks Tamil at home, wants to become a software engineer. Both his parents are tailors. ""After Radha ma'am's class, I try to converse in English with my friends to improve my language,'' he says. Ganesh, a Class 7 student whose father works as watchman at a shop on Cunningham Road, said, ""Radha ma'am makes us feel that English is a easy language,'' he said."

The Delhi government suspended the vice-principal of a government school on Friday -- the day of her retirement -- for allegedly keeping a part of the money meant for teachers to purchase teaching-learning material.

Gomti Devi, the vice-principal of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya (Annie Besant) in Mayur Vihar's Phase II, was suspended after an inquiry was conducted. When contacted, Devi said she was being victimised for being from the scheduled caste.

An order issued on August 30 by Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash read, ""In exercise of power conferred by sub rule (1) of Rule 10 of CCS Rules 1995 hereby places Gomti Devi under suspension with immediate effect. It is further ordered that during the period that this order shall remain in force, the headquarters of Gomti Devi should be in Delhi and shall not leave the headquarter without obtaining permission.""

According to the government, teachers are given Rs 500 to purchase teaching-learning material, which includes, stationery, globes, maps and charts. The government has alleged Devi was giving Rs 350 from the amount to teachers, and keeping Rs 150, claiming it was ""GST deduction"".

Education Minister Manish Sisodia had ordered the inquiry following complaints. Following the completion of the inquiry, she was suspended.

Devi, when contacted, said: ""The Education Minister and the Director, Education, had come to the school for inspection. The computer lab was not working so I told them I have informed the company and officers about it. As I raised my voice against the officer, I am being subjected to this.

I have been in this school for the past five years.""

She said she received the suspension notice at 12.30 pm on Friday: ""Now they will stop my gratuity and all financial benefits. I don't know what to do.""

However, around 50 teachers of city-based Navrachana School have designed innovative board games which will draw the students out of the mobile phones, throw challenges at them and create a fun learning experience.

After working for six months, the team of teachers has created at least 200 board games which are based on lessons of NCERT books. Teachers of five subjects - social studies, science, mathematics, English and Hindi - have done their own research and created board games for students of class I to class VIII.

""Currently these games are made on the basis of first two chapters and we will expand these to later chapters. The board games are helpful for introduction, recapitulation and testing students,"" said Kashmira Jaiswal, vice-principal of the school who conducted a workshop for teachers on 'Gaming in Classroom'. She added that there are elements of excitement, winning and scientific pedagogy in these games and teachers can also spend less time on chalk and talk method of teaching.

The games are designed on the lines of games like snakes and ladders, tic tac toe and playing cards where children also have to answer the questions from their syllabi posed at them through the games and the evaluation is done by their classmates.

The games have also been helpful to students who are slow learners. ""Slow learners take days to understand something which is taught in a traditional way, but through these games they can learn concepts quickly because these games encourage them to think,"" Jaiswal said."

At the 65th Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) meet held earlier this year, the Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar declared the launch of 'Operation Digital Board' in all schools within five years. This reminds us of a similar effort in 1987 when 'Operation Blackboard' sought to provide minimum, essential facilities to improve the quality of primary schooling. Unfortunately, 30 years later, the larger political discourse for improving learning continues to prioritise infrastructure enhancement. Such initiatives indicate that teaching-learning is seen as a largely teacher-directed process, focusing on transmission of information to students. Seymour Papert, the famous MIT professor of media technology and once lonely evangelist for personal computers in classrooms, had said: ""Nothing could be more absurd than an experiment in which computers are placed in a classroom where nothing else is changed"".

Technology has the power to disrupt the traditional classroom space by giving students more agency and pushing teachers to reconsider their roles as experts.

Recognising this, the Connected Learning Initiative (CLIx), a technology programme for high school students, was seed-funded by Tata Trusts in early 2015, and it is being delivered through a collaboration with MIT Boston and Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) Mumbai. CLIx aims to demonstrate effective and sustainable changes in classroom learning, using ICT to both improve student learning and create effective models of teacher professional development.

An ecosystem of collaborators has spearheaded the design, development and implementation of CLIx, including Eklavya, Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, and a number of strategic national partners and the state governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram and Telangana, to impact 478 government schools, 2,130 teachers and 32,437 students as a 'proof of concept'. CLIx also recently won the UNESCO King Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa Prize for the use of ICT in education.

CLIx reaffirms the vision of the National Curriculum Framework (2005) to provide opportunities to students to be ""producers"" rather than ""consumers"" of information through ""hands-on"" time with computers to learn digital skills, as well as develop deeper understanding of the subject matter.

CLIx modules aim to improve digital skills, conceptual understanding in maths and science, communicative english and values for the 21st century for high school students. To support use of CLIx student modules, professional development courses for teachers are made available in the massive open online course (MOOC) format and can be accessed via smartphones. The teacher courses are hosted on a platform called TISSx, which is modelled on the lines of Open edX platform.

What we need today is not smart board technology that will make teaching easier, but dynamic technology tools that give students opportunities to think and create. ICT, when used to its full potential, can change the learning culture from an authoritative teacher-led one to a student-led one. It's not too late to reimagine the Operation Digital Board.

The school students will learn braille from Annie, the first self learning Braille literacy device in the country developed by Bangalore based start-up, Thinkerbell Labs.

A total of 20 Annie-s, complete with a digital Braille slate, a braille keyboard and a braille display were officially launched in Ranchi on Tuesday. These devices are designed to instruct the students in learning both Hindi and English braille through voice commands in Hindi language.

""Braille literacy is extremely low in the country because learning the language needs person to person contact. The teachers need to spend time with the students individually. Annie, which is a voice coordinated device, eliminates the need of a teacher's physical presence and teaches the students through voice commands. The biggest upside is the instantaneous feedback, as a student can understand that they are making a mistake as soon as they enter a letter,"" said Avinash Kothuri, project manager at Thinkerbell Labs, which is a part of Startup India Project.

A team of nine students from BITS Pilani Goa and other colleges of national repute, the prototype of Annie was inspired by the lack of braille teachers in India.

""The employment rates of visually impaired individuals is co related with braille literacy. Many do not have access to private tutoring and learning in groups of as small as eight students can be arduous. Though a lot technological developments have been made in increasing braille reading, Annie is the first device developed for teaching the language instead,"" added Kothuri.

Deputy commissioner Ranchi, Rai Mahimapat Ray told TOI: ""The device is aimed at improving the rate of Braille literacy through an interactive interface. Since we have one blind school in the district, the pilot project has been launched there. But in case any other schools or organisations want to use the device, they can contact us.""

Dr Louis Marandi, minister of minority and social welfare and women and child development was present at the launch event. ""This is a revolutionary device for boosting the Braille literacy numbers. We will soon be expanding the project to all the blind schools and institutions in the state so that more and more people can benefit from it,"" said Marandi."

In a short span, the project has helped in catapulting the quality of education by introducing initiatives to elevate the teaching practices and empathy-based teacher enablement initiatives, which means a teacher uses techniques after understanding the family background or community of the students.

'Project Inclusion', yet another programme introduced by the society is changing the image of government schools.

Under the project, 7,500 teachers have received special training and 4,000 possible cases of Neuro developmental Disorder (NDD) in students have been detected by teachers.

Rawani says,""Teachers participated in three or five days orientation programmes, so, now teachers identify student with NDD and we provide special training to them."" The Ministry of Human Resource Development has also recognised significance of this programme, which will be extended to schools in Leh."

""The effect on families is not trivial, and it's been under-appreciated. It's always good to ask families about stress and anxiety if they report concerns about academics.""

Waber and her colleagues developed a survey-based screening instrument to gauge the effects of learning problems on the child's and family's quality of life. They first sent a 35-question survey to 151 families whose child had been referred to them for evaluation of learning disabilities. They then shortened the survey to 15 questions and sent it to families in a single lower- to middle-income school district in the greater Boston area.

Of the 325 parents or guardians who completed the revised survey, 93 had children who had been identified as having learning problems and were receiving special education support on formal Individualized Education Plans. The remaining 232 had children in general education.

Survey questions focused on such issues as parents' anxiety about their children, children's anxiety and frustration over school work, children taking a long time to complete homework, having to limit family activities because of homework and family stress caused by the child's learning problems.

Psychological fallout

The two groups showed a dramatic difference. Compared with the general education group, parents of children with learning problems reported significantly more quality-of-life problems related to academics, for both the child and the family. Quality-of-life problems fell in the ""at risk"" or ""clinically significant"" range in half of the learning problems group, versus only 15 percent of the general education group.

The quality-of-life impacts of learning problems were greater for middle-school-age children than younger elementary-age children, and were greater in boys than girls, with the gender difference widening in the older grades. However, families of children with and without learning problems gave relatively similar ratings to teachers and school support systems, suggesting that they did not blame shortcomings of the school for the child/family distress.

Waber and her colleagues now routinely give the survey to parents whose children are being evaluated in the Learning Disabilities Program. They plan to follow up a year later to see whether quality of life has improved and, if so, to what extent the improvement is related to how the schools responded to the evaluation. Since the survey is easy to administer through an online link, Waber hopes to see others adopt it.

""We hope its use will make schools, other educators and pediatricians more aware of the distress children with learning problems and their families may be experiencing and take steps to address it,"" Waber says.

Actually it is the beginning of a new one, and perhaps a more fulfilling one, as former Assam Director General of Police (DGP), Mukesh Sahay, has proven by taking up a teaching assignment in a government school in Guwahati.

These days, the retired top cop, who hung up his boots earlier this year, teaches mathematics to class 12 students of Sonaram Higher Secondary School in Guwahati.

Talking about his teaching experience after working in the police department for close to 34 years, the Bihar-born IPS officer told ANI, ""I do this for my happiness and the benefit of the students. This is a small effort towards the development of students.""

Regarding what prompted him to be a teacher of the co-educational school established in 1936 near the banks of mighty Brahmaputra River that flows through the heart of the city, Sahay told Firstpost, ""It all happened when the school invited me for a programme last year as a chief guest.""

""While enquiring about the history of the school, I found they do not have a mathematics teacher. So, I told them that I could step in to fill the void. But it was difficult when I was in service as I could not commit to a particular time. Such was my nature of work. After I retired, I called up the principal to inquire if there is a need for my services. The principal told me to come as no one had joined till then,"" he added.

The well-respected retired top cop added that teaching is a learning experience for him.

""Even though I have to teach in the vernacular, I have no problem. Mathematics has its own language. Whether it is in Assamese, English, Bengali or Hindi, it doesn't matter, unlike literature subjects. It is more of a learning experience for me than teaching experience,"" Sahay, who is a postgraduate in science and a trained lawyer, told Firstpost.

The students and teachers of the government school are also very happy to have a teacher like Sahay who is a well-respected and learned figure of the northeastern state.

For those who are leading a sedate post-retirement life or are about to retire from their jobs, Sahay is a true inspiration to make best use of knowledge, experience and time and give back something to society."

Sources said that presently, if a class VIII student studies a certain chapter, he/she may forget about it by the time he/she reaches class IX where he/she reads a new chapter on the topic.

To prevent such a situation, an ""introductory system"" will be initiated before beginning every chapter with a view to providing a quick revision for the student.

This, according to state education minister Vinod Tawde, will provide continuity and maintain an overall circle of education for every student. ""In the new up-gradation of the curriculum, it will be based on the spiral methodology.

Here, it will maintain a continuous process where the student will remember what he or she learned in the previous academic year, thus creating a strong base for the students.""

Mr Tawde said that the idea was suggested by education experts and was approved by the board of studies which also includes teachers.

Department officials said that only the textbooks and manner of teaching will change and not the syllabus. Also, latest developments will be included in the chapters instead of old ones. ""Students will find it interesting when they are given examples and chapters which they are familiar with,"" said an official.

According to experts however, upgrading the curriculum alone will not be enough; what is required is a change in the assessment and evaluation process.

Fr Francis Swamy, joint secretary, Archdiocesan Board of Education (ABE), and former board member, said, ""We are still stuck in the old procedure when what we need is an application-based curriculum. It should be in a way that the students are prompted to think and reflect. Instead of just learning and reproducing it in the exam, we should make the system action-oriented."""

Adani Foundation Chairperson, Dr Priti Adani, and Cambridge University Press Chief Executive, Mr. Peter Phillips, signed the Letter of Intent.

According to them, the objective of this collaboration is to introduce a futuristic teaching-learning experience into the Indian education system.

The Adani-Cambridge collaboration will focus on three key futuristic educational initiatives. First is the introduction of 'Coding' in Indian schools to hone proficiency of learners in computer science and Information and Communication Technology.

The 'Coding Sandpit' program is aligned with the government's 'Digital India' initiative with an aim to develop computational thinking skills of students and introduce coding for schools from Class 1 to 8 to solve complex problems.

Secondly, the cross-border collaboration plans to roll out the Cambridge Language Solution, a digital language lab for schools specifically focused on sharpening the two important skills of listening and speaking.

The Adani Foundation and Cambridge University Press also plan to introduce eight level methodology books consistent with the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) and National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) guidelines to offer a natural acquisition of English via a comprehensive input approach.

The Adani Foundation hopes to take its mission of 'Brighter Thinking; Better Learning' forward with the immense experience and thought leadership of Cambridge to schools across India.

This collaboration is poised to be one of the leading educational programs by Adani Foundation, and is aimed at fulfilling the potential to groom future leaders for India.

For these tribal students near Mumbai, school is one hour away ","Hindustan Times",FALSE,"Lalita Dhole, a domestic help, dreams of providing the best education to her children. Her biggest worry is not how they will perform in their exams, but their safety. Her apprehension stems from the fact that her children have to meander through a rut road and a forest for an hour before reaching school.

Dhole is not from one of the BIMARU states, but a satellite town of Mumbai, Thane, which boasts of world-class educational institutes and a throbbing commercial apparatus.

The anxiety is shared by parents, most of them illiterate, from 16 tribal hamlets in Thane, whose children have to overcome several obstacles.

""No vehicles enter our area due to the kuchha road. There are no streetlights, which make us worried that animals may attack our children. During the monsoon, it becomes impossible to send them to schools because of waterlogging,"" says Dhole.

Amid talks of making Maharashtra a trillion-dollar economy by 2025, education seems to be a luxury, not a basic right for students from tribal hamlets in Kasar Vadavali at Ghodbunder Road and Yeoor Hills. Even the Right to Education Act, passed nine years ago, has not nudged the Thane authorities to make education more accessible by building roads and ironing out other mobility issues.

However, Takadapada and Paankhanda villages, which are 3km-4km from the hamlets, have schools till Class 8.

Most hilly padas are home to Warli tribes, with no access to electricity and water. One of the tribal hamlets in Kasar Vadavali, Pachvadpada, which is half an hour away from Thane station, overlooks high-rises. Seventy families living in the pada are labourers or work as house helps in these high-rises.

""As our parents never sent us to school, we don't want this thing to happen to our children. Though we have enrolled them in schools, there are various problems, which make it difficult for them to continue education,"" says Anita Dhandekar, resident of Pachvadpada. The nearest school for Anita's son is at Takadapada, and he leaves an hour before the school time.

One class too many at kindergarten

The fallout of far-off schools is that tribal children, even 10-years-old, are studying in a kindergarten (balwadi centre) at Pachvadpada, run by a non-governmental organisation, Hari Om Trekkers.

Manisha Rathore, who is now a Class 5 student studying at Anmol Vidyalaya (an aided school) at Vasant Vihar in Thane, used to go to the kindergarten along with eight other children. ""Most parents prefer sending their children to this balwadi because they aren't many schools nearby. Students who are eight or ten years old are still studying here because they can't go alone to school. Another incentive is that the centre provides meals too,"" says Nandkumar Nikte, volunteer at the balwadi.

TMC schools

NGO Matrushakti Sevanyas runs a hostel for tribal girls, including Manisha Rathore, in Vasant Vihar. These students complain about the quality of education at schools run by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), says Sandhya Sawant, founder of the NGO. Now, they are happy that they are getting good education at Anmol Vidyalaya.

""There (at civic schools) are just four or five teachers. Given their background, these students need special attention. As they do not get that attention in the school, most of them drop out,"" Sawant says.

'College is a dream'

Vasant Gavit, village head at Pachvadpada, said apart from his children, there are only two boys who have studied till Class 12 in his pada.

""Notwithstanding our proximity to Mumbai, we do not get enough facilities,"" complains Gavit. Gavit informs that a few village heads have acquired five-and-a-half acres of land from the collector. A part of the land is likely to be used to open a small school or a balwadi. The plan may take more than three years before it comes to fruition.

""None of the children from our pada has studied in college. Boys mostly leave studies after Class 8 owing to the distance, while girls are expected to stay at home. College seems like a distant dream for the children,"" Gavit contends.

'Not out of the woods'

A self-help group run by the wives of village heads intends to write to the TMC, asking it to provide better roads. Ramesh Tokre, president of Vanhakh Samiti, reveals that 150 students enrolled at the Paankhanda school last year. They take the kaccha road to reach school.

""The civic body doesn't get permission to build a school because the land is forested. The other problem is that no one really demanded that students be provided with transportation. Even if we are provided with one, it will have to drop students half a kilometre away from the school because the road is bad. The other option is hiring an autorickshaw, which we can't afford,"" said Tokre.

Officials from TMC's education department point out the same difficulty in building schools.

""If we get one room on rent, we are willing to provide education to these tribal students. But this isn't the case in tribal padas. We cannot take over forest land for schools,"" said the official.

What the law says

According to the Right to Education Act, 2009, for Class1-5 students, the nearest school must be within a km

Schools for Class 6-8 students must be within a radius of three kilometres

If schools are farther the prescribed limit, the authorities need provide free transportation, mandates the Act"

When Arghya Banerjee was running the Indian operations of Irevna around 2006-2008, then a fast-growing equity research outsourcing firm, he experienced the famous Indian talent crunch first-hand. MBAs and CAs who had just graduated didn't come prepared with the work skills which were required of them when they were hired - a result of the rote-learning education system.

""Basic skills that you expect after years of education - ability to write a professional e-mail, ability to logically express your idea - were woefully lacking. This was the first trigger,"" says Banerjee, recalling the incident which pushed him to take a brave decision such as starting The Levelfield School which breaks almost all the norms of what 'education' means to us in the Indian setting.

He was also trying to put his 4-year-old daughter in school at the time and found that the leading schools in the large cities, while big on infrastructure, seemed lacking in thought and philosophy.

Banerjee realised that the only way to get help children grow and prepare them for the future was to give them the correct sort of education - ""schools where children would learn to think, rather than to memorize facts.""

""I wanted the 'perfect' school for my daughter. Since there was none that satisfied me, I set out to create my own,"" he says.

""Unthinking memory-driven learning or rote-learning is clearly one of the biggest problems in Indian school education,"" says Banerjee. The biggest challenge is changing the education system lies in making the majority, including the officials in charge, understand WHY it is even a problem.

Rote-learning is not just about memorizing dates of battles and formulas of science, but takes place every time we switch off our brains and perform an activity without thinking. ""When we recite facts but do not question them, it is rote-learning,"" says Banerjee.

""For example, when your child knows the names of the capitals of countries, but do not know why countries need capitals. When we can only solve specific problems that we encountered before, but cannot draw a general lesson from them, it is rote-learning as well -- for example, when your child can read an English textbook, but cannot comprehend an unseen passage,"" explains Banerjee.

When children are taught to copy numbers neatly in good handwriting (because numbers are quantities, not pictures), or are asked to memorize multiplication tables (because memorizing three fours is twelve is same as memorizing 'Baa Baa Black Sheep'), they are all instances of rote-learning. These skills do not have any place in the future.

Not only does rote-learning kill the joy of education and learning, it has a far bigger ill effect.

It creates graduates and postgraduates who are unable to think and innovate since their formative years have been wasted in unthinking memorization. So, they become unsuitable employees who lack the important working skills.

Arghya Banerjee says that we are still following an education system which was made for the 19th century ""when the aim of the school system was to create an army of clerks, factory workers and soldiers.""

""That education system aimed to create a bunch of obedient followers, because that's what the newly industrialized nations needed at that time,"" he says.

This is the reason behind the school uniforms, assembly, strict discipline and rigid routines.

""The aim was to foster obedience and uniformity. If we are to move forward in the 21st century, we have to question that old paradigm of education,"" he says.

We are approaching a future where routine jobs will all be automated. So, The Levelfield School tries to focus on debates, literature, movies and writing in order to create individuals who can think and analyse for themselves rather than only following orders.

The school doesn't focus on the narrow subject areas as ""real-life problems do not come packaged in neat subject boundaries.""

""In the future world, where most routine tasks may be automated, we must build thinking individuals who cannot be replaced by algorithms,"" Banerjee says.

The primary skills required to get a job now include reading and speaking in English, and the knowledge of handling computers.

While children living in metro cities or born in middle class or upper class families can learn these skills in the home environment away from school, small-town or village kids are unable to obtain these skills as their school and education system fails them.

""It is the lack of English speaking skills which is the biggest issue in villages and small towns, because in the rest of the skill areas (logical thinking, cogent writing etc.) it is not as if the city kids do well either,"" says Banerjee.

When it comes to improving the education system in rural areas, Banerjee believes there is ""no need for endless committee sittings"". Basic spoken English and other employability skills would go a very long way here.

Banerjee put his life's saving of around 50 lakhs towards building the school but it wasn't enough. He then reached out to angel investors and banks but got a rude shock when he realized he needed to show proof-of-concept. The investors needed to know the plan would work before they invested in the same.

The banks too wanted to fund a school that's already 'affiliated', or a school that's already up and running.

""For a new business in an unconventional area (read non-technology), being a start-up in India is tough,"" realized Banerjee.

He gave up the idea of angel funding and set up the school on a rented premise in the small-town location of Suri -- 200 km from Kolkata.

This was Banerjee's hometown and he had first-hand experience of the problems faced by small-town kids in successfully dealing with life later on because of the lack in our education system.

The Levelfield School is a tranquil setup combining traditional ambience with modern infrastructure to transform the way we study. Over 5-6 years, it grew to its current size and infrastructure and is now a Cambridge International School, affiliated to the IGCSE board, UK.

""It was a big step to give up a high-paying corporate leadership role, pack your bags, and relocate to a small town. But my family was surely supportive of this unconventional idea,"" says a grateful Banerjee.

Convincing parents to give a chance to the new education system Banerjee was trying to implement was a big challenge.

""In the first admission seminar, when I told a group of parents that rote-learning is an evil and we must ensure learning with understanding -- they seemed very appreciative, but only in theory. As the school started, I saw that they were scared of any new method of imparting education. They demanded textbooks, homework and more conventional 'subjects', rather than skills,"" he says.

Till class 8, The Levelfield School uses curriculum and teaching methodologies developed by themselves, including 12 apps that the put in Google Store, almost all of which are among the top educational apps there.

""Our graded-reading program (Delta) and problem-solving program (Delta Math) - are browser-based software developed inside the school,"" says Banerjee.

After that, the Cambridge International Board is followed.

""Till class 8, I decided to prioritize three skills - reading, logical thinking, and social maturity,"" Banerjee says.

The common learning method followed teaches children to read by studying the same textbook thoroughly, a number of times, for a year.

""How can a student learn to read by reading a 70-page English textbook 15-20 times a year?"" asks Banerjee.

""We all learned to read well by reading novels, newspapers, magazines - so why not replicate that process?""

So, Levelfield tries to introduce kids to a variety of reading material like novels, newspapers and magazines. The challenge, in this case, was finding so much of reading material appropriate for children of primary classes.

""Children's books available in the market did not fit the bill, so we set out to create our own library of reading materials by simplifying many classic stories like 'The Prince and the Pauper' or 'The Gulliver's Travels',"" says Banerjee.

The Levelfield School library now houses enough books to ensure that even the primary-grade students do around 1500-pages of reading a year.

Children won't learn to build analytical and thinking skills if they solve the same type of mathematical or scientific problems every day. So, they are exposed to a variety of thinking-based problems.

""We take inspiration from Japanese puzzles like Nonogram and Shikaku, and oriental board games like Go or Gomoku,"" explains Banerjee.

Building social awareness is the next important step but textbooks of social science lack the kind of material which can increase a child's maturity. They need to 'see' the world within their classroom walls. The best way to do this is through stories and cinema, and by analyzing the daily news from newspapers.

""If you are discussing the history of Nazi Germany, why not screen Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist'? While teaching about revolutions, why not use George Orwell's 'Animal Farm'?"" says Banerjee.

Practices that improve hand-eye coordination of kids, help them speak confidently in public, or taking classes outdoors in the lap of nature are other methods used for a wholesome development of the young minds.

""The transformation of the students has to be seen to be believed,"" says Banerjee, speaking about how journalists and principals from other schools have been amazed by the children's ability to speak English fluently and their mature understanding of the world.

Besides winning many nation-wise writing contents, the students have also performed brilliantly well in standardized tests.

Twenty-eight Levelfield students came among the top 1 per cent performers in ASSET all over India, a nationwide standardized test by Educational Initiatives taken by 3000 top metro-city schools, where students' skills are tested in the subjects of English, Mathematics, Science, and Social Science based on CBSE/ICSE board syllabus.

""Our students manage our school's technology infrastructure, our blog, and Twitter feed (@levelfieldpupil). You should really check out some of their writing in our school blog, and you will see that such maturity and ability are not evidenced in kids of this age anywhere,"" says Banerjee.

Inside would be a device worth '10,000 which can help them study and understand better. For the school, the donations worth '6.5 lakh from Commodore Joginder Chandna in the form of assets are nothing short of a blessing. Apart from the very helpful study aid which can store a lot of data, it has an MP3 reader and player, voice recorder and a lot more to help children improvise.

When Abhishek M J, a student, charmed the audience with his mesmerising voice, Chandna and his wife Suman were quick to offer financial aid to the child for continuing his music classes.

The school , formed 56 years ago for blind students, now houses children with varying and multiple disabilities. The maximum strength of the institution is 70 and currently houses 67 children from Classes I to IX. ""The first time I ran for a cause, my motto was that my miles should turn into smiles. There were no money transactions included. We simply spread the message of feeding a poor child every day. It was well received and this is my third initiative. We are happy to be here and be of use to these kids. My motto remains the same,"" said Chandna.

His wife Suman was seen greeting the children with familiarity. She had been visiting the place for some time now with her husband to get to know the children and to provide them with aids that are necessary to each one of them. ""I don't believe in giving money without addressing the major concerns ourselves. We should look at the need of the people we are trying to help and act accordingly. Only then would the help reach the right and deserving people in useful ways. We visited them and spoke with them and understood their basic needs and hopefully have addressed them,"" she said.

The faculty here have only one major worry. They had to start from scratch with most of the differently-abled students. Basically, their training expands only to handle blind children. However, they have developed indigenous ways to deal with different disabilities and it is a learning process for both students and the staff."

Among the hundreds of students, who gathered outside the HRD ministry to hold a protest, was 22-year-old Kuldeep Kumar, who has been in a fix since the administration announced the decision of winding up the classes.

""Firstly, our admissions started late in this session which delayed the commencement of classes till December. We were waiting for classes to begin when regular students were appearing in their semester exams. And, now they have announced a wrap up without completing our syllabus,"" he said.

The students also alleged that they have not received the complete study material. ""Last month, the DU had released the datesheet for several SOL courses even as their classes had not started by then.

A state-wise analysis of the National Achievement Survey 2017 for classes III, V and VIII has highlighted that not only do school buildings need significant repair, the learning environment also doesn't seem to be too conducive for teachers burdened by work overload, lack of drinking water and toilet facilities. In some state as high as 58% of the school buildings need significant repair, while nearly a quarter of the government and aided schools lacks drinking water and toilet facilities, as captured in the survey.

TOI had in one of the most comprehensive analysis of the NAS 2017 on February 24, 2018, highlighted how staff crunch, crowded classrooms and inadequate funds are to blame for poor learning outcomes in government schools as captured in the survey. The state-wise analysis was finalised by NCERT and submitted to the ministry of human resource development recently, a copy of which is with TOI.

While across states, over 95% students like coming to school - a large number of students find the travel difficult. Lack of electricity at many schools is also one of the major factors highlighted by teachers in the survey.

Reading between the lines from the 700-district study which was released by the NCERT in December 2017, TOI found that students are learning less as they move to higher classes, a survey of over 2.2 lakh students in government schools in over 700 districts shows. On average, a class VIII student could barely answer 40% of the questions in maths, science and social studies. The national average score for language was a little better at about 56%.

The findings raise doubts about the demographic dividend India hopes to reap because of a young population. Educationists, experts and rights' activists are not surprised. They say this is a result of insufficient investment in public education and the government's inability to implement the Right to Education Act (RTE) in letter and spirit.

The state-wise analysis, a copy of which has been accessed by TOI from the MHRD, for example revealed that 58% of the schools in Arunachal Pradesh, 43% in Assam, 35% in Uttar Pradesh, 30% in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh are in need of significant repair of the buildings.

Similarly, even some basic necessities like drinking water and toilet facilities are still lacking in large number of state-funded schools across the country. In Uttar Pradesh, which TOI earlier highlighted as having the maximum number of worst performing districts in the learning outcome, 24% teachers responded saying there is lack of drinking water facilities, while 29% highlighted the lack of toilet facilities and 39% said there is lack of electricity in schools. Likewise, in West Bengal, 26% teachers said there is lack of drinking water and toilet facilities, while 9% of them said there is lack of electricity.

These are just a few examples as the survey report in state after state highlighted similar data and pattern. Two other major factors highlighted in the survey was the difficulty students' face while travelling to school and ""work overload"" for teachers. And that number is also not low as on an average nearly 20% students ""find difficult to travel to school,"" while equally large number of teachers are saying there are overloaded with work.

That proves the point what Ambarish Rai, national convener of RTE Forum, had to say that governments have failed to provide adequate funds for school education and implementation of the RTE Act. ""RTE is a package for school development. We cannot look at any part of it in isolation."" He said the RTE Act prescribes one teacher for every 30 students at the primary level, and for 35 students in higher classes, but these have not been implemented. The country is short of 10 lakh qualified teachers, he said.

While Prof R Govinda, former vice-chancellor of National University of Educational Planning and Administration, said, ""The results don't surprise since basic skills are not being inculcated and cumulatively, the deficit will increase. The results for the last 10 years have been the same, which means we have not done anything.""

The government's emphasis on digitisation and slimmer textbooks will help reduce the weight of schoolbags. These changes may be in place by 2019. Mr Javadekar said the school syllabus at present was more than that of B.Com and BA courses. The burden of course work left teachers with little time to impart life skills and inculcate creativity among students.

But the reduction of the quantity of course syllabi should not come at the cost of learning. As it is, the comprehension levels of students across the country are below par. The recently released Annual Status of Education Report for 2017 said 40% of students between the ages of 14 and 18 surveyed in rural schools in 24 states across the country couldn't tell the time from a clock and 57% couldn't do basic mathematics. It is not hard to understand why. Our education system has not focused enough on learning outcomes. It has not kept up with advances in technology. Improving the quality of our students may involve enhancing the quality of our educators. Of the 20 lakh teachers which were to be trained in 2015 under the Right to Education Act, only five lakh have been trained so far. There is a clear mismatch in the supply and demand for educators with 70 lakh teachers teaching close to 26 crore students in 15 lakh schools across the country.

So, merely dropping chapters from books might not be enough. It needs to be augmented by greater rigour in the evaluation process. An element of competition among students through regular assessments is desirable to improve their learning abilities. To its credit, the government has brought back board examinations for class 10 in 2017 and is planning to introduce a Bill in the Parliament to restore examinations and detentions. In 2017, the Right to Education Act was amended to incorporate a competency-based evaluation study covering 2.2 million students across 110,000 schools to understand what a child should be learning in various classes. One of the recommendations of the T.S.R. Subramanian committee, entrusted with preparing a new education policy for India, is compulsory certification for teachers in government and private schools, with the provision for renewal every 10 years based on independent external testing. Lighter textbooks with relevant course work and better teachers could well be the recipe for improved learning outcomes."

The School Education department sources said that this system will be expanded to other government schools in a phased manner soon."
"57","811339652","2018-02-12","http://www.medindia.net/news/before-school-physical-activity-improves-learning-and-body-weight-176923-1.htm","Before-school Physical Activity Improves Learning and Body Weight","Medindia",FALSE,"Investigators from MassGeneral Hospital for Children (MGHfC) report the results of their study of the BOKS (Build Our Kids' Success) Program in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

""We know that physical activity can have positive effects on children's health - ranging from decreased rates of obesity and obesity-related illnesses to improving school performance and overall well-being,"" says Rachel Whooten, MD, postdoctoral fellow in the MGHfC Division of General Academic Pediatrics, and first author of the study.

""Despite these benefits, it's often hard for children and families to find opportunities to be physically active. Our study evaluates a widely available, easily scalable and innovative program that may create more physical activity opportunities for school-aged children.""

An initiative of the Reebok Foundation, which was a co-sponsor of the current study, the BOKS Program is currently available in more than 3,000 elementary and middle schools in the U.S. and other countries. Following a 12-week curriculum, the program provides hour-long, before-school sessions up to three days a week.

Each session begins with a warm-up game, followed by a running-related activity; activities incorporating ""skills of the week,"" such as push-ups or sit-ups; a game to end the session, and nutrition discussions during stretching and cool-down. Sessions are led by volunteers, who have been trained with BOKS program materials.

While the training, BOKS curriculum and support materials are provided to participating schools at no cost, schools need to provide some basic supplies as well as locations for the program.

Previous small studies have documented improvements in body fat and aerobic performance in BOKS participants, compared with nonparticipants. The current study was designed to evaluate both how a 12-week BOKS program affects participants' body mass index (BMI) and whether any differences resulted from participating two or three times a week.

In twenty-four elementary and middle schools in three eastern Massachusetts communities during the 2015-16 school year, the parents of all students in grades K-8 were invited to enroll their children in the BOKS program and the study. Parent of those not participating in BOKS could allow their children to participate in the comparison group.

School districts determined whether the program would be offered two or three times a week, depending on resources and preferences. Twice-a-week sessions were offered at sixteen schools, while eight schools conducted sessions three times a week.

Overall, 274 children participated in the twice-a-week program, 151 in the three-times-a-week program, and 282 in the comparison group, for a total of 707 study participants.

In addition to measurements of height and weight taken before and after the 12-week program, participants ages eight and older completed surveys evaluating their social and emotional wellness - including their overall mood, interaction with peers, satisfaction with their lives and involvement in their studies.

At the end of the 12-week BOKS program, children participating three times a week had significantly better BMI z scores - an age- and sex-specific measure used to track changes in weight status - and a greater chance of moving to a lower BMI category - such as normal instead of overweight - than did children in the comparison group. Three-times-a-week participants also had better scores regarding their engagement in schoolwork, while those in the two-times-a-week group had significant improvements in mood, vitality and energy.

Elsie Taveras, MD, MPH, chief of the MGHfC Division of General Academic Pediatrics, who led the study, explains that the before-school nature of the BOKS program offers several advantages, including not conflicting with after-school activities and family commitments. "" The program's structure in which volunteers from within the school receive brief training and then follow a standard curriculum can overcome the concerns of some teachers and parents that they don't have the knowledge to help kids be more active. The flexibility of the BOKS program and the lack of a required investment in material resources can be helpful for schools with limited equipment and financial resources.""

Three elementary and middle schools in the eastern Massachusetts city of Revere have implemented the BOKS program for the current school year as part of a new study, led by Whooten, that is now underway. Barbara Kelly, principal of the Paul Revere Innovation School, says, ""The BOKS program has become vital to the fabric of our school. The morning program sets the tone for each participating student's day. Their engagement and excitement in BOKS has carried over to the classroom, with parents and teachers alike having seen academic improvement. Students thrive on the program's structure and are so proud to belong to the club. I can't imagine not having BOKS in our school.""

A professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, Taveras adds, ""Childhood is an important time for the establishment of healthy habits and routines that might protect children from chronic diseases including obesity, heart disease, and depression, which are the biggest contributors to morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Programs such as BOKS that help children not only develop healthy habits to promote optimal growth trajectories but also promote social and emotional skills that can help them better handle stress, peer interactions, and negative feelings are just what children need and should be broadly scaled. The program's being school-based and run by volunteers gives it the potential of affecting a large number of children equitably without the need for substantial resources.""

The year is 1858, the British have just suppressed the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and there is intense mutual hatred among the two communities. A young Parsi graduate joins his father's export trading firm, interacting with English merchants and selling goods in India. Attracting the suspicion of the English, he also earned the spite of the Indians as someone who is complicit with the 'enemy.' But the intense desire to grow, to expand, to establish a legacy and overall be the 'Father of Indian industry' is what drove Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata to create an empire that is still regarded with reverence and respect in the chronicles of Indian business.

Business leaders who followed in his footsteps are innumerable. From Dhirubhai Ambani to Naryana Murthy, living in one-room chawls or being dependent on one's wife's last savings of 10,000 rupees could not deter the vision these people had. But one often wonders-Would they have been able to continue with such bravado, had a huge book or a PPT screamed out to them 'it's over, according to statistics, there's no hope in business for you, leave, now'.

It is a known fact that knowledge, as it opens our intellect, also restricts our instincts. Infants would not deter from putting their fingers in the fire as they do not know better. But, as we equip them with knowledge, along creeps in the sense of fear, then risk, then failure, so on and so forth. Gradually, a conservative attitude develops which allows you to lead a good life, but not a great one.

Business schools today, in their quest to create individual stars of the future commercial ecosphere, often forget to instil the fundamental lessons that segregate the successful entrepreneur from the rest. While traditional businesses and family enterprises often start training the younger members of the family from a very young age, they are often not allowed to handle the significant matters. It is a bottom-to-top approach which is followed, in contrast with the B-school curriculum which from the very beginning, only trains students to become CEOs and managers, without giving them basic knowledge of the groundwork. As a result, in the real world, the PPTs and blueprints prepared by B-school grads fall flat on their face as they are impractical and made by considering only what Case theory 101 ordered, not the ground reality.

Another observation in B-school teachings: Their lack of attention to detail. Generations of business tycoons have grown up listening to stories of how JN Tata used to throw a fit even if there was one chink or a spot in the cutlery or plates on AirIndia's flights. While these maybe ignored by B-school students as 'redundant information' or minor issues, the attitude of delivering an impeccable experience to the customer develops only when you have a strong sense of identification with the business and the desire for perfection.

It is no wonder then that even now, according to a recent study by OnStartups, 48.1% of entrepreneurs' state that they grew up in a family business. While this does not indicate that entrepreneurs only belong to certain social strata, it poses an important question: Can a three year B-school training impart a business acumen equivalent to a lifetime of learning from a business family?

The answer can be a triumphant yes, if only that education goes far beyond academic restrictions and focuses more on practical lifesaving tools. The business world today is affected by an array of dimensions, from managing the various profiles of the business to handling consumer complaints on social media platforms. B-schools need to provide an ideal simulated condition for students to hone comprehensive skills that help to tackle all these issues, or start exposing them to the real business world early through meaningful internship programs. The very factor of an agile and impactful business decision, coupled with the constant desire for growth and higher revenue, is the ultimate tightrope walk any prospective entrepreneur needs to master, which can happen only through continuous exposure to such situations.

The difference between academic learning and learning from your familial settings is often summed up by the A to B exercise. Two children were asked to draw out a line from point A to point B, while one drew out the line according to the pathway given, the other straightaway joined A to B. Thus, while it is often necessary to circumvent the restrictions of the question to focus on the goal that needs to be achieved, receiving the right education and harnessing skills is also extremely important to survive the streets, as life, and especially business, is not always a straight line."

The alarm bells sounded in the economic survey over quality of education and the need for skill enhancement haven't gone unheard. Arun Jaitley has launched 'revitalisation of infrastructure and systems in education' (RISE) scheme with a targeted spend of Rs 1 lakh crore till 2022.

Under 'Operation Digital Board', the government aims to replace blackboards with elearning platforms by 2020. Two new schools of planning and architecture and 18 other IITs and NITs will also be set up.

Budgetary allocation for school education and literacy recorded a 7.86% increase as the government committed to treat education ""without segmentation"" from pre-nursery to high school.Stating that education accounts of 5% of budgetary allocations, HRD minister Prakash Javadekar said: ""The government is planning a non-segmented school education scheme to replace SSA and RMSA, which will include children from pre-nursery to Class X.""

Funding for Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan -- strategic funding to higher educational institutions -- has been hiked by Rs 100 crore, and Higher Education Funding Agency gets Rs 2,750 crore more.

The hikes are, however, seen as insufficient by activists. ""The 11.6% increase for SSA is insufficient for realisation of RTE. Even secondary education has been neglected. The promised allocation of 6% of GDP has not yet been achieved,"" said Ambarish Rai, national convener, RTE forum.

Despite the digital drive, allocation for Digital India e-learning for school and higher education has decreased from Rs 0.14 crore to Rs 0.01 crore. The Rs 125 crore for language teachers in the last Budget is missing."
