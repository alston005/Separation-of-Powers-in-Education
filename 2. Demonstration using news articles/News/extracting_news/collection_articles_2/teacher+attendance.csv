Recently, the BMC suspended 20 teachers from across the city for unauthorized absence ranging between three months to almost four years and affecting the quality of education.

According to the BMC education officer, Mahesh Palkar, the civic body took stock of teacher attendance in the past and a few teachers would be suspended. ""The attendance was collated but action wasn't taken on most occasions, only one or two teachers were suspended. But, now we have taken stock of the situation and found a large number of them not reporting to work regularly. Some of them have been suspended for not conducting classes when being present or other malpractices,"" he said.

Along with the suspension orders, the BMC has also sent show-cause notices to the 20 teachers which include four heads of schools. While 16 teachers have been suspended over absence, three others are suspended for other reasons. ""Further action will be determined on the basis of the responses to the notice. The teachers will remain suspended until the end of the inquiry,"" said Palkar.

The BMC will now conduct the exercise more regularly. ""Every three months we will check the report and initiate action against those who are found to be at fault. This way, the unauthorized absence will not go unchecked for more than three months,"" he added.

Ramesh Joshi, who heads Brihanmumbai Mahapalika Shikshak Sabha, the BMC teachers' union, said the teachers had begun approaching them to respond to the notices. ""Teachers need to understand the importance to taking permissions from the department before going on long leaves. If there are medical reasons, they need to provide supporting documents,"" he said.

Member of the BMC education committee, Sainath Durge said, ""It is a good initiative if it is done through natural justice."""
