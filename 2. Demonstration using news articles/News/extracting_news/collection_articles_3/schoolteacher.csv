""English is a subject in which students in our government schools don't feel very comfortable. I diagnosed the problem and developed a strategy.

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

""A cheating case was registered against Ravinder under section 420 of the IPC besides Section 5 of Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act, 1999. The other directors of the company are absconding,"" the police commissioner said."

In the confines of Pongalur, this former government-aided school teacher has dedicated her verdant eight-and-a-half acre to hundreds of trees. The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends."

The school has suspended the teacher and has also set up an inquiry committee.

The parents of the boy, Prasanna Patil, have claimed that he suffered a mild paralytic attack as a result of the alleged beating. Doctors treating Prasanna told TOI that he has developed temporary facial muscle weakness.

Prasanna is a boarder and class 6 student at the AISSMS' Shri Shivaji Preparatory Military School (SSPMS) and hails from Jamb village in Indapur.

Inspector Pramod Waghmare of the Shivajinagar police station said an offence has been registered under section 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Juvenile Justice Act. ""We have detained the teacher, Sandip Gade. Our probe is on,"" he told TOI.

Prasanna's parents brought him to Pune for medical tests on Monday. The treating pediatric neurologist here, Umesh Kalane, told TOI, ""The boy has developed Bell's palsy that causes temporary facial muscle weakness. We cannot categorically ascertain that this was caused by physical beating. He has weakness in the muscles on one side of the face.""

Prasanna's father, Shailendra Patil, told TOI that he had come to the school on November 3 to take the boy home for the Diwali vacations. ""I had then noticed that the right side of his face was swollen. I had asked him about the swelling but he did not say anything,"" Patil, a farmer by profession, said.

Patil said that during the Diwali festival, he again noticed that Prasanna could not talk properly and had even lost the ability to move the muscles on the right side of his face. ""Only after my wife, Ashwini, questioned him that he opened up to say that Gade had beaten him for not completing the assignment,"" he said.

Patil said he took Prasanna to a private hospital in Baramati, where he was told that the boy had suffered a mild paralytic attack.

Ashwini said Prasanna told the doctors that Gade had brutally beaten him. ""He said Gade had told him to keep his hands on the bench and then slapped him several times. Gade even punched my son on the head and pinched him on the stomach. Prasanna does not remember the exact date he was beaten, but says it happened between October 15 and 25,"" she said.

Prasanna's older brother is a class 8 student in the same school. ""We were very happy with the progress of our elder son and, therefore, got Prasanna admitted in the same school this year. Prasanna too was happy in school. Except for Gade, he did not have any complaint about other teachers,"" he said.

Ashwini said they brought Prasanna to Pune on Mondayfor medical tests that were suggested by the doctors in Baramati. The parents also approached the school authorities the same day.

Ashwini said Gade has tendered an apology. ""But that is not enough. We want legal action against him so that he should not dare to beat other students in future,"" she said.

Gade's wife Savita said he has accepted having slapped Prasanna for his incomplete work. ""However, he did not beat him in a brutal manner as claimed by the parents. My husband has been teaching drawing in the school since 1996. He is quite popular among the students,"" she said.

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

File image of Security forces in Cameroon. Reuters

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

""It also needs to be remembered that if such ghastly and heinous crime take place in the villages, it creates serious impact on the minds of the villagers and puts question marks on future of minor victim girls,"" the judges observed. The bench accordingly, upheld the conviction and 18-years rigorous imprisonment of professor - Datta Jadhav (43) and also the 16-years rigorous imprisonment of principal - Vanita Patil (56).

Both Jadhav and Patil were employees of a Zilla Parishad school in Raigad. They had petitioned the bench of Justice Shinde, challenging their conviction by a sessions court. According to the prosecution case, Jadhav had molested several minor girl students of his school by abusing his post as a professor. He had even raped a 12-year-old girl and had even clicked obscene photos of 13 minor girls of his school. These photographs were later recovered from Jadhav's cell phone.

As far as Patil is concerned, she was convicted by the sessions court for abetting the crime by pushing the minor girl inside a room, where Jadhav committed rape on the girl. It was learnt that Patil stood outside the room and ensured that no one enters the room until Jadhav comes out after raping the girl. She had even bolted the doors of the room.

To their defence, the convicted duo argued that no rape took place and they were falsely implicated and arrested under political pressure. They blamed the sarpanch of the survivor's village, who, the duo claimed had got the FIR registered against them.

Having considered the submissions, the bench trashed the argument saying, ""The victim was from a socio-economic backward village and it is a matter of common knowledge that such villagers had no courage to face such uncommon incidents, and so in such a situation they always try to take the help of known person in the village when they had to go to police station."""

A police officer said that while Manjeet and Rajeev were also involved in the murder conspiracy, it was Angel who had planned it and paid the killers.

Sunita's children and her other family members also confirmed that her husband was in an extramarital affair with the model since 2012. They contacted her and asked her to join probe.

""Manjeet disclosed that the model had been asking him to marry her. He had asked his wife to divorce him but when she refused, he started threatening to kill her,"" said another officer.

Both the Iranian-aligned armed Houthi movement and Yemen's internationally recognized government have deployed forces in various districts of the southwestern city, Yemen's third largest.

Al-Shorbagy opened the school following the outbreak of war saying he had nowhere to send his own children. However, 500 boys and girls aged between six and 15 signed up for lessons in that first year.

""All the schools closed down and we had a problem that our kids were on the street,"" Al-Shorbagy told Reuters.

""We opened this building as a community initiative. It was my national and humanitarian duty towards my neighborhood.""

Inside the house, facilities are basic, with exposed brick walls and big gaps where windows should be. Ripped curtains are used to divide up space for classrooms.

Undeterred, the eager children find any space they can on the floor, with barely any room to move, let alone write. They share donated books and follow what one of the 16 volunteer teachers writes on a broken white board.

Classes include math, science and English, with Al-Shorbagy saying he follows the pre-war Yemeni curriculum.

Despite the ramshackle setting and lack of facilities, the school is oversubscribed in a country where education has been decimated and accessible, free school options are limited.

Some 2,500 schools have been damaged or destroyed since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government, a UNICEF report said in March.

Two million children are out of school in Yemen, including Shehab Mohamed Hazzaa, whose mother was trying to enroll him at Al-Shorbagy's school.

""I came here to register... in the school and the principal told me that it is too crowded and rejected him,"" said the mother, who declined to be named.

The only other option in the city are private schools but they cost up to 100,000 Yemeni riyal ($400) per year, putting them out of reach for many in the impoverished Arab country."

On a statement he said in an interview, he said that without delay, he took off his jacket and wrapped it around the teacher's chest where she was bleeding. He witnessed how the boy did the stabbing despite him trying to keep it concealed. In other words, Mason saw it all. After their teacher, the boy also pointed the butcher knife on the other student, threatening others that he would kill the student if they videotaped him. Mason then distracted the boy to get some help.

He also stated that in one of their past conversations, the 13-year-old boy wanted to kill someone. The boy and the teacher's identity remains confidential and unnamed to the public for safety reasons.

This type of behavior from children nowadays has been alarming. We get to hear news about incidents like this weekly having students kill students, stabbing teachers and the like. It's about time that we re-evaluate the lessons we have thought our children within our homes. Is our homes still a healthy environment for our children's character growth? Are we still giving them the premium of learning right manners and obedience? Or are we just allowing them to live their lives the way they want it to be and how they discover it?

We are responsible for the outcome the next generation is producing, and we should take matters like this very seriously. We faced life before they did. It will never be an excuse to say that they have a new way of living because discipline, whether we like it or not, will still be the same and it needs immediate action. We hope you get to do something different in your homes today!"

A 13-year-old class VIII student of St Ursula's School in Akurdi has landed in hospital after being allegedly beaten up by one of his teachers. The child told his parents that he had been beaten continuously for 10-15 minutes in front of other students on Monday by the teacher who suspected that he had teased her son, also a student of the same school.

The boy's parents have registered an FIR with the Nigdi police against the teacher.

Despite repeated requests since Tuesday, the principal of the school did not agree to speak to this newspaper on the case. She refused to meet the correspondent when he went to the school on Wednesday. A security guard at the gate said the principal had asked him to convey that everything had been ""resolved"". The teacher concerned could also not be reached.

The school functioned normally on Wednesday.

The boy, who is admitted at the Lokmanya Hospital in Nigdi, said he, and the teacher's son, were travelling on the same school bus on Monday morning when some other students 'teased' him (the teacher's son). ""Some boys teased the son of the teacher, who is not my class teacher. The teacher's son also taunted the boys. It all happened between them. I was only present there,"" he said.

""After we reached the school, the teacher held my collar, twisted my arm and slapped and kicked me. She kicked me in the stomach as well. Some students and teachers saw this. The beating continued for about 10-15 minutes,"" he said, adding that the teacher also threatened him.

""It was only after some other teachers intervened, that I was let off,"" he said. The boy showed the injury marks on his legs, stomach, arms and on the neck.

The boy's father said his son was badly injured and crying in the school. ""But he was not allowed to call us up. When he came home, he almost collapsed, after which we rushed him to the hospital,"" said his father.

He said when he went to the school to complain against the teacher, the principal only admonished the teacher but did not suspend her. ""She said she could not do much except issue a memo,"" he said.

Pimpri Chinchwad Police Commissioner R K Padmanabhan said the police had registered a non-cognisable offence against the teacher and was pursuing the case seriously. ""I have asked the DCP to look into the matter. We have called the teacher for investigation and we will also talk to the school principal,"" he said."

A month after the Kandivli police arrested a 24-year-old female teacher of a local school for allegedly sexually abusing a four-year-old girl, 68 staffers of the school have come out in support of her.

According to them, none of the CCTV footage of the day the incident took place shows the teacher anywhere near the girl, and also, the child had not visited the washroom that day even once. Based on these findings, the staffers have written a letter to the police, Dindoshi sessions court and the child's parents, and have also attached scanned copies of the CCTV footages with it.

The letter mentions, ""The girl was not seen at the place where her family members alleged the incident took place. The allegations made against the teacher are false and baseless. Hence we are stepping in and offering to provide a lawyer for her. Her bail application has also been submitted in court."" However, the sessions court rejected her plea.

""The teacher has been working with us for the past two-and-a-half years. Her behaviour towards the students, other staff and parents has been good. There have been no complaints against her,"" the letter states.

Speaking to mid-day, the accused's younger brother said, ""My sister is being punished for something she hasn't done. Her co-prisoners in jail are harassing her physically and mentally. Even her bail application got rejected.""

When contacted, Senior Police Inspector Nitin Pondkule said, ""We have checked four hours of CCTV footage and have also sent the victim for a medical check-up. The clothes she was wearing on the day of the incident have been sent for forensic analysis. We will take action based on the results of the medical report.""

Khan also complained that he was doing much more than just teaching. ""My job is to teach but in this school, I'm forced to look into other issues such as transfers, school leaving and all administrative work. So, studies are compromised on many occasions,"" he said. Also, going for a vacation has been a major issue for him. ""I find it hard to take leave for even a day. I usually inform the education department if I absolutely have to and they send a teacher from some other school,"" said Khan.

Being the only teacher, Nawab prefers to teach students of all classes together. Ali Mohammad, chairman of the school's management committee, said, ""This is a major issue and I have informed the education department of the same but it has not done anything.""

Babar, now 25, has taught more than 3000 children in the last 16 years, in a school he started in 2002 when he was only nine and in fifth standard. He started his school at the backyard of his family's small house under a guava tree at Gangpur village in Murshidabad district, West Bengal.

Speaking to Eastern Mirror over telephone, Babar shared his inspiring story of how things unfolded at a tender age. Born in 1993 at Gangpur village, Babar started his schooling at Bhabta Rasidiya Primary School in 1998 and was there till class 4. The school was two kilometres from his house.

In 2002, when he was nine years old, his father Nasiruddin, a jute trader with a small income, got him admitted to Beldanga CRGS High School, about ten kilometres away. He used walk two kilometres daily to catch a bus to the school. That walk actually changed his destiny.

""While returning from school I used to see kids my age working in fields, grazing cattle, and picking rags and scraps instead of attending school,"" Babar recalled. ""When I came to know that they were not attending school because their parents were too poor to afford school fees, it touched my heart and I decided to teach them every day after I return from school.""

It was the same year (2002) that Babar started teaching eight children (aged between five and nine), including his younger sister Amina Khatun, under a guava tree at his parents' backyard. He was the only teacher of his school when it first started.

""I used to teach children of my age from 4 pm to 6 pm after returning from school. I taught my students whatever I learned in school, and they learned it happily,"" Babar reminisced.

In 2003, when Babar was in class 6, he approached the retired principal of Beldanga SRF College, Sanath Kar, who was a close friend of his father, to inaugurate his school, to which the latter obliged and in March 2003, the school was named Ananda Shiksha Niketan (House of Joyful Learning).

Babar has been an ardent advocate of Swami Vivekananda's teachings. He used to visit the ashram of Ramakrishna Mission, located three kilometres from his house, regularly when he was five or six years old.

""I hardly knew about the mission and its teachings. However, I was gradually inspired by the teachings of Vivekananda and his selfless service to humanity. I still go there whenever I get time,"" Babar said.

He said that in March 2003, when he visited the ashram the priest gave him a book and advised him to read for at least five minutes every day. ""It was in that book that I found a quote, 'Service to man is service to God,' which inspired me to continue with my mission till today,"" Babar asserted.

Ananda Shiksha Niketan was recognised (unaided) by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education in 2012 and now offers education from class 1 to 8. It also offers a course for classes 9 and 10 as well, though not recognised yet.

Babar said that after the media reported his work and school, the villagers who were initially sceptical about sending their children to his school changed their mind, and the number of students swelled over time.

Babar shifted his school to Shankarpara village, in 2015, three kilometres away from the previous location. The plot for the new school was donated by Almitra Patel, an NRI, in 2013.

""We already have 300 students including 200 girls, fewer than at our previous address (location) where we had 800 students. We are trying to bring some of those students here by school buses,"" he said.

Babar's biography has been included in the Central Board of Secondary Education syllabus for Class 10, and Karnataka government has included the same in the Class 12 English textbook.

Babar, who completed English honours from Krishnath College, Berhampore in 2013 and Master's degree in history from Kalyani University (distance learning) in 2015, was named ""youngest headmaster in the world"" by the BBC in October 2009 when he was just 16. He has received several awards, including NDTV 'Indian of the Year' and CNN IBN Real Heroes, in 2009, and also featured in 'Forbes Asia 2016 30 under 30 Asia list in Social Entrepreneurs category.

At present, the school has 10 staff, including eight teachers out of which six are its alumni.

""My dream is to teach children till my last breath. I want to see each and every child (in the country) educated,"" Barbar shared."

This was the third such incident since the publication of the complete draft of the NRC on July 30.

Mangaldoi district is about 100 km from state capital Guwahati.

Nirod Kumar Das, who used to practise as a lawyer after retirement, was found hanging by the neck in his room by family members after he had returned from his morning walk on Sunday, Superintendent of Police Sreejith T said.

In a note allegedly left behind, 74-year-old Das stated that he was taking the extreme step to ""escape the humiliation of being marked as a foreigner after the NRC process,"" the family members said.

A local police official confirmed the cause of the death as hanging.

All his family members, including his wife, three daughters, their husbands and children, as well as most of his relatives were enlisted in the NRC, they said.

Das was under distress since the exclusion of his name from the complete draft of the NRC, and more so, when the local NRC processing centre gave him a document, about two months back, stating that his name was put on hold as he had been marked as a foreigner, his family members said.

In his note, Das blamed nobody and listed five people whom he owed Rs 1,200 and asked his family members to return the money, the family and police said.

The agitated family members and locals had refused to let police take Das' body for postmortem Sunday, demanding that action be taken against the NRC processing centre for marking him a ""foreigner"".

They relented only after the district deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police went to the lawyer's house and assured them of a probe to find out why Das' name was excluded and how he was marked as a ""foreigner"".

After retiring at the end of his 34-year career as a teacher in a government school, Das had studied law and was practising in the district court at Mangaldoi near Kharupetia, his family members said.

Meanwhile, the Bengali Students Federation has called a day-long Kharupetia bandh Monday to protest against the exclusion of Das' name from the complete draft of the NRC.

Markets, shops, educational institutions, private offices and banks remained closed, while vehicles were off the roads during the bandh, officials said."

This is not the first such incident in the state. In 2015, a teacher of a private school in Eluru in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh had thrashed a girl student of class 1 and made her sit on a stone, naked in the hot sun, as a punishment for not doing homework.

In the same year, another teacher from a government school in Bheemunipatnam Mandal, Vishakapatanam, asked two students to remove their shirt and stand under the sun for three hours, as a punishment for not doing the homework."

""English is a subject in which students in our government schools don't feel very comfortable. I diagnosed the problem and developed a strategy. Rather than making it a subject confined to reading and writing, I worked on developing listening skills of the children. I would ask them to hear the announcement at railway stations, metro, radio and call centres. The strategy worked and students became very confident,"" Qanungo said.

It was her daughter who asked her to apply for the global award given by Varkey Foundation. ""My daughter got an Economic Times cutout and asked me to apply for it. I thought when my daughter was so confident, I should apply,"" Qanungo said.

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

""A cheating case was registered against Ravinder under section 420 of the IPC besides Section 5 of Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act, 1999. The other directors of the company are absconding,"" the police commissioner said."

In the confines of Pongalur, this former government-aided school teacher has dedicated her verdant eight-and-a-half acre to hundreds of trees. The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends."

The school has suspended the teacher and has also set up an inquiry committee.

The parents of the boy, Prasanna Patil, have claimed that he suffered a mild paralytic attack as a result of the alleged beating. Doctors treating Prasanna told TOI that he has developed temporary facial muscle weakness.

Prasanna is a boarder and class 6 student at the AISSMS' Shri Shivaji Preparatory Military School (SSPMS) and hails from Jamb village in Indapur.

Inspector Pramod Waghmare of the Shivajinagar police station said an offence has been registered under section 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Juvenile Justice Act. ""We have detained the teacher, Sandip Gade. Our probe is on,"" he told TOI.

Prasanna's parents brought him to Pune for medical tests on Monday. The treating pediatric neurologist here, Umesh Kalane, told TOI, ""The boy has developed Bell's palsy that causes temporary facial muscle weakness. We cannot categorically ascertain that this was caused by physical beating. He has weakness in the muscles on one side of the face.""

Prasanna's father, Shailendra Patil, told TOI that he had come to the school on November 3 to take the boy home for the Diwali vacations. ""I had then noticed that the right side of his face was swollen. I had asked him about the swelling but he did not say anything,"" Patil, a farmer by profession, said.

Patil said that during the Diwali festival, he again noticed that Prasanna could not talk properly and had even lost the ability to move the muscles on the right side of his face. ""Only after my wife, Ashwini, questioned him that he opened up to say that Gade had beaten him for not completing the assignment,"" he said.

Patil said he took Prasanna to a private hospital in Baramati, where he was told that the boy had suffered a mild paralytic attack.

Ashwini said Prasanna told the doctors that Gade had brutally beaten him. ""He said Gade had told him to keep his hands on the bench and then slapped him several times. Gade even punched my son on the head and pinched him on the stomach. Prasanna does not remember the exact date he was beaten, but says it happened between October 15 and 25,"" she said.

Prasanna's older brother is a class 8 student in the same school. ""We were very happy with the progress of our elder son and, therefore, got Prasanna admitted in the same school this year. Prasanna too was happy in school. Except for Gade, he did not have any complaint about other teachers,"" he said.

Ashwini said they brought Prasanna to Pune on Mondayfor medical tests that were suggested by the doctors in Baramati. The parents also approached the school authorities the same day.

Ashwini said Gade has tendered an apology. ""But that is not enough. We want legal action against him so that he should not dare to beat other students in future,"" she said.

Gade's wife Savita said he has accepted having slapped Prasanna for his incomplete work. ""However, he did not beat him in a brutal manner as claimed by the parents. My husband has been teaching drawing in the school since 1996. He is quite popular among the students,"" she said.

On October 29, Saifi, along with his two associates, had shot dead Sunita (38), a government school teacher, at Bawana, AK Singla, Additional Commissioner of Police, (Crime) said.

Sunita's husband Manjeet had planned her killing as she was against his relationship with another woman. Police have already arrested four persons -- Manjeet, Angel Gupta, Rajeev and Deepak - in the case, Singla added.

According to police, Deepak hired killers from Meerut. He asked his uncle, Dharmender, who agreed to kill Sunita for Rs 10 lakh, the officer said.

Dharmender recruited Shehzad and Vishal. On that day, all three gunned down Sunita while she was on her way to school, he said.

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

The HC said the teachers were supposed to be the custodians and guardians of the minor girl but they committed the heinous crime.

A division bench of Justices Sambhaji Shinde and Ajay Gadkari said, ""In the present case though there is delay of about two months in lodging the FIR, considering the fact that the victim was minor girl at the relevant time the offence took place. The offence was committed by her teacher, who was supposed to be her custodian and guardian during school hours.""

""It also needs to be remembered that if such ghastly and heinous crime take place in the villages, it creates serious impact on the minds of the villagers and puts question marks on future of minor victim girls,"" the judges observed. The bench accordingly, upheld the conviction and 18-years rigorous imprisonment of professor - Datta Jadhav (43) and also the 16-years rigorous imprisonment of principal - Vanita Patil (56).

Both Jadhav and Patil were employees of a Zilla Parishad school in Raigad. They had petitioned the bench of Justice Shinde, challenging their conviction by a sessions court. According to the prosecution case, Jadhav had molested several minor girl students of his school by abusing his post as a professor. He had even raped a 12-year-old girl and had even clicked obscene photos of 13 minor girls of his school. These photographs were later recovered from Jadhav's cell phone.

As far as Patil is concerned, she was convicted by the sessions court for abetting the crime by pushing the minor girl inside a room, where Jadhav committed rape on the girl. It was learnt that Patil stood outside the room and ensured that no one enters the room until Jadhav comes out after raping the girl. She had even bolted the doors of the room.

To their defence, the convicted duo argued that no rape took place and they were falsely implicated and arrested under political pressure. They blamed the sarpanch of the survivor's village, who, the duo claimed had got the FIR registered against them.

Having considered the submissions, the bench trashed the argument saying, ""The victim was from a socio-economic backward village and it is a matter of common knowledge that such villagers had no courage to face such uncommon incidents, and so in such a situation they always try to take the help of known person in the village when they had to go to police station."""

Both the Iranian-aligned armed Houthi movement and Yemen's internationally recognized government have deployed forces in various districts of the southwestern city, Yemen's third largest.

Al-Shorbagy opened the school following the outbreak of war saying he had nowhere to send his own children. However, 500 boys and girls aged between six and 15 signed up for lessons in that first year.

""All the schools closed down and we had a problem that our kids were on the street,"" Al-Shorbagy told Reuters.

""We opened this building as a community initiative. It was my national and humanitarian duty towards my neighborhood.""

Inside the house, facilities are basic, with exposed brick walls and big gaps where windows should be. Ripped curtains are used to divide up space for classrooms.

Undeterred, the eager children find any space they can on the floor, with barely any room to move, let alone write. They share donated books and follow what one of the 16 volunteer teachers writes on a broken white board.

Classes include math, science and English, with Al-Shorbagy saying he follows the pre-war Yemeni curriculum.

Despite the ramshackle setting and lack of facilities, the school is oversubscribed in a country where education has been decimated and accessible, free school options are limited.

Some 2,500 schools have been damaged or destroyed since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government, a UNICEF report said in March.

Two million children are out of school in Yemen, including Shehab Mohamed Hazzaa, whose mother was trying to enroll him at Al-Shorbagy's school.

Nawab Khan has been a Sanskrit teacher all his life but now also teaches science and maths. He juggles different text books, some of which he has not even seen before, to teach the lessons in them to students. ""I am a Sanskrit teacher and last year, I was deputed to this school. There were four other teachers at the beginning and we managed. However, over the past 10 months, the other teachers got transferred and I'm the only one left now,"" he said.

Babar, now 25, has taught more than 3000 children in the last 16 years, in a school he started in 2002 when he was only nine and in fifth standard. He started his school at the backyard of his family's small house under a guava tree at Gangpur village in Murshidabad district, West Bengal.

Speaking to Eastern Mirror over telephone, Babar shared his inspiring story of how things unfolded at a tender age. Born in 1993 at Gangpur village, Babar started his schooling at Bhabta Rasidiya Primary School in 1998 and was there till class 4. The school was two kilometres from his house.

In 2002, when he was nine years old, his father Nasiruddin, a jute trader with a small income, got him admitted to Beldanga CRGS High School, about ten kilometres away. He used walk two kilometres daily to catch a bus to the school. That walk actually changed his destiny.

""While returning from school I used to see kids my age working in fields, grazing cattle, and picking rags and scraps instead of attending school,"" Babar recalled. ""When I came to know that they were not attending school because their parents were too poor to afford school fees, it touched my heart and I decided to teach them every day after I return from school.""

It was the same year (2002) that Babar started teaching eight children (aged between five and nine), including his younger sister Amina Khatun, under a guava tree at his parents' backyard. He was the only teacher of his school when it first started.

""I used to teach children of my age from 4 pm to 6 pm after returning from school. I taught my students whatever I learned in school, and they learned it happily,"" Babar reminisced.

In 2003, when Babar was in class 6, he approached the retired principal of Beldanga SRF College, Sanath Kar, who was a close friend of his father, to inaugurate his school, to which the latter obliged and in March 2003, the school was named Ananda Shiksha Niketan (House of Joyful Learning).

Babar has been an ardent advocate of Swami Vivekananda's teachings. He used to visit the ashram of Ramakrishna Mission, located three kilometres from his house, regularly when he was five or six years old.

""I hardly knew about the mission and its teachings. However, I was gradually inspired by the teachings of Vivekananda and his selfless service to humanity. I still go there whenever I get time,"" Babar said.

He said that in March 2003, when he visited the ashram the priest gave him a book and advised him to read for at least five minutes every day. ""It was in that book that I found a quote, 'Service to man is service to God,' which inspired me to continue with my mission till today,"" Babar asserted.

Ananda Shiksha Niketan was recognised (unaided) by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education in 2012 and now offers education from class 1 to 8. It also offers a course for classes 9 and 10 as well, though not recognised yet.

Babar said that after the media reported his work and school, the villagers who were initially sceptical about sending their children to his school changed their mind, and the number of students swelled over time.

Babar shifted his school to Shankarpara village, in 2015, three kilometres away from the previous location. The plot for the new school was donated by Almitra Patel, an NRI, in 2013.

""We already have 300 students including 200 girls, fewer than at our previous address (location) where we had 800 students. We are trying to bring some of those students here by school buses,"" he said.

Babar's biography has been included in the Central Board of Secondary Education syllabus for Class 10, and Karnataka government has included the same in the Class 12 English textbook.

Babar, who completed English honours from Krishnath College, Berhampore in 2013 and Master's degree in history from Kalyani University (distance learning) in 2015, was named ""youngest headmaster in the world"" by the BBC in October 2009 when he was just 16. He has received several awards, including NDTV 'Indian of the Year' and CNN IBN Real Heroes, in 2009, and also featured in 'Forbes Asia 2016 30 under 30 Asia list in Social Entrepreneurs category.

At present, the school has 10 staff, including eight teachers out of which six are its alumni.

""My dream is to teach children till my last breath. I want to see each and every child (in the country) educated,"" Barbar shared."

This was the third such incident since the publication of the complete draft of the NRC on July 30.

Mangaldoi district is about 100 km from state capital Guwahati.

Nirod Kumar Das, who used to practise as a lawyer after retirement, was found hanging by the neck in his room by family members after he had returned from his morning walk on Sunday, Superintendent of Police Sreejith T said.

In a note allegedly left behind, 74-year-old Das stated that he was taking the extreme step to ""escape the humiliation of being marked as a foreigner after the NRC process,"" the family members said.

A local police official confirmed the cause of the death as hanging.

All his family members, including his wife, three daughters, their husbands and children, as well as most of his relatives were enlisted in the NRC, they said.

Das was under distress since the exclusion of his name from the complete draft of the NRC, and more so, when the local NRC processing centre gave him a document, about two months back, stating that his name was put on hold as he had been marked as a foreigner, his family members said.

In his note, Das blamed nobody and listed five people whom he owed Rs 1,200 and asked his family members to return the money, the family and police said.

The agitated family members and locals had refused to let police take Das' body for postmortem Sunday, demanding that action be taken against the NRC processing centre for marking him a ""foreigner"".

They relented only after the district deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police went to the lawyer's house and assured them of a probe to find out why Das' name was excluded and how he was marked as a ""foreigner"".

After retiring at the end of his 34-year career as a teacher in a government school, Das had studied law and was practising in the district court at Mangaldoi near Kharupetia, his family members said.

Meanwhile, the Bengali Students Federation has called a day-long Kharupetia bandh Monday to protest against the exclusion of Das' name from the complete draft of the NRC.

Markets, shops, educational institutions, private offices and banks remained closed, while vehicles were off the roads during the bandh, officials said."

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

""A cheating case was registered against Ravinder under section 420 of the IPC besides Section 5 of Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act, 1999. The other directors of the company are absconding,"" the police commissioner said."

In the confines of Pongalur, this former government-aided school teacher has dedicated her verdant eight-and-a-half acre to hundreds of trees. The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends."

The treating pediatric neurologist here, Umesh Kalane, told TOI, ""The boy has developed Bell's palsy that causes temporary facial muscle weakness. We cannot categorically ascertain that this was caused by physical beating. He has weakness in the muscles on one side of the face.""

Prasanna's father, Shailendra Patil, told TOI that he had come to the school on November 3 to take the boy home for the Diwali vacations. ""I had then noticed that the right side of his face was swollen. I had asked him about the swelling but he did not say anything,"" Patil, a farmer by profession, said.

Patil said that during the Diwali festival, he again noticed that Prasanna could not talk properly and had even lost the ability to move the muscles on the right side of his face. ""Only after my wife, Ashwini, questioned him that he opened up to say that Gade had beaten him for not completing the assignment,"" he said.

Patil said he took Prasanna to a private hospital in Baramati, where he was told that the boy had suffered a mild paralytic attack.

Ashwini said Prasanna told the doctors that Gade had brutally beaten him. ""He said Gade had told him to keep his hands on the bench and then slapped him several times. Gade even punched my son on the head and pinched him on the stomach. Prasanna does not remember the exact date he was beaten, but says it happened between October 15 and 25,"" she said.

Prasanna's older brother is a class 8 student in the same school. ""We were very happy with the progress of our elder son and, therefore, got Prasanna admitted in the same school this year. Prasanna too was happy in school. Except for Gade, he did not have any complaint about other teachers,"" he said.

Ashwini said they brought Prasanna to Pune on Mondayfor medical tests that were suggested by the doctors in Baramati. The parents also approached the school authorities the same day.

Ashwini said Gade has tendered an apology. ""But that is not enough. We want legal action against him so that he should not dare to beat other students in future,"" she said.

Gade's wife Savita said he has accepted having slapped Prasanna for his incomplete work. ""However, he did not beat him in a brutal manner as claimed by the parents. My husband has been teaching drawing in the school since 1996. He is quite popular among the students,"" she said.

Zilla Parishad education officer Sunil Kurhade did not respond to calls when contacted on Monday to find out what action the department will take against Gade."

On October 29, Saifi, along with his two associates, had shot dead Sunita (38), a government school teacher, at Bawana, AK Singla, Additional Commissioner of Police, (Crime) said.

Sunita's husband Manjeet had planned her killing as she was against his relationship with another woman. Police have already arrested four persons -- Manjeet, Angel Gupta, Rajeev and Deepak - in the case, Singla added.

According to police, Deepak hired killers from Meerut. He asked his uncle, Dharmender, who agreed to kill Sunita for Rs 10 lakh, the officer said.

Dharmender recruited Shehzad and Vishal. On that day, all three gunned down Sunita while she was on her way to school, he said.

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

The HC said the teachers were supposed to be the custodians and guardians of the minor girl but they committed the heinous crime.

A division bench of Justices Sambhaji Shinde and Ajay Gadkari said, ""In the present case though there is delay of about two months in lodging the FIR, considering the fact that the victim was minor girl at the relevant time the offence took place. The offence was committed by her teacher, who was supposed to be her custodian and guardian during school hours.""

""It also needs to be remembered that if such ghastly and heinous crime take place in the villages, it creates serious impact on the minds of the villagers and puts question marks on future of minor victim girls,"" the judges observed. The bench accordingly, upheld the conviction and 18-years rigorous imprisonment of professor - Datta Jadhav (43) and also the 16-years rigorous imprisonment of principal - Vanita Patil (56).

Both Jadhav and Patil were employees of a Zilla Parishad school in Raigad. They had petitioned the bench of Justice Shinde, challenging their conviction by a sessions court. According to the prosecution case, Jadhav had molested several minor girl students of his school by abusing his post as a professor. He had even raped a 12-year-old girl and had even clicked obscene photos of 13 minor girls of his school. These photographs were later recovered from Jadhav's cell phone.

As far as Patil is concerned, she was convicted by the sessions court for abetting the crime by pushing the minor girl inside a room, where Jadhav committed rape on the girl. It was learnt that Patil stood outside the room and ensured that no one enters the room until Jadhav comes out after raping the girl. She had even bolted the doors of the room.

To their defence, the convicted duo argued that no rape took place and they were falsely implicated and arrested under political pressure. They blamed the sarpanch of the survivor's village, who, the duo claimed had got the FIR registered against them.

Having considered the submissions, the bench trashed the argument saying, ""The victim was from a socio-economic backward village and it is a matter of common knowledge that such villagers had no courage to face such uncommon incidents, and so in such a situation they always try to take the help of known person in the village when they had to go to police station."""

The Bombay High Court recently held that ""ghastly and heinous"" crimes, such as rape, when they take place in villages, have a serious impact on the minds of villagers and also place question marks on the future of minor victims in view of the socio-economical backwardness of the areas.

A division bench of Justice S S Shinde and Justice A S Gadkari refused to enhance the sentence sought by the state of a male class teacher and the headmistress of a primary school for raping a Class VII girl and abetting the crime, respectively. A sessions court in Raigad, Alibaug, had convicted the class teacher and the headmistress under rape and abetment charges, along with charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and sentenced them to 10 years in prison.

According to the statement of the victim to the trial court, in December 2012, the headmistress called he girl to a room next to her office. When the girl went in, the headmistress locked up the room from the outside. The class teacher then removed her clothes, took photographs of her and raped her. He also threatened her against speaking to anyone about the incident. Later, the headmistress opened the door and the girl was allowed to go home. She informed her mother about the incident but got no support to file an FIR. On January 22, 2013, the girl went to a police station and filed a complaint.

The bench observed that after considering the evidence, it was found that the evidence of the student is ""consistent, reliable and trustworthy"". She specifically said that the class teacher committed the crime and the headmistress abetted it, the bench noted.

The court also considered the statement of a witness, who said that when the class teacher's mobile phone was checked, it was found that it had as many as 15 obscene photographs of girl students.

On Thursday, police had claimed to have solved the murder with the arrest of Sunita's husband, Manjeet Sehrawat (38), and his alleged partner, Angel Gupta, and her foster father Rajeev.

Both the Iranian-aligned armed Houthi movement and Yemen's internationally recognized government have deployed forces in various districts of the southwestern city, Yemen's third largest.

Al-Shorbagy opened the school following the outbreak of war saying he had nowhere to send his own children. However, 500 boys and girls aged between six and 15 signed up for lessons in that first year.

""All the schools closed down and we had a problem that our kids were on the street,"" Al-Shorbagy told Reuters.

Inside the house, facilities are basic, with exposed brick walls and big gaps where windows should be. Ripped curtains are used to divide up space for classrooms.

Undeterred, the eager children find any space they can on the floor, with barely any room to move, let alone write. They share donated books and follow what one of the 16 volunteer teachers writes on a broken white board.

Classes include math, science and English, with Al-Shorbagy saying he follows the pre-war Yemeni curriculum.

Despite the ramshackle setting and lack of facilities, the school is oversubscribed in a country where education has been decimated and accessible, free school options are limited.

Some 2,500 schools have been damaged or destroyed since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government, a UNICEF report said in March.

A 38-year-old government school teacher was gunned down by unidentified assailants in Bawana, while she was en route to school on Monday morning -- hours before she was to be felicitated for her batch's academic performance.

According to police, Sunita was a primary school teacher at a Haryana government school in Sonepat's Ferozepur -- 8 km away from her home in Bawana village.

DCP (Rohini) Rajneesh Gupta said, ""The woman was shot thrice by the assailants -- in the chest and abdomen. We have ruled out robbery as a motive and are investigating the case from all angles.""

Sunita's family have told police that they suspect her husband Manjeet is behind the murder. DCP Gupta said he is being questioned. ""The woman kept a diary in which she wrote about some personal issues with her husband,"" Gupta said.

Sunita lived with her husband, a property dealer, and two children studying in classes VII and XI.

Her family said she was to receive a medal from the school today. ""She was a very hard-working teacher. In the morning, she cooked breakfast for her children and waited for them to leave before she left. The children came home from school today and learnt about the murder... they are in shock,"" said her brother-in-law Sanjeet.

Police said Sunita left home at 7.40 am, and a PCR call about the murder was made at 8.05 am.

According to the eyewitness who made the call, he first thought the woman had met with an accident as she was lying on the ground.

""I moved a little further, but heard gunshots and saw some men fleeing the spot,"" he said, suggesting that she fell when the assailants shot her, and then they circled back to shoot her again.

Police said a crowd gathered and ascertained the woman's identity from the documents she was carrying, following which her family was contacted.

In the meantime, she was taken Maharishi Valmiki hospital. ""She was declared dead on arrival by doctors, and the body was taken to Ambedkar hospital in Rohini for a post-mortem,"" said a police officer.

At the mortuary, the husband's family denied his involvement in the case and said the couple had ""no marital or financial problems"".

Meanwhile, Sunita's family said a ""teacher's murder was unpardonable"".

""Out of a batch of 70 students in our village, she was the only one who cleared the Class X exam. She went on to do a Sanskrit course... she was also a gold medalist in her

MA batch. She wanted to become a school principal, and was preparing for an MA in English as she thought her qualifications were inadequate,"" said Sunita's elder brother, Rajesh Malik."

The deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru on Friday issued an order cancelling Prathibha's deputation.

Babar, now 25, has taught more than 3000 children in the last 16 years, in a school he started in 2002 when he was only nine and in fifth standard. He started his school at the backyard of his family's small house under a guava tree at Gangpur village in Murshidabad district, West Bengal.

Speaking to Eastern Mirror over telephone, Babar shared his inspiring story of how things unfolded at a tender age. Born in 1993 at Gangpur village, Babar started his schooling at Bhabta Rasidiya Primary School in 1998 and was there till class 4. The school was two kilometres from his house.

In 2002, when he was nine years old, his father Nasiruddin, a jute trader with a small income, got him admitted to Beldanga CRGS High School, about ten kilometres away. He used walk two kilometres daily to catch a bus to the school. That walk actually changed his destiny.

""While returning from school I used to see kids my age working in fields, grazing cattle, and picking rags and scraps instead of attending school,"" Babar recalled. ""When I came to know that they were not attending school because their parents were too poor to afford school fees, it touched my heart and I decided to teach them every day after I return from school.""

It was the same year (2002) that Babar started teaching eight children (aged between five and nine), including his younger sister Amina Khatun, under a guava tree at his parents' backyard. He was the only teacher of his school when it first started.

""I used to teach children of my age from 4 pm to 6 pm after returning from school. I taught my students whatever I learned in school, and they learned it happily,"" Babar reminisced.

In 2003, when Babar was in class 6, he approached the retired principal of Beldanga SRF College, Sanath Kar, who was a close friend of his father, to inaugurate his school, to which the latter obliged and in March 2003, the school was named Ananda Shiksha Niketan (House of Joyful Learning).

Babar has been an ardent advocate of Swami Vivekananda's teachings. He used to visit the ashram of Ramakrishna Mission, located three kilometres from his house, regularly when he was five or six years old.

""I hardly knew about the mission and its teachings. However, I was gradually inspired by the teachings of Vivekananda and his selfless service to humanity. I still go there whenever I get time,"" Babar said.

He said that in March 2003, when he visited the ashram the priest gave him a book and advised him to read for at least five minutes every day. ""It was in that book that I found a quote, 'Service to man is service to God,' which inspired me to continue with my mission till today,"" Babar asserted.

Ananda Shiksha Niketan was recognised (unaided) by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education in 2012 and now offers education from class 1 to 8. It also offers a course for classes 9 and 10 as well, though not recognised yet.

Babar said that after the media reported his work and school, the villagers who were initially sceptical about sending their children to his school changed their mind, and the number of students swelled over time.

Babar shifted his school to Shankarpara village, in 2015, three kilometres away from the previous location. The plot for the new school was donated by Almitra Patel, an NRI, in 2013.

""We already have 300 students including 200 girls, fewer than at our previous address (location) where we had 800 students. We are trying to bring some of those students here by school buses,"" he said.

Babar's biography has been included in the Central Board of Secondary Education syllabus for Class 10, and Karnataka government has included the same in the Class 12 English textbook.

Babar, who completed English honours from Krishnath College, Berhampore in 2013 and Master's degree in history from Kalyani University (distance learning) in 2015, was named ""youngest headmaster in the world"" by the BBC in October 2009 when he was just 16. He has received several awards, including NDTV 'Indian of the Year' and CNN IBN Real Heroes, in 2009, and also featured in 'Forbes Asia 2016 30 under 30 Asia list in Social Entrepreneurs category.

At present, the school has 10 staff, including eight teachers out of which six are its alumni.

""My dream is to teach children till my last breath. I want to see each and every child (in the country) educated,"" Barbar shared."

This was the third such incident since the publication of the complete draft of the NRC on July 30.

Mangaldoi district is about 100 km from state capital Guwahati.

Nirod Kumar Das, who used to practise as a lawyer after retirement, was found hanging by the neck in his room by family members after he had returned from his morning walk on Sunday, Superintendent of Police Sreejith T said.

In a note allegedly left behind, 74-year-old Das stated that he was taking the extreme step to ""escape the humiliation of being marked as a foreigner after the NRC process,"" the family members said.

A local police official confirmed the cause of the death as hanging.

All his family members, including his wife, three daughters, their husbands and children, as well as most of his relatives were enlisted in the NRC, they said.

Das was under distress since the exclusion of his name from the complete draft of the NRC, and more so, when the local NRC processing centre gave him a document, about two months back, stating that his name was put on hold as he had been marked as a foreigner, his family members said.

In his note, Das blamed nobody and listed five people whom he owed Rs 1,200 and asked his family members to return the money, the family and police said.

The agitated family members and locals had refused to let police take Das' body for postmortem Sunday, demanding that action be taken against the NRC processing centre for marking him a ""foreigner"".

They relented only after the district deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police went to the lawyer's house and assured them of a probe to find out why Das' name was excluded and how he was marked as a ""foreigner"".

After retiring at the end of his 34-year career as a teacher in a government school, Das had studied law and was practising in the district court at Mangaldoi near Kharupetia, his family members said.

Meanwhile, the Bengali Students Federation has called a day-long Kharupetia bandh Monday to protest against the exclusion of Das' name from the complete draft of the NRC.

Markets, shops, educational institutions, private offices and banks remained closed, while vehicles were off the roads during the bandh, officials said."

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

In the confines of Pongalur, this former government-aided school teacher has dedicated her verdant eight-and-a-half acre to hundreds of trees. The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends."

On October 29, Saifi, along with his two associates, had shot dead Sunita (38), a government school teacher, at Bawana, AK Singla, Additional Commissioner of Police, (Crime) said.

Sunita's husband Manjeet had planned her killing as she was against his relationship with another woman. Police have already arrested four persons -- Manjeet, Angel Gupta, Rajeev and Deepak - in the case, Singla added.

According to police, Deepak hired killers from Meerut. He asked his uncle, Dharmender, who agreed to kill Sunita for Rs 10 lakh, the officer said.

Dharmender recruited Shehzad and Vishal. On that day, all three gunned down Sunita while she was on her way to school, he said.

On Tuesday, police received information that Shehzad would be coming to old Seema Puri area and at around 8 pm, he was apprehended, Singla said.

During interrogation, it was revealed that on October 25, they came to Bawana to kill Sunita, however, she had already left for school by the time they reached due to which they rescheduled their plan for October 29, he said.

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

The HC said the teachers were supposed to be the custodians and guardians of the minor girl but they committed the heinous crime.

A division bench of Justices Sambhaji Shinde and Ajay Gadkari said, ""In the present case though there is delay of about two months in lodging the FIR, considering the fact that the victim was minor girl at the relevant time the offence took place. The offence was committed by her teacher, who was supposed to be her custodian and guardian during school hours.""

""It also needs to be remembered that if such ghastly and heinous crime take place in the villages, it creates serious impact on the minds of the villagers and puts question marks on future of minor victim girls,"" the judges observed. The bench accordingly, upheld the conviction and 18-years rigorous imprisonment of professor - Datta Jadhav (43) and also the 16-years rigorous imprisonment of principal - Vanita Patil (56).

Both Jadhav and Patil were employees of a Zilla Parishad school in Raigad. They had petitioned the bench of Justice Shinde, challenging their conviction by a sessions court. According to the prosecution case, Jadhav had molested several minor girl students of his school by abusing his post as a professor. He had even raped a 12-year-old girl and had even clicked obscene photos of 13 minor girls of his school. These photographs were later recovered from Jadhav's cell phone.

As far as Patil is concerned, she was convicted by the sessions court for abetting the crime by pushing the minor girl inside a room, where Jadhav committed rape on the girl. It was learnt that Patil stood outside the room and ensured that no one enters the room until Jadhav comes out after raping the girl. She had even bolted the doors of the room.

To their defence, the convicted duo argued that no rape took place and they were falsely implicated and arrested under political pressure. They blamed the sarpanch of the survivor's village, who, the duo claimed had got the FIR registered against them.

Having considered the submissions, the bench trashed the argument saying, ""The victim was from a socio-economic backward village and it is a matter of common knowledge that such villagers had no courage to face such uncommon incidents, and so in such a situation they always try to take the help of known person in the village when they had to go to police station."""

Earlier, Londhe had filed a report to seek custodial remand of the teacher for five days. Additional public prosecutor Makarand Aurangabadkar submitted that custodial interrogation of the suspect was essential. He pleaded that sufficient time be given to the police to find out whether the teacher had committed similar offence in the past.

The prosecution argued that the suspect's interrogation was also essential to find out whether other schoolteachers and staff members were aware of the alleged acts committed by the suspect.

Almost 700 come daily to his house which he converted into a school in the government-held city of Taiz, which has been at the center of a three-and-a-half-year civil war that has left millions on the brink of famine.

Both the Iranian-aligned armed Houthi movement and Yemen's internationally recognized government have deployed forces in various districts of the southwestern city, Yemen's third largest.

Al-Shorbagy opened the school following the outbreak of war saying he had nowhere to send his own children. However, 500 boys and girls aged between six and 15 signed up for lessons in that first year.

""All the schools closed down and we had a problem that our kids were on the street,"" Al-Shorbagy told Reuters.

""We opened this building as a community initiative. It was my national and humanitarian duty towards my neighborhood.""

Inside the house, facilities are basic, with exposed brick walls and big gaps where windows should be. Ripped curtains are used to divide up space for classrooms.

Undeterred, the eager children find any space they can on the floor, with barely any room to move, let alone write. They share donated books and follow what one of the 16 volunteer teachers writes on a broken white board.

Classes include math, science and English, with Al-Shorbagy saying he follows the pre-war Yemeni curriculum.

Despite the ramshackle setting and lack of facilities, the school is oversubscribed in a country where education has been decimated and accessible, free school options are limited.

Some 2,500 schools have been damaged or destroyed since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government, a UNICEF report said in March.

Two million children are out of school in Yemen, including Shehab Mohamed Hazzaa, whose mother was trying to enroll him at Al-Shorbagy's school.

""I came here to register... in the school and the principal told me that it is too crowded and rejected him,"" said the mother, who declined to be named.

The only other option in the city are private schools but they cost up to 100,000 Yemeni riyal ($400) per year, putting them out of reach for many in the impoverished Arab country."

Following orders issued by the department of public instruction deputing the school's in-charge headmistress Prathibha to another taluk, nearly 290 students staged a protest demanding that she remain at DB Kuppe.

The deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru on Friday issued an order cancelling Prathibha's deputation. The students, who received support from the members of the School Development Monitoring Committee (SDMC), locked classrooms and staged a dharna in front of the school. Prompted by these unforeseen developments, senior officials from the education department visited the school, where they found the students refusing to budge.

Forced to relent in the face of the protest by students, the department cancelled the deputation of the teacher in question. Prathibha has been working at the school for more than a decade, and has developed a good rapport with both the students and their parents. On learning of her deputation, the students and the villagers decided to protest the decision.

SDMC president Raju said, ""Prathibha has been working at the school for the past 12 years, and her performance has been commendable.

The boy's parents have registered an FIR with the Nigdi police against the teacher.

Despite repeated requests since Tuesday, the principal of the school did not agree to speak to this newspaper on the case. She refused to meet the correspondent when he went to the school on Wednesday. A security guard at the gate said the principal had asked him to convey that everything had been ""resolved"". The teacher concerned could also not be reached.

The school functioned normally on Wednesday.

The boy, who is admitted at the Lokmanya Hospital in Nigdi, said he, and the teacher's son, were travelling on the same school bus on Monday morning when some other students 'teased' him (the teacher's son). ""Some boys teased the son of the teacher, who is not my class teacher. The teacher's son also taunted the boys. It all happened between them. I was only present there,"" he said.

According to them, none of the CCTV footage of the day the incident took place shows the teacher anywhere near the girl, and also, the child had not visited the washroom that day even once. Based on these findings, the staffers have written a letter to the police, Dindoshi sessions court and the child's parents, and have also attached scanned copies of the CCTV footages with it.

The letter mentions, ""The girl was not seen at the place where her family members alleged the incident took place. The allegations made against the teacher are false and baseless. Hence we are stepping in and offering to provide a lawyer for her. Her bail application has also been submitted in court."" However, the sessions court rejected her plea.

Babar, now 25, has taught more than 3000 children in the last 16 years, in a school he started in 2002 when he was only nine and in fifth standard. He started his school at the backyard of his family's small house under a guava tree at Gangpur village in Murshidabad district, West Bengal.

Speaking to Eastern Mirror over telephone, Babar shared his inspiring story of how things unfolded at a tender age. Born in 1993 at Gangpur village, Babar started his schooling at Bhabta Rasidiya Primary School in 1998 and was there till class 4. The school was two kilometres from his house.

In 2002, when he was nine years old, his father Nasiruddin, a jute trader with a small income, got him admitted to Beldanga CRGS High School, about ten kilometres away. He used walk two kilometres daily to catch a bus to the school. That walk actually changed his destiny.

""While returning from school I used to see kids my age working in fields, grazing cattle, and picking rags and scraps instead of attending school,"" Babar recalled. ""When I came to know that they were not attending school because their parents were too poor to afford school fees, it touched my heart and I decided to teach them every day after I return from school.""

It was the same year (2002) that Babar started teaching eight children (aged between five and nine), including his younger sister Amina Khatun, under a guava tree at his parents' backyard. He was the only teacher of his school when it first started.

""I used to teach children of my age from 4 pm to 6 pm after returning from school. I taught my students whatever I learned in school, and they learned it happily,"" Babar reminisced.

In 2003, when Babar was in class 6, he approached the retired principal of Beldanga SRF College, Sanath Kar, who was a close friend of his father, to inaugurate his school, to which the latter obliged and in March 2003, the school was named Ananda Shiksha Niketan (House of Joyful Learning).

Babar has been an ardent advocate of Swami Vivekananda's teachings. He used to visit the ashram of Ramakrishna Mission, located three kilometres from his house, regularly when he was five or six years old.

""I hardly knew about the mission and its teachings. However, I was gradually inspired by the teachings of Vivekananda and his selfless service to humanity. I still go there whenever I get time,"" Babar said.

He said that in March 2003, when he visited the ashram the priest gave him a book and advised him to read for at least five minutes every day. ""It was in that book that I found a quote, 'Service to man is service to God,' which inspired me to continue with my mission till today,"" Babar asserted.

Ananda Shiksha Niketan was recognised (unaided) by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education in 2012 and now offers education from class 1 to 8. It also offers a course for classes 9 and 10 as well, though not recognised yet.

Babar said that after the media reported his work and school, the villagers who were initially sceptical about sending their children to his school changed their mind, and the number of students swelled over time.

Babar shifted his school to Shankarpara village, in 2015, three kilometres away from the previous location. The plot for the new school was donated by Almitra Patel, an NRI, in 2013.

""We already have 300 students including 200 girls, fewer than at our previous address (location) where we had 800 students. We are trying to bring some of those students here by school buses,"" he said.

Babar's biography has been included in the Central Board of Secondary Education syllabus for Class 10, and Karnataka government has included the same in the Class 12 English textbook.

Babar, who completed English honours from Krishnath College, Berhampore in 2013 and Master's degree in history from Kalyani University (distance learning) in 2015, was named ""youngest headmaster in the world"" by the BBC in October 2009 when he was just 16. He has received several awards, including NDTV 'Indian of the Year' and CNN IBN Real Heroes, in 2009, and also featured in 'Forbes Asia 2016 30 under 30 Asia list in Social Entrepreneurs category.

At present, the school has 10 staff, including eight teachers out of which six are its alumni.

""My dream is to teach children till my last breath. I want to see each and every child (in the country) educated,"" Barbar shared."

All his family members, including his wife, three daughters, their husbands and children, as well as most of his relatives were enlisted in the NRC, they said.

Das was under distress since the exclusion of his name from the complete draft of the NRC, and more so, when the local NRC processing centre gave him a document, about two months back, stating that his name was put on hold as he had been marked as a foreigner, his family members said.

In his note, Das blamed nobody and listed five people whom he owed Rs 1,200 and asked his family members to return the money, the family and police said.

The agitated family members and locals had refused to let police take Das' body for postmortem Sunday, demanding that action be taken against the NRC processing centre for marking him a ""foreigner"".

They relented only after the district deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police went to the lawyer's house and assured them of a probe to find out why Das' name was excluded and how he was marked as a ""foreigner"".

After retiring at the end of his 34-year career as a teacher in a government school, Das had studied law and was practising in the district court at Mangaldoi near Kharupetia, his family members said.

Meanwhile, the Bengali Students Federation has called a day-long Kharupetia bandh Monday to protest against the exclusion of Das' name from the complete draft of the NRC.

Markets, shops, educational institutions, private offices and banks remained closed, while vehicles were off the roads during the bandh, officials said."

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

""A cheating case was registered against Ravinder under section 420 of the IPC besides Section 5 of Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act, 1999. The other directors of the company are absconding,"" the police commissioner said."

The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends."

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

File image of Security forces in Cameroon. Reuters

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

The chief minister had on Friday ordered a probe into the allegations of stripping made by some of the students and their parents. The chief minister had also directed Secretary Education Krishan Kumar to complete the investigation by Monday and take further action if necessary.

The HC said the teachers were supposed to be the custodians and guardians of the minor girl but they committed the heinous crime.

A division bench of Justices Sambhaji Shinde and Ajay Gadkari said, ""In the present case though there is delay of about two months in lodging the FIR, considering the fact that the victim was minor girl at the relevant time the offence took place. The offence was committed by her teacher, who was supposed to be her custodian and guardian during school hours.""

""It also needs to be remembered that if such ghastly and heinous crime take place in the villages, it creates serious impact on the minds of the villagers and puts question marks on future of minor victim girls,"" the judges observed. The bench accordingly, upheld the conviction and 18-years rigorous imprisonment of professor - Datta Jadhav (43) and also the 16-years rigorous imprisonment of principal - Vanita Patil (56).

Both Jadhav and Patil were employees of a Zilla Parishad school in Raigad. They had petitioned the bench of Justice Shinde, challenging their conviction by a sessions court. According to the prosecution case, Jadhav had molested several minor girl students of his school by abusing his post as a professor. He had even raped a 12-year-old girl and had even clicked obscene photos of 13 minor girls of his school. These photographs were later recovered from Jadhav's cell phone.

As far as Patil is concerned, she was convicted by the sessions court for abetting the crime by pushing the minor girl inside a room, where Jadhav committed rape on the girl. It was learnt that Patil stood outside the room and ensured that no one enters the room until Jadhav comes out after raping the girl. She had even bolted the doors of the room.

To their defence, the convicted duo argued that no rape took place and they were falsely implicated and arrested under political pressure. They blamed the sarpanch of the survivor's village, who, the duo claimed had got the FIR registered against them.

Having considered the submissions, the bench trashed the argument saying, ""The victim was from a socio-economic backward village and it is a matter of common knowledge that such villagers had no courage to face such uncommon incidents, and so in such a situation they always try to take the help of known person in the village when they had to go to police station."""

A special court on Tuesday remanded the suspect in police custody till November 1.

Earlier, Londhe had filed a report to seek custodial remand of the teacher for five days. Additional public prosecutor Makarand Aurangabadkar submitted that custodial interrogation of the suspect was essential. He pleaded that sufficient time be given to the police to find out whether the teacher had committed similar offence in the past.

The prosecution argued that the suspect's interrogation was also essential to find out whether other schoolteachers and staff members were aware of the alleged acts committed by the suspect.

Opposing the prosecution's plea, defence lawyer Narendra Jadhav argued that the custodial interrogation of the suspect was not essential because there was nothing to be recovered from him. He submitted that to conduct investigations at the school, the detention of the suspect in police custody was unwarranted.

The union issued on Tuesday a copy of a letter addressed to the director of the School Education department. The group cautioned that failure to send teachers within seven days would force the students to agitate.

Almost 700 come daily to his house which he converted into a school in the government-held city of Taiz, which has been at the center of a three-and-a-half-year civil war that has left millions on the brink of famine.

Both the Iranian-aligned armed Houthi movement and Yemen's internationally recognized government have deployed forces in various districts of the southwestern city, Yemen's third largest.

Al-Shorbagy opened the school following the outbreak of war saying he had nowhere to send his own children. However, 500 boys and girls aged between six and 15 signed up for lessons in that first year.

""All the schools closed down and we had a problem that our kids were on the street,"" Al-Shorbagy told Reuters.

""We opened this building as a community initiative. It was my national and humanitarian duty towards my neighborhood.""

Inside the house, facilities are basic, with exposed brick walls and big gaps where windows should be. Ripped curtains are used to divide up space for classrooms.

Undeterred, the eager children find any space they can on the floor, with barely any room to move, let alone write. They share donated books and follow what one of the 16 volunteer teachers writes on a broken white board.

Classes include math, science and English, with Al-Shorbagy saying he follows the pre-war Yemeni curriculum.

Despite the ramshackle setting and lack of facilities, the school is oversubscribed in a country where education has been decimated and accessible, free school options are limited.

Some 2,500 schools have been damaged or destroyed since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government, a UNICEF report said in March.

Two million children are out of school in Yemen, including Shehab Mohamed Hazzaa, whose mother was trying to enroll him at Al-Shorbagy's school.

""I came here to register... in the school and the principal told me that it is too crowded and rejected him,"" said the mother, who declined to be named.

The only other option in the city are private schools but they cost up to 100,000 Yemeni riyal ($400) per year, putting them out of reach for many in the impoverished Arab country."

The students of the Government Higher Primary School in DB Kuppe, HD Kote taluk expressed their gratitude for their teacher not in words or gifts, but through a campaign to ensure she remained with them. Following orders issued by the department of public instruction deputing the school's in-charge headmistress Prathibha to another taluk, nearly 290 students staged a protest demanding that she remain at DB Kuppe.

The deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru on Friday issued an order cancelling Prathibha's deputation. The students, who received support from the members of the School Development Monitoring Committee (SDMC), locked classrooms and staged a dharna in front of the school. Prompted by these unforeseen developments, senior officials from the education department visited the school, where they found the students refusing to budge.

Forced to relent in the face of the protest by students, the department cancelled the deputation of the teacher in question. Prathibha has been working at the school for more than a decade, and has developed a good rapport with both the students and their parents. On learning of her deputation, the students and the villagers decided to protest the decision.

SDMC president Raju said, ""Prathibha has been working at the school for the past 12 years, and her performance has been commendable. For a very long time, the school does not have adequate number of teachers, which has had an adverse effect on the education of children. But, since Prathibha came to the school, she has managed things effectively,""

The teacher was allegedly deputed to another taluk following an allegation by a member of the DB Kuppe gram panchayat.

HD Kote block education officer Sundar told TOI that the allegation pertained to abuse of school facilities. ""After the GP member made these allegations, we deputed the teacher to Magge village. But she did not report there, and since the students and SDMC members demanded that she be retained, she has been allowed to continue at the school,"" Sundar said."

On a statement he said in an interview, he said that without delay, he took off his jacket and wrapped it around the teacher's chest where she was bleeding. He witnessed how the boy did the stabbing despite him trying to keep it concealed. In other words, Mason saw it all.

This type of behavior from children nowadays has been alarming. We get to hear news about incidents like this weekly having students kill students, stabbing teachers and the like. It's about time that we re-evaluate the lessons we have thought our children within our homes. Is our homes still a healthy environment for our children's character growth? Are we still giving them the premium of learning right manners and obedience? Or are we just allowing them to live their lives the way they want it to be and how they discover it?

We are responsible for the outcome the next generation is producing, and we should take matters like this very seriously. We faced life before they did. It will never be an excuse to say that they have a new way of living because discipline, whether we like it or not, will still be the same and it needs immediate action.

The boy's parents have registered an FIR with the Nigdi police against the teacher.

Despite repeated requests since Tuesday, the principal of the school did not agree to speak to this newspaper on the case. She refused to meet the correspondent when he went to the school on Wednesday. A security guard at the gate said the principal had asked him to convey that everything had been ""resolved"". The teacher concerned could also not be reached.

The school functioned normally on Wednesday.

The boy, who is admitted at the Lokmanya Hospital in Nigdi, said he, and the teacher's son, were travelling on the same school bus on Monday morning when some other students 'teased' him (the teacher's son). ""Some boys teased the son of the teacher, who is not my class teacher. The teacher's son also taunted the boys. It all happened between them. I was only present there,"" he said.

""After we reached the school, the teacher held my collar, twisted my arm and slapped and kicked me. She kicked me in the stomach as well. Some students and teachers saw this. The beating continued for about 10-15 minutes,"" he said, adding that the teacher also threatened him.

According to them, none of the CCTV footage of the day the incident took place shows the teacher anywhere near the girl, and also, the child had not visited the washroom that day even once. Based on these findings, the staffers have written a letter to the police, Dindoshi sessions court and the child's parents, and have also attached scanned copies of the CCTV footages with it.

The letter mentions, ""The girl was not seen at the place where her family members alleged the incident took place. The allegations made against the teacher are false and baseless. Hence we are stepping in and offering to provide a lawyer for her. Her bail application has also been submitted in court."" However, the sessions court rejected her plea.

Babar, now 25, has taught more than 3000 children in the last 16 years, in a school he started in 2002 when he was only nine and in fifth standard. He started his school at the backyard of his family's small house under a guava tree at Gangpur village in Murshidabad district, West Bengal.

Speaking to Eastern Mirror over telephone, Babar shared his inspiring story of how things unfolded at a tender age. Born in 1993 at Gangpur village, Babar started his schooling at Bhabta Rasidiya Primary School in 1998 and was there till class 4. The school was two kilometres from his house.

In 2002, when he was nine years old, his father Nasiruddin, a jute trader with a small income, got him admitted to Beldanga CRGS High School, about ten kilometres away. He used walk two kilometres daily to catch a bus to the school. That walk actually changed his destiny.

""While returning from school I used to see kids my age working in fields, grazing cattle, and picking rags and scraps instead of attending school,"" Babar recalled. ""When I came to know that they were not attending school because their parents were too poor to afford school fees, it touched my heart and I decided to teach them every day after I return from school.""

It was the same year (2002) that Babar started teaching eight children (aged between five and nine), including his younger sister Amina Khatun, under a guava tree at his parents' backyard. He was the only teacher of his school when it first started.

""I used to teach children of my age from 4 pm to 6 pm after returning from school. I taught my students whatever I learned in school, and they learned it happily,"" Babar reminisced.

In 2003, when Babar was in class 6, he approached the retired principal of Beldanga SRF College, Sanath Kar, who was a close friend of his father, to inaugurate his school, to which the latter obliged and in March 2003, the school was named Ananda Shiksha Niketan (House of Joyful Learning).

Babar has been an ardent advocate of Swami Vivekananda's teachings. He used to visit the ashram of Ramakrishna Mission, located three kilometres from his house, regularly when he was five or six years old.

""I hardly knew about the mission and its teachings. However, I was gradually inspired by the teachings of Vivekananda and his selfless service to humanity. I still go there whenever I get time,"" Babar said.

He said that in March 2003, when he visited the ashram the priest gave him a book and advised him to read for at least five minutes every day. ""It was in that book that I found a quote, 'Service to man is service to God,' which inspired me to continue with my mission till today,"" Babar asserted.

Ananda Shiksha Niketan was recognised (unaided) by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education in 2012 and now offers education from class 1 to 8. It also offers a course for classes 9 and 10 as well, though not recognised yet.

Babar said that after the media reported his work and school, the villagers who were initially sceptical about sending their children to his school changed their mind, and the number of students swelled over time.

Babar shifted his school to Shankarpara village, in 2015, three kilometres away from the previous location. The plot for the new school was donated by Almitra Patel, an NRI, in 2013.

""We already have 300 students including 200 girls, fewer than at our previous address (location) where we had 800 students. We are trying to bring some of those students here by school buses,"" he said.

Babar's biography has been included in the Central Board of Secondary Education syllabus for Class 10, and Karnataka government has included the same in the Class 12 English textbook.

Babar, who completed English honours from Krishnath College, Berhampore in 2013 and Master's degree in history from Kalyani University (distance learning) in 2015, was named ""youngest headmaster in the world"" by the BBC in October 2009 when he was just 16. He has received several awards, including NDTV 'Indian of the Year' and CNN IBN Real Heroes, in 2009, and also featured in 'Forbes Asia 2016 30 under 30 Asia list in Social Entrepreneurs category.

At present, the school has 10 staff, including eight teachers out of which six are its alumni.

""My dream is to teach children till my last breath. I want to see each and every child (in the country) educated,"" Barbar shared."

Nirod Kumar Das, who used to practise as a lawyer after retirement, was found hanging by the neck in his room by family members after he had returned from his morning walk on Sunday, Superintendent of Police Sreejith T said.

In a note allegedly left behind, 74-year-old Das stated that he was taking the extreme step to ""escape the humiliation of being marked as a foreigner after the NRC process,"" the family members said.

A local police official confirmed the cause of the death as hanging.

All his family members, including his wife, three daughters, their husbands and children, as well as most of his relatives were enlisted in the NRC, they said.

Das was under distress since the exclusion of his name from the complete draft of the NRC, and more so, when the local NRC processing centre gave him a document, about two months back, stating that his name was put on hold as he had been marked as a foreigner, his family members said.

In his note, Das blamed nobody and listed five people whom he owed Rs 1,200 and asked his family members to return the money, the family and police said.

The agitated family members and locals had refused to let police take Das' body for postmortem Sunday, demanding that action be taken against the NRC processing centre for marking him a ""foreigner"".

They relented only after the district deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police went to the lawyer's house and assured them of a probe to find out why Das' name was excluded and how he was marked as a ""foreigner"".

After retiring at the end of his 34-year career as a teacher in a government school, Das had studied law and was practising in the district court at Mangaldoi near Kharupetia, his family members said.

Meanwhile, the Bengali Students Federation has called a day-long Kharupetia bandh Monday to protest against the exclusion of Das' name from the complete draft of the NRC.

Markets, shops, educational institutions, private offices and banks remained closed, while vehicles were off the roads during the bandh, officials said."

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

""A cheating case was registered against Ravinder under section 420 of the IPC besides Section 5 of Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act, 1999. The other directors of the company are absconding,"" the police commissioner said."

The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends."

The excess teacher transfer or absorption process, officially termed as 'samayojan' in Marathi, is currently going on in Nagpur with almost 700 teachers termed as excess. Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Sanstha Mahamandal (MRSSM) , which is an association of trusts/societies that own schools, has written to the education minister and officials concerned asking them to desist from carrying out the process any further.

""It is contempt of court by the education department,"" said Ravindra Fadnavis, joint secretary of MRSSM. ""We have approached the court when 2016-17 absorption process was going on and the issue went right up to the Supreme Court. Other legal matters related to this are also pending and our understanding is that no absorption process can be carried out until the court gives the green signal,"" said Fadnavis.

Speaking to TOI, he made it clear that his association has firmed up plans to take legal action against any education officer who forces schools to accept new teachers from the excess pool. ""If teachers from the excess pool are not appointed then education officials threaten our principals. Don't they know that principals do not have the authority to make any appointment? It is the management alone that can take the decision. This is pressure tactics being used by the department to arm twist schools into submission. But now we will not take this lying down,"" said Fadnavis.

The MRSSM is also preparing for a fresh round of legal battle. ""We will pursue the issue to its legal conclusion, as the intimidation by the education department needs to be stopped,"" said Fadnavis."

The school has suspended the teacher and has also set up an inquiry committee.

The parents of the boy, Prasanna Patil, have claimed that he suffered a mild paralytic attack as a result of the alleged beating. Doctors treating Prasanna told TOI that he has developed temporary facial muscle weakness.

Prasanna is a boarder and class 6 student at the AISSMS' Shri Shivaji Preparatory Military School (SSPMS) and hails from Jamb village in Indapur.

Inspector Pramod Waghmare of the Shivajinagar police station said an offence has been registered under section 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Juvenile Justice Act. ""We have detained the teacher, Sandip Gade. Our probe is on,"" he told TOI.

Prasanna's parents brought him to Pune for medical tests on Monday.

We cannot categorically ascertain that this was caused by physical beating. He has weakness in the muscles on one side of the face.""

""I had then noticed that the right side of his face was swollen. I had asked him about the swelling but he did not say anything,"" Patil, a farmer by profession, said.

Patil said that during the Diwali festival, he again noticed that Prasanna could not talk properly and had even lost the ability to move the muscles on the right side of his face. ""Only after my wife, Ashwini, questioned him that he opened up to say that Gade had beaten him for not completing the assignment,"" he said.

Patil said he took Prasanna to a private hospital in Baramati, where he was told that the boy had suffered a mild paralytic attack.

Ashwini said Prasanna told the doctors that Gade had brutally beaten him. ""He said Gade had told him to keep his hands on the bench and then slapped him several times. Gade even punched my son on the head and pinched him on the stomach. Prasanna does not remember the exact date he was beaten, but says it happened between October 15 and 25,"" she said.

Ashwini said Gade has tendered an apology. ""But that is not enough. We want legal action against him so that he should not dare to beat other students in future,"" she said.

Gade's wife Savita said he has accepted having slapped Prasanna for his incomplete work. ""However, he did not beat him in a brutal manner as claimed by the parents. My husband has been teaching drawing in the school since 1996. He is quite popular among the students,"" she said.

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

File image of Security forces in Cameroon. Reuters

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

The orders were issued late on Monday night after he received the inquiry report, which found the incident to be a case of gross negligence, indifference and insensitivity on the part of the teachers of the school.

The Chief Minister has issued strict instructions to show no laxity in the matter as the respect and dignity of the girl students could not be allowed to be compromised at any cost. He has reiterated his government's commitment to providing a favourable environment for the education and empowerment of girls.

The Chief Minister had on Friday ordered a probe into the allegations of stripping made by some of the students and their parents. The Chief Minister had also directed Secretary Education Krishan Kumar to complete the investigation by Monday and take further action as necessary.

The incident was brought to the notice of Captain Amarinder after a video showed girl students crying and complaining that they had been stripped by the teachers in the school premises. The teachers were reportedly trying to find out which of the girls was wearing a sanitary pad, after one was found in the school toilet.

The inquiry report said the students were checked twice on the directions, and with the full knowledge of, the school head Kuldeep Kaur and teacher Jyoti. The girls were checked with their clothes on the first time, and then the two women got them checked again by senior girl students of Class VIII with their clothes taken off, as per the SDM Abohar, at whose office the statements of Kuldeep and Jyoti were recorded on Monday.

During the first checking, which was undertaken in the mid-day meal kitchen, Kuldeep Kaur was standing outside all through the process, the inquiry committee members, DEO Fazilka Kulwant Singh, SHO Sadar Abohar Angrej Singh and District Child Protection Officer Fazilka Ritu, have stated in their report.

The committee unanimously agreed to the indifference and insensitivity towards women's physical dignity expressed by the school staff. The report further said that though there may not have been any intent of physical/sexual assault, the teachers, at the outset, were found to be negligent and careless.

A chargesheet will be issued under Rule 8 of the Conduct Rules against the Kuldeep and Joyti, who have already been placed under suspension, according to the Fazilka.

The HC said the teachers were supposed to be the custodians and guardians of the minor girl but they committed the heinous crime.

A division bench of Justices Sambhaji Shinde and Ajay Gadkari said, ""In the present case though there is delay of about two months in lodging the FIR, considering the fact that the victim was minor girl at the relevant time the offence took place. The offence was committed by her teacher, who was supposed to be her custodian and guardian during school hours.""

""It also needs to be remembered that if such ghastly and heinous crime take place in the villages, it creates serious impact on the minds of the villagers and puts question marks on future of minor victim girls,"" the judges observed. The bench accordingly, upheld the conviction and 18-years rigorous imprisonment of professor - Datta Jadhav (43) and also the 16-years rigorous imprisonment of principal - Vanita Patil (56).

Both Jadhav and Patil were employees of a Zilla Parishad school in Raigad. They had petitioned the bench of Justice Shinde, challenging their conviction by a sessions court. According to the prosecution case, Jadhav had molested several minor girl students of his school by abusing his post as a professor. He had even raped a 12-year-old girl and had even clicked obscene photos of 13 minor girls of his school. These photographs were later recovered from Jadhav's cell phone.

As far as Patil is concerned, she was convicted by the sessions court for abetting the crime by pushing the minor girl inside a room, where Jadhav committed rape on the girl. It was learnt that Patil stood outside the room and ensured that no one enters the room until Jadhav comes out after raping the girl. She had even bolted the doors of the room.

To their defence, the convicted duo argued that no rape took place and they were falsely implicated and arrested under political pressure. They blamed the sarpanch of the survivor's village, who, the duo claimed had got the FIR registered against them.

Having considered the submissions, the bench trashed the argument saying, ""The victim was from a socio-economic backward village and it is a matter of common knowledge that such villagers had no courage to face such uncommon incidents, and so in such a situation they always try to take the help of known person in the village when they had to go to police station."""

The prosecution argued that the suspect's interrogation was also essential to find out whether other schoolteachers and staff members were aware of the alleged acts committed by the suspect.

Opposing the prosecution's plea, defence lawyer Narendra Jadhav argued that the custodial interrogation of the suspect was not essential because there was nothing to be recovered from him. He submitted that to conduct investigations at the school, the detention of the suspect in police custody was unwarranted.

Earlier, around 150 parents launched an agitation outside the school and met the principal demanding that the authorities take measures to ensure the safety of students and to resolve their problems.

The school trustee said, ""We were not aware of the alleged incident in the PE room, we came to know about this from the police on Tuesday. The four students have been referred to a counselling session.We have assured the parents' delegation that the students are safe. Any other issues raised by the parents will be decided on merit."""

Examinations for the students are scheduled for November, the union stated.

The union issued on Tuesday a copy of a letter addressed to the director of the School Education department. The group cautioned that failure to send teachers within seven days would force the students to agitate.

The copy read: 'The government high school, Khaghaboto is the only high school which caters the educational needs of 17 villages under its jurisdiction. However, it is dismal to note that the GHS, Khaghaboto has been functioning without adequate teachers for the past so many months.'

The school has been left with only one mathematics teacher ""due to retire by January 2019"" after the mathematics teacher was transferred to Chumukedima village without any replacement, the union stated.

'The school is left without science teacher after the sole science teacher under RMSA qualified in the state teacher examination and was transferred to Thenyizu on 25th September,2018. The school is also functioning with only one Hindi teacher.'

The organisation has asked the authorities to provide two permanent teachers for each subject and to deploy a science teacher immediately.

The union added: 'Given that the final examination for class 8 and 9 is scheduled on November 20 and 26 respectively, the union urges the department kindly to make immediate arrangements especially for the science teacher within 7 days from the date of this press release failing which we will have no other option but to register our protest by boycotting the science exam for which the department will be held solely responsible.'"

Almost 700 come daily to his house which he converted into a school in the government-held city of Taiz, which has been at the center of a three-and-a-half-year civil war that has left millions on the brink of famine.

Both the Iranian-aligned armed Houthi movement and Yemen's internationally recognized government have deployed forces in various districts of the southwestern city, Yemen's third largest.

Al-Shorbagy opened the school following the outbreak of war saying he had nowhere to send his own children. However, 500 boys and girls aged between six and 15 signed up for lessons in that first year.

""All the schools closed down and we had a problem that our kids were on the street,"" Al-Shorbagy told Reuters.

""We opened this building as a community initiative. It was my national and humanitarian duty towards my neighborhood.""

Inside the house, facilities are basic, with exposed brick walls and big gaps where windows should be. Ripped curtains are used to divide up space for classrooms.

Undeterred, the eager children find any space they can on the floor, with barely any room to move, let alone write. They share donated books and follow what one of the 16 volunteer teachers writes on a broken white board.

Classes include math, science and English, with Al-Shorbagy saying he follows the pre-war Yemeni curriculum.

Despite the ramshackle setting and lack of facilities, the school is oversubscribed in a country where education has been decimated and accessible, free school options are limited.

Some 2,500 schools have been damaged or destroyed since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government, a UNICEF report said in March.

Two million children are out of school in Yemen, including Shehab Mohamed Hazzaa, whose mother was trying to enroll him at Al-Shorbagy's school.

""I came here to register... in the school and the principal told me that it is too crowded and rejected him,"" said the mother, who declined to be named.

The only other option in the city are private schools but they cost up to 100,000 Yemeni riyal ($400) per year, putting them out of reach for many in the impoverished Arab country."

The students of the Government Higher Primary School in DB Kuppe, HD Kote taluk expressed their gratitude for their teacher not in words or gifts, but through a campaign to ensure she remained with them. Following orders issued by the department of public instruction deputing the school's in-charge headmistress Prathibha to another taluk, nearly 290 students staged a protest demanding that she remain at DB Kuppe.

The deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru on Friday issued an order cancelling Prathibha's deputation. The students, who received support from the members of the School Development Monitoring Committee (SDMC), locked classrooms and staged a dharna in front of the school. Prompted by these unforeseen developments, senior officials from the education department visited the school, where they found the students refusing to budge.

Forced to relent in the face of the protest by students, the department cancelled the deputation of the teacher in question. Prathibha has been working at the school for more than a decade, and has developed a good rapport with both the students and their parents. On learning of her deputation, the students and the villagers decided to protest the decision.

SDMC president Raju said, ""Prathibha has been working at the school for the past 12 years, and her performance has been commendable. For a very long time, the school does not have adequate number of teachers, which has had an adverse effect on the education of children. But, since Prathibha came to the school, she has managed things effectively,""

The teacher was allegedly deputed to another taluk following an allegation by a member of the DB Kuppe gram panchayat.

HD Kote block education officer Sundar told TOI that the allegation pertained to abuse of school facilities. ""After the GP member made these allegations, we deputed the teacher to Magge village. But she did not report there, and since the students and SDMC members demanded that she be retained, she has been allowed to continue at the school,"" Sundar said."

The incident happened quickly, as described. The 13-year-old boy called the teacher to come over and immediately stabbed her in the chest. Luckily, Mason Walter braved himself into the situation. On a statement he said in an interview, he said that without delay, he took off his jacket and wrapped it around the teacher's chest where she was bleeding. He witnessed how the boy did the stabbing despite him trying to keep it concealed. In other words, Mason saw it all. After their teacher, the boy also pointed the butcher knife on the other student, threatening others that he would kill the student if they videotaped him. Mason then distracted the boy to get some help.

He also stated that in one of their past conversations, the 13-year-old boy wanted to kill someone. The boy and the teacher's identity remains confidential and unnamed to the public for safety reasons.

This type of behavior from children nowadays has been alarming. We get to hear news about incidents like this weekly having students kill students, stabbing teachers and the like. It's about time that we re-evaluate the lessons we have thought our children within our homes. Is our homes still a healthy environment for our children's character growth? Are we still giving them the premium of learning right manners and obedience? Or are we just allowing them to live their lives the way they want it to be and how they discover it?

We are responsible for the outcome the next generation is producing, and we should take matters like this very seriously. We faced life before they did. It will never be an excuse to say that they have a new way of living because discipline, whether we like it or not, will still be the same and it needs immediate action. We hope you get to do something different in your homes today!"

The child told his parents that he had been beaten continuously for 10-15 minutes in front of other students on Monday by the teacher who suspected that he had teased her son, also a student of the same school.

The boy's parents have registered an FIR with the Nigdi police against the teacher.

Despite repeated requests since Tuesday, the principal of the school did not agree to speak to this newspaper on the case. She refused to meet the correspondent when he went to the school on Wednesday. A security guard at the gate said the principal had asked him to convey that everything had been ""resolved"". The teacher concerned could also not be reached.

The school functioned normally on Wednesday.

The boy, who is admitted at the Lokmanya Hospital in Nigdi, said he, and the teacher's son, were travelling on the same school bus on Monday morning when some other students 'teased' him (the teacher's son). ""Some boys teased the son of the teacher, who is not my class teacher. The teacher's son also taunted the boys. It all happened between them. I was only present there,"" he said.

""After we reached the school, the teacher held my collar, twisted my arm and slapped and kicked me. She kicked me in the stomach as well. Some students and teachers saw this. The beating continued for about 10-15 minutes,"" he said, adding that the teacher also threatened him.

""It was only after some other teachers intervened, that I was let off,"" he said. The boy showed the injury marks on his legs, stomach, arms and on the neck.

The boy's father said his son was badly injured and crying in the school. ""But he was not allowed to call us up. When he came home, he almost collapsed, after which we rushed him to the hospital,"" said his father.

He said when he went to the school to complain against the teacher, the principal only admonished the teacher but did not suspend her. ""She said she could not do much except issue a memo,"" he said.

Pimpri Chinchwad Police Commissioner R K Padmanabhan said the police had registered a non-cognisable offence against the teacher and was pursuing the case seriously.

A month after the Kandivli police arrested a 24-year-old female teacher of a local school for allegedly sexually abusing a four-year-old girl, 68 staffers of the school have come out in support of her.

According to them, none of the CCTV footage of the day the incident took place shows the teacher anywhere near the girl, and also, the child had not visited the washroom that day even once. Based on these findings, the staffers have written a letter to the police, Dindoshi sessions court and the child's parents, and have also attached scanned copies of the CCTV footages with it.

The letter mentions, ""The girl was not seen at the place where her family members alleged the incident took place. The allegations made against the teacher are false and baseless. Hence we are stepping in and offering to provide a lawyer for her. Her bail application has also been submitted in court."" However, the sessions court rejected her plea.

""The teacher has been working with us for the past two-and-a-half years. Her behaviour towards the students, other staff and parents has been good. There have been no complaints against her,"" the letter states.

Speaking to mid-day, the accused's younger brother said, ""My sister is being punished for something she hasn't done. Her co-prisoners in jail are harassing her physically and mentally. Even her bail application got rejected.""

When contacted, Senior Police Inspector Nitin Pondkule said, ""We have checked four hours of CCTV footage and have also sent the victim for a medical check-up.

Babar, now 25, has taught more than 3000 children in the last 16 years, in a school he started in 2002 when he was only nine and in fifth standard. He started his school at the backyard of his family's small house under a guava tree at Gangpur village in Murshidabad district, West Bengal.

Speaking to Eastern Mirror over telephone, Babar shared his inspiring story of how things unfolded at a tender age. Born in 1993 at Gangpur village, Babar started his schooling at Bhabta Rasidiya Primary School in 1998 and was there till class 4. The school was two kilometres from his house.

In 2002, when he was nine years old, his father Nasiruddin, a jute trader with a small income, got him admitted to Beldanga CRGS High School, about ten kilometres away. He used walk two kilometres daily to catch a bus to the school. That walk actually changed his destiny.

""While returning from school I used to see kids my age working in fields, grazing cattle, and picking rags and scraps instead of attending school,"" Babar recalled. ""When I came to know that they were not attending school because their parents were too poor to afford school fees, it touched my heart and I decided to teach them every day after I return from school.""

It was the same year (2002) that Babar started teaching eight children (aged between five and nine), including his younger sister Amina Khatun, under a guava tree at his parents' backyard. He was the only teacher of his school when it first started.

""I used to teach children of my age from 4 pm to 6 pm after returning from school. I taught my students whatever I learned in school, and they learned it happily,"" Babar reminisced.

In 2003, when Babar was in class 6, he approached the retired principal of Beldanga SRF College, Sanath Kar, who was a close friend of his father, to inaugurate his school, to which the latter obliged and in March 2003, the school was named Ananda Shiksha Niketan (House of Joyful Learning).

Babar has been an ardent advocate of Swami Vivekananda's teachings. He used to visit the ashram of Ramakrishna Mission, located three kilometres from his house, regularly when he was five or six years old.

""I hardly knew about the mission and its teachings. However, I was gradually inspired by the teachings of Vivekananda and his selfless service to humanity. I still go there whenever I get time,"" Babar said.

He said that in March 2003, when he visited the ashram the priest gave him a book and advised him to read for at least five minutes every day. ""It was in that book that I found a quote, 'Service to man is service to God,' which inspired me to continue with my mission till today,"" Babar asserted.

Ananda Shiksha Niketan was recognised (unaided) by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education in 2012 and now offers education from class 1 to 8. It also offers a course for classes 9 and 10 as well, though not recognised yet.

Babar said that after the media reported his work and school, the villagers who were initially sceptical about sending their children to his school changed their mind, and the number of students swelled over time.

Babar shifted his school to Shankarpara village, in 2015, three kilometres away from the previous location. The plot for the new school was donated by Almitra Patel, an NRI, in 2013.

""We already have 300 students including 200 girls, fewer than at our previous address (location) where we had 800 students. We are trying to bring some of those students here by school buses,"" he said.

Babar's biography has been included in the Central Board of Secondary Education syllabus for Class 10, and Karnataka government has included the same in the Class 12 English textbook.

Babar, who completed English honours from Krishnath College, Berhampore in 2013 and Master's degree in history from Kalyani University (distance learning) in 2015, was named ""youngest headmaster in the world"" by the BBC in October 2009 when he was just 16. He has received several awards, including NDTV 'Indian of the Year' and CNN IBN Real Heroes, in 2009, and also featured in 'Forbes Asia 2016 30 under 30 Asia list in Social Entrepreneurs category.

At present, the school has 10 staff, including eight teachers out of which six are its alumni.

""My dream is to teach children till my last breath. I want to see each and every child (in the country) educated,"" Barbar shared."

Nirod Kumar Das, who used to practise as a lawyer after retirement, was found hanging by the neck in his room by family members after he had returned from his morning walk on Sunday, Superintendent of Police Sreejith T said.

In a note allegedly left behind, 74-year-old Das stated that he was taking the extreme step to ""escape the humiliation of being marked as a foreigner after the NRC process,"" the family members said.

A local police official confirmed the cause of the death as hanging.

All his family members, including his wife, three daughters, their husbands and children, as well as most of his relatives were enlisted in the NRC, they said.

Das was under distress since the exclusion of his name from the complete draft of the NRC, and more so, when the local NRC processing centre gave him a document, about two months back, stating that his name was put on hold as he had been marked as a foreigner, his family members said.

In his note, Das blamed nobody and listed five people whom he owed Rs 1,200 and asked his family members to return the money, the family and police said.

The agitated family members and locals had refused to let police take Das' body for postmortem Sunday, demanding that action be taken against the NRC processing centre for marking him a ""foreigner"".

They relented only after the district deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police went to the lawyer's house and assured them of a probe to find out why Das' name was excluded and how he was marked as a ""foreigner"".

After retiring at the end of his 34-year career as a teacher in a government school, Das had studied law and was practising in the district court at Mangaldoi near Kharupetia, his family members said.

Meanwhile, the Bengali Students Federation has called a day-long Kharupetia bandh Monday to protest against the exclusion of Das' name from the complete draft of the NRC.

Markets, shops, educational institutions, private offices and banks remained closed, while vehicles were off the roads during the bandh, officials said."
