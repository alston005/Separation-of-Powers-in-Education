Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Monday hit out at the BJP, Congress and the INLD, saying these parties indulge in caste politics and the Aam Aadmi Party talks about building schools and hospitals. Kejriwal recalled his first brief 49-day stint in power when he resigned over the Jan Lokpal Bill issue, saying his aim was never to capture power and he never clung to power.

""People don't leave a chowkidar's job even, but I kicked the CM post in 49 days. We we are not here for power, we want to build nation and nation cannot be built by fights over temple and mosques, by pitching Jats and non-Jats, but by building schools, hospitals and roads,"" Kejriwal said addressing a public gathering in Beri in this district.

Kejriwal and Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia visited three government schools at Beri in the district on Monday. Hitting out at the Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress and the Indian National Lok Dal, he accused these parties of doing caste politics.

""They come to you and seek votes in the name of caste...,"" he alleged. At the same time, he told the gathering that he does not need power, but sought support for AAP, saying it will provide a viable alternative if it forms the next government in Haryana. ""Those who want to have good hospitals, good education, cheap power, it is your responsibility to bring AAP to power,"" he said.

""Will Chautala, Khattar and Hooda give you schools, those of you who think Kejriwal can, raise their hands. Purpose of my life is not to capture power, but bring a change in your lives,"" he said trying to strike a chord with people. He also said that the next elections in Haryana will be fought on issues like school, hospitals, farmers, jawans, water and power.

Kejriwal said that he visited Beri Monday after a few elders and youths from the town had visited his Delhi residence a few days back and told him that they were impressed with the change they have witnessed in government schools in Delhi. ""They said they have seen schools in Delhi and lamented that the condition of schools in Beri was bad. We visited three schools today and met some parents there. We visited one girls school, which has five classes with only two teachers... The intent of the government here does not seem to bring a real change in education system,"" he alleged.

He said that before the AAP came to power, the condition of government schools in Delhi was worse.

""Change doesn't come by mere speeches, but you have to work hard for this. And Manish Sisodia worked hard to bring about this change. Had you ever heard that teachers of government schools being sent to the US and the UK for training...Results of government schools are even better now and many people are pulling out their children out of private schools and admitting them in government schools in Delhi,"" he said. He said many private schools used to fleece students by charging exorbitant fees and effecting hike every year.

""We issued orders that no fees will be increased, despite this 197 schools hiked fees and out of this 160 fees have refunded the increased fees back to students. The remaining have been ordered to immediately refund the fees or else government will take over such schools,"" he said.

""Likewise, we brought change in Delhi's government hospitals. Anyone visiting Delhi's government hospitals, they are provided free treatment.

Yet again this year, education received the highest allocation (26.3%) in the Delhi Budget, with funds being allocated to install 150-200 CCTVs in each school and to develop a ranking system for government schools. Allocation increased from last year's Rs 11,300 crore to Rs 13,997 crore in Thursday's budget.

Stressing on the need to keep students safe, Finance Minister Manish Sisodia said 1.2 lakh CCTV cameras will be installed across government schools. ""An outlay of Rs 175 crore has been proposed in the budget estimate 2018-19. About 150-200 cameras will be installed in each school building. Parents will now be able to see classroom activities of their children online,"" Sisodia said. The plan was announced in the last budget but was not implemented as it remained stuck in the tendering process.

Rs 15 crore for ranking government schools will be given to the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights. ""Parents are concerned about the safety of their wards. They don't have access to authentic information on quality of education, environment and facilities in schools. We are bringing a new scheme under which every school will be evaluated...,"" he said.

Continuing the scheme to strengthen school management committees, the bodies will be given a Rs 5 lakh budget to purchase books for libraries, teaching aids, etc.

The proposals, though, came under criticism. ""Investments that focus on installation of CCTVs and online streaming of classrooms promote a bizarre and dangerous mode of surveillance of teachers and children. It does not create a trusting, creative and good learning environment,"" said Anita Rampal, a professor in DU's Department of Education.

The government also said it will give tablets to teachers -- another promise made last year. Rs 10 crore has been allocated to teach girl students self-defence."
