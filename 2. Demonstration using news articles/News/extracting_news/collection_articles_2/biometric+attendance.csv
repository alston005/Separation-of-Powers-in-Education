The system was previously used on a pilot basis for three to four mains exams conducted by the state civil services.

In fact, the prelims exam conducted on December 23 for Class II officers of Women and Child Welfare department used biometric attendance system, Chandrashekhar Oak, acting chairman of MPSC, said.

All the prelims conducted from January 2019 will also have biometric attendance system in place. The MPSC conducts examinations for recruitment of various state government departments through direct, competitive, departmental or limited vacancy exams. ""The number of candidates appearing for direct recruitment and competitive exams is huge. The competitive exams are mainly held in three phases, including prelims, mains and interview, while in direct recruitment exams there are two phases consisting of prelims and interviews. The biometric system will help in eliminating bogus students appearing for any of these exams,"" said Oak.

Compared to the main exam, the number of students appearing for prelims is much bigger. Hence, the commission decided to implement the system on a pilot basis for mains exams. The exams conducted in November and December had biometric attendance, but for the prelims the system had not been used yet.

""At the time of filling of forms, the Aadhar details of every student are taken based on which the identity of the candidates is verified. On Sunday, the exam held for women and child welfare department was the first prelims exam for which the identification system was used,"" Oak said.

Before entering the examination hall, candidates have to press their thumbs in the machine following which their photographs are taken. They are then allowed to enter the exam hall."

Following repeated complaints from citizens across the city about Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials not being available for them in its offices, the civic body is all set to link biometric attendance with the Human Resource Management System (HRMS).

According to sources in the BBMP, the biometric system and the HRMS were working as standalone systems. With no link between the two systems, the BBMP officials were not bothered about punching in and out on time or even regularly.

C.R. Lakshminarayan, former chairperson of BBMP's Standing Committee for Personnel and Administrative Reforms, said the committee had, on several occasions, recommended that the two systems be linked.

""The BBMP insists on taking the pourakarmikas' biometric attendance thrice a day. Yet, the officials are least bothered to do so themselves,"" he said and added that the committee had found officials who turn up late to work and leave early. ""We even received complaints from public about officials not turning up for work on Fridays before the second Saturdays,"" he added.

He also claimed that the committee had found that there was a minimum 15% absenteeism on any given day among the 9,000-odd BBMP employees. ""However, with the failure in enforcing the biometric attendance system and linking it with the HRMS, the civic body is paying officials even though they have remained absent,"" he charged.

Concurring, D. Randeep, Additional Commissioner (Administration), told The Hindu that the civic body would link both systems soon.

In case punching in is not done at the appropriate time or officials have punched out early, the system will automatically treat it as half day and salary will be cut. He said, in case the officials were out on field inspection or occupied elsewhere, the supervisors will have to certify the same. Until then, the system would treat them as being absent.

""This was a long pending move. The Standing Committee had also submitted its recommendation in this regard to the Administration Department several times. By linking both biometric and HRMS, we will be bringing in some discipline and accountability among the officials at all levels,"" he added."

But last week, when she checked her attendance, she found herself marked either late or absent for few days, when she was very much present and on time. Worried about what might have gone wrong, she checked in with her colleague, who also complained of the same issue.

This problem for Kumari and other teachers in an east Delhi school has occurred as a result of the Aadhaar-based biometric attendance system introduced in the 1,100 schools in Delhi earlier this September.

""It is a hassle for us now to get these things corrected. These days all activities of the teachers are being monitored, so this might cause a problem for us later.

In an increasingly dynamic business environment, all scales of industries require real-time Biometric Attendance System and a seamless access control solution. There are many challenges faced by the industry with most of the existing options, such as fraudulent employee time reporting, accessing and misusing other employee's access cards, altering work hours, et cetera. According to an American Payroll Association, an average employee reportedly plagiarizes approximately 4 and a half hours per week, which is corresponding to 6 weeks' vacation if extended over a year.

TimeDynamo's primary features include tracking & storing employee attendance, leave management request and approvals, managing employee information, and generating customized e-attendance data, which could readily be integrated or uploaded into existing HR or payroll management systems. Employees can see their own timesheet while the team leads can behold the attendance of the team members on TimeDynamo's user friendly mobile app. This product is very helpful for startups, small & big retailers & MSMEs and presently offered in SaaS-based subscription model.

The current edition of TimeDynamo supports fingerprint access, which provides the clock in/out, break patterns, leaves, permissions, OT requests and expense claims of employees. Industries like healthcare and retail do not function in the same timings and it is a strenuous task for the management to create separate schedules for each section. But with roster, a feature of TimeDynamo, retail and healthcare organizations could create weekly/monthly work schedules customizing employee shifts, week offs, overtime and branch/leave swapping as per their business need.

The company's CEO Mr. Sudhir Naidu expresses, ""TimeDynamo has already helped more than 100+ enterprises automate their day-to-day life activities successfully."" He proudly mentions, ""TimeDynamo has been shortlisted by NASSCOM under top 10 innovative Product Showcases, in the fifth edition of Nasscom Product Conclave (NPC). And TimeDynamo will be launching the Dual Iris and Geo-location based attendance recording platform and a fully integrated payroll management system, before the end of this year.""

Government of Uttar Pradesh is trying to deal with the problem of prosthetic thumbs that are being supplied by rubber stamp manufacturers across the state. These help a person to log into the biometric attendance systems in government offices. The state government had finished installing biometric systems across all government offices last year. But sadly, loopholes are being exploited.

The prosthetic thumbs which cast the imprint of a specific individual is priced at Rs 300 in districts like Azamgarh, Varanasi etc. The users of these thumbs can vary from government to private employees, hackers and so on. Those who aren't willing to attend the office can find this to be a proxy way to obtain attendance. These thumbs can be used to hack into laptops, phones and computers too, reported The New Indian Express.

But several district administration and police teams across various districts are tracking down the ones who run these rackets. District Magistrate of Varanasi, DM Surendra Singh has been quoted as saying, ""Possibility of misuse of prosthetic thumbs can't be denied. However, it is not that easy.

A biometric machine is being provided to schools with a strength of 100 students and managements have been instructed to record students' attendance before serving the midday meal while for teaching and non-teaching staff it will be done in the mornings and evenings.

The programme is being implemented in collaboration with the Unique Identification Authority of India and State Information Technology Department.

A year after Chief Minister Vijay Rupani floated the idea of relocating residents of some of the flood-affected villages of Banaskantha and Patan districts, the state government is set to relocate around 500-600 families of five villages from two tehsils of Banaskantha which have been repeatedly facing the brunt of floods. The five villages are Nagla, Dodgam and Khanpur of Tharad tehsil, and Kuda and Jasara of Lakhni tehsil of the district.

The state Revenue Department has identified land where the families will be relocated, and work on levelling land parcels has started. This will be followed by construction of amenities like primary school, local dairy cooperative, anganwadi etc.

""We have identified and given the land for relocation. Now, the rest of the work is being done by the district collectorate in tandem with the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA),"" said an officer of the Revenue Department.

""The original village areas of these five villages were comparatively on a higher position. However, over the years, it got expanded and people also started living in the low-lying peripheral areas that get inundated during floods. So, we have decided to shift only those people to a higher location with their consent, instead of the entire population of the village,"" said Resident Additional Collector of Banaskantha L B Bambhaniya.

According to Bambhaniya, only those families are being shifted who have given their consent to be shifted to a new location. ""Mapping of the land and layout of the relocation plan is also ready. Simultaneously, a proposal has been sent to the state government for equipping the new location with amenities like school, dairy cooperative, anganwadi etc.. Once that proposal is cleared from the Finance Department, work will begin to have those amenities,"" Bambhaniya added.

Minister of State for Water Resources (Independent charge) Parbat Patel, who is the local BJP MLA from Tharad, said, ""The villagers will be getting land for accommodation in two ways; those below poverty line (BPL) will get a particular size accommodation and those not falling under the BPL category will get residence of size equal to their original residence.""

Banaskantha had witnessed two major floods -- one in 2015 and then in 2017. The 2017 floods were, in particular, very serious. Chief Minister Rupani had camped for five days in Banaskantha to oversee the flood relief work. It was during that time, Rupani had floated the idea of shifting people from villages that repeatedly get affected by floods to a safer place.

At least 60 persons and hundreds of livestock were killed in the 2017 floods. Banaskantha district has a significant dairy activity in Gujarat.

Local Congress MLA Geniben Thakor, however, said that the state government has been moving at a snail's pace in the relocation work. ""The CM announced this in monsoon last year. More than one year has passed, and yet there is no significant work on the ground. We do not know as to exactly when the work will be completed and the families be shifted to a safer place. This year, we have not received enough rain, but think of a situation if there was flooding this year too. There could have been casualties like last year,"" said Thakor.

Minister Parbat Patel, however, blame the delay on getting the consent from the families. ""The delay in relocation occurred because of hesitation of people in giving consent. Government was always eager to finish the work at the earliest. But, we cannot shift people without their consent. Once monsoon gets over, other work will be completed on priority,"" he added.

Some schools have already installed a biometric attendance system in adherence to a circular issued to all special schools by the department for empowerment of differently abled and senior citizens.""The department is now insisting the government to issue an order on installing biometric attendance system due to the stiff resistance from special schools, particularly in northern parts,'' says the department's director Siddaraju.

Karnataka state disabled and caregivers federation general secretary, Arpuda Rajan, said an order on making biometric systems compulsory for all special schools is a step in the right direction. He told TNIE that the director, during surprise visits to special schools in Bengaluru and northern parts of Karnataka, found no students or few students inside the classrooms. ""The number of students was inflated to elicit more funds,"" he said.

""Besides ensuring real-time attendance, the biometric system will also facilitate free supply of food grains,'' Siddaraju said. Karnataka state union for differently abled service organisations' general secretary Vasanth Shetty, however, said that the biometric attendance system is no less than a punishment for children with Down Syndrome. ""Marking their attendance through this method could take hours because it is difficult to get restless autistic children or children with cerebral palsy to press their thumb on the scanner,"" he said.

""I had installed three biometric systems, and after unsatisfactory results, I also installed a face reading attendance system in my special school-Saanidhya residential school in Mangaluru,'' said Shetty. The department should drop the move to make biometric attendance compulsory as successive acts, including National Trust Act,had discouraged any form of punishment to differently abled children. Instead of implementing such measures, let the district disabled welfare officer inspect and blacklist special schools found violating the norms, he added.

""Why should they implement something for special schools which does not exist even for primary schools,'' Shetty asked and added that they had demanded that biometric system for special children should not be made mandatory in their memorandum submitted to CM H D Kumaraswamy in Bengaluru on July 14. Siddaraju said children with Down Syndrome and other problems can be exempted from registering attendance through the biometric system. But the reasons need to be documented, he added."

Causing an impact, the number of teachers marking attendance shot up from 1,100 to around 3,500 in a week after the notice was issued, Brar told TOI. DSE has been monitoring the attendance online on a daily basis.

All schools have been provided with Aadhaar-based biometric machines and all teaching and non-teaching staff are supposed to mark attendance through the machine.

In the letter Brar stated, ""It has been brought to my notice that most of the staff (teaching and non-teaching) are not marking their attendance on biometric machines. This is despite the fact that all UT government schools have a requisite number of biometric attendance machines and no demand for additional machine is pending with the headquarters.""

Brar said this is a serious lapse on the part of school heads. ""From now on, it will be the personal responsibility of the concerned school head to ensure all staff members mark their attendance on the biometric system without fail,"" he said.

Schools have been informed that in case of any problem with hardware or software of the biometric attendance system, the same can be brought to the notice of MIS coordinator Ajit Pal Singh, data entry operators Javed and Saurabh Kaushik via phone.

He has further instructed all the inspecting teams formed by the UT education department recently to keep an eye on the attendance.

Come next month, teaching and non-teaching staff of Osmania University (OU) and its constituent colleges will have to record attendance through biometric system. This will be linked to the payroll.

Though biometric machines were installed last year, recording attendance on it had not been made compulsory. ""We will soon issue a circular making it mandatory for all our campus colleges as well as constituent colleges,"" said OU Vice-Chancellor S. Ramchandram, adding that the University Grants Commission (UGC) has mandated it for all varsities.

As of now, there are about 950 teachers -- both regular and contractual -- at OU, including in its constituent colleges. As far as non-teaching staff is concerned, there are nearly 3,500 employees, including those working on contractual basis.

The University signed a MoU with the Telangana State Technology Services Aadhaar-based Biometric Attendance System (TSBS-ABAS) for implementing the system. TSBS-ABAS will be responsible for installing the machines and also for the software.

OU plans to make it compulsory for affiliated colleges in a phased manner. Some of them are already doing it and the rest should follow in the interests of students, the Vice-Chancellor said. In affiliated colleges, the managements have been asked to collect ₹100 per student per semester for installation of the facility.

Varsity officials feel the move will improve accountability among teachers and the non-teaching staff and ultimately, help the student community. This will also bring in more discipline among some teachers accused of not taking classes. The higher authorities will have the evidence to pull up teachers who come late and miss classes or leave early without permission.

Prof. Ramchandram said he plans to extend the biometric attendance system to research scholars soon since they have to work in labs. Their regular visits will streamline the research activity and help them complete their projects on time, he added.

On including students in the biometric system, he said it was ""inevitable but we don't want to rush as of now""."

TOI has learnt about at least two colleges in the city that are mulling installation of the biometric system on the premises of their partner coaching institute. With the government not mandating any GPS mapping for the biometric device, there is no stopping unscrupulous colleges from circumventing the rules.

State education minister Vinod Tawde told TOI on Monday that he will update the government's directive to reflect a mandatory GPS mapping clause. TOI spoke to three different dealers in biometric attendance systems and all of them confirmed that by default, these devices come without GPS technology.

Though none of them wanted to be named as they deal with educational institutes too, the dealers said there was no way the 'fraud' could be found out if the client did not wish it. ""GPS mapping can be a value added service with cloud-based software but rarely does the client opt for it. And yes, it is very much possible for colleges to install such devices at coaching classes and the monthly report won't reflect the location. So on paper, the students would have marked their attendance on college campus itself,"" said one of the dealers.

The state's decision to make biometric attendance mandatory is the result of students bunking regular lectures at junior colleges en masse and attending coaching class instead. Government-aided colleges were losing out on enrolment as students took admission in little known and unaided colleges which overlooked mass bunking.

The financial partnership between colleges and coaching classes ensures that the wheels of the multi-crore business keep moving smoothly.

An association representing principals of aided colleges had last month appealed to their members to ignore the mandatory attendance rule. An office bearer of the Headmasters Association told TOI, ""That's the only way we could fill up our seats. Students are moving in hordes to colleges that you have never heard of, only because their fake attendance is marked there.""

Falling enrolment means job of lecturers is under threat, as appointment is related directly to student numbers.

Meanwhile, the local education department has started gathering data from colleges about whether or not they have installed biometric machines on campus. But till the government specifically mentions ""GPS mapping"" as mandatory, the officials won't be able to act on it."

While many attending the academic council (AC) meeting claimed that the decision was taken by the vice-chancellor in a ""casual"" manner, many others are supporting it as a move that will bring ""transparency"".

Only recently Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) witnessed months of protests by students against a decision to introduce compulsory attendance for them. Many teachers had supported the protest, claiming JNU students did not need surveillance to study properly.

Confirming the decision, JNU rector-1 Chintamani Mahapatra said, ""The new system will be implemented as soon as the minutes of the AC meeting are out."" The same system is already followed for the non-teaching staff.

The AC meeting also made it clear that the students would have to sign an undertaking while registering for a course that they would abide by the attendance rules.

Sona Jharia Minhz, president of JNU Teachers' Association (JNUTA), called the meeting a continuation of the administration's ""autocratic mode of functioning"". The decision was taken like a ""joke"", she said.

The VC gave his own example of how ""magnanimously he also marks his attendance. He said currently the system is for the staff and they will introduce it for the students"", Minhz added.

Amita Singh of Centre for Study of Law and Governance, however, said the decision would bring ""greater accountability"" on part of the teachers as many of them ""do not attend their offices and are busy with other work"".

On online entrance tests, Minhz said the committee prescribing the move should have also mentioned the cost the university would incur if the process is outsourced. ""We are also opposed to this decision because of its impact on social justice. Many aspirants won't be able to participate in such an exam.""

The JNUTA members came to the meeting with a black armband, opposing absence of any representation from School of Arts and Aesthetics (SAA). Kavita Singh, its dean, told TOI that she had nominated an acting dean on being informed that she won't be able to attend the meeting due to a pending inquiry.

If the proposal approved by all political parties on Monday is anything to go by, those skipping general assembly meeting or leaving it halfway will not be eligible for the day's allowance.

Till now, the BMC has been recording attendance of corporators through signatures on a register. ""Corporators who do not sit for the entire duration might lose the allowance for the day. The move will enforce discipline among corporators,"" BJP group leader Manoj Kotak, who moved the proposal, said.

As per rules, all corporators should attend at least four of the five general assembly meetings held every month. They are paid ₹150 as allowance for every meeting, apart from the salary and perks. Similar rules also apply to members of various committees.

Ravi Raja, leader of the Congress, said corporators, sometimes, sign the register and leave the assembly immediately. That way they would get the allowance without having to sit through the proceedings. ""We don't mind the new system, which will help all group leaders keep a check.""

A government resolution (GR) issued on Friday said all aided, unaided and self-financed junior colleges will have to install the biometric attendance machines within a month. Junior colleges in more cities are expected to be added to the initiative soon.

Popular among students in the science stream, integrated programmes are offered by some junior colleges and coaching classes as a tieup where either college may be skipped altogether while attendign the coaching class or where the coaching class teachers conduct lectures in the junior college.

In July last year, school education minister Vinod Tawde had announced the introduction of biometric attendance from this June to end malpractices.

The GR said: ""Complaints have been received against students that instead of attending college lectures, they sit in private coaching classes and attend only practicals in the colleges. It has been observed that many colleges have signed a memorandum of understanding with the private coaching centres. To avoid these incidents the government has decided to make attendance through biometric in junior colleges mandatory.""

The department also asked all education inspectors (secondary) to take a review and submit a report after visiting all colleges. Inspectors should also conduct surprise visits periodically to check whether the machines are in working condition or not, said the GR.

""It is a good move but the education department needs to arrange for manpower to be able to do physical checks,"" said Narendra Bhamwani, former president, Maharashtra Class Owners Association (MCOA). ""Otherwise, the junior colleges will install the biometric machines on the premises of the coaching classes where the students come every day.""

The MCOA had moved court against the practice of having integrated programmes.

Some leading colleges have already introduced a digital or biometric form of attendance. Some others questioned the decision. ""Why has the government introduced biometric attendance only for students from the science stream? Also, the government expects us to pay for the system and aided colleges will find it difficult to arrange funds for this,"" said a principal of a junior college.

Some parents and students were worried by the decision. ""We have already enrolled with a tutorial class and they have asked us to take admission in a particular junior college. Now we are worried how the whole thing will pan out,"" said a parent."

The move is aimed at breaking the nexus between junior colleges and coaching classes where students hardly attend classes and instead spend their time at coaching centres. It is an open secret junior colleges accept commission from coaching classes, in return for marking fake attendance of students on their rolls.

The Education Department for the last couple of years has been trying to put an end to this menace but has failed. Now it has made biometric attendance mandatory so students would be forced to attend classes regularly, or at least be on the campus to mark attendance.

While this may seem foolproof, some say it can be easily manipulated. A senior academician, who did not wish to be named, told TOI all efforts of government will fail. ""The basic problem is that in this college-class nexus, we don't have any complainant. For any problem to be raised, you need a complainant and action by the authority. In this case, all stakeholders like parents, students, coaching class and colleges are happy with the way things are. So who will bell the cat,"" he asked.

While this may seem pessimistic, there is logic to it. TOI had reported last year about the action taken by Education Department on a handful of junior colleges where this nexus was allegedly in place. Nothing came out of that except a few show-cause notices issued to the principal of institutes. The allegations of nexus were never proved and hence the department had to back out.

Another junior college principal said, ""Though I do not have tie up with any coaching class, I can say if I did, it would be impossible to prove it. For colleges already violating all guidelines, it is an easy task to work their way around a biometric attendance system. The students could be asked to remain in classroom and their coaching will be done there itself. How can anyone prove what is going on inside the classroom? The curriculum for the entrance exams is same as that of their board.""

Madhusudan Mude, office bearer of headmasters association, said, ""The move to make biometric attendance compulsory is welcome one but we also have to consider its cost. For aided colleges, there is no extra money coming, how will they raise funds to install the system?""

With the Monsoon session of legislature starting in Nagpur next month, there are chances of college owners putting pressure on the government to either extend the deadline or at least fund the system."

A division bench of justices M V Muralidaran and T Krishnavalli gave the direction to the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department and the joint commissioner of the Sri Subramaniaswamy temple, located on the shores of Tiruchendur. The temple is among the six highly revered abodes of Lord Muruga in the state and thronged by a large number of devotees.

The court was passing orders on a PIL filed by R S Kalyanasundaram, a devotee, who alleged that unauthorised persons were collecting huge amounts of money from the devotees in the name of god and also causing loss to the temple. The petitioner had also prayed that no one should be allowed to enter the temple for a special religious service without purchasing a ticket and that no unauthorised person should be allowed inside the temple.

The bench also directed the temple authorities to warn the legally-appointed priests that they should not demand money from the devotees, other than what was fixed by the administration for special religious services. It directed the authorities of the HR&CE department, which administers a large number of temples in the state, to make surprise visits to the shrine to find out whether non-appointee priests were performing religious services. The temple authorities should also ensure good toilet and water facilities, the bench said.

Asking the officials to comply with the directions immediately, the judges sought a report about the compliance on July 5.

""Instead of coming to colleges, many students attended these integrated coaching. We won't allow this anymore and that is why biometric attendance will be made mandatory in all junior colleges for both teachers and the students,"" Mr Tawde told The Asian Age on Saturday.

He said PU teachers were known for their outstanding erudition, innovation, innovative tools, research and extension and monumental contributions to their areas of interest, leading to a litany of national and international awards, including Padma Shri.

The Punjab government is all set to introduce biometric fingerprint scanning machines to mark the attendance of teachers in government schools of Punjab from April. In the first phase, machines will be installed in 900 government senior secondary schools at a cost of around Rs 30 lakh.

The plan is to set up the machines in all government schools of Punjab (nearly 20,000, including primary, middle, high and senior secondary schools) in a phased manner. However, the teachers have strongly criticised the move saying that it is sheer wastage of money seeing that schools are lacking basic facilities like benches, books and uniforms for the students. They have expressed that instead of spending such huge amount of money on biometric machines, government should first pay heed towards basic needs of the students who still study sitting on the floor due to lack of benches.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Prashant Goyal, Director General of School Education (DGSE), Punjab, confirmed that machines will be installed in 900 government schools in first phase and will be operational by April as the new session begins. ""We have purchased machines through Government e-Marketplace (GeM) which is a goods and services procurement portal run by the Government of India. The machines in phase one have cost us around Rs 30 lakh. Soon, all schools will be covered. In phase one, we are covering 900 government senior secondary schools,"" he said.

Goyal said that move is aimed at making the state education system tech-friendly and laced with latest technology. ""There is no point of still marking attendance on registers manually when a software can update us instantly. Also, it will bring in discipline and bogus attendance will be eliminated,"" he added. Asked about the source of funds, he said that funding of this project has been done through funds available with Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) society. ""We have some management funds available with RMSA which are being used here,"" he said.

Meanwhile, teachers accused government of having its priorities wrong. ""First, the government should get these machines installed at education department headquarters and other offices in Chandigarh and Mohali and district education offices before bringing teachers in its ambit. Why only teachers, not officials and higher ups should mark fingerprint attendance? Few years back, this project failed when machines were installed in block education offices. Even at other offices of education department in Chandigarh, they are lying non-functional...,"" said Sukhdheer Singh Sekhon, president, Elementary Teachers Union (Sekhon), Punjab.

Sukhwinder Singh Chahal, president, Government Teachers Union, Punjab said funds should instead be used to get benches, uniforms and books for students. ""There are principals in schools to keep an eye on teachers. What is more important is to get basic facilities first. At least give us benches and sweepers first and then talk about such hi-tech systems. This is pure wastage of money at a time when government says it has no money to buy benches and uniforms.""

Kumari, like every day, has been reaching her school on time. But last week, when she checked her attendance, she found herself marked either late or absent for few days, when she was very much present and on time. Worried about what might have gone wrong, she checked in with her colleague, who also complained of the same issue.

This problem for Kumari and other teachers in an east Delhi school has occurred as a result of the Aadhaar-based biometric attendance system introduced in the 1,100 schools in Delhi earlier this September.

""It is a hassle for us now to get these things corrected. These days all activities of the teachers are being monitored, so this might cause a problem for us later. The attendance system requires us to punch in our Aadhaar card and then scan our fingerprint, which is a time consuming progress. Why should we be marked late when the system is slow and we are not at fault,"" said Kumari.

This problem is not only at Kumari's school, but in most schools where there are a large number of teachers.

Since it has become an everyday problem, in many schools teachers are reaching at least half-an-hour before time. While in others, the teachers are forced to leave school late as they queue and wait for their turn to mark their out attendance.

""It is a cumbersome process, considering that we are still asked to mark the attendance on the register. Almost 35 teachers are made to use one system, so someone or the other is bound to get marked late every day,"" said an English teacher at a government school in north Delhi.

The issue was raised with the officials of Directorate of Education (DOE), who also acknowledged that the system is a time-taking process and takes 30-45 seconds for marking just one attendance.

""We have received such complaints from various schools about teachers being marked absent or late despite being in the school premises.

This is because of the long queue to punch in their attendance at the bio-metric system and enter their Aadhaar number. Teachers have questioned the need for the biometric system, when they are also made to sign the attendance register.

At a government school in northwest Delhi's Kohat Enclave, school starts at 7 am, but most teachers have been reaching by 6.15- 6.30 am. ""Feeding in our Aadhaar card numbers takes time. So I thought it is better to come early and punch in. If we come a little late, it means again standing in queue and sometimes getting marked late,"" said a teacher at the school, who did not want to be named.

In schools where there are many teachers, the wait is even longer. ""Why can't we have a system where there is no need to give our Aadhaar numbers? This is the main reason why it takes such a long time. It is not a good system... Several times, it fails to read our fingerprints. Teachers who live far from the school have ended up missing their trains and reaching home late,"" said Shoaib Rana, a teacher at the Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Sunder Nagri.

Another teacher questioned,""What is the point of bringing in this technology when we have to record it on paper again. Isn't it a waste of our time?""

The Directorate of Education (DoE) puts the the Employee Attendance Report on its website, which is then made available to the public. The DoE did not respond to calls and messages from The Indian Express. Teachers have demanded for more bio-metric systems. ""We have made a demand for it, but the department has not responded.

The Directorate of School Education is planning to implement the Aadhaar based biometric attendance in private and corporate schools. The new system is being planned for both students and teachers on a pilot basis to regulate attendance and weed out fake enrolments.

Officials of the Directorate of School Education are of the view that Aadhaar based biometric attendance would also aid in preparing Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) data with ease. According to the statistics available with the directorate, about 11,262 private unaided schools are functioning in the State with 31,19,525 enrolments.

""As per provisions in the GO MS 1, the department has the authority to regulate and inspect private schools. The biometric attendance will be implemented as part of the regulations,"" an official said.

For regulating schemes like midday meals and to improve the attendance of students and teachers, the directorate has commenced installing 12,700 biometric systems in 9,349 government and local body schools in 12 districts in the State on a pilot basis. A biometric machine is being provided to schools with a strength of 100 students and managements have been instructed to record students' attendance before serving the midday meal while for teaching and non-teaching staff it will be done in the mornings and evenings.

The programme is being implemented in collaboration with the Unique Identification Authority of India and State Information Technology Department. The IT Department has developed a software for dashboard to monitor attendance in real time. So far, attendance of more than 10,000 students studying in the government and local body schools is being monitored through the dashboard.

Speaking to Telangana Today, Telangana Recognised School Managements Association president S Sreenivas Reddy said the private schools have already installed biometric machines for recording the attendance of teachers.

""It is not possible to implement biometric attendance for students in private schools as the strength ranges between 1,000 and 1,500 and it will consume a lot of time,"" he said."

""The deadline has been extended so we really can't take any action. Also, the surprise checks should not be seen only as punitive action, but more of ensuring compliance with the regulations,"" said the official. A meeting of all education department employees will be held on Monday to take stock of the visit to colleges.

The state government had in June made it mandatory for all junior colleges (with science stream) within city limits to install biometric machines for students.

Approximately 200 colleges were to be affected by the decision and were initially given till July second week to finish the installation, which was extended to August, and now September. The education department had sent in squads to verify who all were following the government's decision.

A year after Chief Minister Vijay Rupani floated the idea of relocating residents of some of the flood-affected villages of Banaskantha and Patan districts, the state government is set to relocate around 500-600 families of five villages from two tehsils of Banaskantha which have been repeatedly facing the brunt of floods. The five villages are Nagla, Dodgam and Khanpur of Tharad tehsil, and Kuda and Jasara of Lakhni tehsil of the district.

The state Revenue Department has identified land where the families will be relocated, and work on levelling land parcels has started. This will be followed by construction of amenities like primary school, local dairy cooperative, anganwadi etc.

""We have identified and given the land for relocation. Now, the rest of the work is being done by the district collectorate in tandem with the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA),"" said an officer of the Revenue Department.

""The original village areas of these five villages were comparatively on a higher position. However, over the years, it got expanded and people also started living in the low-lying peripheral areas that get inundated during floods. So, we have decided to shift only those people to a higher location with their consent, instead of the entire population of the village,"" said Resident Additional Collector of Banaskantha L B Bambhaniya.

According to Bambhaniya, only those families are being shifted who have given their consent to be shifted to a new location. ""Mapping of the land and layout of the relocation plan is also ready. Simultaneously, a proposal has been sent to the state government for equipping the new location with amenities like school, dairy cooperative, anganwadi etc.. Once that proposal is cleared from the Finance Department, work will begin to have those amenities,"" Bambhaniya added.

Minister of State for Water Resources (Independent charge) Parbat Patel, who is the local BJP MLA from Tharad, said, ""The villagers will be getting land for accommodation in two ways; those below poverty line (BPL) will get a particular size accommodation and those not falling under the BPL category will get residence of size equal to their original residence.""

Banaskantha had witnessed two major floods -- one in 2015 and then in 2017. The 2017 floods were, in particular, very serious. Chief Minister Rupani had camped for five days in Banaskantha to oversee the flood relief work. It was during that time, Rupani had floated the idea of shifting people from villages that repeatedly get affected by floods to a safer place.

At least 60 persons and hundreds of livestock were killed in the 2017 floods. Banaskantha district has a significant dairy activity in Gujarat.

Local Congress MLA Geniben Thakor, however, said that the state government has been moving at a snail's pace in the relocation work. ""The CM announced this in monsoon last year. More than one year has passed, and yet there is no significant work on the ground. We do not know as to exactly when the work will be completed and the families be shifted to a safer place. This year, we have not received enough rain, but think of a situation if there was flooding this year too. There could have been casualties like last year,"" said Thakor.

Minister Parbat Patel, however, blame the delay on getting the consent from the families. ""The delay in relocation occurred because of hesitation of people in giving consent. Government was always eager to finish the work at the earliest. But, we cannot shift people without their consent. Once monsoon gets over, other work will be completed on priority,"" he added.

""Lists of colleges have already been made up and we will fan out to different parts of the city and check the status in colleges,"" said a senior official while talking about their strategy. ""We will be going through their attendance logs as well and scrutinizing every record in detail,"" he added.

While the education department's 'blitzkrieg' start date is now out in the open, it was originally supposed to be a surprise inspection campaign. ""We were having a meeting last week with some of the principals and accidentally the date got mentioned. It was a genuine mistake as in due course of conversation the date got mentioned.

This would mean that the machine installed at the college will be a dummy and the education department so far has neither the mandate nor the technical capability to verify the same.

It was in June that the state made it mandatory for junior colleges for both science and commerce streams to install biometric systems. The move aims at keeping track of students and cracking down on integrated courses. As per the department circular, lower-level officials have been asked to carry out inspection, report on how many colleges have or haven't installed the system, and submit the same to the state.

Rajendra Ahire, deputy director of education (DyDe), said, ""We have sent notices to all colleges, asking them to send a report on what is their status regarding biometric attendance. I've personally sent two such notices and probably, we will send another one on August 21 before starting inspection.""

""Strangely biometric attendance was introduced retrospectively. It was illegal and arbitrary,"" they alleged.

The biometric system was introduced without addressing the technical glitches and was discriminatory as some employees were targeted with salary deductions and there was no transparency nor any standard procedure, according to some faculty members.

A request was also submitted seeking the details of biometric attendance and salary deductions of all the employees of NIRDPR, including Director General (DG), Deputy Director General (DDG) and Registrar, and to repay the deducted amount.

Another grievance is that the biometric system was introduced without proper trial and it threw up many technical glitches resulting in discrepancy but the salary was deducted promptly. It was also said that no data on biometric attendance and salary deduction of all employees had been shared.

NIRDPR Director-General W. R. Reddy, however, rejected the allegations of discrimination and said biometric attendance was part of the institute's policy.

""I had installed three biometric systems, and after unsatisfactory results, I also installed a face reading attendance system in my special school-Saanidhya residential school in Mangaluru,'' said Shetty.

The University signed a MoU with the Telangana State Technology Services Aadhaar-based Biometric Attendance System (TSBS-ABAS) for implementing the system. TSBS-ABAS will be responsible for installing the machines and also for the software.

OU plans to make it compulsory for affiliated colleges in a phased manner. Some of them are already doing it and the rest should follow in the interests of students, the Vice-Chancellor said.

Varsity officials feel the move will improve accountability among teachers and the non-teaching staff and ultimately, help the student community.

The higher authorities will have the evidence to pull up teachers who come late and miss classes or leave early without permission.

TOI has learnt about at least two colleges in the city that are mulling installation of the biometric system on the premises of their partner coaching institute. With the government not mandating any GPS mapping for the biometric device, there is no stopping unscrupulous colleges from circumventing the rules.

State education minister Vinod Tawde told TOI on Monday that he will update the government's directive to reflect a mandatory GPS mapping clause. TOI spoke to three different dealers in biometric attendance systems and all of them confirmed that by default, these devices come without GPS technology.

Though none of them wanted to be named as they deal with educational institutes too, the dealers said there was no way the 'fraud' could be found out if the client did not wish it. ""GPS mapping can be a value added service with cloud-based software but rarely does the client opt for it. And yes, it is very much possible for colleges to install such devices at coaching classes and the monthly report won't reflect the location. So on paper, the students would have marked their attendance on college campus itself,"" said one of the dealers.

The state's decision to make biometric attendance mandatory is the result of students bunking regular lectures at junior colleges en masse and attending coaching class instead. Government-aided colleges were losing out on enrolment as students took admission in little known and unaided colleges which overlooked mass bunking.

The financial partnership between colleges and coaching classes ensures that the wheels of the multi-crore business keep moving smoothly.

An association representing principals of aided colleges had last month appealed to their members to ignore the mandatory attendance rule. An office bearer of the Headmasters Association told TOI, ""That's the only way we could fill up our seats. Students are moving in hordes to colleges that you have never heard of, only because their fake attendance is marked there.""

Falling enrolment means job of lecturers is under threat, as appointment is related directly to student numbers.

Meanwhile, the local education department has started gathering data from colleges about whether or not they have installed biometric machines on campus. But till the government specifically mentions ""GPS mapping"" as mandatory, the officials won't be able to act on it."

Speaking at a meeting to review Women and Child Welfare programmes, Ms. Jaimala said that anganwadi teachers need to concentrate on the well-being of children coming to the centres. These teachers have the onerous responsibility of moulding young children. ""These teachers can be used for immunisation and other activities of the department. They cannot be used for any other work,"" she said.

""The government is firm on this,"" Ms. Jaimala said and added that the anganwadi teachers cannot be used for census and works of other departments. Along with biometric, the Minister said that the government will bring in transparency in the working of anganwadis. ""We will know how many children and women have food in anganwadis,"" she said.

The Minister and MLC Ivan D'Souza expressed concern over the death of 10 of the 131 orphan children in the Srirama Sevasharama, Puttur, which was the only adoption centre in Dakshina Kannada. Child Protection Officer Usman said that these 10 children were found abandoned in bushy areas and waste bins. These children could not be saved despite treatment at the Government Hospital in Puttur.

Hilda Rayappan from Prajna Councelling Centre said that the department should ensure that such abandoned children are brought to the Regional Advanced Paediatric Care Centre (RAPCC) at the Government Wenlock Hospital. While directing Mr. Usman to make use of RAPCC, Ms. Jaimala said that she would consider the proposal to open another adoption centre in Mangaluru, which was pending for over two months.

""We are not getting any funding for this and thus, have installed only one machine per class. With over a hundred students in every class, it takes a very long time to record attendance,"" said a principal.

A proposal was discussed at the political group leaders' meeting on Monday. It is learnt the BMC administration responded positively to it.

Corporation meetings are crucial as a final nod for most policy decisions are given here by all party corporators.

Currently, corporators are expected to sign a register on days present. ""Often corporators barely attend meetings, but sign the register and leave. This, however, will not be possible as the 'in' and 'out' time of every corporator will be recorded in the new system,"" said a civic source.

If all goes well, the biometric system could be implemented within a month.

BJP leader Manoj Kotak, who had proposed the system, said corporators owe a responsibility to the public. ""I had moved this proposal and, everyone supported the same on Monday. It will soon be implemented,"" he said.

Congress party leader Ravi Raja termed it a good move to keep a check on the amount of time his party corporators were present at meetings. ""I can then inform party higher-ups as well,"" he said."

Corporators, like the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) employees, will now have to register themselves using biometric attendance. If the proposal approved by all political parties on Monday is anything to go by, those skipping general assembly meeting or leaving it halfway will not be eligible for the day's allowance.

Till now, the BMC has been recording attendance of corporators through signatures on a register. ""Corporators who do not sit for the entire duration might lose the allowance for the day. The move will enforce discipline among corporators,"" BJP group leader Manoj Kotak, who moved the proposal, said.

As per rules, all corporators should attend at least four of the five general assembly meetings held every month. They are paid ₹150 as allowance for every meeting, apart from the salary and perks. Similar rules also apply to members of various committees.

Ravi Raja, leader of the Congress, said corporators, sometimes, sign the register and leave the assembly immediately. That way they would get the allowance without having to sit through the proceedings. ""We don't mind the new system, which will help all group leaders keep a check.""

The system, however, will not be applicable to the Mayor and the deputy Mayor.

The proposal to install biometric machines for corporators was discussed at the group leaders' meeting on Monday, and it was passed unanimously. A group leaders' meeting is an informal body that discusses issues before they are formally brought in for discussion.

Shiv Sena group leader Vishakha Raut said, ""We have prima facie agreed to the concept, but its details need to be worked out. We don't know its modalities yet. The administration needs to come up with a detailed proposal.""

The change, if approved, will apply only to the general assembly meetings for now. Depending on its success, it can be applied to other committee meetings as well.

The decision has come in a wake of several complaints made to the education department about colleges allowing integrated courses in tie-ups with coaching classes at cost of college lectures.

The education department has ordered officials to make surprise visits to such colleges and take strict actions against those in violation of the GR.

To be piloted in the city, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad, the move requires junior colleges to do the needful in a month or face de-recognition.

A government resolution (GR) issued on Friday said all aided, unaided and self-financed junior colleges will have to install the biometric attendance machines within a month. Junior colleges in more cities are expected to be added to the initiative soon.

Popular among students in the science stream, integrated programmes are offered by some junior colleges and coaching classes as a tieup where either college may be skipped altogether while attendign the coaching class or where the coaching class teachers conduct lectures in the junior college.

In July last year, school education minister Vinod Tawde had announced the introduction of biometric attendance from this June to end malpractices.

The GR said: ""Complaints have been received against students that instead of attending college lectures, they sit in private coaching classes and attend only practicals in the colleges. It has been observed that many colleges have signed a memorandum of understanding with the private coaching centres. To avoid these incidents the government has decided to make attendance through biometric in junior colleges mandatory.""

The department also asked all education inspectors (secondary) to take a review and submit a report after visiting all colleges. Inspectors should also conduct surprise visits periodically to check whether the machines are in working condition or not, said the GR.

""It is a good move but the education department needs to arrange for manpower to be able to do physical checks,"" said Narendra Bhamwani, former president, Maharashtra Class Owners Association (MCOA). ""Otherwise, the junior colleges will install the biometric machines on the premises of the coaching classes where the students come every day.""

The MCOA had moved court against the practice of having integrated programmes.

Some leading colleges have already introduced a digital or biometric form of attendance. Some others questioned the decision. ""Why has the government introduced biometric attendance only for students from the science stream? Also, the government expects us to pay for the system and aided colleges will find it difficult to arrange funds for this,"" said a principal of a junior college.

Some parents and students were worried by the decision. ""We have already enrolled with a tutorial class and they have asked us to take admission in a particular junior college. Now we are worried how the whole thing will pan out,"" said a parent."

The move is aimed at breaking the nexus between junior colleges and coaching classes where students hardly attend classes and instead spend their time at coaching centres. It is an open secret junior colleges accept commission from coaching classes, in return for marking fake attendance of students on their rolls.

The Education Department for the last couple of years has been trying to put an end to this menace but has failed. Now it has made biometric attendance mandatory so students would be forced to attend classes regularly, or at least be on the campus to mark attendance.

While this may seem foolproof, some say it can be easily manipulated. A senior academician, who did not wish to be named, told TOI all efforts of government will fail. ""The basic problem is that in this college-class nexus, we don't have any complainant. For any problem to be raised, you need a complainant and action by the authority. In this case, all stakeholders like parents, students, coaching class and colleges are happy with the way things are. So who will bell the cat,"" he asked.

While this may seem pessimistic, there is logic to it. TOI had reported last year about the action taken by Education Department on a handful of junior colleges where this nexus was allegedly in place. Nothing came out of that except a few show-cause notices issued to the principal of institutes. The allegations of nexus were never proved and hence the department had to back out.

Another junior college principal said, ""Though I do not have tie up with any coaching class, I can say if I did, it would be impossible to prove it. For colleges already violating all guidelines, it is an easy task to work their way around a biometric attendance system. The students could be asked to remain in classroom and their coaching will be done there itself. How can anyone prove what is going on inside the classroom? The curriculum for the entrance exams is same as that of their board.""

Madhusudan Mude, office bearer of headmasters association, said, ""The move to make biometric attendance compulsory is welcome one but we also have to consider its cost. For aided colleges, there is no extra money coming, how will they raise funds to install the system?""

With the Monsoon session of legislature starting in Nagpur next month, there are chances of college owners putting pressure on the government to either extend the deadline or at least fund the system."

A division bench of justices M V Muralidaran and T Krishnavalli gave the direction to the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department and the joint commissioner of the Sri Subramaniaswamy temple, located on the shores of Tiruchendur. The temple is among the six highly revered abodes of Lord Muruga in the state and thronged by a large number of devotees.

The court was passing orders on a PIL filed by R S Kalyanasundaram, a devotee, who alleged that unauthorised persons were collecting huge amounts of money from the devotees in the name of god and also causing loss to the temple. The petitioner had also prayed that no one should be allowed to enter the temple for a special religious service without purchasing a ticket and that no unauthorised person should be allowed inside the temple.

The bench also directed the temple authorities to warn the legally-appointed priests that they should not demand money from the devotees, other than what was fixed by the administration for special religious services. It directed the authorities of the HR&CE department, which administers a large number of temples in the state, to make surprise visits to the shrine to find out whether non-appointee priests were performing religious services. The temple authorities should also ensure good toilet and water facilities, the bench said.

Asking the officials to comply with the directions immediately, the judges sought a report about the compliance on July 5.

This machine is likely to be installed in all other institutions latest by May 15, he said on Wednesday.

In PG departments of science faculty, all located at Patna Science College, one biometric attendance machine will be installed each at mathematics-statistics complex, botany-zoology complex, administrative department and physics and chemistry departments.

One biometric machine will be installed for the staff of PU guesthouse, VC's lodge and Institute of Psychological Research at Krishnakunj, the VC said.

On Patna College premises, biometric machines will be installed at three places, including administrative block and language block, according to a decision taken at a meeting of the college teachers held under the presidentship of principal Ezaj Ali Arshad.

Meanwhile, a delegation of Patna University Teachers' Association led by its president Randhir Kumar Singh met the VC on Wednesday and expressed concern over the recent circular linking payment of salaries with the submission of activities' report of teachers every month. It demanded its immediate withdrawal for ensuring academic normalcy on the campus.

The VC said the chancellor's secretariat has sought from the university a detailed report about the compliance of the decisions taken at a meeting of the VCs at Raj Bhawan on April 16. The decisions included biometric attendance of university employees and teachers.

The university has also been asked to send a list of teachers and employees staying in their respective departments for the maximum and minimum time and also of teachers and employees registering maximum and minimum days of absence every month.

Taking exception to the recent exercise initiated by the authorities concerned for ensuring the presence of teachers on the campus, PU former senator and English teacher Shiva Jatan Thakur has questioned the legitimacy of the authority installing biometric machine to record the attendance of university teachers of the PG departments where advance teaching and research are imparted as part of statutory obligation.

He said PU teachers were known for their outstanding erudition, innovation, innovative tools, research and extension and monumental contributions to their areas of interest, leading to a litany of national and international awards, including Padma Shri.

He said it was demeaning and humiliating for the teachers to record their attendance in the biometric system twice a day for the entry and exit time even when they are engaged in teaching, examination, evaluation and research activities. He appealed to the chancellor to exempt university teachers from recording their attendance on biometric machine."

The Punjab government is all set to introduce biometric fingerprint scanning machines to mark the attendance of teachers in government schools of Punjab from April. In the first phase, machines will be installed in 900 government senior secondary schools at a cost of around Rs 30 lakh.

The plan is to set up the machines in all government schools of Punjab (nearly 20,000, including primary, middle, high and senior secondary schools) in a phased manner. However, the teachers have strongly criticised the move saying that it is sheer wastage of money seeing that schools are lacking basic facilities like benches, books and uniforms for the students. They have expressed that instead of spending such huge amount of money on biometric machines, government should first pay heed towards basic needs of the students who still study sitting on the floor due to lack of benches.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Prashant Goyal, Director General of School Education (DGSE), Punjab, confirmed that machines will be installed in 900 government schools in first phase and will be operational by April as the new session begins. ""We have purchased machines through Government e-Marketplace (GeM) which is a goods and services procurement portal run by the Government of India. The machines in phase one have cost us around Rs 30 lakh. Soon, all schools will be covered. In phase one, we are covering 900 government senior secondary schools,"" he said.

Goyal said that move is aimed at making the state education system tech-friendly and laced with latest technology. ""There is no point of still marking attendance on registers manually when a software can update us instantly. Also, it will bring in discipline and bogus attendance will be eliminated,"" he added. Asked about the source of funds, he said that funding of this project has been done through funds available with Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) society. ""We have some management funds available with RMSA which are being used here,"" he said.

Meanwhile, teachers accused government of having its priorities wrong. ""First, the government should get these machines installed at education department headquarters and other offices in Chandigarh and Mohali and district education offices before bringing teachers in its ambit. Why only teachers, not officials and higher ups should mark fingerprint attendance? Few years back, this project failed when machines were installed in block education offices. Even at other offices of education department in Chandigarh, they are lying non-functional...,"" said Sukhdheer Singh Sekhon, president, Elementary Teachers Union (Sekhon), Punjab.

Sukhwinder Singh Chahal, president, Government Teachers Union, Punjab said funds should instead be used to get benches, uniforms and books for students. ""There are principals in schools to keep an eye on teachers. What is more important is to get basic facilities first. At least give us benches and sweepers first and then talk about such hi-tech systems. This is pure wastage of money at a time when government says it has no money to buy benches and uniforms.""

DGSE Goyal, meanwhile, said that there is no provision under RMSA as of now to spend these funds on furniture. ""We have requested central government to allow us to use money for buying furniture for schools, but currently there is no such provision,"" he said."

Secretary of Higher Education and Skill Development, Ajoy Kumar Singh has directed the colleges in the state to link the attendance data with the Chancellor's Portal at earliest to ensure proper scrutiny of the attendance of college staff on a regular basis.

The department is also all set to start biometric attendance logging for students of eleven premier colleges in the state including Ranchi Women's College and Doranda College in the capital from the next session. Polytechnic and engineering colleges of the state will also follow the suit in digitalizing the education system of the state.

The changes were proposed at the 65th meeting of Central Advisory Board of Education held in New Delhi held earlier this week which was later discussed extensively at the Chancellor's Conference, chaired by Governor Draupadi Murmu. ""The state higher education department has come to the conclusion after much deliberation that the quality of education can only improve if both teachers and students actually present in the classrooms. A healthy teaching environment can boost the quality of education. We have instructed all colleges in the state to link the data of biometric attendance of all non-teaching and teaching staff to the Chancellor's Portal for monitoring purposes. We are starting biometric attendance for students in 11 colleges in the next session too,"" said Abu Imran, Director Higher Education, Jharkhand.

The department of higher education will be extending the system of bio metric attendance for students in phases from the next session. The Chancellor's Portal of the state has been set up in July last year and is functional to make the system of monitoring of data across colleges in the state easier through digitization. Students will now have to maintain a minimum of 75 per cent attendance in each paper to appear for any examination."

The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), however, has left it to institutes to avoid a direct conflict with the teaching community.

""The technical institutions may introduce online Aadhaar-linked biometric attendance for regular faculty members,"" the council stated in its latest notification.

Earlier, the council made it compulsory for all technical institutes to introduce an online Aadhaar-linked biometric attendance recording system.

The technical institutions ""shall"" introduce online Aadhar-linked biometric attendance for regular faculty members, Clause 5.7 of the AICTE's Approval Process Handbook 2018-19 stipulated.

A source told DH: ""This clause has been amended to leave it to the institutions to decide... We do not want to interfere with the autonomy of the institutions.""

The Economic Survey 2016-17 had suggested the introduction of biometric attendance system in ""all primary schools,"" identifying ""teacher absenteeism"" as one of the main causes of the fall in learning outcome.

A ""successful testing"" of a biometric attendance registration project was carried out by the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry in Manipur in consultation with the state government.

An Android-based mobile tablet along with biometric finger scanner was distributed among the teachers and other staff at government schools in five districts.

The device was also built to record attendance of students as well as monitoring the financial and physical progress made on Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) funds.

""We will expand it across all the states,"" HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar told the Lok Sabha on July 21, while concluding a debate on the Right to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Bill, 2017."

On the two previous occasions, it failed to take off on account of the stiff opposition from various employees organisations.

This time around again the employees had tried their best to wriggle out of the system, but the office of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan stood firm and decided to go forward with its implementation.

The office timings at the Secretariat are 10 a.m to 5 p.m.

Anyone who turns up after 10.15 a.m. for three consecutive days would lose a day's leave. Besides the biometric was directly linked to the salary register, making it impossible for one to escape the exercise.

""We will have to follow the rules as we are duty-bound to obey it, hence all will have to ensure that they do what is being asked, if not, at the end of the month, there will be deductions in our salary, which none will enjoy,"" said a group of employees, hurrying to ensure that they punch in their entry.

It remained to be seen whether the new rule persists, or gets aborted like it happened in the past when many of the punching machines went out of order after a while and were never replaced.
