A 13-year-old boy, a student of class 6 of a private school in east Delhi, suffered multiple injuries after he fell down from the third floor of the school building Friday morning. He is battling for life in a city hospital.

The incident took place around 8.30am, soon after the morning assembly prayers. The boy is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a private hospital and is unfit for recording a statement. No case was registered in connection with the incident, the police said.

The boy's family blamed the authorities of the school for the incident. They alleged that no safety measures were in place at the school premises to avoid such an incident. The family also suspected foul play and demanded a probe to ascertain the circumstances under which the student fell off the building.

The school authorities, on the other hand, ruled out foul play and said they were extending their cooperation in the police enquiry. A senior school administration official said the footage of the CCTV cameras was checked.

""The footage shows the boy having an argument with some fellow students after which he ran to the third floor and jumped. A staffer was present on the third floor but by the time she could stop him, the student had jumped. We rushed the student to the hospital,"" the school official said.

Police said they have initiated an enquiry to ascertain whether the boy attempted suicide or accidentally fell off the building. The footage of the CCTV cameras is also being analysed. The statement of some students was also recorded, they added.

""The boy is still under medical observation. Once he is declared fit, we will record his statement to ascertain the exact sequence of events which led to his fall from the building,"" Ved Prakash Surya, additional deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara), said.

The boy lives with his family in northeast Delhi. His family members said they dropped him off at the school around 7am as he had to appear in an internal science exam.

""I got a call from the school and they told me that my son was injured and admitted to a hospital. I rushed to the hospital and learnt that my son had fallen from the school building. He has suffered multiple fractures and head injuries,"" a family member of the boy said."

Please refer to the news item ""Roofless polling station leaves staff shocked"" wherein it has been reported that the school building selected for the polling station in the village ""Lambi Keri""falling under block Khwas was found roofless. In this context, I would like to draw the attention of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir State towards the miserable condition of School Education Department. It is a matter of utter shame and shock that all of the concerned authorities of education and administrative sectors seem to have been sleeping since long and remained quite ignorant about the plight of the said school building till the date of election.

To my knowledge and experience, the concerned school teacher/headmasters have to submit a detailed report about the status of school building to the concerned higher authority every month. And if the concerned school teacher/headmaster was sincere enough to submit the monthly reports, the concerned higher authorities including ZEO,ZEPO,CEO, etc are fully responsible and answerable in the matter. The factual story appearing in this paper reveals that either the school teachers remain absent from the school or they have not reported the matter to the concerned authorities. It also indicates that the concerned administrative authorities are totally negligent towards their duties. Moreover, the concerned authorities of SSA associated with the construction of school buildings are also responsible for the poor quality of school building. There may be so many other school buildings lying unreported leading to suffering of poor students.

One of the main reasons beyond this scenario is that these Government schools are meant only for the students of rural poor parents and none of the concerned authorities including teachers,ZEOs , CEO, legislators and other officers do never even think about sending their own children to the Government schools.

However,it is suggested that the instant case of the roofless school building should be got investigated by a commission headed by the concerned Deputy Commissioner and all those found guilty should be punished under the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code so that justice is done to all concerned and none could dare to deviate from the duty and responsibility in future.

In 1976, the four-storey Qaumi Senior Secondary School at Sadar Bazar was razed to the ground during the Emergency period. The Central Board of Secondary Examination-affiliated school was then shifted to a DDA Colony, but it neither got land nor building.

Things have not changed much even as four decades passed by. Thirteen 'classrooms' with tin shed roofs and walls are built in L-shape at the corner of the Eidgah premises. A ceiling fan, a blackboard on a stand and rusted iron benches comprise each 'classroom'. The principal's office and the teachers' room are adjusted in between.

As a senior secondary boys' school with around 800 students at present, classes run in two shifts due to space constraint. While Class 6- 8 are held in the morning, the primary classes take place in the evening.

Like Fawad, other students and teachers have adjusted to their makeshift arrangements. However, they admit that it is better to have a building than operating from a temporary place.

However, they alleged that a small group of ex-students, who were in no way connected to the institution today, other than framing an online petition against its development, were posing hurdles before them.

Principal Sr. Nidisha pointed out that this group had never stepped into the threshold of the institution after graduating from there and were unaware of the archaeological hassles faced by the school. Sr. Nema, headmistress of the high school section, asked if quality education could be imparted in congested, poorly ventilated and old-fashioned classrooms when neighbouring schools have hi-tech facilities."

UDHAMPUR, Oct 8: The student of Government Primary School, Mohalla Tallian, Zone Ghordi ( Ramnagar) under SSA and local villagers held protest demonstration today demanding repair of damaged school building.

The protesting students and villagers raised slogans against the Education Department and the Udhampur District Administration. They alleged that no repair work on school building was conducted for the last about 16 months and student are forced to study under the open sky.

They pointed out that this Govt Primary School was constructed during 2010-11, under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and around 50 are enrolled. Its building is now lying in shambles.

On June 6, 2017 heavy rain and thunderstorm totally damage this school building but after so many months, no repair work on this school building was initiated by the concerned authorities. Its roof has been collapsed. During rainy days, children are facing lot of difficulties. Their studies are affected as school is closed in case of rain.

Protesters further alleged that there was no provision of Mid Day meals and the drinking water in the school. There is no toilet for students or staff and no boundary wall has been raised in the school. The children and staff are facing manifold problems. Locals of the area appealed to State Governor to intervene into the matter."

That mantra, once touted by Facebook and other tech companies, is antithetical to the Tacklebox approach to entrepreneurship. At the first of each session's six workshops, Tacklebox founder Brian Scordato says as much to the founders seated before him.Instead, Tacklebox is about making slow and steady progress. Case in point: Scordato advises the founders not to quit their day job until they're (almost) certain their business is viable.

Launched in 2015, Tacklebox is a six-week program during which Scordato guides about eight founders, many of whom still have full-time jobs, in bringing their business ideas to fruition. Tacklebox isn't an accelerator in the traditional sense: Founders don't give up equity in their companies; instead, they pay $2,500 to attend what can seem like ""startup school.""

The goal, Scordato said, is to show founders that successful entrepreneurship is, above all, ""practice-able and teachable and learnable.""

Admittedly, the slow-and-steady strategy isn't the sexiest. A story about an entrepreneur who up and quit her day job to pursue her startup dreams is generally much more compelling than an entrepreneur who waited it out until the time was just right.

But Scordato makes a persuasive case for caution. ""You're always proving that this is worth your time,"" he told me.

""A lot of our founders have really, really good jobs and they've busted their asses to create a little bit of savings,"" he said. ""Most of our founders don't come in and say, 'I hate my job; I want to leave.' It's more like, 'I really, really like my job. It's helped me gain this certain insight and I want to start a company based on that. But I want to make sure that it's worth leaving this awesome job for it.'""What's more, he said, having a full-time job means you necessarily have limited time to work on your business. So you have to prioritize, and do only the tasks that are most important. ""It's interesting how it works when you force yourself into the confines to really focus on the 80/20 stuff,"" Scordato said, referring to

Scordato's observations are backed by some research and anecdotal evidence.

In his 2016 book, ""Originals,"" Wharton professor Adam Grant wrote that, contrary to popular belief, the most successful entrepreneurs don't quit their day job to start a company. One University of Wisconsin study found that entrepreneurs who kept their day jobs were 33% less likely to fail than those who don't.

Grant cites the example of Bill Gates, who was testing his idea for Microsoft on the side before he took a leave of absence from Harvard to go all in.

Similarly, Kathryn Minshew, cofounder and CEO of The Muse, didn't quit her job at McKinsey until she was confident in the strength of her business. And the founders of jewelry company Aurate told Business Insider that starting a business on the side, while they were employed at Marc Jacobs and Goldman Sachs, made them better entrepreneurs.

""Some people think about founders and think about startups as 23-year-olds starting something, and it's actually a good idea for them to do it even if it fails. It's a cool life experience,"" Scordato said. ""That's for the most part not my founders. My founders have enormous opportunity cost for starting these things.""

Scordato also looks specifically for founders who have developed domain expertise over the course of their career. ""You should have been subconsciously preparing to build this company for a long time, in a way such that your skill sets and knowledge bases have already distanced you from any competition,"" he said.

Indeed, an MIT study found the average age of a successful startup founder is 45. The study authors found that work experience explains much of the age advantage. They write in the Harvard Business Review,""Relative to founders with no relevant experience, those with at least three years of prior work experience in the same narrow industry as their startup were 85% more likely to launch a highly successful startup.""

I sat in on two of the workshops and listened to a recording of a third. At the first workshop, Scordato told the founders that sometimes, people get to the end of the program and realize they don't want to launch their startup. ""That's OK, too,"" he said.

I was skeptical: Who spends six weeks and $2,500, only to realize that, oops, their business idea stinks? But the Tacklebox alums I spoke to said they'd rather spend some time and money to realize their business idea isn't workable than quit their jobs and blow a huge amount of cash, only to reach the same conclusion a year down the line.

Shawn Cheng, a partner at the venture production studio ConsenSys Labs, has been a mentor to Scordato and to Tacklebox founders; he told me that the biggest value of the program is learning ""how to learn,"" or learning ""how to walk away.""

Most startup accelerators take an ""all or nothing"" approach, Cheng said, in that you either build a company or waste everyone's time; Tacklebox is geared toward founders thinking that ""they have an idea and they want to be testing it, and they want to be talking to more people about it, but they're not quite sure how they should validate it in order to put everything else in their lives on hold to pursue it.""

Sam Alston, the founder of Big Lives, which identifies up-and-coming fashion designers, was in the eighth cohort of Tacklebox, in 2017. She credits the program with giving her the confidence to leave her job, as a client development director at Louis Vuitton.

Alston said she frequently recommends Tacklebox to aspiring entrepreneurs, noting that Scordato is transparent about the fact that ""the skills that you gain should allow you to then test any business idea"" - not just the one you're currently working on. ""It's really selling a framework rather than consulting on a specific business.""

Scordato also told me that a handful of founders have gone through Tacklebox with one business idea, realized they didn't like it, and waited another year or so before going through Tacklebox again with a better one.

It's a program Scordato might have benefited from earlier in his career. In the past 11 years, he's launched three startups, aside from Tacklebox: a recruiting platform for college basketball, a dating app, and a social-networking app. None of them are still in operation.Scordato's real talent seems to be spotting other entrepreneurs with potential, and giving them the guidance and mentorship they need to develop their nascent businesses. He also brings in a series of outside experts, including successful founders and investors like Cheng. Each cohort of founders gets a chance to pitch their businesses to a group of investors, less to convince them to sign on and more to get feedback about how well they articulate their business' mission and goals.

Chuugani is glad he went through Tacklebox before Y Combinator. He told me that, in Y Combinator, after three months, if you don't think your idea is viable, it's a much more high-stakes situation. ""You're forced to find any idea that might work,"" he said, ""because now you've raised money from the accelerator."" He added, ""YC changed my life,"" but ""you should be a little bit prepared to know what you're getting yourself into if you're going to raise money.""

Despite Chhugani's success, Scordato said that the majority of Tacklebox startups aren't suited to Y Combinator. The Lobby ""has the potential to be a very high-growth, very huge exit sort of company,"" but it's an exception.

Some founders go onto more niche accelerators, like New York Fashion Tech Lab - but for about half of Tacklebox startups, Scordato said, ""maybe they need a little bit of money to build the initial tech platform, or they need to hire someone to do that, but it's not going to be a big challenge. They can start operating and become profitable quickly.""

Lee, the 37Angels founder, said Scordato and Tacklebox are more open-minded about success than most other startup accelerators. That is to say, getting into the uber-selective Y Combinator isn't the only measure of success.

Lee mentioned the concept of ""lifestyle startups,"" a term that's emerged in the last decade to describe a business that doesn't need venture capital and won't necessarily be worth $1 billion, ever. Lee said the term is often perceived negatively; but lifestyle startups, she said, are welcomed at Tacklebox. A lifestyle startup can still bring in $10 million a year, she said - and ""since when did making $10 million a year become a failure?""

""We LOVE those,"" Scordato wrote in an email, referring to lifestyle startups. ""What we really stress is that companies that could be great lifestyle businesses and probably won't be unicorns shouldn't try to become unicorns. They should build sound, revenue-generating businesses that can build great products at a high margin for a (relatively) small group of customers.""

In an irony that's not lost on its founder, Tacklebox itself is one such startup. ""I love that Tacklebox is practicing what it's preaching,"" Cheng said. He mentioned that Tacklebox has already gone through several iterations, holding workshops on weekends, mornings, and evenings, and offering higher and lower price points.""It's got to be scary for Brian,"" Cheng added, ""but I commend him for that and for not being afraid of trying new things and experimenting."""

Nine years on, School Education Department, Kashmir, has failed to construct building for much awaited Primary School in kandi village of South Kashmir's Pulwama district.

Local residents from Banjren, a Gujjar habitation -- around 35 kilometres from district headquarter, informed that in 2009 authorities of school education department established a primary school in their village.

""During the initial phase, government primary school Banjren was accommodated in a rented building and it operated in a dilapidated building sans any ventilation from July 2009,"" Tufail Ahmad , a local from the area said, adding villagers from Banjren pleaded before authorities for constructing a building for the school.

He said that in 2011 when the rented building started collapsing that authorities of school education department approved construction of two additional class rooms(ACR) for government primary school Banjren.

Another resident, Sheeraz Ahmad, said that the contract for construction of ACR was given to a local contractor, Riyaz Ahmad. However Ahmad refused to start construction on ACR on grounds that he saw the contract as less profit making to him. Sheeraz said that he handed over the contract to another contractor, Zubair Ahmad who after construction of plinth too refused to work on the project fearing loss.

The villagers informed that after 2014 great deluge, the walls of the rented building from which primary school Banjren was operating started falling apart.

They said that fearing any causality, the authorities clubbed this primary school with another primary school, which is situated at distance of five kilometres in Kandi-Pathri village.

The villagers said that clubbing of primary school Banjren proved counter-productive as student roll declined from 70 to 16 from 2015 to 2018.

""Most students discharged themselves to get enrolled in nearby private schools,"" teachers at the school said, adding that travelling 5 kilometre long distance through dirt paths is troublesome for primary school kids.

The villagers added that in 2015 a new primary school was constructed in Banjren habitation for students of Poswal Mohalla.

""We request authorities of school education department either started constructed on primary school Banjren, which is pending since 2011 or club it with primary school Poswal Mohalla, which will save our children from travelling 5 kilometres up-hill,"" the villagers said.

Chief Education Officer, Pulwama, Mushtaq Ahmad Salroo told Rising Kashmir that construction on primary school Banjren was stopped because it was being built in landslide prone area. He said that they would consider clubbing of primary school Banjren with primary school Poswal Mohalla."

There was a serious threat to the lives of students, the parents had pointed out during their protest.

But with relocation of the school put on hold, students are an upset lot.

""Finally, the students will move into a new building with proper facilities. The previous building was a challenge for the children and had become a hurdle in their studies.

While Rinky works as a cook in a house nearby, her father Vimlesh, was a construction worker and worked for the owner of the building which collapsed and took away lives of his two children. However seeing one of his child life less and another struggling for breath, he collapsed and in an irony of fate was admitted in the same hospital where his one son who was struggling for life.

""We had asked the landlord, under whom I also work to allow us leave the building as it was not safe to live any more, however he told me that there is no need to worry and he will soon arrange another apartment for us,"" said grief stricken Vimlesh.

Vimlesh used to pay four thousand every month as rent for room on third floor of the building. Just one month ago when another family living on the first floor of the building left he also decided to leave the building but his landlord convinced him to stay.

""My father blindly trusted, the landlord and today we are paying for our blind trust, all are savings are also buried under debris and above all I lost my brothers,"" said Rinky

Father Vimlesh was aware about the rickety state of the building and wanted to shift from it. But last month the landlord convinced him to continue staying which has now proved fatal."

From writing letters to holding several meetings, Kalyan's efforts finally paid off after secretary school education Krishan Kumar intervened and directed deputy commissioner Ludhiana to save the school and shift the toll plaza site.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Kalyan said, ""Since NHAI officials visited our school in August first week, I was having sleepless nights. Five years of hard work was being razed in a minute. Since 2013, we are working to make it a smart school and better than private schools.

The Department Of School Education Kashmir is risking lives of students of Government Boys Primary School at Wakherwan in South Kashmir's Pulwama district by conducting their classes in an unsafe and unhygienic building.

The Primary school at Wakherwan village is housed in a three room single storey building.

Ghulam Mohammad Mir, a villager said that the building was constructed in 1980s and over these years it started dilapidating due to lack of maintenance by concerned authorities.

""The walls of the building have wide cracks, windows are broken and without window panes. The ceiling too is broken,"" he said.

""Our village has more than 200 households and has a decent population of school going children but majority of parents have stopped sending their kids to the school,"" Mir said, adding that the building is unsafe and can collapse anytime. He said that around 25 students, mostly from poor families who cannot afford to send their kids to private schools, are enrolled in the said institution.

The villagers said that the school environment is unhygenic. "" A stable can be seen sharing walls with the school building on one side and on other side there is a cowshed; heaps of cow dung, dirt and fallen tree trunks fill the small yard of the school,"" the villagers said.

Another villager, Mohammad Ashraf said that the floor of the class rooms often become dirty after bird poop falls on to them from the attic through wide holes of the broken ceiling.

""Neat and clean environment is a pre-requisite for an institution like a primary school because teachers often start educating tender kids on cleanliness,"" he said , adding that authorities put a bad example before their kids . He said that unhygienic school environment serves as a source of infection and the stink causes distraction in regular class work.

The villagers said that they pleaded with authorities for relocation of the school but to no avail. ""There are more than 800 kanals of state land (chariae) in our village which can be used for the purpose of constructing of the school,"" the villagers said.

Deputy Commissioner Pulwama, Ghulam Mohammad Dar said that he held a meeting with villagers of the residents who informed him about the available land.

""A new building will be constructed at the available land which is very suitable for the said purpose and the school will be relocated to the new building,"" he said."

The Rs 27 crore facelift project started a few months ago, with an October deadline.

A slice of 'modern history' in the capital may have been permanently erased by authorities, with the demolition of a part of the old school building on the Purana Qila premises. The demolition, carried out around 10 days ago, is part of an extensive facelift exercise being undertaken inside the complex by the Archaeological Survey of India, in collaboration with the National Buildings Construction Company.

A public sector enterprise, NBCC had adopted the monument for upgradation and facelift under the Centre's Adopt a Heritage scheme last year, a Ministry of Culture official said. The Rs 27 crore facelift project started a few months ago, with an October deadline.

In June, amid reports about the possible demolition of the Partition-era school building, several archaeologists and heritage experts raised a voice against the move. Former ASI director general BB Lal said, ""The building was built after Partition, when refugees came to Purana Qila, as a school for their children. Even if it's not Mughal or British, the structure has its own importance in modern history.""

Neera Misra, chairperson-trustee of the Delhi-based Draupadi Dream Trust, which promotes arts and culture, sent letters to the ASI, Ministry of Culture and PMO, asking them to intervene and stop the demolition of the ""1947 Partition history-linked building"". Misra said, ""I was assured at the time that the demolition will not happen.""

Even though ASI officials were unavailable for comment, when The Indian Express had contacted them in June, ASI had said in a written reply: ""The earliest reference to imparting education to children of those who migrated to India after Partition relates to the... corridors and gardens of Quila-e-Kuhna mosque inside Purana Qila from August 1948 to December 1949. The said school was just a temporary arrangement for some time after 1949...""

An ASI archaeologist, who did not wish to be named, said, ""The said building was not blocking the view of the fort, nor was it jarring in any other way. The ASI will demolish a building only if it's an encroachment in the protected area or entails any illegal occupation. This wasn't the case here.""

Meanwhile, the National Green Tribunal sought a report from NBCC on the revival of the iconic lake, after a plea alleged the project was being undertaken in a manner that would damage the environment. A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed NBCC to submit the report by September 24, when the matter would be heard next.

The direction came on a plea filed by Delhi-based R K Gupta, who contended that both the NBCC and ASI have put a plastic sheet on the bed of the lake, preventing groundwater recharge.

Also, the use of a JCB machine near the main entrance of the fort by NBCC had raised eyebrows. Experts contend that earth-moving equipment can't be deployed in or close to heritage structures as it may damage them. The ASI said in the statement: ""The elevated road leading to the main entrance of Purana Qila has been made of several layers of concrete in recent times. Removing those layers manually would have taken a lot of time; so we had to employ the equipment.""

""In the ASI guidelines, it's not mentioned whether we can or cannot use the JCB. It has to be decided on site, as per the circumstances,"" said an official, adding that ""a British-era pathway has been revealed at the entrance after the removal of the concrete road, and it will be retained as it is"".

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao gave the direction to raze the building of Alok Punj Secondary School and to transfer all students to other government schools after the Delhi government informed the court that on inspection, Central Public Works Department (CPWD) had found the structure to be dangerous and vulnerable to collapse anytime.

In his report, the chief engineer of CPWD intimated the court that the building was unsafe. During the brief hearing, HC made it clear to the government that it is only concerned with the condition of the building and the safety of children studying there.

""We are only permitting you to shift the students and construct a new building there,"" the bench noted. The court then asked the Directorate of Education (DoE) to file, in a week's time, a status report indicating the timeframe by which the students would be shifted to another school and a new building be constructed for them to study.

On its part, Delhi government assured the high court that it will provide free bus services to students and accommodate them to other nearby schools run by it.

The high court's direction came while hearing a PIL, filed by NGO Social Jurist through advocate Ashok Agarwal, highlighting that 2,600 students enrolled in classes VI - X are studying in a dangerous school building and the government needs to shift them temporarily so that it can rebuild a new building, which is much safer.

The court had earlier directed the secretary of education to personally look into the matter as the same concerned safety, security and education of the students. It will now take up the matter for further hearing on September 27."

People in Kerala might not be able to forget the 'deadly months' of July and August because of the massive effect of the calamity on life and infrastructure.

Help has been pouring in from all over the country for those who have been hit by the flood. Despite fewer resources, Keralites have come together to help each other.

This government lower primary school at Kurichiarmala in the district will remain the testimony to nature's fury that has left a trail of death and destruction across the state.

A landslide on August 9 had torn through the school's one-acre compound and created two craters near the building and making it inaccessible.

Until Monday, the teachers and villagers were unsure of the future of the institute's 92 students.

In two days, the uncertainty gave way to a new-found confidence -- now seen across the state -- as the exuberant students started school on the top floor of a madrassa, barely a kilometre away.

The temporary establishment has become a symbol of communal harmony and determination of a resilient village that refused to be cowed down by adverse conditions, despite their debilitating effect.

There was an effort to clean up the three-foot mud and slush from the school building so that the classes could commence. Recurring landslides, however, posed a constant risk, forcing the authorities and volunteers to abandon their efforts.

Realising the need for continuing the school, the local mahal committee stepped in and offered space in the Hayathul Islam Madrassa building. Local residents and volunteers swung into action and made necessary arrangements on the top floor of the building.

They converted the top floor into a full-fledged school with four classrooms and a staffroom in 72 hours.

As the classes restarted on Wednesday morning, the building earned the distinction of having a madrassa, a mosque and a government school under the same roof.

The school, meanwhile, adjusted its working days. It would be closed on Fridays -- so that the faithful would have enough space for their prayers -- and instead, would work on Saturdays. The arrangement would continue for the rest of the academic year.

Authorities said the school would function in the madrassa until it a new building somewhere nearby.

Among the students who attended school on Wednesday, five have been rendered homeless by the landslides. A Facebook community, Human Being Collective, Malabar Flood Relief Forum and Green Palliative Volunteers had raised around Rs 4 lakh and helped the villagers recreate the school, which now sport brand new furniture, blackboards, teaching aids and colourful walls with animated characters and even indoor plants.

The pre-primary section has been accommodated in the madrassa's courtyard, where the Hayathul Islam mosque is also located.

""Even the children hailing from families who had suffered huge losses in the landslide were so happy on seeing their new school. It will immensely help them in erasing their traumatic experiences,"" district collector Keshvendra Kumar said.

The school is also a reaffirmation of the secular credentials of Kerala where everyone is helping each other, cutting across religious, social and other barriers,"" who spent around three hours at the school, added.

The school's PTA President Mohammed Aslam, also the vice president of the mahal committee, said the entire Mahal was very forthcoming in opening up its premises for the school. ""Though properties worth crores were lost in the landslide, our biggest loss was the Kurichiar Mala LP School. Most of the people in the village work in the nearby tea plantation and the school was their only hope for a better future of their children,"" Aslam said.

School headmaster Sasi P K said the deputy director of education has sanctioned the changes in the school working days to facilitate the Friday prayers at the mosque.

C K Saseendran, representing Kalpetta in the state assembly, said the school would be upgraded to an upper primary school with Rs 1 crore from the MLA fund and a Rs 49 lakh grant from the central government's multi-sectoral development programme. The Tata Group, meanwhile, has promised to construct a new building for the school on identifying a new location.

The district collector said the damaged school building would be converted to a memorial to showcase how the people overcame the natural calamity."

Muthuraj, whose seven-year-old son is a student at the school, said the building looks like it will collapse on the students any time.

""Though school authorities have sealed the cracks on the roof with concrete, water continue to drip on the floor,"" said Muthuraj, a public relations officer with Makkal Viduthalai Katchi. The building is so damaged that steel rods and girders can be seen in some walls and parts of the roof, he added.

Though the students were shifted to another building in the revenue block, that too was leaky, parents said. ""Teachers moved all the students from six classrooms into a new building and crammed them into three rooms. But that building is also leaking,"" said Murugesan, father of a six-year-old. ""The new building is in a low-lying area. So, water enters the classrooms if it rains heavily. We are planning to meet the collector this week to lodge a complaint about the crisis,"" he said.

As per the reports, the injured are fine and undergoing treatment in KEM Hospital. However, keeping in mind the intensity of the fire, it is really a miracle too see so many people survived. Meanwhile, as the fire-tenders were trying to rescue the residents trapped in fire, a 10-year-old girl saved the day with the lessons she had recently learnt in her school. The girl is grade 6 student.

The 10-year-old Zen Gunratan Sadvarte learnt a lesson from her school teacher who told her dos and don'ts when you are stuck in fire. Zen was quoted by NDTV as saying she was sleeping at the time and it is her mother who spotted the smoke and alerted the family. ""There was blasts burning and just gasses gathering over the house and the room. We couldn't breathe, I couldn't breathe so we went into the kitchen. My father thought that the kitchen would be much safer than anything,"" she said.

In the middle of chaos, Zen used her fire safety tips to help to save her family and neighbours. She asked them not to panic and asked them to cover their nose with a wet cloth to prevent form getting suffocated. Neighbours then rushed out of their flats and one girl was out of breath because of asthma.

""In asthma, you can't breathe well, the carbon was hurtful for her. I gathered everyone at the gallery of 1603.""

When the firefighters asked people to come down, the Class 6 student told them it was not a good idea. ""I took the phone and said we cannot come down as it will create a lot of panic and panic won't allow us to breathe,"" Zen told reporters.

Zen said she had done much research into disaster management when she was all of seven. ""I researched in grade 3 because you are judged over one topic. And I took disaster management. I don't know whether my data is saved right now or not but..."" The knowledge certainly helped when she needed it the most.

The incident took place at the Government Senior Secondary School for Boys (Blind) hostel in north Delhi's Kingsway Camp on August 8 after heavy rain in the national capital. This incident has occurred after a PIL on the condition of the building and the requirement of teaching staff was filed in the Delhi High Court earlier this month.

""Portions of two roofs had fallen on the same day in room numbers 7 and 13. I was saved as it fell besides me and just broke my fingernail. The other boys were at the other end of the room. My parents were glad it did not fall on my head,"" said Oraon, showing the wound.

After the incident, students received a letter from Delhi social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam saying things will be fixed soon.

The roofs have now been temporarily patched up with cement. The railings to the staircases are rusting while the wall paint has come off at most places.

According to hostel residents, the school building was identified as 'dangerous' by the Public Works Department some years ago, but no precautionary measures were taken.

""It was only after a petition was filed that some repair work began, "" said SK Rungta, senior advocate who filed the plea and general secretary, National Federation of the Blind.

Around Rs 98 lakh were sanctioned for the repair work of the building in December 2017. Work was to start in May. However, work has started only now after the incident.

However, this is not the only worrisome fact about the place run by the Delhi government's social welfare department. The school and hostel for the blind from Class 1 to 12, housed in a two-storey building, also lacks teaching staff, books and, most importantly, audio devices.

With only 10 teachers for a total of 136 students, the classes are held with students stuffed in a room. Of the 10, only four teachers are regular employees while the rest are guest teachers. The sanctioned strength is 25 teachers. For the last 6-7 years, there has been no recruitment to fill the vacant posts said a school official.

""There is only one teacher for primary classes (Class 1-5). There are no teachers for science and maths, which is taught here up to Class 8,"" said RP Yadav, who teaches senior classes.

Vijay Rahul, a Class 12 student, said, ""there are no teachers for most subjects. How can a Hindi teacher teach mathematics?"" said Rahul.

The school has been running without a principal for more than two years. A new principal, a PGT teacher, has been given the and has joined only on August 18.

""We had asked engineers to assess the structure and start repair work. Also,I have been writing for a year to the DSSSB for recruitment of teachers. Meanwhile, we have arranged for guest teachers. I will review the progress on Monday,"" Gautam said."

Classes for around 200 children of primary section (Classes I to V) of a government school in Jahangirpur (alias Jagirpur) had to be shifted to a langar hall in a nearby gurdwara after their building was declared 'unsafe' on August 10. The school also has around 15 children under pre-primary section.

Unlike other days, when classes were held separately for all classes, on Tuesday, the children were cramped up under one roof in the gurdwara as classes were held simultaneously.

The order issued by district project director of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA) from local district education office on August 10, asked the teachers of the school to shift classes to a 'safe' place and lock six 'unsafe' rooms as they collapse anytime. The order further stated that children should not be allowed to sit in the school building and that the head teacher should make some alternative arrangement for the classes to be conducted. As no proper place was found, children were made to sit in the langar hall of a gurudwara after getting the permission of the gurdwara head.

According to Manmohan Singh, head teacher of the school, it is just the beginning of many problems lying ahead. ""We have not even shifted our benches here because it is all uncertain. Gurudwara management can ask to vacate their space in the langar hall anytime, depending on their programmes. For instance, even on Monday we weren't able to conduct classes as there was a bhog ceremony scheduled at the gurdwara. So we made students sit in open at the porch of our school building,"" he said.

Since there were no fans at the gurudwara shed where students have been allotted space, old ceiling fans from the school building have been taken down and have been installed at the shed for now. ""We have got our own fans removed from the classrooms and got them installed here under the shed. How can we make students sit without fans in such heat? If any kid falls ill or gets unconscious, who will be responsible. Thankfully, there is a water cooler in the gurdwara, so drinking water is not an issue,"" added Singh.

Another problem that remains is that of the washroom. ""These are small children from Classes 1 to 5 and since our school building is across the main road, I cannot allow them to cross the road and go to washroom in our own school. It is a busy road with heavy traffic movement. So we are requesting the gurudwara management to let our children use their washrooms. We have agreed to pay to get them cleaned,"" he said.

While the written orders have been issued by district project director of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA) from local district education office saying that old building having six classrooms should be locked and demolished as soon as possible, there is still no word on when and where new building will be constructed.

""Either they can demolish the old one and construct a new one here itself. Otherwise, village panchayat has told us that another chunk of land allotted for school many years back is lying unused. We have received no information yet on when work will start to construct the new building,"" said the head teacher.

Chennai-based Concrete Quality Concepts, an IIT-Madras-incubated company, which had conducted tests to assess the stability of the Government Higher Secondary School at Thinaikulam in the district, has said the 'stability of the building is good' but found some of the RC columns 'severely distressed.'

In its report submitted before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, the company, which carried out ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), rebound hammer (RH), assessment of carbonation, compressive cell and half cell potential tests in February, said the concrete in the near surface portion was in the range of 'good to very good'.

""The average RH values in RC structural elements of the school building indicate that the quality of concrete in the near surface portion is good to very good, except the RC columns C8 and C10 on the ground floor and C6 on the second floor,"" it said.

The average RH values in these RC columns indicated that the quality of concrete in the near surface portion was satisfactory. The average UPV values in a majority of the structural elements could be considered as good and in certain RC columns doubtful, the report said.

The visual inspection and non-destructive tests revealed that the corrosion was predominant in the RC columns of the ground floor and RC lintel beams of the first and the second floors. ""However, the RC beams and RC slab on all the three floors did not show any distress bearing in RC beam A8 and B8 in the second floor,"" it said.

The severely distressed RC columns on all the three floors should be rehabilitated using micro concrete jacketing, the company suggested. The tile joints in the terrace might be rectified to arrest the leakage with lime grout and repainting, it said.

After the court suo motu took cognisance of media reports that the school building was unsafe for students, the Engineer-in-chief (Buildings) of Public Works Department had ordered the tests.

The walls, windows and ceiling of the entire building have become very weak.

Since the departments do not have any alternative, they are not declaring classrooms unsafe, putting the lives of more than 200 children at stake, said Manmohan Singh, head teacher of the school, who has written at least four letters in the past week, stating that due to heavy rain, the school building, which is already in a very bad shape, can collapse anytime. So, it should be declared unsafe at the earliest so that they can move kids out, but there has been no action till Saturday.

Singh, who has written to the block primary education officer, local MLA Sanjay Talwar and local PWD officials, said the school has more than 200 kids. ""There are four classrooms and all of them are unsafe. Despite our several letters to various departments, the PWD is not declaring the building unsafe and lives of children are being put at stake,"" he said.

Kuldeep Saini, Deputy District Education Officer, said a report from the PWD engineers is awaited to declare the building unsafe. ""We are looking for some other arrangement, till a new building is constructed. Meanwhile, teachers can hold classes in the local gurdwara,"" he said.

Unofficially, the head teacher has been asked to look for space and even contact local gurdwara.

""They (government) have no other space and we have been told to move to nearby gurdwara, but through unofficial verbal orders. A major tragedy is awaiting. Even roots of old trees have entered deep inside walls. We get scared when any child moves closer to any wall,"" said Singh."

On Friday, OneIndia wrote about leaking roofs of a Madhya Pradesh school. In fact, tired by the lackadaisical attitude of the authorities to fix the leaking roofs of their school building, students of the government school in Dindori, Madhya Pradesh on Thursday submitted a memorandum to the district council. Their memorandum was addressed to President Ramnath Kovind.

""During monsoon, water drips from the roof in every classroom. There are no washrooms and it has been like this for many years, please help us,"" stated the memorandum addressed to the President.

Be it Chhattisgarh or Madhya Pradesh, school education, mostly in rural areas, is in shambles. It seems the government is not at all serious about improving the school education system in the country, but the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre talks about giving institute of excellence status to a select few varsities."

In 2015, owing to the dilapidated condition of the government-run school building, officers from the education department closed it down keeping in mind students' safety. But in three years they could not start work on a new building. Since then, students were forced to attend classes in rooms provided by the villagers, one of whom got his house built under Indira Awas Yojana.

Jajati Kesari Suna, president of the school management committee said, ""We requested the house owner to allow us to use his room, but how long could we keep him waiting.""

So, after two years, the owner told them to vacate his home. ""We approached the officials requesting them to help us construct a new building, but all their assurances came to nought,"" Suna said.

Disappointed, the school management decided to shift to another house which had been newly constructed. But after holding classes there for a year, the owner has now asked them to vacate the place within the next two months.

""Where will these students study?"" asked Hara Prasad Shah, the school headmaster. ""Due to shortage of rooms, we shifted students from Classes VI to VIII to another school, which is four km away. Only students from I-V are studying here,"" Shah added.

Kalahandi district collector Anjan Kumar Manik said fund had been allocated for construction of a new school building two years back. ""I have instructed the officials to start the construction as soon as possible,"" Manik said.

Nila Madhab Panda, the block education officer of Kesinga, said Rs 6 lakh was allocated for the school but it could not be utilised in time because getting suitable land was a problem. ""A piece of land near the existing building has been acquired around six months back. The process of allocating fresh grant is on.

This Shiva temple in Raisinghpur village is not just home to the deity, it has been serving as a school for 23 students for the past 10 years.

The Raisinghpur New Primary School, established in 2008, was to have been set up on a parcel of government land outside the village.

The school and mass education department, under which the school falls, had granted funds to the tune of Rs 6.44 lakh in 2008-2009. As the land was situated far away from Raisinghpur, the authorities decided to shift the school to within the village. A 20-decimal patch of land, also belonging to the government but claimed by the villagers as their own, was chosen for the school by the revenue inspector.

Due to the dispute over the land, the school building was never actually built. Thus, from its inception, the school - which has classes from I to V and comprises 23 students, three teachers and four blackboards - has been working out of its unlikely home from 10 am to 4 pm, six days a week.

""We come to the school regularly and it becomes difficult for the teachers to take classes as there is only one room in the temple here. Had there been a building, we would have read without any problem,"" said Prem Karuna, a Class V student.

Damayanti Barik, the mother of a Class V student, said the future of the children were at stake. ""The biggest problem the kids face is while eating the midday meal. The food has to be prepared in different houses in the village as the school does not have a building of its own. Not only is this a logistical nightmare, it also brings up the question of hygiene,"" she said.

The cook of Raisinghpur New Primary School, Kadambini Mishra, echoes Damayanti. ""It is so difficult to cook in a different house every day. Worse, the children have to eat under the open sky in the temple verandah,"" she said.

""We are trying to do the best we can under the circumstances,"" added headmaster in charge of the school, Pratap Kumar Panda.

The Kalahandi district project coordinator of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Gabakhya Nayak, said a new proposal for the construction of the school building at a cost of Rs 10 lakh had been sent to the government. ""However, construction can only begin when the dispute over land ends,"" he added.

President of the school management committee, Jatindra Singh, explained that the dispute over the 20-decimal land had led to the school building's construction being stalled.

On being asked, he could not specify when the dispute would be resolved. ""The revenue inspector had chosen the land. It is up to the state government to resolve the land issue,"" was all he was willing to say."

Teachers said she had attended school on Thursday and nothing had happened which could have upset her. Around 2.30pm, the girl returned from school.

No other injuries were reported, but the fire brigade continued its search for any unidentified missing persons, late into the night.

The first floor of the building was undergoing renovation work. Mote said, ""There was carpentry work going on the first floor, and it is likely that the dead person was a worker.""

The fire brigade pressed eight fire engines and seven water tankers, a turntable ladder and an ambulance to the spot. The fire was brought under control after around three hours of fire fighting, by 9.43pm.

According to reports from the fire brigade, the building did not have the mandatory fire safety systems.

Flames ripped through the celebrated Mackintosh building after it caught fire at around 23:15 BST on Friday, a BBC News report said on Saturday.

The blaze has spread to nearby buildings, including the Campus nightclub and O2 ABC music venue, which suffered ""extensive damage"". No casualties have been reported, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said.

Efforts to bring the fires under control are expected to be ""prolonged"", Deputy Chief Officer Iain Bushell said.

More than 120 firefighters have been sent to the scene, faced with ""an extremely challenging and complex incident"", he said.

The Mackintosh building was badly damaged by fire in May 2014 and was due to re-open next year following a multi-million pound restoration project.

Ben, an eyewitness, told the BBC the latest fire looked ""much worse"" than the previous one. ""This is a blaze, the building is just going up like a tinder-box. It's quite shocking,"" he said.

Connor Neil, 22, said people were being evacuated from their homes and there was a ""big orange light"" which could be seen from streets away.Despite the thick, black, acrid smoke, the blaze seemed to be dying down in the Mackintosh building.But very quickly the situation changed, with the roof of Campus nightclub catching fully alight.

Earlier, loud bangs were heard coming from inside the art school as crews tried to tackle the flames.Students - some of whom graduated on Friday - were in the street in shock. They can't believe it's happened again.

One Twitter user posted a video of the O2's roof appearing to collapse as firefighters sprayed water onto the building from an aerial platform.

Police Scotland advised the public to avoid the area, and said areas around Dalhousie St, Scott St and Sauchiehall St were all affected by road closures.

Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney described the building, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, as ""the most architecturally important building in Glasgow"".

The Labour politician said the restoration effort had suffered a ""horrific setback"" which he hoped would be overcome.

Mr Sweeney went on to say: ""The 1909 library extension, that was the origin of the 2014 blaze is now fully alight too. ""It looks like the entire interior space is now fully alight.

""The best we can probably hope for is structural facade retention and a complete rebuild of the interior. Devastating.""

In a tweet, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This is clearly an extremely serious situation. ""My first thoughts tonight are for the safety of people - but my heart also breaks for Glasgow's beloved @GSofA.

While there is nothing wrong in this, Passah pointed out that one of the conditions in the guidelines issued was that the school should have undisputed and sufficient land for construction of the school building with scope for further expansion.

Passah also said that the SDSEO in its reply to the RTI on November 29, 2017 had informed that the school does not have a land patta of its own. Also, the DSEL in its reply on May 14, this year had further intimated that the building permission for the school is not available and the Tax Receipt copy of the land is also not available.

Passah also said that the guidelines specify that the School Managing Committee (SMC) shall be responsible for maintenance and repairs of the building putting proper boundary fencing and up keep of the building on completion.

Passah however said that if the school does not have land, it is impossible to be responsible for maintenance and repairs and provision of boundary fencing.

""Based on the facts received through RTI, it can be concluded that there has been a misuse of public money, and possibility that the amount sanctioned for construction of the school building was not utilized at all. Various appeals and complaints have been made to the DSEO and DSEL, but no action has been taken till date,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Passah further alleged that the Managing Committee of the school, which was approved by the SDSEO, Shillong, consists of members whose qualification is below matric (tenth) with members having minimum qualification of class III.

""There are also criminal charges against few a members of the Managing Committee. It is saddening to know that the authority approved and entrust the management of school business to people whose qualification is very low besides having criminal charges,"" he stated.

Please refer to the news item ""Roofless polling station leaves staff shocked"" wherein it has been reported that the school building selected for the polling station in the village ""Lambi Keri""falling under block Khwas was found roofless. In this context, I would like to draw the attention of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir State towards the miserable condition of School Education Department. It is a matter of utter shame and shock that all of the concerned authorities of education and administrative sectors seem to have been sleeping since long and remained quite ignorant about the plight of the said school building till the date of election.

To my knowledge and experience, the concerned school teacher/headmasters have to submit a detailed report about the status of school building to the concerned higher authority every month. And if the concerned school teacher/headmaster was sincere enough to submit the monthly reports, the concerned higher authorities including ZEO,ZEPO,CEO, etc are fully responsible and answerable in the matter. The factual story appearing in this paper reveals that either the school teachers remain absent from the school or they have not reported the matter to the concerned authorities. It also indicates that the concerned administrative authorities are totally negligent towards their duties. Moreover, the concerned authorities of SSA associated with the construction of school buildings are also responsible for the poor quality of school building. There may be so many other school buildings lying unreported leading to suffering of poor students.

One of the main reasons beyond this scenario is that these Government schools are meant only for the students of rural poor parents and none of the concerned authorities including teachers,ZEOs , CEO, legislators and other officers do never even think about sending their own children to the Government schools.

However,it is suggested that the instant case of the roofless school building should be got investigated by a commission headed by the concerned Deputy Commissioner and all those found guilty should be punished under the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code so that justice is done to all concerned and none could dare to deviate from the duty and responsibility in future.

Now a Class 8 student, Fawad, in between giggles of his friends during recess, is much smarter. He harbours little hope of any perceptible change in the study conditions. ""We don't think the school will have a building of its own anytime soon,"" asserts one of his friends.

In 1976, the four-storey Qaumi Senior Secondary School at Sadar Bazar was razed to the ground during the Emergency period. The Central Board of Secondary Examination-affiliated school was then shifted to a DDA Colony, but it neither got land nor building.

Things have not changed much even as four decades passed by. Thirteen 'classrooms' with tin shed roofs and walls are built in L-shape at the corner of the Eidgah premises. A ceiling fan, a blackboard on a stand and rusted iron benches comprise each 'classroom'. The principal's office and the teachers' room are adjusted in between.

As a senior secondary boys' school with around 800 students at present, classes run in two shifts due to space constraint. While Class 6- 8 are held in the morning, the primary classes take place in the evening.

Like Fawad, other students and teachers have adjusted to their makeshift arrangements. However, they admit that it is better to have a building than operating from a temporary place.

The wait seems to be endless. In August, the High Court had directed the Delhi Development Authority to allocate 4,000 square yards of land for a school building and complete all formalities with regards to the land in the next three months.

That mantra, once touted by Facebook and other tech companies, is antithetical to the Tacklebox approach to entrepreneurship. At the first of each session's six workshops, Tacklebox founder Brian Scordato says as much to the founders seated before him.Instead, Tacklebox is about making slow and steady progress. Case in point: Scordato advises the founders not to quit their day job until they're (almost) certain their business is viable.

Launched in 2015, Tacklebox is a six-week program during which Scordato guides about eight founders, many of whom still have full-time jobs, in bringing their business ideas to fruition. Tacklebox isn't an accelerator in the traditional sense: Founders don't give up equity in their companies; instead, they pay $2,500 to attend what can seem like ""startup school.""

The goal, Scordato said, is to show founders that successful entrepreneurship is, above all, ""practice-able and teachable and learnable.""

Admittedly, the slow-and-steady strategy isn't the sexiest. A story about an entrepreneur who up and quit her day job to pursue her startup dreams is generally much more compelling than an entrepreneur who waited it out until the time was just right.

But Scordato makes a persuasive case for caution. ""You're always proving that this is worth your time,"" he told me.

""A lot of our founders have really, really good jobs and they've busted their asses to create a little bit of savings,"" he said. ""Most of our founders don't come in and say, 'I hate my job; I want to leave.' It's more like, 'I really, really like my job. It's helped me gain this certain insight and I want to start a company based on that. But I want to make sure that it's worth leaving this awesome job for it.'""What's more, he said, having a full-time job means you necessarily have limited time to work on your business. So you have to prioritize, and do only the tasks that are most important. ""It's interesting how it works when you force yourself into the confines to really focus on the 80/20 stuff,"" Scordato said, referring to

Scordato's observations are backed by some research and anecdotal evidence.

In his 2016 book, ""Originals,"" Wharton professor Adam Grant wrote that, contrary to popular belief, the most successful entrepreneurs don't quit their day job to start a company. One University of Wisconsin study found that entrepreneurs who kept their day jobs were 33% less likely to fail than those who don't.

Grant cites the example of Bill Gates, who was testing his idea for Microsoft on the side before he took a leave of absence from Harvard to go all in.

Similarly, Kathryn Minshew, cofounder and CEO of The Muse, didn't quit her job at McKinsey until she was confident in the strength of her business. And the founders of jewelry company Aurate told Business Insider that starting a business on the side, while they were employed at Marc Jacobs and Goldman Sachs, made them better entrepreneurs.

""Some people think about founders and think about startups as 23-year-olds starting something, and it's actually a good idea for them to do it even if it fails. It's a cool life experience,"" Scordato said. ""That's for the most part not my founders. My founders have enormous opportunity cost for starting these things.""

Scordato also looks specifically for founders who have developed domain expertise over the course of their career. ""You should have been subconsciously preparing to build this company for a long time, in a way such that your skill sets and knowledge bases have already distanced you from any competition,"" he said.

Indeed, an MIT study found the average age of a successful startup founder is 45. The study authors found that work experience explains much of the age advantage. They write in the Harvard Business Review,""Relative to founders with no relevant experience, those with at least three years of prior work experience in the same narrow industry as their startup were 85% more likely to launch a highly successful startup.""

I sat in on two of the workshops and listened to a recording of a third. At the first workshop, Scordato told the founders that sometimes, people get to the end of the program and realize they don't want to launch their startup. ""That's OK, too,"" he said.

I was skeptical: Who spends six weeks and $2,500, only to realize that, oops, their business idea stinks? But the Tacklebox alums I spoke to said they'd rather spend some time and money to realize their business idea isn't workable than quit their jobs and blow a huge amount of cash, only to reach the same conclusion a year down the line.

Shawn Cheng, a partner at the venture production studio ConsenSys Labs, has been a mentor to Scordato and to Tacklebox founders; he told me that the biggest value of the program is learning ""how to learn,"" or learning ""how to walk away.""

Most startup accelerators take an ""all or nothing"" approach, Cheng said, in that you either build a company or waste everyone's time; Tacklebox is geared toward founders thinking that ""they have an idea and they want to be testing it, and they want to be talking to more people about it, but they're not quite sure how they should validate it in order to put everything else in their lives on hold to pursue it.""

Sam Alston, the founder of Big Lives, which identifies up-and-coming fashion designers, was in the eighth cohort of Tacklebox, in 2017. She credits the program with giving her the confidence to leave her job, as a client development director at Louis Vuitton.

Alston said she frequently recommends Tacklebox to aspiring entrepreneurs, noting that Scordato is transparent about the fact that ""the skills that you gain should allow you to then test any business idea"" - not just the one you're currently working on. ""It's really selling a framework rather than consulting on a specific business.""

Scordato also told me that a handful of founders have gone through Tacklebox with one business idea, realized they didn't like it, and waited another year or so before going through Tacklebox again with a better one.

It's a program Scordato might have benefited from earlier in his career. In the past 11 years, he's launched three startups, aside from Tacklebox: a recruiting platform for college basketball, a dating app, and a social-networking app. None of them are still in operation.Scordato's real talent seems to be spotting other entrepreneurs with potential, and giving them the guidance and mentorship they need to develop their nascent businesses. He also brings in a series of outside experts, including successful founders and investors like Cheng. Each cohort of founders gets a chance to pitch their businesses to a group of investors, less to convince them to sign on and more to get feedback about how well they articulate their business' mission and goals.

Chuugani is glad he went through Tacklebox before Y Combinator. He told me that, in Y Combinator, after three months, if you don't think your idea is viable, it's a much more high-stakes situation. ""You're forced to find any idea that might work,"" he said, ""because now you've raised money from the accelerator."" He added, ""YC changed my life,"" but ""you should be a little bit prepared to know what you're getting yourself into if you're going to raise money.""

Despite Chhugani's success, Scordato said that the majority of Tacklebox startups aren't suited to Y Combinator. The Lobby ""has the potential to be a very high-growth, very huge exit sort of company,"" but it's an exception.

Some founders go onto more niche accelerators, like New York Fashion Tech Lab - but for about half of Tacklebox startups, Scordato said, ""maybe they need a little bit of money to build the initial tech platform, or they need to hire someone to do that, but it's not going to be a big challenge. They can start operating and become profitable quickly.""

Lee, the 37Angels founder, said Scordato and Tacklebox are more open-minded about success than most other startup accelerators. That is to say, getting into the uber-selective Y Combinator isn't the only measure of success.

Lee mentioned the concept of ""lifestyle startups,"" a term that's emerged in the last decade to describe a business that doesn't need venture capital and won't necessarily be worth $1 billion, ever. Lee said the term is often perceived negatively; but lifestyle startups, she said, are welcomed at Tacklebox. A lifestyle startup can still bring in $10 million a year, she said - and ""since when did making $10 million a year become a failure?""

""We LOVE those,"" Scordato wrote in an email, referring to lifestyle startups. ""What we really stress is that companies that could be great lifestyle businesses and probably won't be unicorns shouldn't try to become unicorns. They should build sound, revenue-generating businesses that can build great products at a high margin for a (relatively) small group of customers.""

In an irony that's not lost on its founder, Tacklebox itself is one such startup. ""I love that Tacklebox is practicing what it's preaching,"" Cheng said. He mentioned that Tacklebox has already gone through several iterations, holding workshops on weekends, mornings, and evenings, and offering higher and lower price points.""It's got to be scary for Brian,"" Cheng added, ""but I commend him for that and for not being afraid of trying new things and experimenting."""

Nine years on, School Education Department, Kashmir, has failed to construct building for much awaited Primary School in kandi village of South Kashmir's Pulwama district.

Local residents from Banjren, a Gujjar habitation -- around 35 kilometres from district headquarter, informed that in 2009 authorities of school education department established a primary school in their village.

""During the initial phase, government primary school Banjren was accommodated in a rented building and it operated in a dilapidated building sans any ventilation from July 2009,"" Tufail Ahmad , a local from the area said, adding villagers from Banjren pleaded before authorities for constructing a building for the school.

He said that in 2011 when the rented building started collapsing that authorities of school education department approved construction of two additional class rooms(ACR) for government primary school Banjren.

Another resident, Sheeraz Ahmad, said that the contract for construction of ACR was given to a local contractor, Riyaz Ahmad. However Ahmad refused to start construction on ACR on grounds that he saw the contract as less profit making to him. Sheeraz said that he handed over the contract to another contractor, Zubair Ahmad who after construction of plinth too refused to work on the project fearing loss.

The villagers informed that after 2014 great deluge, the walls of the rented building from which primary school Banjren was operating started falling apart.

They said that fearing any causality, the authorities clubbed this primary school with another primary school, which is situated at distance of five kilometres in Kandi-Pathri village.

The villagers said that clubbing of primary school Banjren proved counter-productive as student roll declined from 70 to 16 from 2015 to 2018.

""Most students discharged themselves to get enrolled in nearby private schools,"" teachers at the school said, adding that travelling 5 kilometre long distance through dirt paths is troublesome for primary school kids.

The villagers added that in 2015 a new primary school was constructed in Banjren habitation for students of Poswal Mohalla.

""We request authorities of school education department either started constructed on primary school Banjren, which is pending since 2011 or club it with primary school Poswal Mohalla, which will save our children from travelling 5 kilometres up-hill,"" the villagers said.

Chief Education Officer, Pulwama, Mushtaq Ahmad Salroo told Rising Kashmir that construction on primary school Banjren was stopped because it was being built in landslide prone area. He said that they would consider clubbing of primary school Banjren with primary school Poswal Mohalla."

The students had to attend classes without even the basic amenities.

The dilapidated condition of the old school building had forced parents and students to protest against the apathy of the education department authorities and it led to the construction of a new building.

There was a serious threat to the lives of students, the parents had pointed out during their protest.

But with relocation of the school put on hold, students are an upset lot.

""Finally, the students will move into a new building with proper facilities. The previous building was a challenge for the children and had become a hurdle in their studies.

While Rinky works as a cook in a house nearby, her father Vimlesh, was a construction worker and worked for the owner of the building which collapsed and took away lives of his two children. However seeing one of his child life less and another struggling for breath, he collapsed and in an irony of fate was admitted in the same hospital where his one son who was struggling for life.

""We had asked the landlord, under whom I also work to allow us leave the building as it was not safe to live any more, however he told me that there is no need to worry and he will soon arrange another apartment for us,"" said grief stricken Vimlesh.

Vimlesh used to pay four thousand every month as rent for room on third floor of the building. Just one month ago when another family living on the first floor of the building left he also decided to leave the building but his landlord convinced him to stay.

""My father blindly trusted, the landlord and today we are paying for our blind trust, all are savings are also buried under debris and above all I lost my brothers,"" said Rinky

Father Vimlesh was aware about the rickety state of the building and wanted to shift from it. But last month the landlord convinced him to continue staying which has now proved fatal."

A land acquisition notice was issued by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to vacate the school building within three months.

NHAI had planned to build a toll plaza barrier at the school site after razing it for the ongoing widening of Ludhiana-Chandigarh six-lane highway. Now, as per the latest development, the school building has been excluded from the building plan.

From writing letters to holding several meetings, Kalyan's efforts finally paid off after secretary school education Krishan Kumar intervened and directed deputy commissioner Ludhiana to save the school and shift the toll plaza site.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Kalyan said, ""Since NHAI officials visited our school in August first week, I was having sleepless nights. Five years of hard work was being razed in a minute. Since 2013, we are working to make it a smart school and better than private schools.

The Department Of School Education Kashmir is risking lives of students of Government Boys Primary School at Wakherwan in South Kashmir's Pulwama district by conducting their classes in an unsafe and unhygienic building.

The Primary school at Wakherwan village is housed in a three room single storey building.

Ghulam Mohammad Mir, a villager said that the building was constructed in 1980s and over these years it started dilapidating due to lack of maintenance by concerned authorities.

""The walls of the building have wide cracks, windows are broken and without window panes. The ceiling too is broken,"" he said.

""Our village has more than 200 households and has a decent population of school going children but majority of parents have stopped sending their kids to the school,"" Mir said, adding that the building is unsafe and can collapse anytime. He said that around 25 students, mostly from poor families who cannot afford to send their kids to private schools, are enrolled in the said institution.

The villagers said that the school environment is unhygenic. "" A stable can be seen sharing walls with the school building on one side and on other side there is a cowshed; heaps of cow dung, dirt and fallen tree trunks fill the small yard of the school,"" the villagers said.

Another villager, Mohammad Ashraf said that the floor of the class rooms often become dirty after bird poop falls on to them from the attic through wide holes of the broken ceiling.

""Neat and clean environment is a pre-requisite for an institution like a primary school because teachers often start educating tender kids on cleanliness,"" he said , adding that authorities put a bad example before their kids . He said that unhygienic school environment serves as a source of infection and the stink causes distraction in regular class work.

The villagers said that they pleaded with authorities for relocation of the school but to no avail. ""There are more than 800 kanals of state land (chariae) in our village which can be used for the purpose of constructing of the school,"" the villagers said.

Deputy Commissioner Pulwama, Ghulam Mohammad Dar said that he held a meeting with villagers of the residents who informed him about the available land.

""A new building will be constructed at the available land which is very suitable for the said purpose and the school will be relocated to the new building,"" he said."

The Rs 27 crore facelift project started a few months ago, with an October deadline.

A slice of 'modern history' in the capital may have been permanently erased by authorities, with the demolition of a part of the old school building on the Purana Qila premises. The demolition, carried out around 10 days ago, is part of an extensive facelift exercise being undertaken inside the complex by the Archaeological Survey of India, in collaboration with the National Buildings Construction Company.

A public sector enterprise, NBCC had adopted the monument for upgradation and facelift under the Centre's Adopt a Heritage scheme last year, a Ministry of Culture official said. The Rs 27 crore facelift project started a few months ago, with an October deadline.

In June, amid reports about the possible demolition of the Partition-era school building, several archaeologists and heritage experts raised a voice against the move. Former ASI director general BB Lal said, ""The building was built after Partition, when refugees came to Purana Qila, as a school for their children. Even if it's not Mughal or British, the structure has its own importance in modern history.""

Neera Misra, chairperson-trustee of the Delhi-based Draupadi Dream Trust, which promotes arts and culture, sent letters to the ASI, Ministry of Culture and PMO, asking them to intervene and stop the demolition of the ""1947 Partition history-linked building"". Misra said, ""I was assured at the time that the demolition will not happen.""

Even though ASI officials were unavailable for comment, when The Indian Express had contacted them in June, ASI had said in a written reply: ""The earliest reference to imparting education to children of those who migrated to India after Partition relates to the... corridors and gardens of Quila-e-Kuhna mosque inside Purana Qila from August 1948 to December 1949. The said school was just a temporary arrangement for some time after 1949...""

An ASI archaeologist, who did not wish to be named, said, ""The said building was not blocking the view of the fort, nor was it jarring in any other way. The ASI will demolish a building only if it's an encroachment in the protected area or entails any illegal occupation. This wasn't the case here.""

Meanwhile, the National Green Tribunal sought a report from NBCC on the revival of the iconic lake, after a plea alleged the project was being undertaken in a manner that would damage the environment. A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed NBCC to submit the report by September 24, when the matter would be heard next.

The direction came on a plea filed by Delhi-based R K Gupta, who contended that both the NBCC and ASI have put a plastic sheet on the bed of the lake, preventing groundwater recharge.

Also, the use of a JCB machine near the main entrance of the fort by NBCC had raised eyebrows. Experts contend that earth-moving equipment can't be deployed in or close to heritage structures as it may damage them. The ASI said in the statement: ""The elevated road leading to the main entrance of Purana Qila has been made of several layers of concrete in recent times. Removing those layers manually would have taken a lot of time; so we had to employ the equipment.""

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao gave the direction to raze the building of Alok Punj Secondary School and to transfer all students to other government schools after the Delhi government informed the court that on inspection, Central Public Works Department (CPWD) had found the structure to be dangerous and vulnerable to collapse anytime.

In his report, the chief engineer of CPWD intimated the court that the building was unsafe. During the brief hearing, HC made it clear to the government that it is only concerned with the condition of the building and the safety of children studying there.

""We are only permitting you to shift the students and construct a new building there,"" the bench noted. The court then asked the Directorate of Education (DoE) to file, in a week's time, a status report indicating the timeframe by which the students would be shifted to another school and a new building be constructed for them to study.

On its part, Delhi government assured the high court that it will provide free bus services to students and accommodate them to other nearby schools run by it.

The high court's direction came while hearing a PIL, filed by NGO Social Jurist through advocate Ashok Agarwal, highlighting that 2,600 students enrolled in classes VI - X are studying in a dangerous school building and the government needs to shift them temporarily so that it can rebuild a new building, which is much safer.

The court had earlier directed the secretary of education to personally look into the matter as the same concerned safety, security and education of the students. It will now take up the matter for further hearing on September 27."

People in Kerala might not be able to forget the 'deadly months' of July and August because of the massive effect of the calamity on life and infrastructure.

Help has been pouring in from all over the country for those who have been hit by the flood. Despite fewer resources, Keralites have come together to help each other.

This government lower primary school at Kurichiarmala in the district will remain the testimony to nature's fury that has left a trail of death and destruction across the state.

A landslide on August 9 had torn through the school's one-acre compound and created two craters near the building and making it inaccessible.

Until Monday, the teachers and villagers were unsure of the future of the institute's 92 students.

In two days, the uncertainty gave way to a new-found confidence -- now seen across the state -- as the exuberant students started school on the top floor of a madrassa, barely a kilometre away.

The temporary establishment has become a symbol of communal harmony and determination of a resilient village that refused to be cowed down by adverse conditions, despite their debilitating effect.

There was an effort to clean up the three-foot mud and slush from the school building so that the classes could commence. Recurring landslides, however, posed a constant risk, forcing the authorities and volunteers to abandon their efforts.

Realising the need for continuing the school, the local mahal committee stepped in and offered space in the Hayathul Islam Madrassa building. Local residents and volunteers swung into action and made necessary arrangements on the top floor of the building.

They converted the top floor into a full-fledged school with four classrooms and a staffroom in 72 hours.

As the classes restarted on Wednesday morning, the building earned the distinction of having a madrassa, a mosque and a government school under the same roof.

The school, meanwhile, adjusted its working days. It would be closed on Fridays -- so that the faithful would have enough space for their prayers -- and instead, would work on Saturdays. The arrangement would continue for the rest of the academic year.

Authorities said the school would function in the madrassa until it a new building somewhere nearby.

Among the students who attended school on Wednesday, five have been rendered homeless by the landslides. A Facebook community, Human Being Collective, Malabar Flood Relief Forum and Green Palliative Volunteers had raised around Rs 4 lakh and helped the villagers recreate the school, which now sport brand new furniture, blackboards, teaching aids and colourful walls with animated characters and even indoor plants.

The pre-primary section has been accommodated in the madrassa's courtyard, where the Hayathul Islam mosque is also located.

""Even the children hailing from families who had suffered huge losses in the landslide were so happy on seeing their new school. It will immensely help them in erasing their traumatic experiences,"" district collector Keshvendra Kumar said.

The school is also a reaffirmation of the secular credentials of Kerala where everyone is helping each other, cutting across religious, social and other barriers,"" who spent around three hours at the school, added.

The school's PTA President Mohammed Aslam, also the vice president of the mahal committee, said the entire Mahal was very forthcoming in opening up its premises for the school. ""Though properties worth crores were lost in the landslide, our biggest loss was the Kurichiar Mala LP School. Most of the people in the village work in the nearby tea plantation and the school was their only hope for a better future of their children,"" Aslam said.

School headmaster Sasi P K said the deputy director of education has sanctioned the changes in the school working days to facilitate the Friday prayers at the mosque.

C K Saseendran, representing Kalpetta in the state assembly, said the school would be upgraded to an upper primary school with Rs 1 crore from the MLA fund and a Rs 49 lakh grant from the central government's multi-sectoral development programme. The Tata Group, meanwhile, has promised to construct a new building for the school on identifying a new location.

The district collector said the damaged school building would be converted to a memorial to showcase how the people overcame the natural calamity."

The administration of Model Higher Secondary School, according to locals, is now trying to take over the portion of the ground by constructing a 6-room structure despite having an ample space and existing structures.

A veteran local cricketer, Ghulam Mohi Uddin Mirab who is the member of of Bijbehara Cricket Organisation, said they apprehend that structure, if constructed, would shrink the space for the cricket ground.

""Since decades, we have maintained and developed this ground from our own money. Some months back, we along with Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association developed the turf at a cost of Rs 4 lakh.

They alleged that principal of the school got the land dug covertly during night hours to pave way for the foundation of the building.

The residents and sports lovers say that in the absence of a proper sports ground, the youth of the area will have no option to develop their skills and may turn to waywardness.

Another cricketer Mohammad Shafi said the youth have developed keen interest towards sports activities for past many years owing to the availability of the playfield.

""This ground has produced hundreds of top cricketers in the region who have even played in national tournaments. Many landed good jobs due to their excellence in the sporting field too. If the authorities now snatch the ground from players it would halt the sporting activities afterwards.""

Classes for around 200 children of primary section (Classes I to V) of a government school in Jahangirpur (alias Jagirpur) had to be shifted to a langar hall in a nearby gurdwara after their building was declared 'unsafe' on August 10. The school also has around 15 children under pre-primary section.

Unlike other days, when classes were held separately for all classes, on Tuesday, the children were cramped up under one roof in the gurdwara as classes were held simultaneously.

The order issued by district project director of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA) from local district education office on August 10, asked the teachers of the school to shift classes to a 'safe' place and lock six 'unsafe' rooms as they collapse anytime. The order further stated that children should not be allowed to sit in the school building and that the head teacher should make some alternative arrangement for the classes to be conducted. As no proper place was found, children were made to sit in the langar hall of a gurudwara after getting the permission of the gurdwara head.

According to Manmohan Singh, head teacher of the school, it is just the beginning of many problems lying ahead. ""We have not even shifted our benches here because it is all uncertain. Gurudwara management can ask to vacate their space in the langar hall anytime, depending on their programmes. For instance, even on Monday we weren't able to conduct classes as there was a bhog ceremony scheduled at the gurdwara. So we made students sit in open at the porch of our school building,"" he said.

Since there were no fans at the gurudwara shed where students have been allotted space, old ceiling fans from the school building have been taken down and have been installed at the shed for now. ""We have got our own fans removed from the classrooms and got them installed here under the shed. How can we make students sit without fans in such heat? If any kid falls ill or gets unconscious, who will be responsible. Thankfully, there is a water cooler in the gurdwara, so drinking water is not an issue,"" added Singh.

Another problem that remains is that of the washroom. ""These are small children from Classes 1 to 5 and since our school building is across the main road, I cannot allow them to cross the road and go to washroom in our own school. It is a busy road with heavy traffic movement. So we are requesting the gurudwara management to let our children use their washrooms. We have agreed to pay to get them cleaned,"" he said.

While the written orders have been issued by district project director of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA) from local district education office saying that old building having six classrooms should be locked and demolished as soon as possible, there is still no word on when and where new building will be constructed.

""Either they can demolish the old one and construct a new one here itself. Otherwise, village panchayat has told us that another chunk of land allotted for school many years back is lying unused. We have received no information yet on when work will start to construct the new building,"" said the head teacher.

Chennai-based Concrete Quality Concepts, an IIT-Madras-incubated company, which had conducted tests to assess the stability of the Government Higher Secondary School at Thinaikulam in the district, has said the 'stability of the building is good' but found some of the RC columns 'severely distressed.'

In its report submitted before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, the company, which carried out ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), rebound hammer (RH), assessment of carbonation, compressive cell and half cell potential tests in February, said the concrete in the near surface portion was in the range of 'good to very good'.

""The average RH values in RC structural elements of the school building indicate that the quality of concrete in the near surface portion is good to very good, except the RC columns C8 and C10 on the ground floor and C6 on the second floor,"" it said.

The average RH values in these RC columns indicated that the quality of concrete in the near surface portion was satisfactory. The average UPV values in a majority of the structural elements could be considered as good and in certain RC columns doubtful, the report said.

The visual inspection and non-destructive tests revealed that the corrosion was predominant in the RC columns of the ground floor and RC lintel beams of the first and the second floors. ""However, the RC beams and RC slab on all the three floors did not show any distress bearing in RC beam A8 and B8 in the second floor,"" it said.

The severely distressed RC columns on all the three floors should be rehabilitated using micro concrete jacketing, the company suggested. The tile joints in the terrace might be rectified to arrest the leakage with lime grout and repainting, it said.

After the court suo motu took cognisance of media reports that the school building was unsafe for students, the Engineer-in-chief (Buildings) of Public Works Department had ordered the tests.

The building, constructed at a cost of ₹ 1.26 crore, was inaugurated in 2016. After plastering in the walls and columns peeled off, exposing corroded steel rods, the Parent-Teachers' Association pulled out the students and the block remained locked for about eight months."

Water seeping through cracked ceilings and walls during rain, broken window panes and roots of old trees peeping out of damaged walls -- this is the scenario inside the government primary school at Jahangirpur village of Ludhiana. However, the education department and Public Works Department (PWD) is unmoved, despite the probability that the school building can collapse anytime, putting lives of around 200 children at risk.

So, it should be declared unsafe at the earliest so that they can move kids out, but there has been no action till Saturday.

Be it Chhattisgarh or Madhya Pradesh, school education, mostly in rural areas, is in shambles.

The petitioner alleged that the school was demolished to provide a large space to the parliamentarian in front of his house, in collusion with education authorities and the village pradhan.

According to petitioner, the land on which the school is situated on Jeeva Main Street belonged to his father. As the school lacked all the basic amenities and considering the safety of the children, his father, before his death, cancelled the lease deed and asked the management to vacate the premises.

This Shiva temple in Raisinghpur village is not just home to the deity, it has been serving as a school for 23 students for the past 10 years.

The Raisinghpur New Primary School, established in 2008, was to have been set up on a parcel of government land outside the village.

The school and mass education department, under which the school falls, had granted funds to the tune of Rs 6.44 lakh in 2008-2009. As the land was situated far away from Raisinghpur, the authorities decided to shift the school to within the village. A 20-decimal patch of land, also belonging to the government but claimed by the villagers as their own, was chosen for the school by the revenue inspector.

Due to the dispute over the land, the school building was never actually built. Thus, from its inception, the school - which has classes from I to V and comprises 23 students, three teachers and four blackboards - has been working out of its unlikely home from 10 am to 4 pm, six days a week.

""We come to the school regularly and it becomes difficult for the teachers to take classes as there is only one room in the temple here. Had there been a building, we would have read without any problem,"" said Prem Karuna, a Class V student.

Damayanti Barik, the mother of a Class V student, said the future of the children were at stake. ""The biggest problem the kids face is while eating the midday meal. The food has to be prepared in different houses in the village as the school does not have a building of its own. Not only is this a logistical nightmare, it also brings up the question of hygiene,"" she said.

The cook of Raisinghpur New Primary School, Kadambini Mishra, echoes Damayanti. ""It is so difficult to cook in a different house every day. Worse, the children have to eat under the open sky in the temple verandah,"" she said.

""We are trying to do the best we can under the circumstances,"" added headmaster in charge of the school, Pratap Kumar Panda.

The Kalahandi district project coordinator of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Gabakhya Nayak, said a new proposal for the construction of the school building at a cost of Rs 10 lakh had been sent to the government. ""However, construction can only begin when the dispute over land ends,"" he added.

President of the school management committee, Jatindra Singh, explained that the dispute over the 20-decimal land had led to the school building's construction being stalled.

On being asked, he could not specify when the dispute would be resolved. ""The revenue inspector had chosen the land. It is up to the state government to resolve the land issue,"" was all he was willing to say."

Teachers said she had attended school on Thursday and nothing had happened which could have upset her. Around 2.30pm, the girl returned from school. She then left home on the pretext of going to tuitions, in the same complex. Instead, she headed to another building and went to the eighth-floor refuge area.

The clip was circulated on WhatsApp and soon went viral, leaving her friends and neighbours stunned.

""The refuge area cannot be kept locked nor can a wire mesh be put up as per fire department orders. We had put up CCTV cameras in the area which have captured the girl going to the parapet,"" said society manager Rajesh Medhe. ""A guard has been posted there since the incident.""

Residents informed the girl's mother and carried the girl into a car.

She succumbed to injuries at the hospital. ""She had celebrated her birthday eight to 10 days ago,"" her tuition teacher said.

No other injuries were reported, but the fire brigade continued its search for any unidentified missing persons, late into the night.

The first floor of the building was undergoing renovation work. Mote said, ""There was carpentry work going on the first floor, and it is likely that the dead person was a worker.""

A Level II fire (not a major fire) gutted second and third floors of the four-storey building at 6.08pm on Sunday.

The fire brigade pressed eight fire engines and seven water tankers, a turntable ladder and an ambulance to the spot. The fire was brought under control after around three hours of fire fighting, by 9.43pm.

According to reports from the fire brigade, the building did not have the mandatory fire safety systems.

Flames ripped through the celebrated Mackintosh building after it caught fire at around 23:15 BST on Friday, a BBC News report said on Saturday.

The blaze has spread to nearby buildings, including the Campus nightclub and O2 ABC music venue, which suffered ""extensive damage"". No casualties have been reported, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said.

Efforts to bring the fires under control are expected to be ""prolonged"", Deputy Chief Officer Iain Bushell said.

More than 120 firefighters have been sent to the scene, faced with ""an extremely challenging and complex incident"", he said.

The Mackintosh building was badly damaged by fire in May 2014 and was due to re-open next year following a multi-million pound restoration project.

Ben, an eyewitness, told the BBC the latest fire looked ""much worse"" than the previous one. ""This is a blaze, the building is just going up like a tinder-box. It's quite shocking,"" he said.

Connor Neil, 22, said people were being evacuated from their homes and there was a ""big orange light"" which could be seen from streets away.Despite the thick, black, acrid smoke, the blaze seemed to be dying down in the Mackintosh building.But very quickly the situation changed, with the roof of Campus nightclub catching fully alight.

Earlier, loud bangs were heard coming from inside the art school as crews tried to tackle the flames.Students - some of whom graduated on Friday - were in the street in shock. They can't believe it's happened again.

One Twitter user posted a video of the O2's roof appearing to collapse as firefighters sprayed water onto the building from an aerial platform.

Police Scotland advised the public to avoid the area, and said areas around Dalhousie St, Scott St and Sauchiehall St were all affected by road closures.

Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney described the building, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, as ""the most architecturally important building in Glasgow"".

The Labour politician said the restoration effort had suffered a ""horrific setback"" which he hoped would be overcome.

Mr Sweeney went on to say: ""The 1909 library extension, that was the origin of the 2014 blaze is now fully alight too. ""It looks like the entire interior space is now fully alight.

""The best we can probably hope for is structural facade retention and a complete rebuild of the interior. Devastating.""

In a tweet, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This is clearly an extremely serious situation. ""My first thoughts tonight are for the safety of people - but my heart also breaks for Glasgow's beloved @GSofA.

""Once again, we are indebted to the bravery of our firefighters and other emergency services.""The Mackintosh building was completed in 1909 based on designs by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland's most-lauded designer.

It has been described as ""a working art school as well as a work of art"", and has an A-list rating from Historic Scotland.

In recent years, the school has produced many of the UK's leading contemporary artists such as Douglas Gordon, David Shrigley, and three recent Turner Prize winners: Simon Starling in 2005, Richard Wright in 2009 and Martin Boyce in 2011.Other former students include actors Robbie Coltrane and Peter Capaldi, and artist Peter Howson.

As per the president of the party's youth wing, Thomas Passah, a reply to a RTI filed by the party had revealed that Rs 75,000 was sanctioned as a non-recurring grant in aid for construction of school additional class room under the Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resources scheme for Madrassa Himayatul Islam UP School Shillong.

While there is nothing wrong in this, Passah pointed out that one of the conditions in the guidelines issued was that the school should have undisputed and sufficient land for construction of the school building with scope for further expansion.

Passah also said that the SDSEO in its reply to the RTI on November 29, 2017 had informed that the school does not have a land patta of its own. Also, the DSEL in its reply on May 14, this year had further intimated that the building permission for the school is not available and the Tax Receipt copy of the land is also not available.

Passah also said that the guidelines specify that the School Managing Committee (SMC) shall be responsible for maintenance and repairs of the building putting proper boundary fencing and up keep of the building on completion.

Passah however said that if the school does not have land, it is impossible to be responsible for maintenance and repairs and provision of boundary fencing.

""Based on the facts received through RTI, it can be concluded that there has been a misuse of public money, and possibility that the amount sanctioned for construction of the school building was not utilized at all. Various appeals and complaints have been made to the DSEO and DSEL, but no action has been taken till date,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Passah further alleged that the Managing Committee of the school, which was approved by the SDSEO, Shillong, consists of members whose qualification is below matric (tenth) with members having minimum qualification of class III.

""There are also criminal charges against few a members of the Managing Committee. It is saddening to know that the authority approved and entrust the management of school business to people whose qualification is very low besides having criminal charges,"" he stated.

Passah has since sought the intervention of the State Education Minister, Lahkmen Rymbui through a memorandum in which he said that it is not about the size of the amount, but the seriousness of the crime, which needs to be eradicated from the state especially from reputed and important sector as education."

""The enquiry committee will fix responsibility as to who signed the bills resulting in release of money to the contractor for incomplete work,'' he said, adding that only six class rooms have been built in the school in place of eight rooms as provided in the contract.
