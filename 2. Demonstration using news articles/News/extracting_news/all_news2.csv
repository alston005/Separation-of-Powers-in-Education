"1308","","Mysuru: ""Education is a treasure that can be preserved without any fear of loss,"" said Justice V Gopala Gowda, a retired judge of the Supreme Court here on Friday. Justice Gowda, who delivered the convocation address at St. Philomena's College, likened teachers to a sculptor who sharpens and chisels the life of students.

""Quality education is the solution to all problems in the society,"" said the retired judge.

Mysuru Bishop Reverend KA William said that the best convocation was the sense of satisfaction that one had of being a good human being. ""Education becomes prominent when it spreads in all directions. Always do good, think good and speak good, and that is how one serves his or her purpose to the society,"" he added.

In-charge vice-chancellor of the University of Mysore (UoM) Prof. Aisha M Sheriff pointed to St. Philomena's College's seven-decade-old legacy. ""The college was established in 1946, and it was thrown open by then maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar. The institute was the first degree college to be accredited A+ by NAAC. The college is a global village, with students from 19 states in India, and 26 foreign countries studying here,"" Prof. Aisha said.

Exhorting students to dream, and dream big, she added, ""One must never stop learning, and must always treat the whole of humanity as a religion.""

The real challenge is in infusing quality into delivery of higher education alongside enlarging its reach, Justice Balbir Singh Chauhan, Chairman of Law Commission of India, said addressing the fourth convocation of Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur, on Friday.

Higher education is the key factor for creating a large pool of skilled manpower for our nation.

It is the determiner of career prospects of the students and is the stepping stone for building a strong nation, said Justice Chauhan.

Universities, he said, were the hub of dynamic and creative young students and experienced faculties where innovative ideas and technologies sprout for advancement of science and development of home grown technologies.

""Understand and tap your potential to the maximum. With talents and interests, you can transform the world,"" Justice Chauhan told the students.

""While the internet is a magical world and provides solutions to many questions, constant use of social media may lead to a kind of addiction resulting in vulnerability to crimes and dereliction of work. Therefore, try to use technology for your advantage and ensure that it is not detrimental to your personal life and future prospects,"" he added.

In his welcome address, Vice-Chancellor A. P. Dash said quality of education has to be the focus of attention in the country that accounts for over 800 universities and 50,000 colleges.

For the country to become a developed nation, every individual must strive to achieve excellence.

""A degree is no longer a passage to certain employment. There is a need to add new skills with latest technologies. Innovation and creativity are the keywords of our times."" Prof. Dash said.

"1313","","We have highly qualified and experienced teachers in government schools. The students studying in government schools come from a very poor background and their parents are not educated, hence, they are not able to give any attention towards their studies at home. This is the bitter truth that the students from these schools are not well versed with the three R's namely reading, writing and arithmetic, (Curtis, 1795 as cited by Timbs&Limbert, 1825).

Moreover, they are not able to spell, understand and pronounce words even in the upper primary classes. This problem is carried forward to higher secondary level and at times even to higher education level.

And in this way can say that we are not able to generate good educational outcomes from government schools because the students studying there don't have a strong base. Government schools lack organizational capacity. The classes are not organized in judicious rooms.

The main aim of education is to acquire relevant skills and knowledge coupled with the proper know-how and technology, which is responsible for the capacity and skill development and the inclination for making cost-effective use of that knowledge.

It is very unfortunate that the students in the government schools don't even get a basic education which is why the main aim of education remains unfulfilled. Government teachers don't give thrust on spellings, meanings, pronunciation, and dictation etc. so that basics of students studying in such schools are very weak and for that matter, they are not able to write a sentence or even a paragraph properly.

All the schools, colleges and institutions of higher education in India follow a random walk series as far as course outline is concerned. The obsolete syllabus is the normal feature of Indian educational institutions which doesn't fit into the modern world setting. For the reason, students in our country are not able to find a good place in job markets, in and outside the country.

Moreover, faulty education system is one of the reasons for high educated unemployment in our country in general and Jammu Kashmir in particular (Qadri&Kasab, 2017).

In order to improve the quality of education in India, particularly in government schools, the government and the concerned authorities should put heavy emphasis upon the research and development of the syllabus which should necessarily talk about the modern world and its related processes of globalization, liberalization and privatization on the one hand and technology, innovations and entrepreneurships on the other hand. Furthermore, special focus should be given on relevant case studies.

There is a need to thoroughly and scientifically review and identify the policy intermediations that improve education quality and student learning at the elementary levels. We need to depend on a theory of alteration and for that matter, we need to understand the main drivers of the improvements in the quality of education at elementary level.

The supply-side competence contributions need to be put up that function through the provision of better infrastructure, particularly, human capital, and social capital. The efficiency wage hypothesis argues that incentives and rewards increase the productivity or efficiency. It should be adopted in our education system for both students as well as for teachers because it will increase their productivity levels.

Besides, the programmes, policies and plans through rewards and incentives seek to influence the behavior and inter-temporal likings and inclinations of teachers, parents and students.

The inductive or bottom-up and deductive or top-down participating and community management intrusions, which activate through the principles of decentralization and its allied reforms, transmission of skills and knowledge, and augmented community participation in the organization and management of education systems must be adopted (Masino&Zarazua, 2015).

Conclusion and recommendation:

Immense stress should be given right from KG classes at words, spellings, meanings, pronunciation, writing, dictation, and reading etc. so that fundamentals of learning become strong which will make the students able to read and write properly.

There is a need to thoroughly and scientifically review and identify the policy intermediations that improve education quality and student learning at elementary levels. It is very important to note that the inputs and efforts are effective only when policy changes are coupled with community participation, rewards and social capital.

We can improve learning outcomes when social norms and inter-temporal varieties and selections are factored in the strategy of education plans and policies (Masino&Zarazua, 2015), and when we integrate technology with classroom.

As education is an unending process and the knowledge acquisition and skill upgradation for its solicitation and application are not static but parts of a dynamic and lively process, there is a need to make schools dynamic and lively with good interaction among all the parties involved in the teaching-learning process.

Special training programmes must be developed for teachers teaching at an elementary level. Division of labour is the separation of tasks in a system so that actors or participants may specialize. Economic growth is the pivotal point of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations (1776). Economic Growth for Smith is rooted in increasing division of labour and specialization.

In any modern education system there is an increasing emphasis on specialization and the division of labour. Subject specialist teachers must be allocated against specific subject posts.

For example, P.G. in English must be posted for teaching English, P.G. in History must be posted for teaching History, P.G. in Chemistry must be posted for teaching Chemistry and so on and so forth. This will definitely enhance the quality of education and bring specialization in an economy in general and education in particular.

"1315","","School no 18 at Parabwadi is one of the many civic schools that have undergone a makeover in the past two years. (Praful Gangurde/ HT)

Take a walk along the corridors of TMC school number 18 at Parabwadi and the information neatly painted on walls will tell you about countries and flags. Small diagrams on other walls give an insight into the school and the schedule.

This is one of the many civic schools which have undergone a makeover in the past two years.

The Thane Municipal Corporation's education department has made use of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to give civic schools a facelift.

The move has made the students more enthusiastic to attend class.

""We have noticed better attendance in classrooms after the colourful makeover. Also children are showing interest in subjects where special sessions are conducted for them,"" said Disha Vichare, teacher at a civic school in Kisan Nagar.

Corporates have helped set up digital and technology friendly classrooms and laboratory for higher classes.

Not just infrastructure but self-help organisations are focusing on improving the quality of teaching.

Some provide sessions for special children and some focus on students who are talented in art. English speaking sessions are also held for teachers and special coaching for dropouts.

A total of Rs9.76 crore corporate social responsibility funds have been used since 2015 till 2017 with an aim to improve the quality of education in municipal schools.

The TMC accepts funds from top corporates and self-help organisations to avoid delays in projects.

""Earlier, the procedure to approve budget for projects was time-consuming. However, approval for CSR funding is quick. Since the corporates handle most of the procedure, it saves us a lot of time. This also helps students and teachers to get better facilities quickly,"" said Vikas Repale, chairman of education committee, education department, TMC.

A visible example of the benefits of CSR initiative is the signal school at Teen Hath Naka, which has been running for three years.

""The signal school started for the children begging on the streets has gained a lot of popularity. We will soon begin a platform school in Mumbra for children loitering on the station premises,"" said Manish Joshi, deputy municipal commissioner, education department, TMC.

He said a skill centre for labourers has also been built. ""We are working towards making Thane's civic education on a par with private institutions,"" Joshi said.

""Many organisations have approached us to provide stationery or meals to students of civic schools. We tell them about the requirements we have in schools and accordingly the organisations work to provide what the schools lack,"" added Repale.

Many TMC schools, which were in a run-down condition, have been upgraded with better infrastructure and teaching quality.

Students of Lokmanya Nagar civic school were happy getting a laboratory recently.

""Without a laboratory, it was difficult teaching science to students. There was hardly any practical training and students also would not show much interest in understanding concepts. There has been a huge improvement after a laboratory was set up,"" said Pranali Vaidya, teacher from the school.

Students are excited about their 'new' school.

""Our school walls have mathematical tables and cartoon figures. It is attractive and we all join in to learn tables,"" said Anish More, student of Vartak Nagar civic school.

""The makeover has made

a difference to learning and teaching. However, the CSR activities are time-bound and it is essential for the TMC to ensure that teaching quality keeps improving,"" said Vijay Bedekar, educationalist.","TMC schools score high on quality education after infrastructure upgrade ","951195447","2018-09-20","https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tmc-schools-score-high-on-quality-education-after-infrastructure-upgrade/story-IELTCSvfdRmflNl0CP2kpL.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

"1317","","To strengthen the primary education at an early age, IX Primary Olympiads is scheduled to be held in India. The exam is designed in such a way that it helps both students and parents to understand the improvement areas and their National level academic performance.

Primary Olympiad runs as a National level certification program and competition for young learners along with their teachers from class I - V. The competition has five levels and the students studying in respective classes can opt for the respective levels. The Olympiad consists of Language, Mathematics and Science sections. The Language Olympiad focuses on spelling and grammar, Maths Olympiad focuses on Arithmetic & Geometry and the Science Olympiad focuses on science and environmental studies.

""In our education system, the National Level examinations are best held at only X or XII standard level, which hampers the educational outcomes. This situation needs to be addressed urgently, as lack of early transparency eliminates the system's knack to rectify itself. There are tremendous contentions among academicians on measuring a students learning from younger grades. Some believe that the damage done to young children through exam stress outweighs the benefits of actual learning, and others contend that the examination results are not the actual reflection of true learning,says,Mr.Hemant Bisht, National Product Head, Primary Olympiad.

Students enrolled in the Primary Olympiad receive books as study materials which are aligned with their school curriculum and hence can also be utilized as an additional practice material. Students enrolled for the Language Olympiad receive a spelling book, a grammar book and comprehension & composition book. Students enrolled for the Maths Olympiad receive a maths text-book and an activity book. Students enrolled for the Science Olympiad receive a science text book and an environmental studies book.

A teacher's guide is also provided to the teachers of the participating schools to enable them for effective preparation assistance to the students. A team of master trainer also assist the teachers of the enrolled schools on state-of -the art teaching methodology and easy ways to understand the subjects better.

""In parallel to the issue of not having annual exams, students in primary classes are devoid of exposure to non-academic and in-school activities as well. While the Government makes systematic yet gradual progress towards improving the education system, the approach that the Non-Profit Organisations have undertaken is to highlight the above issues and support the Government initiative by either creating a content of International standard or raise their exposure by conducting competitive exams.""Mr.Bisht further added .

Winners from each grade will be awarded a scholarship of upto Rs 10000/- along with certificates and recognition. For students not making it to the finale, in addition to awards, certificates and recognition, a detailed score card that analyzes their performance in a variety of competency dimensions is given. Schools also receive a confidential score card that shows how the school performed relative to other schools.

With Alumni bases in over 20 cities and associations with the best schools, the services provided are niche in the segment. Successfully implementing with the State Governments and PSU's to support their quality education drive, Primary Olympiads continuously prove to have a substantial impact on effective learning

The Primary Olympiad was first launched in June 2010 in the name of 'English Olympiad' and was confined only to Mumbai. With over 9 years of excellence in it s unique domain, Primary Olympiad is the oldest certificate programs, emerging as the premium certification programs for primary classes in the country. Today over 12,000 students from 200 schools in 20 cities are part of the Primary Olympiad.

Prince Charles' British Asian Trust, Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, Tata Trusts and some others have come together to raise initial USD 11 million (about Rs 73 crore) to improve quality of education in India.

The UK government's Department for International Development is also a part of the consortium.

The consortium wants to use the fund as a springboard to double the Development Impact Bond (DIB) in the coming years, a statement said.

Till date, this is the largest DIB globally for education and the largest in India with a potential to be significantly scaled up further, it said.

With this new and innovative social finance tool, the consortium aims to improve literacy and numeracy skills for more than 3,00,000 children, drive focus towards outcomes in the development sector and transform the way education is funded in India, the statement added.

While traditional funding streams are under severe pressure, innovative financing mechanisms such as DIBs are a complementary tool to attract new private capital and will also play a major role in bridging the financing gap to achieve the UN's ambitious Sustainable Development Goals, it added.","Global leaders raises USD 11 mn to improve quality of education in India","944283603","2018-09-11","https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/global-leaders-raises-usd-11-mn-to-improve-quality-of-education-in-india-118091101143_1.html","Business Standard",FALSE

"1326","","The speakers at the inaugural session of the three-day 46th Annual Conference of the AP chapter of the Association of Physicians of India (AP APICON 2018) held at the PES Institute of Medical Sciences and Research at Kuppam on Saturday called for quality medical education in order to make India a viable medical hub in the coming decades.

Over 500 delegates from all over India from various medical colleges and universities took part in the event.

S. Sacchidanand, Vice-Chancellor of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, Bangalore, who inaugurated the conference, said that though there were about 450 medical colleges and 10,000 nursing colleges in India, producing thousands of graduates and post-graduates and paramedical students every year, the need of the hour is to have 'quality medical education'. Along with age-related health ailments, several diseases were breaking out from time to time, every season, as they were being potentially fostered by the rapid changes in the environment globally.

""The true meaning of medical education and practice should be based on social context. With young generation and available infrastructure and talent, India has the potential to be a vibrant destination for medical education and to become a perfect hub for it,"" Dr. Sacchidanand said.

Chancellor of PES University Dr M.R. Doreswamy observed that the PES Medical College in Kuppam is the best example of taking medical education and fruits of research to villages, following the Gandhian concept that 'India lives in villages'.

He said that generally national conferences would be held in cities, but the PES University could bring the intellectuals of medical field to a remote village like Kuppam, behind which the efforts of the faculty played a crucial role.

The Uttar Pradesh government, under chief minister Yogi Adityanath's personal push, is working on a plan to make public education free. There is already a catchy slogan -- from KG (kindergarten) to PG (post graduation). The plan may seem revolutionary, but amounts to little more than tokenism. Fees are already quite low -- in University of Lucknow, for instance, the monthly fee for a regular MA programme is a little below '700 while that for the most expensive self-financed MA programme, the monthly fee stands a little below '5,000. Education is free till the secondary level in public schools. Yet, successive ASER surveys show how, even in rural areas, parents are increasingly preferring private schools over public ones. In UP, 30.3% of the all school-going children were enrolled in private schools in 2006. By 2014, this had increased to over 51%. Also, these reports point at a significant lag in terms of quality of learning between government-run and private schools. And, as per NSSO data, more than a quarter of school students in the country bridge gaps in school-learning through private coaching . So, the problem is not fees impeding access to education, it is the poor quality of education and consequent poor learning outcomes, especially in government-run schools. In fact, the increasing private-school enrolment and private tuitions trends show that even the poor are willing to spend for better quality education.

The Adityanath government should work on improving the quality of learning in its schools and universities -- students in government schools in the state, as per the last ASER survey that examined this, reported worse learning outcomes than students in government schools across the rest of the country. As per a Times of India report, nearly 3,700 PhD-holders applied for the job of 62 messenger posts in the telecom wing of UP police -- the minimum educational qualification required is Class V-pass. Among other things, this is also a blistering commentary on the quality of higher education in the state. So, instead of making ""KG to PG"" free, if the state focuses on improving quality of education imparted at its schools, colleges and universities, students would benefit more. Addressing the quality-gaps in government school education, in particular, would not only mean better learning outcomes, it could also benefit families financially if it brings down dependence on private coaching or private school enrolment.","Yogi Adityanath plans free KG to PG education: Not cost, but quality is top concern in UP government institutions","940081556","2018-09-05","https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/yogi-adityanath-plans-free-kg-to-pg-education-not-cost-but-quality-is-top-concern-in-up-government-institutions/1303980/","The Financial Express",FALSE

Of the 6,000 'lecturer' positions in 404 government junior colleges, there are only 840 regular ones. In 162 colleges, there is not even one regular lecturer. The remaining 5,200 vacancies were filled with contract and guest lecturers -- the former recruited for three years and the latter on annual basis. There are 3,800 contractual and 1,400 guest lecturers in the government junior colleges.

Now, with no job security for 85 per cent of the staff working in these colleges, the educational standards in these institutions have taken a beating. P Madhusudan Reddy, president of Telangana Government Junior Lecturers' Association, said, ""The High Court has said that contract lecturers cannot be regularised nor can they continue for more than three years.

By the time there develops an understanding between the teacher and the student, it is time for them to leave. Teachers too are not interested in working because they know they are temporary. For proper teaching to take place, the tenure should be of at least four to five years or the government should take up permanent recruitment.""

With the state government not recruiting any regular lecturer since 2002, the colleges have been making do with contract lecturers. Despite the High Court's directive on ensuring that the tenure of contract lecturers does not exceed three-year term, it was in 2014 that lecturers under this category were inducted.

A total of 45 students from SC residential schools bagged MBBS seats this year of which 30 got the seats in open category. This stands testimony to the kind of education being extended to students in Telangana, said Irrigation Minister T. Harish Rao.

Addressing the students of Girls Residential School at Hothi K in Zaheerabad mandal after inaugurating the school building and laying foundation stone for additional classrooms on Thursday, he said that the State government has established 604 residential schools in addition to the existing 273 institutions.

By 2021, about 10 lakh students would be studying in schools and the government would be spending a budget of ₹15,000 crore on education per annum, he said.

""Education is one of our top priorities which is why Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao ensured establishment of 134 SC residential schools in addition to the existing 134 schools that were established in the past six decades,"" Mr. Harish Rao said.

""For the first time in the country, we established as many as 30 degree residential colleges in the State,"" he said, adding that people have trust in government educational system now as they were willing to send their children to government schools. Unlike his usual way, he spoke to students in English and enquired about the facilities at school.

Principal Vijaya informed the Minister that the existing residential accommodation was sufficient for only 256 students while the student strength was 526.

Mr. Harish Rao promised her to sanction additional rooms.

Earlier, the Minister laid foundation stone for the construction of 50-bed hospital and classrooms at Kohir.

He also laid foundation stone for road-over bridge on railway track at Zaheerabad at an estimated cost of ₹90 crore, a demand that was pending for the past two decades.

"1342","","HYDERABAD: Hailing the High Court verdict on Friday rapping the TSBIE over the appointment of guest faculty to government junior colleges, lectures claim that the quality of education won't improve until the arrangement is totally done away with. Of the 6,000 'lecturer' positions in 404 government junior colleges, there are only 840 regular ones. In 162 colleges, there is not even one regular lecturer.

The remaining 5,200 vacancies were filled filled with contract and guest lecturers _ the former recruited for three years and the latter on annual basis. There are 3,800 contractual and 1,400 guest lecturers in the government junior colleges.

Now, with no job security for 85 per cent of the staff working in these colleges, the educational standard in these institutions has taken a beating. P Madhusudan Reddy, president of Telangana Government Junior Lecturers' Association, said, ""The High Court has said that contract lecturers cannot be regularised nor can they continue for more than three years.

By the time there develops an understanding between the teacher and the student, it is time for them to leave. Teachers, too, are not interested in working because they know they are temporary. For proper teaching to take place, the tenure should be of at least for or five years or the government should take up permanent recruitment.""

Since 2002 the government has not recruited any regular lecturer and the colleges have been making do with contract lecturers. Despite the High Court's directive on ensuring that the tenure of contract lecturers does not exceed three-year term, it was in 2014 that lecturers under this category were inducted.

An official of the board admitted that quality of education depended on the strength and permanence of the teaching staff. ""Teachers and infrastructure are most important inputs in the education system. That infrastructure in government colleges is poor is well-known. Now, having so many categories of lecturers - regular, contract, guest, part-time guest, and minimum scale - is doing more harm than good,"" he said.","Regular teachers prerequisite for quality education in colleges","932638122","2018-08-26","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/aug/27/regular-teachers-prerequisite-for-quality-education-in-colleges-1863242.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

Principal of Lakireddy Balireddy College of Engineering K. Appa Rao has said there are plenty of opportunities for higher education in various countries and called upon students to work hard and be equipped to pursue a career that has better prospects.

Mr. Rao was speaking at the seminar on 'Overseas Education and Opportunities' organised jointly by The Hindu and IDP Education at the college on Friday.

He said not many had a clear picture of education abroad and such awareness programmes introduced them to not just education opportunities but also financial aid in the form of scholarships provided by institutions.

Manager-Operations of IDP Education Maneesh Chandra stressed the need for setting a higher goal in life to make it big.

Focus on research

""The quality of education and standards of an institution play a key role in shaping up the career of students. Industries across the world always look for industry-ready graduates to employ. But curriculum in Indian institutions is changed only once in two or three years.

In case of foreign universities, course curriculum as required by the industry could be updated in a matter of a month or two, which is a great advantage for students,"" Mr. Maneesh said. The first salary was the most important thing in one's career, he said and asked students to aim high.

Explaining the opportunities of funded courses in universities in the U.S., Canada, Australia and other countries, Mr. Maneesh said most of the foreign universities were involved in research and engaged students in research work.

Govt. assistance

Apart from the universities, the government of Andhra Pradesh was also providing loans and subsidies for students to pursue higher education in foreign universities, he said. ""All kinds of support is available for those wishing to pursue education in other countries. It is time you used the opportunities,"" he told the students.

A team of experts of IDP Education later threw light on courses, universities and scholarships available in Canada, U.S. and other countries.

"1345","","Mysuru: As a result of the Government of Karnataka partnering with Pratham, an NGO to improve the quality of education in primary schools in the state, the reading ability of children in Class 4 and 5 saw an improvement from 29% to 65% and the ability to do math increased from 31% to 69%. In the case of Urdu medium schools, the ability to read a story in Urdu improved from 17% to 57%.

Elated with the success, the state government by the end of 2019 will extend this partnership with Pratham in 21 districts of the state.

Divulging details of the training method of Pratham which has brought about significant changes, founder of Pratham Mysore, Ashvini Ranjan told TOI, ""The uniqueness in our training lies in segregating the children based on their learning levels. In a typical classroom, there are children who have stopped learning at different levels. While 10% of a classroom is made up of frontbenchers who have little or no difficulty, the remaining 90% have difficulties in learning at various levels.""

""By segregating them, the teachers who are trained by our master trainers will provide individual attention to every child to help them catch up by clearing their doubts and the children rapidly catch up,"" said Ranjan.

""To promote a healthy and friendly classroom atmosphere, we ask the teachers to squat on the floor along with the children as it makes a world of a difference to the children as they feel less intimidated by the teacher,"" said Ranjan asserting that a significant change was witnessed after this method was adopted. The children do not get frightened and a friendly atmosphere is created and learning becomes fun, he added.

""We also update the parents about their wards' progress which is making them wake up and pay attention to their children,"" Ranjan said.

Elated by the difference made to the children, Ranjan said, ""We are participating with the government at every step in this short-term intervention. Many a times, there are teachers who are not so welcoming of our master trainers who are young men and women between the ages of 20-25, but the difference made in the learning process of these children is reassuring and encourages us to do better.""

Explaining the Teaching at Right Level (TARL) methodology of Pratham, Jagadish, a programme coordinator for Pratham, said, ""Our methodology focuses on teaching students based on their levels by giving them individual attention. Some children will not be able to identify letters, some won't be able to read words and some others won't be able to read sentences. We identify such problems and help them overcome those problems. There are many dedicated teachers who put in a lot of effort to help these children overcome their learning difficulties.""

After grouping the children by classifying them as 'letter level', 'word level', and 'sentence level', a semicircle is formed and the teacher sits down on the floor to impart lessons which boosts one-to-one relationship, added Jagadish.

Pointing to the pivotal role played by Teaching Learning Materials (TLM) of Pratham, Rachaiah, a member of the State Resource Group (SRG) who teaches mathematics, said, ""We adopt the touch and learn method which makes learning not only easy, but also fun. To teach mathematics, we use straws, coins, and currency notes when we have to teach them simple addition, subtraction, division or multiplication.""

Crediting the method adopted by Pratham for improving soft skills of the children, he said, ""Along with learning, the speaking skills of the children also saw a huge improvement.""","Govt-NGO partnership sees improvement in quality of education in primary schools - Times of India","930865400","2018-08-24","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/govt-ngo-partnership-sees-improvement-in-quality-of-education-in-primary-schools/articleshow/65520574.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"1346","","Modern higher education in India had its genesis in colleges as they predated universities at least by half a century. They also outnumbered universities since their inception, but post-Independence they have grown rather too rapidly to become dominant players in the higher education. As per MHRD's All India Survey of Higher Education (AISHE) data, while the number of universities in the country increased from 27 in 1950 to 903 in 2017-18, recording a growth of 32 times, the number of colleges during the corresponding period soared 67 times from 578 to 39,050. Critically, over 78 per cent of the total number of teachers in higher education are employed in the collegiate sector.

Ubiquitously, improving the overall quality of higher education shall remain a distant dream unless the initiatives and measures in this regard pay focussed attention on colleges. The fact that over 60 per cent of the colleges in the country are located in rural areas, catering mostly to the deprived and marginalised sections of the society, makes it imperative for policy planners to focus their attention on colleges. Since an overwhelming number of the colleges are affiliated to public-funded state universities, the onus of reforms for improving quality and promoting excellence in colleges fall in the domain of the state governments. However, the Union government, which is constitutionally charged with the responsibility of coordination and maintenance of standards in higher education, has to play a critical role through policy intervention and regulation.

Fortunately for the policy planners and regulators, the MHRD's AISHE has been providing data on the number, size and growth of colleges consistently since 2006-07 and the same are also timely released. So, the summary data for 2017-18 is already available in public domain. A quick diagnostic run of the available data as obtained for the years 2007-08 to 2017-18 throws up major deficiencies in the collegiate system of higher education in the country, crying for structural reforms in the sector.

The problem of large numbers of colleges affiliated to a single university seems to have been gradually addressed; 161 of the 285 universities affiliating colleges now have less than 100 colleges affiliated to them and the same has been achieved by establishing new universities and also by bifurcating or trifurcating existing universities. There are now only 15 universities that have more than 500 colleges affiliated to them and it seems that most states are now proactively working to lessen their affiliating burden.

Quite a few major problems, however, still continue to persist, thus calling for urgent action. The first is the problem of single-discipline colleges which constitute over a third of the total number of colleges in the country. For these colleges, curricular reforms like Choice-Based Credit System (CBCS), which is being prescribed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) as a necessary measure to improve quality in higher education is a near impossibility.

Secondly, the collegiate system of higher education in the country is characterised by a very large number of small-sized institutions. Data reveals that nearly a fifth of the colleges have less than a hundred students on their roll and only less than 4 per cent of them have over 3,000 students. Small-sized colleges suffer from the same deficiencies as those pointed out in case of single-discipline colleges. Additionally, they also lack adequate and suitable infrastructure and suffer from the lack of academic viability and economies of scale.

Thirdly, the student-teacher ratio in the colleges at over 30 is way too high. Technological advancements in teaching-learning notwithstanding, teachers play a critical role in imparting quality higher education. It is also proven that institutions catering to largely first-generation learners drawn from the poorer and marginalised sections of society need to invest more in teachers and teaching-learning resources as these students require far more focussed attention to overcome what their families are unable to provide for.

Finally, the number of colleges in the country have been rising too rapidly. The expansion is largely driven by private initiatives and the number of government and government-aided colleges have been declining in proportion. Even though there have been some consolidation lately, leading to closure and winding up of colleges, we are still seeing on an average 3 to 4 colleges being established every day. Such a growth is neither desirable nor viable academically and economically. While new colleges are still needed to mitigate regional disparities and widen equitable access, the time has come to focus on qualitative expansion and consolidation.","Colleges hold the key to improving quality in higher education","930172908","2018-08-23","https://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-colleges-hold-the-key-to-improving-quality-in-higher-education-2653364","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE

Tribal students have appealed to the Centre to ensure ""quality education"" and proper facilities, including schools and hostels, for those belonging to scheduled tribes and said that reservation in government institutions and jobs alone is not the solution to their problems. They also urged the central government to formulate policies on the ""basis of ground realities"" for the welfare of tribal children.

Tribal students from across the country participated in a convention organised by the Adivasi Adhikar Manch and the Centre for Adivasi Research and Development here on Saturday to highlight their issues. ""Please tell the government that we are not getting a quality education. There are no schools in some tribal areas. Even if there are, there are no teachers. At some places, tribal students have to travel miles to reach school. ""We need more hostels and good facilities. The government talks about reservation (in jobs), but what will we do if we do not get a proper education?"" asked Sunil Tirki from Jharkhand.

Tribal students, who had come from faraway villages of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Tripura, and other states, also complained about poor hostel facilities at residential government schools. They said that hostels do not have proper drinking water and toilet facilities. At some places, there are no ceiling fans. So, the students sleep in the open during summers.

""Sometimes, we have to fetch water from nearby wells. Very often students fall sick and return home, as there are no proper medical facilities available for us,"" Lata Soren, a tribal student from Chattisgarh, said. The organisers claimed that because of the ""flawed"" policy framework of the government which is detached from the ground reality, ""Adivasi children cannot sustain their education"".

""The Centre is cutting down on the number of schools based on the number of students attending the classes. Now, in tribal areas, this is proving to be disastrous. Because of the geographical locations of these areas, one cannot hope that Adivasi children will sustain their education without a decentralized approach. ""That's why compared to other children, the dropout rate among tribal students is higher. If the government wants to bridge this gap, then it needs a different policy framework,"" Brinda Karat, CPI(M) leader and member of the Adivasi Adhikar Rashtriya Manch, says. The students' parents, who also attended the convention, said that there are many villages which do not have schools.

""I want my two children to study, but there are no schools. If they want to go to school, they need to travel miles through forests. It is unsafe. Why cannot schools be built near our villages?"" asks 25-year-old Phula Bai, who belongs to the Bhil tribe of Rajasthan. According to a recent survey conducted by the Adivasi Adhikar Manch and the Centre for Adivasi Research and Development, some tribal areas have recorded an increase in the dropout rate among girl students, as not many parents feel safe to send their daughters to the schools far-off.

""My school is very far from my village. It takes more than two hours to reach there. I am able to continue with my studies because my brother accompanies me. But there are many in my class who have stopped coming to school as they are scared to travel alone and they do not have money to pay for the transport. There is no hostel for girls,"" said Varsha Sihem, a class 8 tribal student from Madhya Pradesh.

"1349","","Tribal students have appealed to the Centre to ensure ""quality education"" and proper facilities, including schools and hostels, for those belonging to scheduled tribes and said that reservation in government institutions and jobs alone is not the solution to their problems.

They also urged the central government to formulate policies on the ""basis of ground realities"" for the welfare of tribal children.

Tribal students from across the country participated in a convention organised by the Adivasi Adhikar Manch and the Centre for Adivasi Research and Development here on Saturday to highlight their issues.

""Please tell the government that we are not getting a quality education. There are no schools in some tribal areas. Even if there are, there are no teachers. At some places, tribal students have to travel miles to reach school.

""We need more hostels and good facilities. The government talks about reservation (in jobs), but what will we do if we do not get a proper education?"" asked Sunil Tirki from Jharkhand.

Tribal students, who had come from faraway villages of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Tripura, and other states, also complained about poor hostel facilities at residential government schools.

They said that hostels do not have proper drinking water and toilet facilities. At some places, there are no ceiling fans. So, the students sleep in the open during summers.

""Sometimes, we have to fetch water from nearby wells. Very often students fall sick and return home, as there are no proper medical facilities available for us,"" Lata Soren, a tribal student from Chattisgarh, said.

The organisers claimed that because of the ""flawed"" policy framework of the government which is detached from the ground reality, ""Adivasi children cannot sustain their education"".

""The Centre is cutting down on the number of schools based on the number of students attending the classes. Now, in tribal areas, this is proving to be disastrous. Because of the geographical locations of these areas, one cannot hope that Adivasi children will sustain their education without a decentralized approach.

""That's why compared to other children, the dropout rate among tribal students is higher. If the government wants to bridge this gap, then it needs a different policy framework,"" Brinda Karat, CPI(M) leader and member of the Adivasi Adhikar Rashtriya Manch, says.

The students' parents, who also attended the convention, said that there are many villages which do not have schools.

""I want my two children to study, but there are no schools. If they want to go to school, they need to travel miles through forests. It is unsafe. Why cannot schools be built near our villages?"" asks 25-year-old Phula Bai, who belongs to the Bhil tribe of Rajasthan.

According to a recent survey conducted by the Adivasi Adhikar Manch and the Centre for Adivasi Research and Development, some tribal areas have recorded an increase in the dropout rate among girl students, as not many parents feel safe to send their daughters to the schools far-off.

""My school is very far from my village. It takes more than two hours to reach there. I am able to continue with my studies because my brother accompanies me. But there are many in my class who have stopped coming to school as they are scared to travel alone and they do not have money to pay for the transport. There is no hostel for girls,"" said Varsha Sihem, a class 8 tribal student from Madhya Pradesh.

Consequently innumerable prospective teachers hurriedly enrolled themselves in the last part of the month of Sept. 2017 through internet for the said course of two years duration under the guidance and supervision of National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS)

The implementation of D.EI.ED course may sound excellent in theory but it may not be so much in practise.

"1353","","Prime Minister Narendra Modi today pitched for improving the quality of education in institutions like IITs and invited suggestions from teachers and intellectuals in this regard.

He also stressed the need for innovation, saying that societies which do not innovate, stagnate.

Addressing the 56th annual convocation of IIT-Bombay today, Modi announced a financial aid of Rs 1,000 crore for the institute, saying that six decades of ""constant trying"" had made it an institute of eminence.

He said seven lakh engineers pass out of the country's educational campuses, and a collective effort was required to ensure they get high quality of education and acquire necessary skills.

""I appeal to teachers and intellectuals present here that they should think about how quality can be improved and come up with suggestions. It is our responsibility to ensure that not only quantity but quality too is of high level. The government is also actively taking steps for this,"" Modi said.

Heaping praise on IIT-B, Modi said, ""It is due to last six decades of constant trying that IIT-B has made its place as one of the country's eminent institutes. You will be receiving a financial aid of Rs 1,000 crore which will help in the development of infrastructure.""

The prime minister said several students who have graduated from the institute are actively participating in the country's development.

Modi said that in the last four years, seven IITs, seven IIMs (Indian Institute of Management), two IISER (Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research) and 11 IIITs (Indian Institute of Information Technology) have been approved.

""In order to improve infrastructure, RISE (Revitalisation of Infrastructure and Systems in Education) programme has been initiated. In accordance with this programme, a target of accumulating Rs 1 lakh crore has been set.

""New institutes, new infrastructure is necessary, but more important is the skilled power generated from these. The government is also focusing on this,"" he said.

The prime minister further said the foundation of India's developed economy was being laid through innovation and industries which will lead to sustainable long-term financial growth based on technology.

""Innovation and enterprise are going to be the foundation stones for making India a developed economy. Start Up India and the Atal Innovation Mission launched by the Centre have resulted in India becoming the world's second largest ecosystem for technology,"" the prime minister said.

In the coming two decades, innovation and new technology will decide the trajectory of growth in the world and the role of IITs in this will be very important, he said.

""Be it 5G broadband technology, artificial intelligence, block chain technology or machine learning, these are techniques that will play an important role in the vision of smart cities,"" Modi said.

Maharashtra governor C Vidyasagar Rao, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Union Human Resources Development Minister Prakash Javadekar were present at the event.

India's manufacturing activity moderated in July, 2018, amid a softer increase in output, new orders and employment, according to a monthly survey that polls factory managers. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) stood at 52.3 in July, down from 53.1 in June.

Although softening slightly since June, both domestic and export orders rose for the ninth consecutive month in July. And Reflecting sustained periods of growth in output and new orders, firms were encouraged to raise their staffing levels for the fourth successive month in July, the survey added.

"1530","","DeVos has been a critic of the Obama-era policy that erased debt for those who attended shuttered schools that violated the law or misled students.

The Department of Education will cancel $150 million in student loans after losing a court battle against an Obama-era borrower defense relief program that allowed people a chance to seek debt forgiveness if their schools shut down and violated the law or misled students. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been highly critical of the program, which she described in the past as giving students ""free money.""

In a statement, the Department said it has identified nearly 15,000 borrowers who are eligible to have their debt forgiven based on their attendance at a school that closed between November 1, 2013, and December 4, 2018. Around half of these borrowers, the Department said, had attended Corinthian Colleges, Inc. - a for-profit education company that shut down in April 2015.

DeVos, who in May effectively killed a government team that investigated for-profit colleges, wanted to see the borrower relief program terminated. Democrats took her to court after she announced in June 2017 that she would pause the program.

After the loan cancellation was announced, Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said, ""this is a good first step, but it's not good enough.""

""It's disappointing that it took a court order to get Secretary DeVos to begin providing debt relief to students left in the lurch by predatory for-profit colleges, but I am pleased the Department has finally started implementing this rule,"" Murray said in a statement.

However, Titus said the news reports were false and misleading.

She cited Section 3 (6) of the KTU Act which states the varsity's headquarters should be located in Thiruvananthapuram.

Justice Sidhharth Mridul asked the senior bureaucrat to appear and explain why he failed to abide with court direction to file an affidavit on status of funds available with government for schools.

It didn't help that Sisodia too put on record that his secretary is ""reluctant to file the counter-affidavit on some misdirected approach"", despite clear instructions. Taking note of this dissonance, HC issued the summons, though making it clear it is for failure to abide by court's directions and not Sisodia's orders that it wants an explanation.

HC had last month asked Centre to clarify why it has not yet disbursed its entire share of money to the Delhi government for improving infrastructure, while asking Delhi's education secretary to apprise it of the status of finances allocated for schools.

However, in his affidavit, Sisodia alleged that despite instructions the secretary hasn't agreed to file an affidavit, which is why he is outlining the status on allocation and disbursement of Centre and Delhi government's respective shares in relation to provision of funds for creating the educational infrastructure for the year 2018-2019.

Sisodia told court that as per budget approved by legislative assembly, LG and Centre, Rs 3,500 crores has been allocated for education department for 2018-19. Out of that, Rs 2,100 crore earmarked by the Centre for improving Delhi government schools as per 60:40 ratio. The Delhi government said it has till now been allocated only about Rs 258 crores from the overall corpus by Centre.

HC is hearing a batch of petitions filed by children from various government-run schools complaining about the absence of infrastructure and violation of their Right to Education. On behalf of the students', advocate Khagesh Jha submitted that some of them are forced to study in schools that run in shifts as the building can't accommodate children of the locality in single shift.

Jha argued that Delhi government had earlier assured it will construct 1,200 classrooms and 30 new schools in the current financial year, ""but the process is slow due to non-disbursement of funds by the Centre.""","Education secretary summoned for not filing fund info - Times of India","956584977","2018-09-28","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/edu-secy-summoned-for-not-filing-fund-info/articleshow/65986499.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

Since 2013, we are working to make it a smart school and better than private schools. At least Rs 27 lakh were spent by NRIs and other donors to revamp the school building, make smart classrooms, install computers, education park and library. It wasn't an option to keep quiet and let NHAI raze our school. I had no other place to make 102 children sit , that too, after seeing a model school being razed.

Goa's director of accounts, in a notification issued on Tuesday, said none of the candidates who appeared for the initial recruitment examination held on 7 January secured the minimum qualifying marks required to get through.

The successful candidates were supposed to go through a round of oral interview before the final selection. Aam Aadmi Party's Goa general secretary Pradeep Padgaonkar criticised the delay in announcement of results and said the failure of all 8,000 candidates is a sad commentary on the ""collapse"" of the state's education system.

"1543","","The White House has dismissed Manigault Newman's memoir as the product of a ""disgruntled"" former employee and said it's ""riddled with lies.""

Former White House adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman claims in her new book, ""Unhinged,"" that President Donald Trump once referred to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos as ""Ditzy DeVos"" and said he would soon ""get rid of her.""

This allegedly occurred after a disastrous visit to Howard University in May 2017, in which DeVos was protested and booed by the student body. Manigault Newman, who studied at Howard, joined DeVos on her trip to the campus and said it was ""painful to experience.""Manigault Newman also accompanied DeVos the following day for an event in Florida, but was apparently ditched at the hotel by DeVos's motorcade.

The former White House adviser claims DeVos called and told her to take an Uber to the event, but she was livid and opted to take one to the airport instead.

Manigault Newman wrote, ""We'd been booed by the entire auditorium. People were angry. There were protesters. I'd been getting death threats daily. And she'd left me completely alone with no security?""

After she returned and gave the president a summary of what transpired, Manigault Newman claims Trump ""shook his head in disgust"" and suggested he would fire DeVos in the near future.

""[Trump] said, 'She is Ditzy DeVos, what do you expect? In a very short period of time, I will get rid of her. Believe me, believe me,'"" Manigault Newman wrote.

In a rare move, the UT education department has served show cause notices, suspension and even termination notices to teachers due to poor Class X CBSE results in government schools. Teachers retaliated by staging protests against the ""unfair"" action and criticised the no-detention policy under the Right to Education Act and the Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation system.

With another year left for his tenure to get over, Education Secretary BL Sharma talks to Indian Express to explain why teachers should be more responsible and how the system can be strengthened from the inside.

Teachers have been up in arms against the education department of late for serving show cause notice, suspension and termination notices. Do you think it is feasible for this dissatisfaction to breed? After all, teachers directly deal with students.

Instead of looking inward and resolving to perform better, teachers are spouting absurdities. Their stand is illegal, immoral and harmful for the future of the students. A large number of teachers have failed miserably and because we took a symbolic action against poor performance, they are ready to spoil students' career.

This is a crucial year as the students who have been promoted to Class 9 have studied eight years under the Right to Education Act. They have never failed an exam before. What measures is the department going to take to improve the results in government schools?

We will be taking up a number of issues in the next 5 to 10 days, starting from rationalisation of manpower in schools. We have recently deployed 15 principals and heads where they were needed. We will put a full stop to the grace marks policy. Those teachers whose performance is not up to the mark are already holding remedial classes for students who have failed to clear the exam. I have strictly told principals and heads that they should perform and lead from the front. If a teacher is not performing well, then that should reflect in their ACR. We have also requested the State Council of Educational Research and Training to hold training sessions for subjects in which students have performed poorly.

Teachers have alleged that they were forced by the district education department to give grace marks to promote students to Class 10 as a ""one-time"" chance. Will there be any monitoring within the department to keep a check on the promotion of such practices?

If need be, we will transfer department officials who are not performing up to the mark. I have told my people too that they have to bear the responsibility as they are the link between the schools and the government. I will ensure performance-based action and keep officials on their toes.

Teachers have also blamed policies such as no-detention and CCE.

I agree that the no-detention policy is unhealthy and the government, I think, is making some amendments to that. But it cannot be an excuse for teachers who have performed poorly. There are those who have performed exceedingly well too, including teachers, in some periphery schools.

What are the landmark achievements in education policies that have benefited teachers and students in the last decade?

In my time, I sat on mats and walked 6 km to school daily. Our schools did not have free lunches or proper toilets. But our teachers were excellent. Things have changed for the better now. Policies such as the mid-day meal and free education have opened up new avenues. Focus on student-teacher ratio, scientific methods of teaching and holistic development have brought a revolutionary change even in areas where resources are limited.

You have another year to go. How has your experience been so far?

Teachers get handsome salaries compared to other states and UTs. The transport and civic facilities in school are excellent. We have some brilliant principals, heads and teachers too and a lot of talent among the students. But the only issue is of monitoring that we will take up to the best of our ability. Students will be tested internally and they will be trained to appear for the board examination. I also feel that students should work hard because nothing is insurmountable. With regular testing, they will be sensitised with how to appear for these exams. We will arrange for talks and seminars to motivate them","Chandigarh government schools have one of the best infrastructure in the country, says Education Secretary BL Sharma","906272803","2018-07-16","https://indianexpress.com/article/education/chandigarh-government-schools-have-one-of-the-best-infrastructure-in-the-country-says-education-secretary-bl-sharma-5261409/","The Indian Express",FALSE

UT Education Secretary B L Sharma demanded at least 75 per cent results in Classes X and XII from all the principals and school heads at a meeting on Thursday afternoon.

At the meeting, he ""admonished"" some for behaving like ""unionists"". Teachers of government schools in the city have been up in arms against the department for issuing termination, suspension and show cause notices for poor Class X CBSE results.

""A couple of people were admonished for being unionists. Unions are for labourers; principals and heads are at the level of officers. So, why are they behaving this way? For the system to improve, they too have to contribute and achieve certain targets,"" said Sharma. He added that heads were appointed to manage and improve their institutions and mobilise their resources.

Sources said the meeting went on for two hours and the department officials also congratulated those who had performed well.

They, however, claimed that officiating principals, in-charges and vice-principals were not invited to the meeting. A number of schools are functioning with them at managerial positions.

""I congratulated and praised people who have performed well. Some principals and heads have got above 90 per cent results, but below 60 per cent there were too many,"" further stated the education secretary.

People who have performed miserably need to be admonished, he added, and there was no point in raising such a hue and cry by those who have not done their job.

The department is planning to bring about structural and administrative changes, too. Teams consisting of principals have been formed to monitor schools at the ground level so that the deficiencies are clear. The principals of Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS), Sector 46, GMSSS-10, 16, 18, 20B, 22, 27C, 33, 35, 37D, Dhanas, Khuda Ali Sher, and MHC Manimajra are members of these teams.

As for the show cause notices, Sharma said he could not do everything at once even though teachers, principals and heads should face some punishment.

""Teachers should be aware of the consequences; in the private sector, they would have been laid off overnight for poor performance. The number of poor performers is huge. The show cause notices will remain for now, but there will be no penalty as the idea is to reform,"" he added.

On July 10, the department held a press conference where it highlighted the poor Class X CBSE results and the teachers' protests against termination, suspension and show cause notices.","Education Secretary to school heads: Want at least 75 per cent results","904705796","2018-07-13","https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/education-secretary-to-school-heads-want-at-least-75-per-cent-results-5257561/","The Indian Express",FALSE

TEACHERS GET good salaries and all the benefits of a government job; the least they could do is teach instead of sloganeering, said Education Secretary B L Sharma. On Tuesday, officials of the UT education department held a press conference where they highlighted the poor Class 10 CBSE results and teachers' protests against termination, suspension and show-cause notices.

In the coming weeks, however, the UT education department will hold meetings with principals, school heads and teachers to come up with solutions to improve board examination results.

""How can we explain such poor results in a city like Chandigarh that has all the comfort, great infrastructure in the schools? Is a pass percentage below 50 per cent acceptable?"" asked Sharma. The department shared information on the ""disciplinary"" action taken against principals, school heads and teachers. One principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS), Karsan, was suspended for less than 20 per cent result in Class 12.

In Class 10, four school heads were suspended for less than 20 per cent. Show-cause notices were served to 26 school heads and three in-charges were transferred to periphery schools as ""punishment"" for less than 20 per cent result.

Show-cause notices were also served to 60 teachers who have recorded less than 33 per cent result. While two Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) teachers were served one-month termination notice, one contract teacher was terminated and another regular teacher suspended for less than 15 per cent result.

""If the government wants, it can take away all the departments from me. I am ready to suspend my own officials, but who's going to take stock of teachers' responsibility? Show-cause notices are just a means to get an explanation from them,"" said Sharma.

Sharma also criticised his own department for following ""wrong practices"" in the past. He added that despite a commendable performance in the National Achievement Survey, Chandigarh has been left behind in the board examination.

""I am strictly against grace marks and I have briefed my department officials that such practices will not be followed in future. Had I been aware of it, I would have done something. In an age where students are getting above 95 per cent, grace marks do not make sense,"" he said.

The Education Secretary added that the department was taking corrective measures to change the system. He said Chandigarh was a city of ""sifaarish"" and policies such as transfer, promotion and seniority were stagnating here.

""I am not at all in favour of permanent employment at one place. We will be looking into transfers with those who have stayed the longest at one place to be moved first. I made the draft seniority list that had been pending since 1990, but not a single person was finalised because even the criteria is disputed,"" he added.","Teachers should teach instead of sloganeering: Education secretary","903214484","2018-07-11","https://indianexpress.com/article/education/teachers-should-teach-instead-of-sloganeering-education-secretary-5254416/","The Indian Express",FALSE

"1548","","Top US lawmakers have urged education secretary to launch an investigation into possible attempts by Chinese state-directed Huawei Technologies' partnerships with more than 50 top American universities that may pose a significant threat to national security and can steal research and technology from them.

The letter from both House and Senate members including Senator Marco Rubio, says Huawei's partnerships with more than 50 US universities ""threatens national security.""

""China is using Huawei to position themselves to steal American research through so-called 'research partnerships' with American universities to exploit the openness of our system of higher education,"" Rubio said.

Huawei and other Chinese state-directed telecommunications companies should not be allowed to operate in the United States. ""We should put them out of business by denying them the ability to buy US semi-conductors,"" he demanded.

Rubio along with Congressman Jim Banks raised several concerns with DeVos on Chinese state-directed Huawei Technologies' partnerships with US universities that may pose a significant threat to national security.

""Our intelligence community has warned about this exact type of national security threat for over a decade. Huawei is a state-directed entity that uses academic surveillance to spy and collect intelligence on America and our allies,"" Banks said.

""Make no mistake, Huawei cannot be trusted and the Department of Education should work closely with the FBI to address China's attempts to infiltrate America's intellectual institutions,"" Banks said.

In their letter to DeVos, the two lawmakers said that Huawei Technologies, a ""national champion"" of the China, has formed a series of research partnerships with over 50 universities in the United States that threaten national security.

The US intelligence community has warned for years of Huawei's links to the Chinese government and the People's Liberation Army. Huawei benefits from extensive government support, which has fueled long-standing concern that the company's equipment in the US could be used by the Chinese government for spying, cyberattacks or industrial and economic espionage.

""As Huawei describes it, the Huawei Innovation Research Programme (HIRP) provides funding opportunities to leading universities and research institutes conducting innovative research in communication technology, computer sciences, engineering, and related fields.""

Recently Christopher Wray, FBI Director, said he was ""deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don't share our values to gain positions of power...it provides the capacity to conduct undetected espionage.""

Admiral Mike Rogers, then Director of the National Security Agency and Commander of United States Cyber Command, added that Government programmes need ""to look long and hard at companies like this.""

""We urge that you promptly request a complete and classified briefing by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence on Huawei and Chinese technology acquisition modalities in general (as the technology transfer problem set is bigger than Huawei),"" Rubio and Banks said.

Today, President Donald Trump met with Republican lawmakers after the Senate moved to block a White House plan to allow Chinese telecom giant ZTE Corp. to buy component parts from the US.

ZTE is accused of violating trade laws by selling sensitive technologies to North Korea and Iran. The administration announced an agreement with ZTE earlier this month but has run into opposition in Congress.

Rubio and Banks believe that both ZTE and Huawei as virtual arms of the Chinese government's overall economic aggression strategy should be banned from buying US technology components, even if that means they go out of business.","US lawmakers urge education secretary to probe Chinese spying at American universities","891256652","2018-06-21","https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/us-lawmakers-urge-education-secretary-to-probe-chinese-spying-at-american-universities-118062100327_1.html","Business Standard",FALSE

He must come forward and explain all that has gone wrong under his leadership even as his terms ends

The term of Anil Swarup, School Education Secretary, Government of India, is drawing to a close. We wish him all the very best in his next undertaking. However, at this juncture, one needs to revisit the highlights of his inglorious term which saw an incessant flow of fiascos in the school examinations, assessments and entrance examinations conducted by the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE). It is also disconcerting that the CBSE, which is meant to be an autonomous body, is increasingly becoming an extended arm of the Union Human Resources Development Ministry (MHRD).

No Discussions On New Education Policy; No Data On Achievement Survey

With much fanfare, in February 2018, Swarup announced that the National Council for Education Research and Training (NCERT) had conducted the largest National Achievement Survey (NAS) at the Class X level. This is a nationwide test to assess academic standards. One has not seen any public data or statistics from this assessment, well after over four months. It needs to be kept in mind that such surveys are conducted using taxpayer money, and it is bizarre that those conducting it did not find it worthwhile to release any detailed statistics into the public domain. There have been a few newspaper articles about some of the findings, but this is extremely sparse data. This kind of information needs to go directly to the public, instead of a few handpicked journalists.

Data was released for the NAS at the Class V and Class VIII levels. However, the analysis presented in the form of district- and state-wise report cards, was shoddy and did not offer any insight into how abilities differed by basic factors such as the examination board, which the school was affiliated to. A better route would have been to upload anonymised and bucketed data, without the school name (but including other details such as the board which the school was affiliated to, fee range and zip code among others). That way, the data would have benefitted from the eyeballs of statisticians and data analysts, who would have been able to glean out invaluable patterns and trends, in a manner which is perhaps too ambitious to expect from ill-equipped generalists employed as National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and HRD officers.

Most worrisome is that there has been no concrete discussion around the New Education Policy (NEP) after the first draft of the NEP was scrapped in 2016. For a country with precious little beyond human capital, one hopes to see a greater sense of urgency around the NEP.

The Entrance Exam Debacle: JEE-Mains And NEET (2018)

The CBSE management should have been taken to task when it emerged that several questions in the JEE Mains (2018) question paper were very similar to those of a mock test conducted by the Narayana coaching chain in 2016. It raises serious questions about the paper setting process of the board and the originality of the questions. The board reacted by filing a case against the whistleblower website which first made this startling revelation, but this claim has also been validated by others, including Narayana students, as is evident in this Quora thread. A Narayana spokesperson did explain that the questions were common and similar to those asked in a practice test conducted by their chain in 2016.

Another Narayana head, speaking to 360, called the incident ""cheating"" by the CBSE board which had lifted Narayana's intellectual property. We don't know what exactly happened, but the public deserves a swift and conclusive explanation or investigation into such issues. If the questions did match, one plausible explanation is that questions were picked up from a common source or a popular book. That in itself should be a red flag, indicating academically unsound practices within the board.

National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) was eventful, once again, with several errors in the Tamil translation of the question paper. The same was the case with the Bengali version of the paper.

This is an extreme case of academic injustice given the amount of preparation which goes into these examinations.

Dismal Handling Of CBSE's Paper Leakage

The CBSE economics re-examination for Class XII was more of a face-saving exercise for the board. Well before the economics examination, the accountancy paper made headlines as it emerged that questions from the paper had circulated on social media, before the examination. CBSE was also aware of surreptitious attempts being made to gain illegitimate access to question papers and had warned examination centre-heads, to take precautions against the same, as early as 4 March.

While it is understandable that the possibility of a leak is not negligible in a country as large as ours, neither Swarup nor Anita Karwal, CBSE chairperson, were apologetic enough to offer the public clear insights into the origin of the leaked papers. Instead, Swarup interrupted and silenced a well respected educator, who was bold enough to broach the topic of the paper leaks at a recent conference in Kolkata. Till now, there has been no transparent explanation by the board, to inform the public about the findings from the investigations into the paper leaks. The dust has practically settled on the issue because we have almost forgotten the episode.

News 18 clearly showed their journalist standing outside a CBSE examination centre with printouts of a handwritten set of questions from the biology question paper (from her WhatsApp messages), before the examination even started. When the biology paper was over, it turned out that the questions matched with those which were in the journalist's possession. The board was informed, but they refused to engage on the matter. The leak of the biology paper was never discussed. Cases of paper leaks and cheating need to be taken with utmost seriousness because it destroys the faith of young and honest students in the country's institutions and systems.

Much Ado Over The Spiking Of Marks

Boards are trapped in a vicious spiral of inflating marks, largely because central universities such as Delhi University follow a bizarre admission process where 97 per cent in the Indian School Certificate Examinations (ICSE) board loses out to 98 per cent in Tamil Nadu board, but wins over 96 per cent in Uttar Pradesh board. It does not seem to appear irrational to any of those in power, that these are scores in different examinations, with different syllabi, and different standards of strictness in marking. Marksheets of Indian boards also fail at offering any insight into the relative standing of candidates. There is no indication of the percentile ranking of a student in the subjects for which he/she took the examination.

The specific issue with CBSE's result is that not only do they inflate scores, but data also indicates that they also favour specific zones such as Delhi and Chennai, and selectively inflate their scores more than others. In addition, they grossly distort the relative ordering, by pushing up everyone within a range of five to 15 marks, to exactly the same score of 95 in various subjects. This creates a spike at the 95 level in CBSE histograms for various subjects because students who actually scored marks as different as 86, 87, 88 and 94 have all been bumped up to 95. These histograms are becoming old now, but for those new to this controversy, this is the kind of inexplicable score distribution observed in many CBSE subjects, the most common characteristic being the astounding spike at 9

A histogram that shows the standard deviation in Math scores

Swarup presided over several meetings and discussions where he convinced several boards such as state boards to stop this artificial inflation of marks. The discussions were vague and lacked the level of statistical detail required in any deliberation over academic assessments. Many states such as Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka have indeed seen a drop rate in their pass percentage and scores, which indicates that they have made some attempt to deliver on their promise to stop inflating marks.

However, after all this, the CBSE itself has not delivered on its promise, in both 2017 and 2018. It has continued to tamper and falsify its scores, with the 95 spike still as prominent as ever. One cannot help wondering whether the fuss made about moderation was less of a systemic reform and primarily to get the state boards to reduce their scores, as there has been much hue and cry about students from southern state boards grabbing a disproportionate churn of coveted seats in Delhi University. It is passing extraordinary that after so much debate and discussion, the board, which functions right under the nose of the MHRD, has once again brazenly tampered with and manipulated its result, without as much as a comment from the School Secretary. This makes us wonder if there was any genuine concern about the academic consequences of grade inflation, or whether the brouhaha about spiking was primarily to get boards other than CBSE to stop inflating scores, to facilitate the smooth sailing of Delhi students into Delhi University.

ISCE has barely 10 per cent of its students scoring 90 and above in mathematics this year, while CBSE has 12.5 per cent of all its passed candidates scoring 95 or more. Similar trends are observed in physics and chemistry as well. These kind of variations penalise boards with rigorous standards of assessment, such as those of Maharashtra and West Bengal.

CBSE has again gone scot-free, without offering any insight into how their scores are transformed, despite strict instructions from a toothless MHRD to all boards, emphasising that they need to be transparent and should upload all details about how marks are changed, before releasing results.

One Set Of Rules For Delhi, Another For The Rest

What is also more serious is that CBSE follows one set of rules for Delhi students, and another set for the rest of the country. The histogram suggests that they inflate everyone's marks, but clear attempts are made to push more Delhi/NCR zone students into the high scoring band above 90. Notice the different shapes of the histograms for Delhi students and non-Delhi students. The latter resembles a distorted bell curve, slightly ajar, whereas the former bears no resemblance to the kind of distribution one would expect for test scores from a public examination. Even last year, the Indian Express had covered how the English scores were rigged to favour Delhi zone. Half of all the 95s in English Core were from Delhi in the 2017 examination.

Observe this 2016 table accessed by the Times of India. In most subjects, Delhi zone students received moderation marks, which were slightly less than the rest of the country, but in English they were bumped up by as much as 12 marks, while the rest of the country received none at all. For most of the popular subject combinations, such as English, physics, chemistry, maths and computers/economics, this kind of an inflation scheme will ensure that a student of Delhi scores at least five marks higher than a student from another zone, submitting exactly the same quality of answer scripts. This of course was before Swarup took over, but the 2017 data revealed similar anomalies in the English marks.

I think we can all agree that the Delhi University admission process is flawed and unreasonable, but it is reprehensible to address one wrong with another wrong (arbitrary manipulation of marks), when the latter destroys whatever semblance of meritocracy is left in the Indian board exams.

Swarup has rightfully made much ado about India's education mafia but in the absence of clear explanations and apologies about CBSE's paper leaks and anomalous assessment, it is hard to distinguish his accomplishments from the contributions of those whom he flays.","The School Education Secretary Has A Lot To Answer For","889390053","2018-06-18","https://swarajyamag.com/current-affairs/the-school-education-secretary-has-a-lot-to-answer-for","swarajyamag.com",FALSE

Union School Education Secretary Anil Swarup on Tuesday said the central government would set up pre-school educational units and the NCERT was preparing a curriculum for them.

""There is a preparatory work to be done before a child enters into class one. We are studying how pre-school will work in the government domain. What approach needs to be taken,"" Swarup said.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) was coming out with a curriculum in this regard by this year, he told reporters on the sidelines of a session on pre-school policy organised by the ASSOCHAM.

Swarup said the HRD ministry will come out with a guideline by June 30 relating to the Central government's financial assistance to the proposed pre-school units to be set up by the school education department.

Asked about the role of pre-schools set up by private bodies, he said the ""private sector is doing a great job and can give us ideas. Personally I believe that good work can be done in both private and public domains.""

With the 'Samagra Shiksha' programme launched last month, ""we plan to impart holistic education without segmentation from pre-nursery to Class 12,"" he said.

With 'Samagra Shiksha' coming into effect, the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan will cease to exist separately and merge with it, he said.

""We expect support from state governments for rolling out the scheme effectively,"" Swarup said.

On a question about corporal punishment, Swarup said, ""Handling a child should be different from handling an adult.""","Centre to set up pre-school educational units: Union school education secretary Anil Swarup ","882018116","2018-06-06","https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/centre-to-set-up-pre-school-educational-units-union-school-education-secretary-anil-swarup/story-vkbXuNkvvsUx4LNiYDnItL.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

Union school education secretary Anil Swarup on Monday said that the department will use advanced technology to conduct CBSE examinations next year to check question paper leaks.

""The Secretary of Education has appointed a committee to explore how technology can be used to prevent any recurrence of such a situation. Today, technology allows us to improve that situation. And we have to see that it is not repeated, keeping in mind that there are smarter people. From next year, it will be our endeavour to ensure that there is no such leak,"" Swarup said in response to a query after an interactive session - 'Robust, just, reliable and student-friendly public examination system' - organised by the Merchants' Chamber of Commerce (MCC).

In March this year, the CBSE received widespread criticism following the Class XII economics question paper leak.

The Union school education secretary also made it clear that no CBSE official was involved in the leak and said that it was perpetrated by a handful of tech-savvy people. ""We get hundreds of mails and if our official gets a mail at 10:15 am about a leak, you cannot stop the examination to be held at 4,000 centres and inconvenience 11 lakh children,"" he said.

Responding to allegations of irregularities in conducting the NEET examination in West Bengal, Swarup said, ""The NEET has been conducted very neatly by the CBSE and there was absolutely nothing wrong.

"1553","","Ujjain: Salient features and special components of traditional Indian teaching system -- Gurukul Ashram -- were highlighted through a rainbow of events on second day of three-day international Gurukul conference at Maharishi Sandipani Rashtriy Vedvidya Pratishthan on Chintaman Ganesh Road on Sunday.

Speaking on the second day of the conference, RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyaji Joshi said that education not only imparts knowledge, there is purity in sacraments too. He said that while looking at the traditions of India, it is found that under decentralized arrangements, education was provided in Gurukul in ancient times. Gurukul not only refer to the school of residential and food system, but it is a tradition that provides sacrament-based education as a whole.

The education that is received on the internet is not education but only information. At present, there is a need to understand boundaries of modern things and move ahead. He said Dakshina is given to Guru and fee is sought from student which reflects the difference between current education system and Gurukul education system. Maintaining Gurukul education system is a challenge. It is necessary to move forward by preserving the spirit of values ??in education, he added.

During the session, principal secretary culture Manoj Shrivastava said that Ujjayini's old name was Mahakalvan. Similarly, Varanasi has been called Anandvan and Mathura as Vrindavan. Providing education in a free environment of the forest was among the ancient traditions. He said that the strategic activities of Gurukul education have to be implemented at the ground level. Shrivastava said that it must be seriously acknowledged that education has collapsed.

To overcome this, education in the open environment is required. Many countries such as Switzerland, Finland and England have worked on the concept of forest schools. The decisive attack on India's early education took place in the colonial era. Current schools neither have agricultural land nor sports ground. Playing with nature gives birth to creativity in a child. Many arts in 64 arts can be a part of skill development, he added.

In the session, Dr Shailendra Mehta said that during Mahabharata period Takshshila is mentioned as the seat of education. During that era, all scientific subjects were taught in universities like Nalanda, Takshshila and Vikramshila. Swami Sevit Somagiri Maharaj said that currently everyone is participating in a blind race in the name of development, nobody should be skeptical about the education of Indian philosophy and science.

Yoga exercise and fantastic presentations of art of war

On the second day, musical performances of Yoga Surya Namaskar, Mallkhamb, Yoga Shikhar etc were performed under physical presentations. Mallkhamb was exhibited by children of Karnwati Gurukul. Baba Saheb Nanal Gurukul Yoga (Ratnagiri, Maharashtra) students made Pyramid. Hemchandracharya Sanskrit School of Karnavati students presented pole mallkhamb and gymnastics. Children of Veer Lokashah Sanskrit Jnanpith (Jodhpur, Rajasthan) staged art of war called Kalaripayutu and Ujjain's Achyutanand Prasadik Jiwajirao Gurukul students presented yoga exercises. Presentations were made with Gayatri Mantra recital in the background.

Symposium on five faculty of Gurukul education

Discussions were held on five different topics of Gurukul education by topic experts. Gurukul's classical education system will again be heading towards mainstream education. At the venue of the programme, five faculty of Gurukul Education, respectively, the school (Knowledge fund), theatre (art), gaushala (agriculture), observatory (yoga) and laboratory (science) were created. In these five faculties discussions were held with experts of different subjects and important information related to the topics that lead to student's all round development. After listening to the discussion in the five faculties, the discussion came to the fore that all gurukulas and their gurus affiliated with the great sage traditions of India have kept the tradition of Indian knowledge, art, agriculture, yoga etc alive. In the life of human beings there should be knowledge of methods of these faculties. The origins of Indian life philosophy should be based on spiritual contemplation, immortality of soul-divineness and life-based truth.

Tejaswakul Kulkarni, Ratan Vasisht, Kapildev Mishra and Anil were the speakers in the laboratory faculty. Speakers in theatre included Dr Sachchidanand Joshi, Amirchand, Acharya Vasudev Krishna Shastri (Nepal) and Acharya CM Krishnaashastri. In Gaushala faculty speakers were Dinesh Marothiya, RP Tiwari, TV Kattimani and Girish Prabhune. Vedhashala faculty speakers included Anirudh Deshpande, Dr Pratima Joshi, Dr Mohanlal Chhipa and Acharya Vednishth. The speakers of school's knowledge fund faculty were Acharya Hariprasad Adhikari, Dr Hemchandra and Acharya Nilkandan who shared various important information related to their respective subjects. During the discussion, the experts of the subjects satisfied queries of attendees and convinced them to take action to implement their suggestions.

Intense discussion on education system

Discussions were held on five pillars of Gurukul. These pillars were the role of parents, ideal students, acharya's responsibilities, contribution of operators and academic discussions. Five parallel sessions were held and attendees were informed about different aspects of gurukul education. On the first subject Ujjawala Patil on behalf of the Indian Education Board, Nagpur, said that parents are the first Guru of a child. The child receives initial education at home. In today's modern era parents do not have enough time for children. Due to lack of time, conceptual distance between children and parents is increasing and Gurukul education is the only system in which children are better understood. Student's every question is answered and their curiosity satiated. Aruna Saraswat said that whether children get education in Gurukul or in any school the role of guardian remains the same.

Arundhati Kawadkar as the speaker in the discussion on ideal student in Gurukul Education, talked about qualities of ideal student. She said that an ideal student desires to be full of sensual and victorious life. Acharya Mahabaleshwar Shastri presided over the session.

Mesmerising cultural presentations

On the second cultural evening, attractive presentations were made by students from different gurukuls. In this cultural evening, different sheds of art was presented. Classical music was presented through various devices by students of Hemchandracharya Gurukul. There were sounds like Naad, Pakhavaj, Sarangi, Santoor, flute, sitar, tabla and drum. After classical music students presented folk songs and rendered melodies which received huge applause from the audience. After this, Lord Ganesha's prayer was recited by Sarvottam Bhakti Gurukul of Ujjain students.

It was followed by attractive dance presented on the Shiva Tandava by students of Gotirtha Vidyapeeth Karnavati. Through the teachings of Lord Krishna, students of Sri Brahma Ved Vidyalaya Sansthan of Varanasi tried to explain that one should not be afraid of problems of the world but wage a war against them. The presentation of this dance was done on popular poem ""Arambh hai prachand"". Udipi dance was staged by Nivratti Gurukul of Karnataka. Kavyavali was presented by Ujjain's Kanva Gurukul.","Ujjain: Internet only provides information, not education says RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyaji Joshi | Free Press Journal","859372478","2018-04-30","http://www.freepressjournal.in/latest-news/ujjain-internet-only-provides-information-not-education-says-rss-general-secretary-suresh-bhaiyaji-joshi/1267388","Free Press Journal",FALSE

Anju Sharma, Principal Secretary (Higher and Technical) Education, in an interview with The Indian Express, shares the reforms that the state education department has adopted for better performance of the state's higher and technical educational institutes

In view of the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings, what areas does the Gujarat government need to focus on or improve in higher and technical education?

The government is focussing on reworking the syllabus and the examination system, promoting start-ups, research and innovation, skill based education and use of Information and Communications Technology, among other things, to increase the quality of institutes of higher education.

What steps are being taken to fill posts of professors in government colleges?

The Gujarat Public Service Commission (GPSC) is in the process of filling up posts of principals and professors. In the last five years, more than 2,700 faculty positions have been filled.

What could be the possible reasons for as many as 50 per cent of seats in engineering colleges lying vacant? Have any corrective measures been planned?

The intake capacity of engineering colleges has increased over the years, while the preferences of students have changed. In case of institutes not performing well, or students not opting for some courses or institutes, steps for the closure of the programme or the institute are being taken by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), and in some cases by the colleges themselves.

What measures are being taken to monitor private colleges flouting University Grants Commission (UGC) norms on infrastructure, faculty and other areas of operation?

Universities closely monitor their establishments and affiliates regarding UGC norms and their compliance. A college's affiliation is renewed only after inspection by a committee.

What are the reasons for the increasing unemployability of Gujarat's youth, especially across technical sectors? Can the course structure or poor quality of education be blamed?

The growth of industries and increased flow of investment to the state, in the recent years, has improved employment prospects for the youth. A fund of Rs 200 crore has been created to convert the concept of job-seeker to job-giver. A 'Student Start-up Policy' has been launched. The Education Department is making continued efforts to revise the curricula to meet the industry standards. Most colleges have set up finishing schools to enhance employability. Every university is now conducting campus placements. Internship programmes have been given a boost. The 'Mukhya Mantri Apprenticeship Yojana' was recently launched to provide job training to about one lakh youths.

"1555","","CHENNAI: The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has taken suo motu cognizance of a TOI report - ""City Schoolboy, part of group of 20, drowns in Pune dam, 2 go missing"" - and called for a detailed report from the school education secretary, the director of matriculation and the principal of ECI school in Tondiarpet within four weeks.

SHRC chairperson Justice T Meenakumari passed the orders on Thursday directing the school education secretary to issue instructions to all schools in TN to take steps to save lives of children by conducting pre-tour drills.

The order said the education department should frame guidelines for school authorities while taking children on tours.

As per the report of the education department, the group comprised students from Class VIII to Class XII. Danish Raja, who drowned, was a Class VIII student.

The team had left from Chennai on the night of April 23 and had reached Pune on April 25 morning. The camp was to be held from April 25 to May 2, said officials. One teacher from the maths department of the school had accompanied the students while two other guardians were from the NGO. Representatives from the NGO 'Teach to Lead' along with the principal of the ECI Matriculation School, also met with corporation officials on Thursday.

"1557","","Anil Swarup, the school education and literacy secretary who was the face of the government during the recent CBSE paper leak controversy, feels that demands to sack the board chairperson are not justified.

""You cannot just sack somebody because something went wrong somewhere,"" he says. Such a sacking would certainly make news, he says, but would not solve the problem. If not found guilty of wrongdoing, the person at the helm should be given a chance to fix loopholes than be asked to walk away, the 1981-batch Uttar Pradesh-cadre IAS officer, who retires in June, tells The Sunday Standard in an exclusive interview.

Anil Swarup, the school education and literacy secretary who was the face of the government during the recent Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) paper leak controversy, feels that demands to sack the board chairperson are not justified. Such a sacking would certainly make news, he says, but would not solve the problem. If not found guilty of wrongdoing, the person at the helm should be given a chance to fix loopholes in the system than be asked to walk away, the 1981-batch Uttar Pradesh-cadre IAS officer, who retires in June, tells The Sunday Standard in an exclusive interview.

The government has started an internal inquiry following the CBSE Class X and XII paper leak controversy. What is its status?

The internal inquiry is more to look at the system rather than fixing responsibility. Fixing responsibility is done through police investigation to check whether there is any collusion. So far there is no indication of any collusion of any CBSE official. There was only a finding that a particular official was lax in supervision, though there was no evidence of collusion yet, he was suspended and a formal departmental probe was started.

There is a process of a formal inquiry in the code of conduct rules. So you appoint an inquiry officer and then an inquiry happens and action is taken against the concerned officer. This should not take very long -- maybe in a month they will come to a conclusion on the extent of fault of that official.

Will we see more heads rolling in this case?

You cannot start by saying that heads should roll for the sake of it. We live in a country where law prevails. Under the law, you take action only if there is responsibility. Under the code of conduct rule, you can't take action on the basis of moral responsibility. There has to be a specific responsibility -- what has that person done wrong? Moral responsibility is not a consideration for civil services. Civil servants are either right or wrong -- there cannot be a grey area in-between.

So far, the police probe has not shown that there was collusion on the part of even a lowly CBSE officer. If that were the case, action will be taken against any officer but you cannot say initiate action just because of moral responsibility. If a wrong has happened, we have to find out what is the extent of involvement of an individual in that wrong.

Everybody has been talking about the role of the CBSE chairperson (Anita Karwal) but what is her fault? She received a mail at 1 am (a tip-off on the Class X Maths paper leak) but saw it only around 8.55 in the morning and immediately informed the Controller of Examinations.There were hordes of fake leaks floating around - you cannot stop or do something about a purported leak without verifying it. Every leak was verified -- but only two were found to be true (the other being the Class XII Economics paper leak). But after the examination had begun (on March 28), she could not stop it midway as it would have created chaos. At every step, a calculated decision was taken as per the available information keeping the best of students' interests in mind.

So what did she (Karwal) do wrong on her part? I am of the view that if a civil servant is wrong, he or she should be sacked but if they are not, they should be asked to stay and correct the system. Theoretically, if she were to be removed, a new chap will come and take several months just to understand things. Now if she is not directly involved as the evidence so far suggests, she is in the best position to understand and improve the system.

Are we interested in improving the system or are we baying for somebody's blood? It may not make news, but if I want to improve the system, the person who is sitting there is in a better position to come up with solutions than a new chap.

Many feel that after the CBSE leak controversy, the chairperson is being defended...

You see, if somebody has done something wrong, there is accountability; otherwise, just because people demand that somebody be hung, so the highest person is hung -- will that be justified?

She (Karwal) is at it and trying to bring in changes. And her credentials prove that. She has been one of the most outstanding officials. What she has done in the HRD ministry (as a joint secretary) even before she became CBSE chairperson is quite remarkable. She was responsible for successfully carrying out the National Assessment Survey, 2017, to assess the learning outcomes of school children across the country -- which was the biggest such survey where 22 lakh children were tested to see what they are learning in government schools.

This was the biggest-ever exercise to correct the education system in the country because we are making district-wise plans on what is wrong where and how to fix it. She was the pivot around whom the NAS was carried out even though it was done by the NCERT. That was phenomenal work.

One has to look at antecedents of an individual before taking any action. You cannot just sack somebody because something went wrong somewhere.

Over the years, CBSE had made a name for itself in conducting exams. Have the recent leaks led to a credibility crisis?

CBSE is a very credible organisation and will continue to be so. This was an exception and could have happened anywhere. Things like these definitely impact credibility to some extent but it cannot erode credibility completely.

Reputations are not made or unmade in a day. If there is a genuine effort to plug some loopholes, what is the problem? Yes, it's a wake-up call; yes, something very wrong has happened. It has been admitted and, therefore, a committee has been set up under the chairmanship of ex-HRD secretary V S Oberoi on use of technology in conducting CBSE exams and it will submit its report by May 31.

In the meanwhile, all efforts are being made to understand how the system could improve and I have no doubt that next year we will have an even better system in place.

Of late, you have been talking about an education mafia in the country. What exactly do you mean?

There are a lot many factors that impact education -- for me, the focal point is teachers and that is impacted when I say mafia. By and large, most people are fine but there are a set of people who are trying to destroy the system and trouble the future of this country.

I will give you a couple of examples. There are 16,000 B.Ed colleges in the country but it is a known fact that many of them do not function at all. When we asked them to furnish affidavits, about 4,000 did not and when we initiated action against them, they went to court. But we took them on -- the first time that such notices were issued on such a large scale.

The other set of mafia relates to some set of private schools. There are some schools which escalate fee without any rationale and we keep getting complaints against them. We have been in touch with state governments, and I am glad to say that the Uttar Pradesh government has come up with a legislation (on regulation of private schools) two days back, which have been welcomed even by private schools' association, meaning thereby that a majority of them are not opposed to some sort of a regulation.

This I would say is another step to bring mafias under control.I hope other states will also follow. Gujarat has already done something similar and Andhra Pradesh is actively considering it. So, there are initiatives being taken to rein in education mafias who are in small numbers but are well-connected and powerful.","Sacking of CBSE chairperson won't solve the problem: School Education secretary Anil Swarup","850238199","2018-04-15","http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/2018/apr/15/sacking-of-cbse-chairperson-wont-solve-the-problem-school-education-secretary-anil-swarup-1801629.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

There has been a debate over the National Medical Commission Bill in which one clause permits the bridge course for ayurvedic and homoepathic doctors to prescribe allopathic medicines. Maharashtra permits cross-pathy, even as the Centre is supposed to decide on it. Are we thinking of modifying it?

Maharashtra has already come out with a law that ayurvedic doctors can practise allopathy to the extent of knowledge they have applied. These doctors are basically for primary health care, so the ""extent of knowledge"" would mean basic medical intervention. For homoepathy, there is a six-month bridge course of pharmacology. That combined with their basic graduation will allow them to practise as per what they learn in these courses. This is already in force in Maharashtra and we don't intend to change it. Some 600 homoepathy doctors are already being trained for mixed-pathy.

While Maharashtra has enough medical colleges, the issue of shortage of doctors has not been addressed. How can this problem be resolved?

We are coming up with one more medical college in Jalgaon, and next year we will have one in Baramati. In Nandurbar's medical college, there is an issue of infrastructure. We are in the process, but construction of a new building will take time. We are also increasing seats for post-graduation students. Last year, we increased 200 seats, and this year we increased 77 seats. Now there is a proposal for an additional 50 medical seats. We already have 16 medical colleges and five colleges under the municipal corporation apart from these. In addition, in medical colleges, we are in the process of filling vacant positions of teachers. We have advertised for almost 400 posts. Interviews for 300 teachers have been conducted and 100 posts have already been filled.

In Maharashtra, we have been facing issues with candidates under a bond to serve in government hospitals.

Earlier we used to give doctors three years of grace period to complete the bond. From next year, this practice will be stopped. After MBBS, graduates will asked to serve a bond and then taken for counselling. They will not be allowed to appear for the post-graduate exam if they have not served the one-year bond in government hospitals. Doctors may protest against this, but we will stand by our decision.

Maharashtra took some measures to ensure doctors' security last year after massive protests. Do we plan further measures?

We have handed over security to the Maharashtra State Security Corporation that comes under the home department. The security appointed by them has the power to arrest. Private security agencies do not have power to arrest. The government of Maharashtra has improved the security situation substantially in hospitals.

But while there is Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage of Property) Act, 2010, there is not even a single conviction under it against those booked for attacking doctors.

About that, we need to take information from the home department. We do not know about the conviction numbers.

The Maharashtra government is opting for privatisation in different programmes. The health department released a government resolution (GR) recently to tie up with private medical colleges. Do government medical colleges plan similarly?

In the medical education department, we still do not have any GR on public-private partnership.

A lot of streams in post-graduation go vacant like forensic science. How can government ensure we have takers?

Students will take specialisation where there is better scope. It is not that forensic science seats are going vacant. Even in anatomy we do not have that many takers. Orthopaedics and gynaecologists have scope outside government jobs. In forensic science medicine and anatomy, there is only posting as teaching faculty in government hospitals. Students are not keen to join and we cannot force them to.","Don't intend to change rules on mixed-pathy in Maharashtra, says medical education secretary","846361545","2018-04-08","http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/dont-intend-to-change-rules-on-mixed-pathy-in-maharashtra-says-medical-education-secretary-sanjay-deshmukh-5129352/","The Indian Express",FALSE

Swarup, an IAS officer who was also initially the coal secretary, further told the channel, ""In coal, the mining was underground and the mafia was above that. In education, the mafia is underground. We are grappling with that"".

Swarup's comments come after Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that a ""mafia"" is controlling India's examination system. ""Till today, no step has been taken that would send the message that they would end this mafia in education. They saved the mafia in the Vyapam case. It seemed they are involved in this as well,"" Sibal said.

The CBSE came under widespread attack after the Class XII Economics paper was leaked, affecting lakhs of students. The government announced a re-examination on 25 April. But it ruled out any re-test for Class X Mathematics paper, which too was said to have been leaked. The Delhi Police is probing the leak following a complaint by the CBSE and has made numerous arrest in connection with the leaks.

The HRD ministry has also set up a ""high-powered committee"" to examine the process by which the CBSE conducts examinations, following the leaks. The panel, headed by former HRD secretary VS Oberoi, will suggest measures to make the process ""secure and foolproof through the use of technology"" and submit a report by 31 May.

"1560","","New Delhi, Mar 30 (ANI): Secretary of the Human Resource Development Ministry Anil Swarup on Friday informed that the re-examination of CBSE's Class 12 economics paper will be held on April 25 across the country, while the re-test for Class 10 mathematics is likely to be conducted in July.

He also assured that strict action will be taken against the culprit persons.

""There are no perfect solutions for this kind of situation.

Our immediate concern of the children who have suffered and this decision is in that context.","CBSE class 12th economics re-examination on April 25, decision on Class 10th in 15 days: Education Secretary","843594928","2018-04-04","https://www.newsr.in/video/20180330/9856452/CBSE-class-12th-economics-re-examination-on-April.htm","newsr.in",FALSE
"1561","","NEW DELHI: There were more questions than answers given at a press conference on Friday by the Human Resources Development Ministry that was called to make announcements related to the latest developments and decisions as a consequence of CBSE paper leaks that have rocked the country. Anil Swarup, Secretary, School Education and Literacy Department, who was tasked with making the announcements and fielding questions from media, appeared to be fiercely protecting CBSE chairman Anita Karwal, a 1988-batch Gujarat cadre IAS officer.

Though present at the venue, which turned heated as several tough questions were posed, Karwal barely spoke. Swarup chose to answer the questions, even those which were addressed to her. While admitting that a ""system that had been working fine for last so many years, but did not work this time round,"" the secretary, in response to many questions, kept saying that ""there are no perfect decisions, but those taken mainly with students' interest in mind.""

On being asked if responsibility of the leak had been fixed or if heads of top CBSE officials, including that of Karwal, will roll, all Swarup could say was that ""responsibility cannot be fixed unless investigations are over and its confirmed at which level leaks have happened.""

He, however, chose to ignore a question on why action was not taken against Karwal given her ""moral responsibility"" to conduct fair Board examinations. Quizzed if the Board ignored tipoffs of leaks on several occasions before March 28, Swarup said that ""a number of papers that were floating around as the leaked paper"" had turned out to be a hoax. The secretary also did not make any commitments on part of the government that no leaks will happen in future.","CBSE paper leak: Responsibility can't be fixed before probe,says Anil Swarup, Secretary, School Education and Literacy Department","841494900","2018-03-30","http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/mar/31/cbse-paper-leak-responsibility-cant-be-fixed-before-probesays-anil-swarup-secretary-school-educ-1794953.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"1562","","He said that question papers of other subjects have not been leaked.

Coming clean on the rumours of other re-exams, officials at the HRD ministry clarified that the exams for other allegedly leaked papers will not be held again.

""Number of papers were floating around purported to have been leaked. We had to verify all of them. It is not that one paper got leaked and no one did anything. We had a wealth of information misleading people to believe the papers were leaked,"" Anil Swarup, secretary of school education, confirmed on Friday.

The incident of leak is most unfortunate and regretful, he added. Refusing to pin the blame on CBSE chief, Swarup said it will be premature to blame Anita Karwal and ask her to resign.

""Without an inquiry, moral responsibility can't be fixed,"" secretary of higher education, HRD ministry, said on fixing the responsibility of leak on CBSE chief Anita Karwal. The nature of leak and its consequences of the exam that was held have decided the fresh dates for the exam, he explained.

Putting to rest the possibility of re-exams in other allegedly leaked question papers in class 12, Swarup explained that the CBSE officials have also received complaints and purported copies of leaked papers of other subjects but none of the circulated copies matches the original paper attempted by students. Stating that the so-called ""leaked papers"" were not leaked papers actually, he mentioned,""Even we received the purported copies and in the last few days, we have carefully examined all of them. Since they do not match the question paper set by CBSE board, it is clear that the question papers haven't been leaked in other subjects.""

The MLCs have termed Shalini as irresponsible as she has taken 15 days leave from March 13. MLC Puttanna said, ""The PUC II examinations are going on and SSLC exams are to begin from March 23.

With Shalini on leave, the charge has been handed over to the Transport Department secretary. ""There have been several instances in the past during examinations, such as question paper leaks.

"1572","","NEW DELHI: In what could be a major worry for policymakers in the field of education, the number of children who drop out of government schools in class IX and X is increasing significantly in most states of India.

The latest data from the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database of information about schools, says that the situation is particularly grim in states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, West Bengal, and some north-eastern states, as per 2016-17 statistics.

In these states, the percentage of students dropping out of school in secondary classes was considerably higher than the previous years. For example, in Bihar, in 2016-17, 39.73 per cent students in secondary classes withdrew from school, as compared to just 25.90 per cent students in 2015-16.

In Jharkhand, 36.64 per cent students dropped out in 2016-17, the last year for which data is available, which is over 12 per cent more than the previous year. The Union Human Resources Development Ministry has been boasting about making significant changes in the school education sector.

It's own figures, however, suggest that while the gross enrolment ratio was over 100 per cent at the primary level in 2016-17 (GER can be more than 100 per cent at the primary level because of overage and underage children taking admissions), it Is less than 80 per cent at the secondary level and is yet to reach 60 per cent at the senior secondary level.

Education experts said that while lack of access in rural areas and lack of interest in learning are major factors why children in higher classes drop out of schools, the no-detention policy till class VIII, which was introduced as part of the Right to Education act, could also be a reason.

""The government has now moved to end the no-detention policy, but in the past many year, it has been seen that children who were not assessed properly till class VIII, lose interest in studies when they don't do well at higher level examinations,"" said educationist Varsha Narain.","Government school dropouts in classes 9, 10 increasing in many states","1026738802","2018-12-26","http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/dec/26/school-dropouts-increasing-in-many-states-1916572.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

""English is a subject in which students in our government schools don't feel very comfortable. I diagnosed the problem and developed a strategy. Rather than making it a subject confined to reading and writing, I worked on developing listening skills of the children. I would ask them to hear the announcement at railway stations, metro, radio and call centres. The strategy worked and students became very confident,"" Qanungo said.

"1575","","MANGALURU: The Daddalkad villagers, about 35 km from here, have set an example by showing that collective efforts can save a Kannada-medium government school from closure. They have built a school by pooling Rs 2.20 crore with 24 classrooms and imparting English education alongside Kannada, and it is all set for inauguration.

The 43-year-old Government Higher Primary School, Daddalkad, Bantwal taluk, was in a dilapidated condition in 2015 and had only 30 students. Now it has around 500 children, studying from LKG to class VIII, where English is taught along with Kannada.

It was all possible because of the efforts and foresight of Shree Durga Friends Club, Karenki, led by Prakash Anchan, a garment merchant from Bantwal.

""When most Kannada-medium schools across the state are closing down due to various reasons, we wanted to show the world that this school can be saved by adopting new teaching skills, and today we are successful in doing so. Our mission began three year ago when theschool had only 30 children. Even those who had joined nearby English-medium schools have quit, and have taken admission here,"" says an elated Prakash while speaking to TOI.

The first phase of the school with eight classrooms was inaugurated last April, and second and final phase will be inaugurated by governor Vajubhai Vala on January 5.

Anchan added that they collected all the money from generous donors, who included locals, parents and others. ""We have not taken a single penny from any government be it the Centre or state. When we proposed the same building plan, the government estimated a cost of Rs 6 crore, but we have completed the work by spending Rs 2.2 crore.""

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries.

"1578","","CHANDIGARH: A day after Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CCPCR) sent recommendation letter to the education department, asking them to take strict action against in-charge and officials responsible for the delay in the rape case, the department transferred the in-charge of the concerned school to another school.

This shows that the department itself has not taken any major step besides issuing advisory in the case. ""She did not delay taking the action. The moment parents of the survivor told her, she immediately reported the incident to the police,"" a senior official told TOI.

However, this does not match with the statement the in-charge gave to the CCPCR. In her statement, she had said that after the parents reported the matter on October 22 she handed over the case to the school's sexual harassment committee. Then the in-charge telephonically reported the matter to the DEO office. However, a letter was also given to the DEO on October 25. On October 26, media reported the case and then the FIR was registered. CCPCR had sent letters recommending strict action on December 17 while the transfer orders were issued on December

18. The reason stated for the transfer was ""mistresses (being senior most) are hereby assigned the duties of the in-charge in the schools."" Another person has been made in-charge of the school in her place.

Earlier the CCPCR, despite being the right authority, had refrained from acting tough against those responsible for the delay in reporting of the case and had left the onus to decide action on authorities concerned.

As per former members of the commission, inclusion of officials from the UT education department, health and other departments in the CCPCR has led to show leniency in a serious case. ""Last time when it was a private school head at fault, an FIR was recommended because that is what the Pocso Act states and this time CCPCR just saved itself and left it to the department to act,"" said a member requesting anonymity. Education secretary B L Sharma however, assured that appropriate action will be taken.

"1580","","The basic shiksha adhikari (BSA), Gautam Budh Nagar, on Tuesday, asked block education officers to demolish all dilapidated government school buildings that are unsafe and can cause harm to students.

The move comes after a wall collapsed in Noida's New KM Public School in Salarpur village, killing two children and injuring three students. The BSA said they will demolish all unsafe government school buildings and identify illegal private schools to close them down.

""We have written to block education officers to ensure that the private agencies are selected in each village to demolish unsafe government school buildings and construct new ones. The private agencies that will build the new school buildings will be finalised through an open auction in the respective villages. Earlier, due to technical reasons, we could not hire private agencies to reconstruct government schools,"" Balmukund Prasad, BSA, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.

According to officials, there are several government primary and middle schools in various villages across the district that are operating in old, unsafe buildings.

The education department has also written to the block education officer in Dankaur to inspect private schools and shut them down if they are violating norms.

As per the education department, there are 174 illegal schools in the Gautam Budh Nagar district. Over two lakh students study in these schools, that are housed in illegal buildings with no safety measures in place, officials said.

""After a 2017-18 survey, we identified 174 illegal schools in district. Most of them were shut down. Now, to identify more illegal schools, we have formed two teams that will submit monthly reports. The allegations of parents that we were aware of all illegal schools operating in the district are false and baseless,"" Prasad said.

""The block education officer needs to inspect Children's Academy in Chhijarsi; Dayanand Public School, Bahlolpur; Vivek Vidyapeeth, Chhijarsi; Gyandeep School in Chotpur, HI Public School in Chhijarsi; Geeta Public School in Chhijarsi; Jagriti Public School in Chhijarsi and Naveen Gyan Hari Singh Public School. If these schools are illegal, then we will shut them down immediately,"" Prasad added.

The other schools that are to be inspected by the education department are CBSE Public School, Prayag Public School and Sai Public School in Yakubpur village; and Royal Public School, Gayatri Public School and Beena Public School in Sadarpur village.

Pradeep Yadav, whose son was killed when New KM Public School's wall collapsed on Monday, said,""If these 174 schools were illegal and unsafe for children, then why did the education department not act earlier. We demand that the UP government file an FIR against education department officials for laxity.""

Prasad said,""Parents are responsible for checking whether schools are approved or not before they admit their wards. We have decided to seek information from the public about schools they think are illegal as well. We will inspect them and take appropriate action.""

"1581","","CHANDIGARH: Nearly a month after deciding the recommendations in the rape case of a Class I government school student, the Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CCPCR) has finally issued letters to the UT education secretary, health services director and the Chandigarh SSP, directing all to take action in the matter.

As per the inquiry, the school head, education department officials and the doctors who examined the girl did not report the matter to the police. Copies of the letters are with TOI.

In November, TOI had reported that the commission has refrained itself from recommending action against the persons in question for delay in reporting the case as suggested in the Juvenile Justice Act and had left it to the concerned authorities to decide the punishment. Notably, this is the first time that the child rights commission has shown leniency in a serious case and not recommended FIR against every person from doctors to school heads and education department officials who did not report the matter to the police as per the Act suggests.

As per the information, this was done because the school authorities were found to be unaware about the law that applied in such a case.

In 2015, CCPCR had acted the other way and recommended FIR against the school management of a private Chandigarh school for delaying to report the molestation case of a pre-primary student. The conductor of the school bus had molested a kindergarten student in the bus. Recently, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed a lower court to proceed against a the school principal who had failed to act even after knowing about the molestation.

The JJ Act states under Section 19 (1) that any person who has the apprehension that an offence is likely to be committed or has the knowledge that an offence has been committed, should bring the incident to the notice of the special juvenile police unit or the local police. The failure to report such an offence is punishable with imprisonment or fine or both.

Failing to report the commission of an offence under Section 19 (1) or failing to record such offence under section 19 (2) is punishable under Section 21

(2) which states that any person, being in-charge of any company or an institution (by whatever name called) who fails to report the commission of an offence in respect of a subordinate under his control, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year and with fine.

That is not all, cold drafts blowing in through gaps make comfort impossible in these schools, which are maintained by the UT and have been running for decades.

The education department is aware of the state of affairs but is yet to replace the sheds housing primary and pre-primary students with a proper building. The remaining classes do run in buildings but lack the space to accommodate these students.

There are eight rooms under the shed in Hallomajra. These include all sections of Classes VI, VIIA and VIIIA. In the evening, all sections of Class I are also conducted under the roof.

In Hallomajra, one class is held in the midday meal room. The block under the tin roof is located on a separate premises. A rickety fence passes off for a boundary wall, leaving students vulnerable to insects and snakes.

Cracked walls in GMS, Palsora Colony make it impossible to warm the room. ""In such uncomfortable surroundings, students cannot focus on studies,"" said the parent of a school student.

Schools with concrete buildings do not have it easy either. Water seepage is a common problem. Leaky roofs, damp walls and rotting blackboards are common. School officials said they have informed authorities but the process of repair is slow.

Authorities from other government schools said these buildings have never been renovated.

The district education office itself is grappling with the problem of water seepage on the top floor, where water accumulates on the roof.

""We have to save documents after the rain as the roof leaks. So many letters have been written but nothing has been done,"" said an official, requesting anonymity.

"1584","","PATNA: The scourge of caste-based discrimination in Bihar has permeated a government-run higher secondary school so deeply that its students have been made to sit in separate classrooms demarcated along caste lines for the past four years.

Authorities of Bihar's education department were unaware of the regressive practice being followed at the GA Higher Secondary (Plus 2) School at Lalganj in Vaishali district so far. After the matter came to light following a recent inquiry by officials, a shocked state government ordered an inquiry on Tuesday.

While all students of the school usually come to the institute together and leave the premises together, they are made to sit in different classrooms as per their castes and religions according to a system followed for the past four years, said sources. Students from Dalit and Muslim communities are reportedly never allowed to visit other classrooms.

There are also separate sections and rooms for students belonging to Hindu and Muslim communities at the school, said sources. Similarly, separate classrooms have also been allotted for students of each class belonging to the upper castes, OBCs and Dalits. The school also uses separate attendance registers for different social groups of the students.

""An inspection of the school made it clear that such a system indeed prevails there. We are sending a detailed report to the district education officer for instructions on suitable action on the matter,"" said Arvind Kumar Tiwari, the Block Education officer (BEO) of Lalganj.

School headmistress Meena Kumari, however, claimed that the social segregation of students has been proving useful in many ways. ""This system is in place in order to facilitate a smooth educational process and also to ensure that the execution of government schemes becomes easier. There is no discrimination on the basis of caste or religion,"" she said.

""There have been no negative effects of this system at the school so far. Besides, there has never been a complaint against this system, which is running smoothly,"" argued the headmistress.

The government school in her home town, Chopasni village, can now give competition to city schools after it was upgraded with help from donors. Chanchal and her elder sister Pratibha study in the village school now.

Several people from the village who shifted to Jodhpur city just to provide better education to their wards have returned to the village. Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school. Along with the villagers, I wrote a letter to ONGC and HPCL requesting help to construct two separate toilets for girls and boys as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR). The school thus got two toilets that cost Rs 3.5 lakh each,"" said Ratnoo.

""Several girls who dropped out after a certain age due to lack of toilet facilities in school returned to study here,"" said Tima Ram Dhandhu, a villager.

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground. Several others, including the village panchayat, contributed to construct classrooms in the school and install CCTV cameras,"" said Ratnoo.

Jay Narayan Gehlot, sarpanch of Chopasni village, said that the entire village made it a vision to give a good school to the children of the village. ""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same. From a single village we managed to bring 50-60 new students to join the school, ""said Suresh.

Sarla Ratnoo, a student of class 12, said: ""I can dream big now as I can continue with my education. Had the school been far away or without facilities, it would not have been possible.""

The school has a strength of more than 350 students and provides Identity cards and uniforms. ""CCTV cameras have been installed in the classes.

Krithik, who studies at Cherry Creek High School at Greenwood village in Denver, was appalled at the sight of the school. ""My images were shattered when I stepped into the school. It was unclean and did not have adequate amenities. Schoolteachers there said this was the state of many government schools in India. That's when I decided to do something,"" he said.

With help from his grandfather and his father M Ramesh Babu, Krithik, an Overseas Citizen of India, started an NGO, Empowering Rural India Foundation, about two weeks ago. When funds became an issue, his family members suggested him to find sponsors.

But the 16-year-old donated his own money of 6,000 US dollars. ""In May, I won the first prize in an international science fair held in Pittsburgh and received a cash award of 3,000 US dollars. Besides, I decided to put another 3,000 US dollars from my savings,"" he said.

When funds in hands, he approached the school management and asked them about their needs. Headmaster Perumal said installation of solar panels would help the school as it was affected by frequent power disruptions.

Krithik immediately accepted the idea and started searching for companies that install solar panels along with his father and mother Karpagavalli. They zeroed in on one and installed solar panels recently.

""The school is incurring about Rs 15,000 as electricity charges every two months. With solar panels, we can save that money,"" said a teacher, on the condition of anonymity.

Krithik said the solar panels could produce 2kw of power. ""The requirement of school is less than 2kw. It could sell excess power to the Tamil Nadu electricity board,"" he said.

Ramesh Babu said his son's idea was to build sustainable and renewable energy systems that would serve schools in India for decades. ""Our goal is to improve academic success and create self-sustaining solutions to build up a strong infrastructure,"" he said.

Krithik, who will return to the US by the end of the month, said, ""I will participate in more science fairs, will get more money and contribute something to government schools in India.""

"1588","","TIRUPUR: Amidst heavily publicised plantation drives and green revolution projects, here is one woman quietly contributing to the expansion of green cover in her village. In the confines of Pongalur, this former government-aided school teacher has dedicated her verdant eight-and-a-half acre to hundreds of trees. The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends.","8-acre paradise in Pongalur: The story of how a government school teacher built a mini forest ","1018104100","2018-12-14","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/dec/14/8-acre-paradise-in-pongalur-the-story-of-how-a-government-school-teacher-built-a-mini-forest-1911413.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

"1591","","PUNE: A state government survey on the weight of school bags swept under the carpet the concern and worry among parents, doctors and education experts.

Only around 5,000 students had satchels over the prescribed limit, a recent study conducted by the education department shows.

The survey covered 4.17 lakh students in over 23,000 government, corporation and zilla parishad schools from August till October.

Educationists were divided over the results. Some disbelieving experts said it was not possible that just one per cent students carried overweight bags. Others attributed the change in textbook sizes and planning for the reduced weight of the school bags.

The state government had issued a notification for lighter school bags on November 5, 2015. The principal and another representative would be responsible if any child was found with an overweight bag.

Senior officials in the education department said special squads conducted the survey in 37 districts of Maharashtra and 88,972 schools. As many as 4,308 officials were appointed three years ago.

The survey established that 98.77% students carried school bags as per the prescribed limit while 1.23% had overweight satchels. In Pune district, 5,030 schools and 13,950 students were surveyed and only 652 students were found to be carrying overweight bags.

The 15 districts included Nashik, Nandurbar, Dhule, Nagpur, Mumbai.

Former director of education Vasant Kalpande said textbooks are now bigger in size with more pages but they should not weigh down school bags if there is proper planning by the school.

""Perceptions of those who don't trust the survey seem to be based on students going to private schools. My experience is that most educationists are out of touch with ground realities,"" Kalpande said.

"1592","","BHUBANESWAR: The All Odisha Parents' Association has urged the state government to strictly implement the school bag weight limits prescribed by the ministry of human resource development (MHRD). They alleged that most government or private schools in the state were not implementing the MHRD's guidelines on reducing the weight of school bags.

""The weight of the bag of a Class III student studying in a CBSE school varies between 7 and 9 kg. This, according to the guidelines, should be between 2 and 3 kg. I personally weighed the bags of children studying in different classes, in different schools. I found that only in a few cases were the children carrying lighter bags,"" said Basudev Bhatt, convener of All Odisha Parents' Association.

In a letter to school and mass education minister Badri Narayan Patra, Bhatt called for strict implementation of the guidelines and asked the state government to carry out random checks in schools.

""Due to the heavy weight of the school bags, most children complain of pain in the back, shoulder and problems of posture. Long-term distortion of the spinal cord is also possible. If departments conduct raids at regular intervals, things may improve,"" said Bhatt, adding that states such as Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi were working actively to lighten students' bags.

A senior officer in the school and mass education department said on the condition of anonymity that the state government had issued an order asking schools to reduce the weight of school bags. ""Implementation has been a problem,"" the officer added.

The parents' association also asked the government to make schools follow the MHRD's and the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)'s guidelines on not giving homework to children up to Class II. ""On one hand, we are talking about making learning joyous. On the other, we impose so much homework on our children every day. The government should look into the matter,"" said Bhatt.

The Confederation of Odisha Public Schools, however, said implementation of the guidelines was hardly possible in a practical manner.

""The recent guidelines of the MHRD have only been implemented in Lakshadweep. Most parents complain if we don't give homework to children. They want to go through the textbooks to see what the schools have been teaching. Only guidelines won't do, we must be practical,"" said chairman of the confederation, B N Patnaik, while admitting that children carried heavy school bags.

He added, ""The CBSE issued a guideline that said the weight of the school bags should not exceed 4 kg, provided the children use NCERT books. But is the NCERT able to provide all the textbooks? If children don't have access to NCERT textbooks, they have to use many other textbooks,"" Patnaik said.","Parents ask government to implement school bag weight guidelines - Times of India","1014662733","2018-12-10","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/parents-ask-govt-to-implement-school-bag-weight-guidelines/articleshow/67015845.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"1593","","Despite external appearances, it is not easy being a government school teacher. Over the last few years, many have been struggling for regular posts and salaries across Punjab. In the absence of assured income, they have been hard-pressed to maintain their families. Still, there are others who have not lost track of a larger purpose - students' welfare.

These teachers have come together to overhaul infrastructure in as many as 1,700 schools. Efforts are on to take the number to 4,250.

LITTLE ONES: KG classes in Government Primary School, Jhans started 2 years ago

Principals, head teachers and teachers are spearheading the change with the help of philanthropists.

Here are a few stories of faith and transformation.

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

"1594","","The department has ordered Mount Carmel School in Dwarka locality to stop fresh admissions for the academic session 2019-'20.

The Delhi government's Directorate of Education on Thursday issued an order withdrawing the recognition of a private school in Dwarka locality for allegedly violating land allotment terms by increasing its fee without prior approval, The Indian Express reported. The order will come into effect from April 1, 2019.

The department said it had ordered Mount Carmel School in Dwarka's Sector 22 to stop fresh admissions for the academic session 2019-'20. The school is a Christian minority institution run by the Mount Carmel School Society.

According to the order, private unaided recognised schools in Delhi operating on land allotted by government agencies cannot increase fee without prior approval of the director of education. After a Delhi High Court verdict, the directorate had sought online proposals for the year 2016-'17 from schools that wanted to increase fee.

Mount Carmel School was issued a showcause notice in February 2016, citing non-compliance, after the school hiked fee by 25% without seeking the director's approval. However, the school contended that the directorate order was not applicable to minority schools and that Mount Carmel was being run on land allotted to it at institutional rates, minus any concession.

School principal Michael Williams said they would approach the court and seek legal relief. ""In 1998, the school land of Rs 1.5 crore was acquired for Rs 1.6 crore, which was not a concessional rate,"" he said. ""This is unfortunate, as under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973, the DoE [Directorate of Education] cannot cancel recognition of minority schools.""

Williams told PTI: ""Though we have not received the notice yet we have got to know about it from media reports. We urge the students and parents to not panic and assure that we would come out clean.""

The government has also issued notices to three other schools and directed them to refund to parents the extra fee they charged between 2006 and 2011, along with 9% interest, The Times of India reported. These include Bal Bharati School in Dwarka, St Marks Senior Secondary School in Meera Bagh, and Springdales, Dhaula Kuan.","Delhi government withdraws recognition of private school for hiking fee without approval","1013176819","2018-12-07","https://scroll.in/latest/904917/delhi-government-withdraws-recognition-of-private-school-for-hiking-fee-without-approval","Scroll.in",FALSE

"1596","","CHANDIGARH: Teachers of government schools are busy in the child mapping survey again this year, thus, leaving them irritated.

Teachers said the duty should be given to someone else so that they could focus on students, who are left in schools all by themselves. With Exams nearing, most of the schools are yet to complete syllabus of senior classes. During a visit to schools on Monday and Tuesday, TOI found teachers handling multiple classes. In some schools, especially primary schools, only the in charge of the school was present as other teachers were out for conducting survey.

The in charge had been managing all the classes together. In some schools, teachers had combined various classes to manage students, while in others students were made to sit in the open so that teachers could conduct activities for all throughout the day.

An emergency meeting of the executive members of the Joint Action Committee (JAC) was held on Tuesday. The meeting was held to discuss the problems being faced by teachers while conducting the survey.

""Students are suffering due to such activities. Teachers should not be involved in non-academic activities at the cost of studies of the students. Keeping in view the studies of students and security of teachers, such nonteaching activities should be allotted to an outsourcing agency so that teachers can concentrate only on the studies of students,"" said Bhag Singh Kairon, president, JAC. Various leaders of the JAC appealed to the education department that they should not assign such activities to teachers and also minimize other non-teaching activities in the schools in the interest of students.

Teachers said they were further facing problems as residents did not cooperate with them most of the times and treat them as salespersons and humiliate them.

According to sources in the department, reducing the content in textbooks was one of the options put before the state government and was also discussed at various levels, including school management.

""Reducing the content will bring down the size and the weight of textbooks. We already have a research report and an expert committee report on how the weight of bags can be reduced.

"1602","","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as the state government has said it had earlier implemented the Centre's decision to regulate the weight of school bags based on classes, the regulation of change in the curriculum of Classes I to V will be a herculean task for the state Education Department as all the contents of the books have already been printed. Moreover, the immediate change in the subjects by limiting it to language and mathematics in Classes I and II will also create a gap for the children in learning science and social studies.

However, Education Department sources said it could only be implemented from the next academic year and a high-level discussion would be needed for the smooth implementation. In a bid to ensure more leisure time for children and to reduce the burden on them, the Ministry of Human Resources the other day issued fresh directives to states and Union territories. As per an official order, the Centre has banned assigning homework for students of Classes I and II and said no subject other than language and Mathematics is to be prescribed for these classes. For Classes III, IV and V, schools are directed to teach only language, environmental science and mathematics as prescribed by the NCERT. The Union Government has also issued guidelines in terms of the weight of the bags of kids in Classes I to X.

A Shahjahan, General Education Secretary, told Express that a high-level meeting will be held soon to discuss changing the curriculum of Classes I to V. ""However, the present curriculum will be continued until a final decision is taken in the meeting,"" he said.

Sources said the curriculum in all schools, except CBSE schools, will be revised from the next academic year. Though the government has decided to only revise the curriculum of Classes IX and X, the high-level meeting will decide to revise the curriculum of primary school as well. The curriculum committee has given approval to the revision of the curriculum for Class 9 and 10 in the meeting.

According to a senior officer of the Directorate of Public Instruction, the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) has been entrusted with implementing the curriculum revision. SCERT was earlier entrusted with overviewing the textbooks and make an entrepreneur-friendly environment in the classrooms as part of curriculum revision.

"1603","","The education of nearly 650 to 700 children has been hit adversely ever since the PMC Colony government school in which they were studying was transformed into a temporary shelter for the victims of the Patil Estate slum fire. Over 1,200 families were rendered homeless after a devastating fire broke out in the slum on Wednesday.

The school is located in PMC Colony area near the Patil Estate slum which suffered a fire incident three days ago. The children running in the corridors are not on campus for education but for mere survival after losing their entire households in the fire.

""Most of the children in the school are from Patil Estate. The school was informed about the incident and the required arrangement was made a little after 2pm (The fire brigade received a call at 1.10pm). The teachers were in the school till around 6:15pm when the last child was handed over to his parents,"" said Shilpa Gholap who works closely with the principal of the school. ""In fact, the number goes up in the evenings as everyone is looking for space to sleep,"" she added on Friday.

Thursday, Friday and Saturday (half day) of the school work was lost for the 650-700 students of the school. The pupils missing academic work include ones studying in English, Marathi and Urdu medium.

The principal of the school, Anjali Mandhale, was on leave when the incident happened and the school was headed by Ujwala Nangre, vice principal, in her absence.

Ganesh Sonune, disaster management department officer at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said government structures for such situations are pre-identified and people are shifted there and provided with water, sanitation and food.

""That is the protocol. For example, people were provided with blankets and donations from us as well as private organisations. If needed, private halls and open private spaces are taken into consideration as well. For the (school) days which are lost, we have to make sure that the timings are adjusted later on - in 3-7 days - when everyone has found a replacement shelter,"" he said.

When asked for how long the school will suffer loss of academic days, Nangre said that cannot be specified.

While the teachers were gathered in one room, 13 classrooms were allotted for shelter and one for medical help. Dr Geetanjali Joshi sat with one nurse in the day shift and while they did not get any fire-related cases, the doctors had attended to 108 patients for common conditions like cold, fever, sore throat, among others, within 20 hours of the tragedy."," Education takes a stand still as government school turns into temporary shelter for Pune slum fire victims","1007950613","2018-12-01","https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/education-takes-a-stand-still-as-government-school-turns-into-temporary-shelter-for-pune-slum-fire-victims/story-mxz3llrWjUjXKHFAQRmMJO.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

Every student would get a locker. This is an extremely welcome move by the government. Students would now be able to relax while travelling from and to their schools. This project would be implemented in all government schools be they directly run by the government, government-aided or government-sponsored.

In the first phase, students from class I to VIII would get lockers, and the second phase, students from class IX to XII. Fifty thousand primary schools and 14,000 secondary (Madhyamik) schools would get the lockers. The lockers for each class would be set up within the classrooms themselves or where space is not available, outside.

Funds have already been allocated for the purpose. Every locker will have the name of the student concerned. For classes I and II, students will be allowed to keep all their books in the lockers. For the others, some may be kept in the lockers and the rest carried home.

Besides books, pencil boxes, school bags, water bottles, dry foods, and even PT dresses can be kept in the lockers.","School students to be relieved from 'bag' pain as Bengal government plans lockers","1007581484","2018-11-30","http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/nov/30/school-students-to-be-relieved-from-bag-pain-as-bengal-government-plans-lockers-for-every-school-1905355.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"1605","","GADAG : A government school in a Gadag village is a quiet affair. It has only one teacher, who picks up all the school students from their homes on his bike and even drops them off later. How can he fit all the students on his bike? Well, he has only three students. If the teacher takes off, the school is shut for the day. The three students study in Classes 1, 2 and 5. The government primary school in Bandemma Nagar near Naragund town once had a good numbers of students but after locals started to migrate, the school was left with only three children.

The teacher, H S Sunkad, hails from Naragund and he was appointed on deputation to this school four months ago.A few years ago, Bandemma Nagar had several families living here and many children went to the school. However, most of the residents got houses under a Central government scheme and left the village.

The three children continue to come to school, thanks to their dedicated teacher. ""When I first came here, I was surprised to see only three students. But it is my duty as a teacher to teach, irrespective of the number of students. I teach all the children in the same class. Of the three students, one was planning to quit school and had joined his father in cattle grazing. But I convinced the family as well as the boy to pursue his studies. After this I started picking and dropping the three children,"" Sunkad said.

The Education Department, however, plans to get more children to this school. Gadag Deputy Director Of Public Instruction (in charge) G L Baratakke said the department is aware about the issue. ""I have informed Naragund BEO to take up a survey on how to increase the number of students. I am waiting for the report, and based on it I will take steps to improve the numbers. We will request the transport corporation to run regular buses to the area where the school is,"" he said.

Gadag district Kannada Jagruti Vedike president Prabhurajgouda Patil appreciated the efforts of the teacher who has been teaching just three kids. ""We will visit this government school and check the possibility of increasing the number of students by creating awareness in nearby areas,"" he said.

"1606","","COIMBATORE: While the Ministry of Human Resource Development has only now started to give

importance to martial arts training for girl students as part of its self-defence programme, this government higher secondary school in Kurichi has been a pioneer in the field with seven of its students getting ready to participate in a State-level meet to be held soon.

Even its first year of training, as many as 120 of its 147 students participated in the divisional meet concluded in the city; 91 of them managed to bag medals too. The school offers training in various disciplines like fencing, judo and taekwondo.

At a time when most government schools in the city and rural areas alike concentrated on conventional games like kabaddi, volleyball and football, this schools took the initiative to introduce martial arts with the help of its physical education teachers P Sivaprakasham and N Nisar. This training was then extended to the school's girl students in the form of self-defence lessons. Teachers wanted them equipped to handle any situation they might face. After being briefed about the different forms of martial arts, many girls volunteered to be trained in fencing; they also managed to win a few

medals, he recalls.

Five girls -- S Swetha, D Mercy, R Ranjani, of class XI, and Rajeshwari (class X) and K Logeshwari (class IX) -- have been qualified to participate in the State-level event to be held soon in Kankeyam

of Tirupur district. The girls, on their part, are happy to have overcome all odds to make a mark in the

sport. Though their mothers were hesitant to allow them to be trained in martial arts, all parents are now happy that their girls have managed to achieve so much. Now, they eagerly inquire about fencing practice before asking about academics, narrates Swetha.

Headmistress N Shanthi cannot appreciate the effort more. The teacher's job is not just to improve the students' skills in academics; they should also identify their talents and put them on the path of development. She also remarks that such training has increased attendance among students. A year ago, only 50 per cent of students were willing to attend classes; this has increased to 95 per cent, she claims.

While the school might have its reasons to introduce martial arts to its students, the motivations for single

mother M Gowri are quite simple. Raising her two girls -- M Praveena and M Durgadevi -- on her own, after the demise of her husband, she wanted them to be fiercely independent. When the school

announced self-defence lessons, she was more than happy to sign them up for it. True to spirit, the girls managed to bag a silver medal in karate and Praveena has a bronze in fencing to add to it. It was the mother's aspiration that pushed them to their best, Praveena declares.

The school allows students to excel in swimming too. Four boys -- T Akash, V Mahadevan, M Muthukathiravan, S Logeshwaran (all class VIII students) -- were identified after teachers saw them

swimming in the Kurichi lake, located adjacent to the school.

All these boys had not had formal training before.

"1607","","The death of an eight-year-old student after his school cab was hit by a goods vehicle on Tuesday has once again spotlighted illegally plying school transport in the national capital.

At least 40,000 vans are plying without valid permits in the capital, of which around 25,000 are engaged as school cabs, according to data available with the Delhi government's transport department. However, only 9,600 school vans are registered with the department.

Despite several crackdowns against these cabs and unverified drivers, private vehicles plying as school vans continue to flout the guidelines mandated under the School Cab Policy, 2007.

The guidelines say that vehicle owners should have a commercial school cab licence. They fix a cap on the number of children to be ferried, list out safety precautions and mandate adequate and comfortable seating space, plus adequate ventilation in the van. The guidelines also mandate that van drivers wear Public Service Vehicle (PSV) badges and that their antecedents are verified and approved by the regional transport authority (RTO).

According to the Delhi Police, the eco cab ferrying the children that met with an accident on Tuesday did not have a permit to carry school children.

In April, a school van met with accident in which a seven-year-old was killed. The Delhi government had then said it would introduce changes in the 2007 policy by the end of the year in order to make rules more stringent, but nothing has been done so far.

The new rules were meant to fix accountability of both transporters as well as the school authorities for the safety of children while being ferried to and from schools.

Tuesday's incident has alarmed parents across the city. ""There are no school transport facilities available in interior localities, and we have to opt for private vehicles. The government should make it mandatory for all schools to provide vehicles in each and every locality,"" Nupur Sharma, a parent from east Delhi's Trilokpuri, said.

Officials of several schools, however, said that parents themselves preferred private vehicles over school buses because of the ""low cost"" and ""doorstep pick up and drop"".

""We keep requesting parents to not put the lives of their children at stake by hiring private vehicles,"" Jyoti Arora, principal at Mount Abu School, said.

Meanwhile, Delhi traffic police prosecuted drivers and owners of 6,532 school vans for various offences between January and November 15 this year. In 2017, 2,183 owners and drivers of such vans were prosecuted.

However, the city's school cab association said the city government had promised them a notification regarding the waiver of road tax and parking charges for school vans, which has not been released yet.

""Registering their vehicles as school vans costs drivers much more than plying them as private vehicles, as parking charges and road tax are higher. In a meeting last year, the transport minister had agreed to waive off these charges. But no notification in this regard has been released so far,"" Jai Singh Chaudhry, vice-president, Delhi School Cabs Association, said.","40,000 illegal school vans plying across Delhi: Government","1005195124","2018-11-28","https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/40-000-illegal-school-vans-plying-across-delhi-government/story-RhFJf4ET6Xx4MX9JDp9xCO.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

"1610","","A day after the Centre asked the states and Union territories to go easy on children over homework and the weight of their school bags, parents and activists in the city said the state government has tough rules on the issue but their implementation continues to be tardy.

Parents say schools ask their children to bring extra books apart from routine timetable as they rush to complete portions. This adds to the load that students are carrying in their bags. The Union human resource development ministry has asked states to come up with norms of their own or follow the Maharashtra or Telangana models.

A parent from a Central school said, ""My daughter is in primary and she carries hardly four textbooks, but the size of those books is quite big. While they use worksheets, the weight of her bag is too much.""

The parent added, ""The school initially asked us not to give food from home in order to reduce the weight of school bag but her school canteen doesn't give healthy food. They have noodles and Chinese dishes that have left with upset tummy. So she carries tiffin which adds to the weight of her bag.""

According to a government order of 2017, the prescribed weight of school bags should be between 1,800 gm and 3,425 gm. Maharashtra's policy is that the weight of a bag should not exceed 10 per cent of a student's weight.

Jayant Jain of non-profit Forum for Fairness in Education said, ""The state education department has only formed a rule but it has not yet been implemented. The implementation will happen only when action is taken against schools that flout the norms. Students still carry heavy bags.

At a meeting of the deputy commissioners, chief executive officers (CEO) of zilla panchayat and the secretaries of all departments, Kumaraswamy was apprised by his ministerial colleague Sa Ra Mahesh over the poor quality of cycles being distributed to the 5.14 lakh students across the state.

Mahesh, at the meeting, told the CM that the cycles were so brittle that they became scrap within a few months of use. To this, Kumaraswamy sought an explanation from the education department principal secretary Shalini Rajneesh, who blamed the district officials of the department. He claimed that the companies provided samples of the best quality to them in Bengaluru, however, quality checks on the same were not taken up by the district level deputy directors for public instructions (DDPI), resulting in poor quality cycles being distributed to school children of class VIII to class X.

On hearing the explanation, CM Kumaraswamy directed the department to stop the supply of these poor quality cycles and halt all payments to the company supplying it.

Later, speaking to the media, Kumaraswamy said: ""There is a complaint over poor quality of cycles being supplied to the children, as a result of which I have directed the officials to hold a departmental inquiry into the matter.""

But according to sources in the meeting, there was also a debate over whether it was possible to cancel the scheme altogether considering the persistent problems with the cycle quality over the years and the burden on the state exchequer.

It is said that no sooner did Rajneesh appraise the CM of the reasons for the poor quality of cycles and Kumaraswamy directed the department to hold an inquiry, additional chief secretary (finance) I S N Prasad suggested that the government must consider the possibility of permanently shelving the scheme.

He said the scheme was serving no purpose to the students with poor quality and suppyl issues, with even the cycles procurement becoming more and more tedious and putting unnecessary burden on the state exchequer.

At present the state government is paying Rs 3,900 per cycle for girl students and Rs 3,600 per cycle for boys, with the total expenditure at Rs 185 crore.

""On hearing this suggestion, the CM directed Rajneesh to consider the possibility of even cancelling the scheme, if it is found unviable,"" said a official present at the meeting.

The scheme of supplying free cycles to students began in 2006-07, with former chief minister B S Yeddyurappa being the brainchild behind the scheme.

The scheme was primarily directed towards girl students who were traversing hilly regions and tough terrains without modes of transportation to their schools.

Soon after this, the government decided to extend the same scheme to boys. Both the schemes were extended to students studying between class VIII to class X.

Any move of cancelling the scheme may also create a political backlash as the scheme was launched by the current opposition party and was further extended by the Congress government over a period of 12 years.","Karnataka government to consider cancelling free cycle scheme for school children in state - Times of India","1004685985","2018-11-27","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-government-to-consider-cancelling-free-cycle-scheme-for-school-children-in-state/articleshow/66832026.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"1613","","The classroom inside the plan is fitted with an internet-enabled LED screen where senior students get YouTube lessons and the juniors watch cartoons and hear stories.(Rajesh Lawania)

Most students studying in government schools in India have never seen a plane, leave alone travelling in one. For 406 students of Government Senior Secondary School in Rajasthan's Indargarh village, too, it was a dream to sit in an airplane. A government engineer made this possible a few months ago by erecting a replica of a plane for a classroom in Alwar district. One class for all students is held in this special classroom inside the plane. The students feel so thrilled sitting in a plane that they don't want to go home even after school gets over.

""It has become a major attraction in the village,"" says principal Pushpa Meena. ""Even people from outside the village come here for posing in front of the plane. It has become a selfie point in the village,"" she adds.

Meena said recently after a wedding, the bride and groom came to the school for a photo shoot near the plane.

Until six months ago, the Indargarh government school, 16km from Alwar city, had a dilapidated building, broken classrooms, ceilings that leaked and an unattractive facade.

According to 2016 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey of schooling and learning levels in rural India, Rajasthan is among the top three states with highest dropout rate in children of 11 to 14 years. Against the all-India average of 3.5%, Rajasthan has 5% dropout rate in this age group.

Unattractive schools are a major reason for high dropout rates.

The district unit of Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) took up the renovation of the Indargarh school six months ago. SSA junior engineer Rajesh Lawania prepared a proposal for developing facilities at the school and constructing an airplane for a classroom. He approached Sehgal Foundation, a non-profit organisation that has developed 30 government schools in the district, with the project.

In six months, the foundation has spent Rs 45 lakh on the development of the Indargarh school, said foundation official Mahipal Singh.

The classroom inside the plan is fitted with an internet-enabled LED screen where senior students get YouTube lessons and the juniors watch cartoons and hear stories, said the principal.

""The school is already drawing new students. This year, we have had 22 new admissions. The plane classroom has started only this week. We hope to reap its benefits in the next academic session,"" she added.

""Kabhi nahi socha tha ki hawai jahaz me baithkar padhenge, yeh kisi sapne se kam nahi hai (We never thought we will ever sit in a plane. This is nothing short of a dream),"" said Priyanka Saini of Class 11. Her friends, Kanchala and Anju, couldn't agree more.

The villagers are happy with the development and feel a sense of ownership. ""We will look after the school. It has changed our vision towards a school,"" said Jatan Singh, a local.

Former sarpanch Ramjilal Meena said the gram panchayat was fortunate to have a school like this.

The plane has two entries with stairs to climb. There's pathway from the classrooms to the stairs with trees on both sides. ""We planted 1,100 plants to improve the landscape and make the campus children friendly,"" Lawania said.

The SSA engineer had earlier got classrooms of a government school painted like the coaches of a train. ""I am constantly thinking of innovations to make the schools attractive to increase enrolment and to check dropouts,"" he said.

Lawania said he has also never been inside a plane. He looked at YouTube videos to see the insides before designing the classroom.","Classroom inside 'plane' draws more students to this government school in Rajasthan","1004410699","2018-11-27","https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-viral/classroom-inside-plane-draws-more-students-to-this-government-school-in-rajasthan/story-p9ZpImwvatuFGp3lQBPWNP.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"1614","","has to be reduced/revised if it has to adhere to new weight standards

would have been the first state in the country to fix a standard bag weight for schoolchildren in 2016, but the plan did not materialise. With the Ministry of Human Resource Management (HRD) issuing a circular to all the state governments fixing school bag weight for each classes, the state government is in a fix. The problem is the state now has to revise the syllabus -- in fact reduce the contents considerably -- if it has to adhere to the new weight standards.

According to the HRD circular, it's 1.5 kg for Class I and II, 2-3kgs for Class III and V, 4 kg for Class VI and VII, 4.5 kg for Class VIII and IX and 5 kg for Class X. Experts and government officials say that while the plan for reducing the physical weight of the bag should be taken up, the question is how the content will be reduced. This means, the department of education (primary and secondary) will now have to take a robust plan to reduce the content in textbooks.

In 1993, the Yash Pal Committee identified the problem of heavy and recommended that textbooks be treated as school property. It wants schools to allot lockers for children in schools itself. It also mooted a separate timetable for homework and classwork so that kids don't take books home every day.

Bangalore Mirror, in July 2017 did a test run, which showed schoolchildren were carrying heavy load on their backs, with some cases some exceeding 11 kg.

International guidelines say children should not carry more than 10 per cent of their body weight on their shoulders. But BM's test run in 2017 showed that Class 8 student carried more than 5.6 kg.

In July 2015, the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of School Education and Literacy, sent out an order to the Karnataka Primary and Secondary Education department. The Centre had then suggested ways like keeping textbooks at school. Even the CBSE had issued a notification in April 2016, aimed at restricting the number of textbooks carried by students to school every day. But despite all this, nothing has changed on the ground.

VP Niranjanaradhya, who was part of a committee set up by the Department of State Educational Research and Training to suggest the right bag weight for students, said: ""We not only have to reduce the physical weight, but have to reduce academic burden as well. We cannot ask a Class 1 student to memorize and tell Mathematical Tables up to 100. We should stick to basics. There are so many things in our textbooks which are not necessary.""

A senior offical from Department of Education said, ""We have to reduce the content of textbooks now. Whatever is irrelevant needs to be cut down and for example, if a Class 3 student is carrying all textbooks which weigh 4 kg, then we should bring that weight down to just 3kgs. How to do that? By reducing the content and eventually the sizes of the book.""

Gopalakrishna, director of DSERT and Karnataka State Textbooks Society said, ""We already have research submissions and reports over the years. We are collating everything and preparing a draft.

The Bhasha Sangam programme, under the 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' project of the MHRD, will be followed in schools from November 20 to December 21, 2018, during which schoolchildren will be introduced to all 22 India languages of Schedule VIII of the Constitution.

The ministry has released a schedule marking dates for each language, and students have already been introduced to Assamese and Bengali on November 20 and 22, respectively. Next on the schedule is Bodo on November 26, and Dogri on November 27. Kannada is scheduled for introduction on November 30.

During the Bhasha Sangam programme, the school authorities have to introduce students to five sentences of the language fixed for that particular day/date by reading out the sentences in the morning assembly and asking the students to repeat them.

""We need to read out five simple short commonly-used sentences, for eg, what is your name, hello, how are you, etc. In case there are any students who know that particular language we can make them read out the sentences in the morning assembly,"" said a teacher from a government school in the city.

According to the notification issued by MHRD, this programme aims to enhance linguistic tolerance and respect, and promote national integration.

A digital book with audio recordings of the sentences is available on the websites http://epathshala.gov.in/ and the MHRD website http://mhrd.gov.in/bhashasangam so that students can hear the correct pronunciations.","Government school students to be introduced to 22 languages in a month","1001969978","2018-11-23","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2018/nov/23/government-school-students-to-be-introduced-to-22-languages-in-a-month-1902104.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"1616","","NEW DELHI: Quashing a popular belief, a report has revealed that students attending government schools in the national capital have better access to nutritious food than their counterparts in private schools. The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), which compiled the report titled Survey of Fruits, Vegetables and Juice Intake of School Children, Nutritionists and Dieticians, found that students in government schools consumed around 250 grams of vegetables in a day while those in private schools had only 210 grams.

The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, recommends that a person should consume at least 300 grams of vegetables a day. Of this, according to NIN guidelines, 50 grams each must constitute leafy vegetables and tubers, while 200 grams should be other vegetables. The institute also recommends intake of 100 grams of fresh fruits.

""Schoolchildren need maximum nutrition and deficiency of micronutrients leads to fatigued learning. Non-consumption of vegetables leads to deficiency of micronutrients, which significantly affects learning abilities. Hence, it is important for schoolchildren to have the required amount of vegetables (micronutrients),"" said Dr YG Deosthale, former director of NIN.

The ICRIER, as a part of the survey, studied the dietary habits of 98, 596 students across 36 government schools and 54 private schools in the city. The students were from Class V to Class XII.The survey found no significant difference in the intake of fruits and vegetables between girls and boys. ""More than 56 per cent students enrolled in Classes V to XII in Delhi-NCR consumed lesser green vegetables than what is mandated. And, only over one-fourth of the students ate fruits daily,"" the report said.

However, according to the report, students in private schools consumed more fruits that those enrolled in government schools. ""While 34 per cent of students enrolled in private schools ate fruits daily, only 25 per cent of those in government schools consumed fruits,"" the report said.

The principal of a private school said that it was not the school's duty to instruct kids on what to eat. ""Almost all students eat what they are told to by parents. What we can do is to make them aware of the benefits of healthy eating. But, in the end they will follow the dietary routine of their house,"" she said.

Last year during Teacher's Day celebration, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had announced that the State Government will provide free uniforms to both BPL and APL students studying in State-run schools. Earlier, only students belonging to BPL families were getting uniforms.

However, no funds were sanctioned under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) for purchasing uniforms for APL students. On the other hand, the SSA sanctioned '6.44 crore in the academic year of 2017-18 to procure uniforms for 1.61 lakh students. There are a total of 40,000 APL students in the district.

There are 1,381 government-run primary and upper primary schools in the district that get funds under SSA. Under the scheme, government spends '400 for two pairs of uniforms per child belonging to BPL category. As no funds were sanctioned for buying uniforms for APL students, the school management committees decided to divert some funds for the purpose.

Sources said there was verbal instruction by officials of the School and Mass Education department to do so. As a result, instead of spending '400 on buying two pairs of uniforms, the schools spent '120 to '150 to purchase one pair of substandard quality uniform for the BPL students. The remaining money was used to buy uniforms for APL students.

Sanatan Bhoi, a daily wager of Peteipur village, said the uniforms supplied by schools last year have already been damaged and only one set of uniform has been provided this year.

SSA District Project Coordinator Sapani Kumar Jena admitted that funds were diverted last year to buy uniforms for APL students. ""From the next academic year, uniforms will be provided to students of both the categories. We are expecting funds for uniforms to reach all government schools within a week's time.

"1619","","ERODE: A government primary school on Periyar Street here is perhaps the only one of its kind in the State: it is entirely English medium as parents want to enrol their children only in these classes. English medium classes were opened here eight years ago when the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa allowed their parallel sections from the first standard. Since then, the demand has increased and gradually, it became a fully English medium.

The school, established 158 years ago, used to be the primary section of the Government Girls Higher Secondary School at PS Park, Erode. In 2001, it was made a separate school with a separate head. Most primary schools in the State are run by local bodies. In fact, there are only 27 primary schools, including three in Erode district, directly under the government. Of the three in the district, two are in the city and one in Bhavanisagar.

When the present headmaster, V S Muthuramasamy, took charge, its strength was 72, but now there are 310 students, more than 200 of them being girls. It has 10 teachers, all of whom are postgraduates; three of them, including the headmaster, have an MPhil degree. However, Plus Two with DTEd is the basic qualification for teachers of primary schools.

All classes from the first to the fifth standard have two sections, each with 25-30 students. So, the school has just enough number of teachers.

Good infrastructure

The school now has enough infrastructure, like any private school, to attract parents. Earlier, when it did not have enough of them, former MLA of Erode East, V C Chandrakumar (2011-16), granted Rs 33.50 lakh from his MLA fund to construct a new, well-furnished three-classroom building in place of the old tiled building. The present MLA, K S Thennarasu granted Rs 10 lakh to lay a proper floor and dig a new borewell.

The RMSA office in the school was shifted to the CEO's Office and the building is now used to conduct classes. Using SSA and panchayat union funds, eight toilets and a noon-meal centre were constructed recently; a bicycle parking space was also created.

Erode West MLA K V Ramalingam, during a recent visit, agreed to help construct a compound wall with a good gate. With donations from the public, walls of all classrooms, both inside and outside, were painted with pictures of leaders, scientists, birds, animals, flowers, trees, alphabets, etc, to encourage children to learn about them. Also, panels with Tirukkurals written on them have been hung in the buildings.

English medium in govt schools will not harm Tamil

ERODE: ""ALL parents want to put their kids in English medium classes. I can't force them to enrol the children in Tamil medium. If I try to do that, they will go to other schools. And rules say admission

should not be refused to any child. Through parents' choice, all classes here are now English medium. There is no Tamil medium class,"" V S Muthuramsasmy, headmaster of the Government Primary School on Periyar Street in the city told Express.

""Having only English medium classes in the school is not wrong,"" said Muthuramsasmy, who is also district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Aarambapalli Aasiriyar Koottani. ""Parents are clamouring to see their children speak English. They send them to private schools, unmindful of the hefty fees, for it. If the government itself provides good English medium education, they will not spend so much money on private schools. In fact, only if this demand is met will the strength of government schools increase,"" he added.

Opening LKG and UKG sections in all government schools will not affect Tamil, he said. All students have to learn Tamil as the first language. Besides, many in Tamil medium students who score high marks in Plus Two find higher studies, all of which is in English medium, difficult. A student learning in English from the primary level will find higher education easier.

As all the teachers here are postgraduates, there is no difficulty in conducting classes in English. The English reading and writing skills the school's students are very good, said, teachers. Hearing some students - Saranya and Saravanan of the fourth standard and Dhanushka and Merlin of the fifth - read lessons from their English texts and explain the meaning in Tamil clearly, proved their claims. The books in English for other subjects were also easy.

In fact, the students find the Tamil textbooks harder. ""Spoken English classes are conducted using CDs. So the children learn the pronunciation easily,"" said Umamaheswari, a teacher. ""The school also arranges free classes for karate and music. The teachers are paid from the school fund. ID cards and diaries also are given free of cost to all students. As private schools collect Rs 20-40,000 for the same education at the primary level, many parents prefer this school.

It is the main reason that our strength is growing every year. Our aim is to make the school first in the State in all aspects in the coming years,"" she added. Attracted by the good high quality of education in this school, many parents pulled their children out of private schools and put them here.

The initiative has also provided the school with LCD projectors and laptops, enabling smart classrooms. The school's Headmistress, Tamil Arasi, notes how these have helped in increasing the enrollment rate in the school and getting children to attend classes regularly. ""These children are very keen to attend the robotics classes where they were taught about motors, the gear mechanism, lever and pulleys, which they learn practically. The attendance is high on Mondays and these children do not skip any class now,"" she notes.

In a complaint signed by the students from classes XI and XII and addressed to the principal, they said it was important to raise the issue for the future of other students in the school.

""This teacher looks at girls inappropriately and to some he has even asked obscene questions, the answer of which is not with anyone of us.

He, however, refused to divulge if the teacher has been found guilty, but claimed, ""It is not a case of sexual harassment."" Hence, the school has not filed any police complaint.

The students have threatened that if the school tries to suppress the matter, all girl students will stop attending classes.

Two teachers of Government Middle School in Kundal village, Fazilka, were issued transfer orders after six Class VI students alleged that they were forced to strip in front of their senior girl students (of Classes VII and VIII) after a sanitary napkin was found in the school's toilet.

The two teachers are Jyoti, the class teacher and Kuldeep Kaur, in-charge of the school. Jyoti has been transferred to a school in Khui Khera village and Kaur to Balluana in the same district.

The alleged incident happened on October 31. The six girls alleged that when a sanitary napkin was found in the school's toilet, the class teacher wanted to find out who had thrown it there without disposing of it in a bin. As per their complaint, she decided to take them to a vacant classroom, where she called some students of Classes VII and and VIII.

Abohar Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Poonam Singh said, ""The six girl students said they were asked to strip in front of their senior girl students and class teacher to find out who was using sanitary napkin that day. The girls' complaint came to me following which I constituted an inquiry which is being done by two principals of Government Senior Secondary Schools and as per the preliminary report of their inquiry, both teachers have been transferred. The final inquiry report will be submitted on Monday after taking the statement of the teachers. We have already taken statements of girl students and they will not be called again.""

Criticising Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's stance on the Sabarimala temple women's entry issue, K Muraleedharan, senior Congress leader and chairman of the KPCC's campaign committee, stated that CPM has never spearheaded any renaissance movement in Kerala whereas the Congress was at the helm of all social reforms.

""No chief minister can hope that he can destroy a temple's rituals and customs. It is not a government office where the government can intervene....it seems like he (Pinarayi Vijayan) wants to be spoken of in the same way as Chattambi Swami, Ayyankali and Sree Narayana Gurukkal but by his actions on Sabarimala so far, he has earned the right to be placed with Ravana, Duryodhana and Dusshasana, "" K Muraleedharan was quoted as saying by Manorama news.

K. Muraleedharan also said that Pinarayi Vijayan will have to pay a 'heavy price' if he continues to turn the temple into a battleground. Referring to recent attempts by women to enter the temple, Muraleedharan said they are individuals who led campaigns such as the 'Kiss of Love' in Kerala.

"1636","","NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has approved the nomination of Quality Council of India (QCI) for management of the school evaluation project being carried out by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR).

The council had to be nominated because, without it, Rs15 crore fund allotted for the project would have lapsed. The process of selecting the system integrator had to be otherwise done through competitive bidding.

Earlier, when the government had nominated Akshay Patra for the distribution of midday meals in government schools and asked former lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung for his approval for the allocation of land to build the kitchen, he had turned it down stating that no opportunity was to be given to other NGOs.

During the 2018 budget, a fund of Rs15 crore was allotted for the evaluation and ranking of over 5,000 schools, both government and private, on four broad parameters -- safety, teaching-learning, community participation and social inclusion. Earlier, DCPCR had said the results would be announced in November, but now, due to the delay in getting the system integrator, the date has been extended.

For the project, DCPCR had constituted working group comprising representatives from Directorate of Education, east, north and south corporations, New Delhi Municipal Council, SCERT/DIETs, Delhi Cantonment Board, private schools and civil society organisations.

At a meeting of the state advisory council held in September and the minutes of the meeting confirmed on October 10 that the decision to nominate QCI was taken.

As DCPCR also required a system integrator to develop mobile application, it is working with Bengaluru-based Mantra Social Services -- an NGO that works in the field of school evaluation on a pro-bono-basis.","Delhi government okays QCI for DCPCR school project - Times of India","981776146","2018-10-30","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-govt-okays-qci-for-dcpcr-school-project/articleshow/66421939.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

Having spent many years in Kerala, these workers can speak Malayalam. Now, the PTA and the public have come up with a project called Njangalum Vayikkum, which translates into ""we will also read"", to enhance reading skills.

The response to the programme has been good with 30 labourers enrolled in the scheme. PTA president P P Saidu Mohammed said the literacy programme would help migrant workers not only to communicate better, but also to interact more effectively with the locals.

""The migrant workforce is fast becoming the backbone of several sectors in the state,"" he pointed out.

The school authorities got support from Usman Koomanna, who helps migrant workers and teachers here communicate with others in a better way.

Through the camps, which are held during weekends at the school, the migrants are taught the basics of Malayalam.

Most of these 30 labourers hail from Odisha. Workers from West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, too, are taking the classes.

"1638","","MYSURU: It appears as though many government school teachers are more preoccupied with being transferred to schools of their choice as the annual transfer process is set to commence in November. While many private schools in the district have managed to complete 80% of the SSLC syllabus, students of government institutions are contending with prolonged truancy of their teachers. Consequently, a very significant amount of their syllabus has not been covered, leaving the students in a lurch.

The teachers have laid the blame squarely at the doors of the officials of the department of public instruction (DPI) for the protracted delay in finalising the transfer process. Sources in the Karnataka primary and secondary education department said that the process was initiated as early as December 2017, but stiff resistance from teachers unwilling to relocate to rural areas resulted in the delay.

An officer in the primary education department said, ""We will complete the transfer of primary school teachers by October 30, following which we will start the transfer process of high school teachers. As a result, many schools will not have teachers for various subjects till December, which might pose problems to SSLC students.""

That private schools were holding camps on how best to tackle SSLC examinations set the dire situation in state-run institutions in stark relief, he said. ""At government schools, students are more worried about, who their new teacher will be, whether he or she will complete the syllabus on time and if the teacher will continue where the previous one stopped, etc. In the absence of a full-time primary and secondary education minister, this is a fiasco. Students at government schools are likely to lose some marks owing to the delay in completion of syllabus,"" the official added.

President of the primary school teachers' association Basavaraj Gurikar attributed the delay in the transfer process to software glitches. ""We hope things change in the next few years and the process can be completed in a seamless manner, so as to avoid trouble for the students,"" said Gurikar.

Raghu Kumar, an SSLC student at a government high school in Mysuru city, said, ""The government must not let the students down. If a teacher is transferred in the middle of the academic year, it creates a lot of problems for the students. The government must ensure that such a situation does not arise next year.""

Deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru Mamata said that as many as 2,032 primary school teachers from across the district had sought transfer. ""The transfer of primary teachers was to be completed by October 22,"" said Mamata.

Former primary and secondary education minister and BSP leader N Mahesh told STOI that the delay was the result of a host of issues - the result of elections, confusion pertaining to additional teachers and technical glitches. ""It is unfortunate that students have to suffer. But, the department was also helpless in many cases,"" he added.","Government school students hit by delay in transfer process - Times of India","980300454","2018-10-28","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/government-school-students-hit-by-delay-in-transfer-process/articleshow/66398368.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

Top sources in the education department told TOI: ""Of the estimated 21 lakh students surveyed in classes 6-8, nearly 6 lakh students cannot do basic reading, writing or basic arithmetic.""

Basic reading and writing constitutes the child's ability to read simple sentences like: 'My name is Ramesh' or ""Gaay ghaas khay che"" (Gujarati for: A cow eats grass).

""They could not even do basic maths like answering 2+2=4; 3+7=10; 7-4=3,"" the official said.

This revelation on the shocking state of education was revealed in the seventh edition of the 'Gunotsav' drive, a study undertaken by the state government where primary school students are assessed to ascertain their levels of learning.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama admitted that the major learning gap was a cause of concern. He said that state was committed to turning the situation around.

""Gujarat is the only state that has assessed the problem. Once we knew the problem, we first initiated an out-of-box measure like Mission Vidya to remedy it. After this intervention, where earlier only five students in a class could read or write, now only 5 can't,"" said Chudasama.

Mission Vidya was launched recently by the Gujarat government, where teachers are asked to give 3 hours of extra classes to weak students for 35 days.

At the end of Mission Vidya, 43% of the weak students identified were able to read and write simple sentences and do basic maths.

Officials, however, admitted that the huge learning gap would need more than stop-gap interventions for quality to be improved.

Confirming this, State Forest, Ecology and Environment Minister R Shankar said, ""Considering the increasing level of pollution and decreasing number of trees, we have decided to encourage young minds to grow trees by educating them about the importance of nature.""

As per the proposal ready with the Forest Department, all children studying at government schools in the state in Classes 8, 9 and 10 will be given 10 saplings each free of cost. The children can plant them in the premises of the school, near their house or even on the sides of the road. However, after planting them, the children need to nurture them for the next three years.

The marks, however, will be based on how many plants will remain at the end of the third year when the children are in Class 10. People from the Forest Department will check on the plants once every six months. Explaining this, minister Shankar said, ""If the child manages to retain all the 10 saplings at the end of the third year, he or she will be awarded with internal marks of 10.""

"1647","","BENGALURU: Looks like teachers' transfers at primary and higher education level will not happen at all this year. The state government school teachers' transfers, which was stalled for a few days due to allegations of irregularities, and which was to begin from October 15, has got stuck with the code of conduct, as the dates for bypolls have been announced. Now, the teachers have decided to stage a protest on Wednesday over the delay.

As per the announcement made by the department of primary and secondary education, the entire transfer counselling process was supposed to be completed by November 23.

The last teachers' transfers at the school level were done during 2016. Out of the total 2.02 lakh primary and high school teachers and education department officials, as many as 60,000 of them have applied for mutual transfers and transfers on request. The department has received around 2,000 objections on the basis for which excess teachers have been identified.

Meanwhile, the government degree college lecturers' compulsory transfer which was notified a few weeks ago has also got stuck at the government level as there is no communication after receiving objections for the same from lecturers.

According to officials from the department of collegiate education, they have not received any reply from the government to go ahead with the process.","Bypolls, lack of communication stall transfers of Karnataka government school teachers","964860381","2018-10-09","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2018/oct/09/bypolls-lack-of-communication-stall-transfers-of-karnataka-government-school-teachers-1883076.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

"1649","","School Bus While school principals will be held responsible in case of any untoward incident in a school bus, no one is accountable for small vans and auto rickshaws that ferry students beyond their vehicle's seating capacity, allege educationists

On October 3, the Bombay High Court questioned the rationale of the state government behind permitting vehicles having a seating capacity of less than 13 to ply as a school bus, defying the central government's notification from last year that had defined ""school buses"" as vehicles that have a seating capacity of 13 passengers and more, excluding the driver. Earlier in August, the HC had summoned the additional commissioner of the Maharashtra transport department for issuing a resolution that nullified the order regulating school buses. The transport department had issued a circular on May 19 that allowed vehicles without 13 seats to ply as school buses.

While the alterations to school bus rules have irked the HC, they have raised many eyebrows. Doesn't the state government give two hoots about the safety of school children, ask concerned citizens.

While people want the government to take the issue seriously and school authorities to ensure complete compliance of vehicle safety norms, school managements grumble that even if they provide transport facilities, parents choose 'unsafe vehicles' for their kids.

When I compare today's scenario with my school days, I feel that quite a number of measures had taken by authorities to make school transport safe. But if we feel that the authorities are not doing enough, and our children are travelling via unsafe mode, we should immediately stop using them. Unsafe modes of school transport survive because of parents who just complain and not look for alternatives. -- Ankit Arora, Borivali

We need a policy that is holistic and takes care of all aspects. Having an attendant on the bus for the kid is a must. Not anyone and everyone should be allowed to drive a bus; they should be specially trained and have enough experience. Registration documents of the bus and details of its staff should be made available to parents. A background check of the bus staff before hiring is absolutely necessary. -- Yogita Gonji, Thane

The authorities and contractors who provide transportation facilities to school should ensure safe commute of children. However, I think that there's a dearth of rules and regulations which will make both school administration and bus operators more accountable, and I don't think the authorities are doing something about it. As of now no constructive step has been taken by the authorities to make commuting to school safe. -- Somesh Chowdhary, Andhwei West

The state government should come up with stringent rules guidelines for school bus since it is a question of our children's safety. It is also necessary that the existing rules and regulations are implemented strictly. Responsibility, however, does not lie with school authority and government alone. Parents should also play an important role in implementing the rules since it is for their children's safety. They should check that the school bus in which their children goes, is following all the rules and regulation set by the authorities. -- Smita Bhingarde, Jogeshwari

Safety is not defined by the seating capacity of the vehicle but on other factors like the experience of staff, adhering to traffic rules etc. The rule allowing 7-seater vehicles is the need of hour considering rising fuel cost. A 13-seater bus is financially viable only if all the seats are occupied. With only 5-6 students on a particular bus route, 13-seater bus becomes a liability. If the 7-seater vehicle is following safety norms, then I think it is always better to have a 7-seater option available. -- Neeta Lokhande, Navi Mumbai,

Ensuring safe school transport is one of the prime responsibilities of school authorities. There are many instances where loopholes in the transport system of the school had led to tragic unfortunate incidents. Just painting the buses and vans with yellow colour cannot be a justified solution. A background check of bus staff is a must. At times drivers work on a freelance basis without any authorized license which ultimately puts the future of small kids at stake. -- Bhavesh Sharma, Dahisar

Change has come, things are much better than what it was five years ago. However, I feel, much more can be done. Even with the rules in place, there is rampant over-crowding in the school vans and buses. Children need to have full seat to themselves to accommodate their schoolbags. Often two or more students are cramped in addition to the sanctioned capacity. Buses going over the speed limit and the fear of children getting injured inside the bus are a concern with many parents. -- Tejashri Bhingarde, Sewri

Buses that are run by the school management are functioning in accordance with the rules. They are spacious, have a supervisor and facilitate safe disembarkation and embarkation. The same cannot be said about the private vans. The driver alone can't supervise the kids. Even with grill doors, hard roof, fire extinguisher and other safety measures laid down by the state act, I feel that these vehicles are unsafe for children. -- Rashmi Sagvekar, Mulund

School authorities do not have any control over school transport unless it's owned by the school. Most of the schools across the city outsource bus service. Unless the police keep an eye on these buses on regular basis it will be difficult to expect full compliance of the safety norms on their part. In the majority of the mishaps, school authorities are held responsible to execute 100 per cent compliance of vehicle safety norms. Unfortunately, they do not have means to keep a check on these aberrations. -- Dr. Rajendra Pradhan, President, DS High School, Sion

Government is not doing enough to keep school transport safe. As per rules, autos carrying school kids should have grill doors. Most of the times the grill doors are missing in autos. I have complained about it to the police several times but in vein. What makes it worse is that they are not afraid of legal action. Our school management bears the expense of school bus driver and lady attendant, and our buses are as economical. Still parents choose unsafe vehicles for their kids. -- Raj Aloni, Principal, Ramsheth Thakur Public High School, Kharghar","Speak up Mumbai: Is Maharashtra government driving past school transport safety?","963943504","2018-10-08","https://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-speak-up-mumbai-is-maharashtra-government-driving-past-school-transport-safety-2672846","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE
"1650","","CHENNAI: The government school teachers are as competent as their counterparts in the costly private schools when it comes to subject expertise, as shown by the Teaching Professionals' Olympiads conducted in the last three years.

The results of Olympiad, conducted by the Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA) and Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, however, showed that teachers of private schools that charge an annual fee above '10,000 were better communicators.

The Olympiad tests teachers across the country for their competence in three broad parameters, subject expertise, classroom practice & professional competency and logical ability & communication.

The schools were categorised into government schools, low-cost private schools (annual fee less than '1,500) and costly private schools (annual fee above 10,000). The results of the Olympiad showed that the teachers in all three categories of schools had no significant difference in any of the parameters, except when it comes to communication.

""Communication is measured in terms of language, structure, sensitivity and comprehension. This includes parameters such as sensitivity towards children with special needs, gender agnostic expression, ability to communicate with clarity when speaking to parents among others,"" said Anjali Jain, founder-director of CENTA.

Teachers from schools that charge fees of over '10,000 scored about 63 per cent in communication, while teachers from government schools scored 48 per cent. Teachers from low-fee (below '1,500) private schools scored only 45 per cent. ""Government school teachers in Tamil Nadu are not deficient in any way in comparison with private school teachers. Private school teachers are better trained in coaching students for various exams when government school teachers are hard-bent on teaching the subject,"" defended G Arivoli, Joint Director of State Council of Educational Research.

Government school teachers in Tamil Nadu are largely on a par with national averages, said Anjali. For example, national averages in 2017 for classroom practice and professional competencies and logical ability and communication were 35 per cent, 38 per cent and 47 per cent respectively, while the same for Tamil Nadu government teachers were 32 per cent, 35 per cent and 41 per cent respectively.

"1654","","School bags Is the government complying with its own resolution, the HC wanted to know

The Bombay High Court on Wednesday asked the state government to file an affidavit explaining if it has been complying with its own Government Resolution, which enlists steps to be taken for reducing the weight of school bags.

A division bench of Justice BR Gavai and Justice MS Karnik were informed by advocate Nitesh Nevshe that since the resolution is passed, there has been no checks and balances. No school in the state has been penalised or even pulled up for not complying with the recommendations made in the resolution. He presented to the court information obtained under the Right to Information Act, which indicated complete non-compliance.

As per recommendations in the government resolution issued in 2015, schools have been directed to take various steps like using tablets, one textbook for allied subjects, provide lockers to keep books in schools, etc. The resolution was issued after a government-appointed committee noted the school bags were so heavy that 60 per cent of students below the age of 10 were suffering from orthopaedic and stress-induced ailments.

The arguments were made during the hearing of a public interest litigation filed by activist Swati Patil claiming state government is not taking steps to reduce the weight of school bags. The petitioner relied on a report of WHO which claimed children suffered various orthopaedic and other ailments because of heavy school bags.

Nevshe said, ""The resolution places the onus of implementation on schools and parents, but the state has not clarified the action it would take if it is not implemented by the schools. Or who in the government will be held accountable to oversee this implementation, because of which there is non-compliance.

A division bench of Acting Chief Justice Naresh Patil and Justice Girish Kulkarni said: ""This is not good and you (state) are in contrary to the law"". The observation was made after the court was informed that the Maharashtra Motor Vehicle Act, which the state government is relying on to push its claim of allowing lesser seating capacity vehicles, is yet to receive Presidential Assent.

Government Pleader Abinandan Vagyani informed the court that a proposal has been sent to the State Law and Judiciary department to study and opine on whether the government stand is contrary to the Central Motor Vehicle Act. Soon a meeting would be convened of transport officials to get clarity on the same. The court also asked the state government to continue its special drive to check violations in school buses.

Advocate Rama Subramaniam, appearing for NGO PTA United -- which has sought directions to authorities seeking implementation of motor vehicle rules to ensure the safety of children during travel to and from the school, said, ""The Central Motor vehicle Rules state that a school bus can be only which has a seating capacity of 13 and more.

The recent Supreme Court order -- denying mandatory linking of Aadhaar to bank accounts -- notwithstanding, the state education officers have been told to ensure that every government and zilla parishad school student has a bank account linked to Aadhaar.

"1659","","The Delhi government has sent school teachers and coordinators to countries such as Singapore, Finland and the US to get an exposure of the teaching methods adopted there.

As part of the many educational reforms introduced in the last three-plus years, the Delhi government sent 200 teachers to Singapore for a teacher-training programme.

Mail Today talked to six such teachers, who were part of the current batch (September 2017-August 2018), and have brought back with them a slew of innovative ideas such as 'Flipped Classrooms', reintroducing lesson planning, developing support material, 'think stations', 'Go MAD (Make a Difference)' project and CAL (Computer Aided Learning) labs.

Deepti Chawla, Rajikiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Yamuna Vihar; Kapila Parashar, Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Bhola Nath Nagar, Shahdara; Rashmi Grover, Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Anand Vihar; Gaurav Kumar, Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, Dwarka Sector 1; Neeru Lohiya, Government Girls Senior Secondary School Sector 4, RK Puram, and Kadambiri Lohiya, teacher/co-ordinator at Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Gandhi Nagar were among those who witnessed the advanced teaching methods at educational institutions in Singapore, as well as visited the Museum of Education, which showcases the evolution of the education system.

FOR TEACHERS

In the past, only a handful of school principals used to go on self-sponsored trips to foreign countries to observe their teaching methodologies and imparted the knowledge gained to their schools on return.

Two hundred teachers of government school were recently sent to Singapore for exposure.

The Delhi government came up with the idea of sending teachers, coordinators to countries such as Singapore, Finland and the US. The teachers became 'students' and observed the teaching procedures at Woodgrove Secondary School in Singapore, attended sessions with school mentors and learnt about new avenues of teaching that focus on student development, rather than reinforce rote learning.

Dispelling the idea that they went on a 'holiday', the teachers stated that the programme, which involved only selected educators, intensely grilled them.

""For the five-day workshop, held under the The National Institute of Education (NIE), a Singapore-based institution, the teachers were asked to apply from 2016 onwards,"" said Deepti Chawla.

She further said, ""There were rounds of interviews to identify the teachers from close to 1,100 government schools. Out of the thousand teachers who had applied, only 200 were selected.""

Giving a further glimpse into the meticulous selection method, Rashmi Grover said they were asked to undertake a psychometric test, followed by a group discussion.

""An interview was held with senior officials from the Directorate of Education (DoE) of Delhi government, which evaluated the teachers on ideation, teaching experience and ability to learn from discussions.""

Neeru Lohiya said this was the first time that teachers were sent for such programmes, and not heads of schools. ""But then, no proper feedback was taken from these heads of institutions,"" she added.

SAYING NO TO ROTE LEARNING

The participants in this programme learnt the different concepts of effectual teaching adopted by school teachers in Singapore.

Lohiya told Mail Today how the five-day programme involved teachers interacting with mentor teachers across select schools, where they were demonstrated different educational aspects employed by state-run schools to encourage students to learn.

The aim of the initiative is to make classrooms more participative.

Kapila Parashar said that the idea of rote learning is discouraged in Singapore schools and students are asked to tell teachers the lessons they would want to be taken up for the day.

The main focus in these schools is to promote student participation, impart vocational knowledge as well as academic knowledge, while giving students the space to freely come up with ideas.

IMPLEMENTING IDEAS OBSERVED ABROAD

Right after the successful implementation of 'Happiness Curriculum' for all students studying up to Class VIII, government schools are now working out schemes for implementing the ideas these teachers observed in the foreign schools.

Talking about the changes, Gaurav Kumar said, ""Many technological facets have been implemented in schools on a pilot basis, such as the use of K-Yan projectors.""

BRINGING ALL STUDENTS ON THE SAME PLATFORM

This year, the Delhi government, in a bid to identify academically weak students, and bring them on a par with their peers, launched Mission Buniyaad. This idea was also taken from the mentorship trip, said the teachers.

The programme, which was implemented across all government schools in Delhi, witnessed a positive outcome.

""The recent educational trip was an eye opener. Teachers observed a number of activities which they are making students undertake here,"" concluded Deepti Chawla.

STUDENTS LEAD IN A 'FLIPPED CLASSROOM'

A flipped classroom is defined as a type of exercise where instead of the teacher leading the class, students take the lead and explain the day's topic to their peers through different activities.

Practised commonly across schools in Singapore, the idea involves a strategy where students are asked to read through topics and explain these to their classmates.

This innovative idea, says Neeru Lohiya, from the Government Girls Senior Secondary School, RK Puram, is being implemented in her school. ""We ask students to come prepared from home. After they are done explaining, the teacher explains the topic to the class once again. This exercise requires the participation of all students in a class.""

Further explaining the concept, Lohiya says, ""Students are divided into small groups and one or two topics are assigned to them. This reduces the pressure on them as they don't need to mug up stuff. Throughout such sessions, the teacher sits at the back of the class and observes the students.""

In 'flipped classrooms', students are asked to come prepared and take classes and explain topic to their friends.

In a typical classroom, the teacher is the central figure who explains the entire lesson and responds to questions. In a Flipped Classroom model, roles are reversed, as students take on the responsibility of answering questions.

Class discussions are centred round the students. The method also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practising a concept by working on a problem set, for example, outside school through projects.

The main objective of a flipped classroom is to shift the attention from teacher to students where the students become the teacher and explain the lesson to their peers.

In a flipped classroom, lessons are taught via different mediums like plays or group discussions or videos. Class activities vary but may include - experiments, text analysis, debate or speech presentation, current event discussions, peer reviewing, project-based learning, and skill development or concept practice.

Through these activities, students get to spend more time on higher-order thinking skills such as problem solving.

This method also facilitates a more personal interaction between the teacher and students as well as active learning for the latter as they themselves get to participate in and evaluate their learning.

"2018","","This despite States increasing their budgets for school education in the past three years, says a study conducted across six States by two NGOs

State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers.","Hard lesson: funds not enough to attract teachers to government schools","1029553823","2018-12-30","https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hard-lesson-funds-not-enough-to-attract-teachers-to-government-schools/article25867438.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

He also ordered clearing of grazing grounds in different parts of the state from encroachments. In Agra, police had to intervene in at least six cases to free cows locked in schools and public health centres. On Saturday, villagers locked up stray cows in a school in Garhi Bachchi. A day earlier, cattle were locked up inside a primary school at Arela village in Etmadpur tehsil. Uttar Pradesh: Over 700 Stray Cows Locked in School, Health Centre in Aligarh.

"2020","","JHUNJHUNU (Rajasthan): Suman Bhadiya is a proud woman today. The young headmaster of Government Senior Secondary School in Lalpur Village of Rajasthan's Jhunjhunu District, explained how a lot of families here are now preferring government schools to private ones for their children.

Bhadiya, who took charge as headmaster only a year ago, told how implementation of various programmes helped increase student enrolment from less than 200 to 222 this year. ""Innovative ideas such as no-bag day on Saturdays, concepts like emotional pillars, and teacher-student bonding, have worked well. They have boosted enrolment at this government school,"" said Bhadiya.

She was able to overcome a lot of issues with support from Piramal Foundation for Education Leadership (PFEL). The foundation has been offering leadership training programmes to school heads, youths and education administrators in the government system, while improving various education processes and deploying tools and technology.

""The idea of transforming schools through 'Headmaster Leadership' triggered during the Gujarat earthquake relief operations in Kutch,"" said Aditya Natraj, founder of PFEL. ""I noticed that while everyone was fleeing the affected area, one government school headmaster went back to help his students. Without waiting for support from the government, he mobilised the community and resumed classes under a tree. It was evident that a highly motivated headmaster, with good leadership skills, is what it takes to cause a significant impact on student learning."" Natraj noticed that there leadership courses for school headmasters were available only for some private schools, and not for government schools.

Maniram Mandiwal, who took over as principal of JP Janu Senior Secondary school at Jhunjhunu in 2015, found his institute had infrastructure to accommodate 2,000 students -- from Class I to Class XII -- but had only 385 students.

"2021","","GUWAHATI: Fearing loss of annual administrative grants from the government for failing to enrol adequate number of students, state government-run schools of the state have embarked on a first-of-its-kind publicity campaign.

Following the mode of campaigns run by privately-managed educational institutions, government schools across the state have started a massive advertising campaign ahead of commencement of the new academic session on January 1, featuring achievements and facilities of the schools.

Sources in the education department said the state government's recent decision to provide annual administrative grants to schools on the basis of enrolled positions has added an impetus to this campaign.

Banners portraying facilities and accomplishments at entrances of schools has become a common sight. Some school authorities have also launched a social media campaign, named Utsav Vidyarambha, an annual enrolment drive conducted every year with the help of local community and students, to enhance enrolment in schools.

""From this year, the publicity campaign for Utsav Vidyarambha has been launched on a massive scale. The prime thrust is to change the prevailing notion of most guardians that the quality of education in the state-government schools are not at par with private schools. Let's spread the message that trained and qualified teachers are imparting education in government-run schools and the admissions as well as other facilities are totally free for the newly enrolled kids at the primary level,"" a senior official of the education department told TOI on Friday.

Checking the decrease in enrolment, something which was detected as a major worry in Gunotsav, is the primary agenda behind launching such a publicity campaign, he added.

As per the new guidelines, schools with enrolment of 60 or below will not get any financial support, schools having enrolment of 61 to 400 will get financial support of Rs 20,000, schools having enrolment of 401 to 600 will get financial support of Rs 25,000 and schools having enrolment of more than 600 will get financial support of Rs 35,000.","Government schools launch publicity campaign to attract students - Times of India","1028640152","2018-12-29","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/government-schools-launch-publicity-campaign-to-attract-students/articleshow/67295648.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

All 56 papers of 20 marks each, albeit a revision test, would serve as a mock exam just to give the students the feel of the Boards and also help students to understand areas they need to focus on. By December 31, all government schools under the DSE across the State will receive these papers.

""In the last exam most students failed in Math and Science so we have decided to focus on revisions.

"2023","","BENGALURU: Former chief minister and co-ordination committee chairman Siddaramaiah has crossed swords with Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy over his decision to introduce English medium in 1,000 government schools from the next academic year. Siddaramaiah took to Twitter to criticise the decision of the CM, saying, ""I have studied in Kannada medium till high school. Am I an idiot?""

The tweets come in the wake of a recent meeting of eminent Kannada writers and activists urging the state government to withdraw the decision and to teach English only as a language from primary classes.

In the first tweet on Thursday evening, Siddaramaiah wrote: ""We should have clarity on learning Kannada language and Kannada medium (of instruction). I have studied in Kannada medium till high school. Am I (Has it made me) an idiot? Kannada should be the sovereign language in Karnataka.""

In the second tweet, he said, ""Chief minister H D Kumaraswamy has said that 1,000 English medium schools will be started from the next academic year in the state. I will discuss this with him.""

"2024","","Veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah voicing his thoughts about cows taking precedence over a cop's murder in UP got the Hindutva firmament worked up, with the usual aspersions about his supposed 'anti-national' character being cast. Yet the evidence is mounting that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath cares more about the welfare of cows than people inhabiting his state. Consider his latest order that in case of encroachers on grazing land, the encroachments be removed immediately and strict action initiated against the accused. As Adityanath continued to drive his administration hard on ill-conceived cow schemes, irate farmers in Aligarh locked up stray cows inside classrooms while schoolchildren and teachers were left in the lurch.

In truth, the scale of the problem unleashed by Hindutva-inspired curbs on cattle trade is unmanageable. A 2012 livestock census found 3.9 crore cows in UP. Six years later, imagine many of these cows past their productive age roaming the countryside and cities in search of food. No government is in a position to earmark shelters or grazing lands for such a huge population. Adityanath's desperate search for cow welfare solutions is bound to fail and he must instead focus on the rising farm anger against stray cows now directed at government property like schools and hospitals. Even those encroaching grazing land deserve a better reason than stray cows to be asked to go.

Farmers have paid dearly for this proliferation of stray cows. Unable to sell unproductive cows and now struggling to fend off stray cows from fields, it has been a double whammy for them. Reviving the cattle trade will solve these problems. In light of growing agrarian distress BJP should not lose sight of the fact that it is humans, not cows, who will be voting at the hustings.","Adrift in UP: Locals park stray cows in schools, Adityanath conjures government schemes for cows","1027796415","2018-12-27","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/adrift-in-up-locals-park-stray-cows-in-schools-adityanath-conjures-government-schemes-for-cows/","The Times of India",FALSE
"2025","","Officials in the DoE said that they are planning to organise awareness campaigns among parents to motivate them to apply. (HT File)

After four rounds of admissions, less than a quarter of the 1,400 reserved seats on offer in the city's private schools for differently abled students were filled this year. This has prompted the government to carry forward the vacant seats to the next academic year.

Hindustan Times had reported last week that the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) had invited fresh online applications for 1,268 entry-level reserved seats for a fourth round of admissions to the current academic year which has just three months left.

On Wednesday, the draw of lots were held for these seats but only 123 were filled. The DoE cited ""lack of applications"" for the large number of seats going vacant.

""Of the 125 applications we received during the fresh round of admission, 123 candidates were absorbed. The selected candidates have to approach the allotted school on or before December 31,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said.

According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016, three per cent of the total number of seats meant for the economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) category are reserved for children with disabilities.

Goel said that the department will carry forward the remaining reserved seats to next academic session (2019-20). ""The seats will be counted in the category during next year's admission,"" he said. The notification of admission in the entry level classes under the 25% reserved seats for the EWS/DG category is likely to be announced in the first week of January, next year.

Officials in the DoE said that they are planning to organise awareness campaigns among parents to motivate them to apply.

""There is lack of awareness among parents about the reserved seats because this was the first time the quota was introduced within the 25% EWS/DG seats. We are planning to organise campaigns to aware parents from the coming admission session,"" an official said.

Experts, however, said that the ""lack of inclusiveness"" in schools make parents reluctant from applying. ""Though the situation in private schools is better than the government schools, parents of children with disabilities are still reluctant from applying there. They think their kids will only be able to adjust in special schools. More efforts need to be put in to make campuses more inclusive by appointing trained special educators and providing better infrastructure facilities,"" said Dr Satender Singh, disability rights activist.","Delhi government to carry forward 1,145 vacant seats reserved for differently abled in private schools","1027316930","2018-12-27","https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/delhi-government-to-carry-forward-1-145-vacant-seats-reserved-for-differently-abled-in-private-schools/story-33lvmCsQxUQcFjedEmlXrO.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

While rebuilding by the government agencies in different parts of the state is only in the initial stages, the UP and LP schools which remained half submerged in the flood waters for over five days suffering huge damage to their facilities, have come back to life. In the forefront of the effort to revive them was the Deepalaya Trust in Delhi which lost no time in identifying the devastated schools and offering its help.

In a commendable operation coordinated by A J Philip, Deepalaya executive officer and eminent journalist; Dr George Mathew, Chairman, Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi; and A J Abraham, social activist in Ernakulam, the rebuilding of the school started in right earnest in September itself and the work was completed within two months.

The so-called government red-tapes and delays were overcome with the strong support provided by the school authorities, including the AEO Latha, school headmaster V K Santhosh, panchayat president T G Anoop, Cartoonist Academy and the local people.

The Trust spent Rs 33 lakh in replacing the damaged computers, reconstructing the collapsed compound walls, removing the slush and debris from the compound and classrooms, laying tiles on the floors, painting the walls and re-equipping the library. Soon, other NGOs joined hands, including 'Human Values' and 'Rapid Response' of Pondicherry, which replaced the old furniture, desks and benches with modern ones.

Now the schools sport a completely new look and none who visits the place will realise that these were the ones the floods had ravaged only a few months ago. To celebrate its rejuvenation, the school organised a function on Saturday, which was attended by Sethu, writer and former chairman of South Indian Bank, Dr George Mathew, Cartoon Academy members, panchayat president, ward members, school children, parents, teachers and local people.","Good Samaritans come to the aid of flood-affected government schools in Kerala's Paravur","1026222258","2018-12-25","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2018/dec/25/a-symbol-of-rising-kerala-1916062.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

Manu Baligar, president, Kannada Sahitya Parishad, said, ""A delegation led by me will meet the CM in the next three-four days. Our objection is to making English a medium of instruction from the primary level.""

"2033","","These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students(HT File)

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

He said IIM Bangalore has also expressed willingness for a study of the reorganization process and its benefit.","Here's why Jharkhand government is planning to shut 6,646 schools","1023726410","2018-12-21","https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/here-s-why-jharkhand-government-is-planning-to-shut-6-646-schools/story-Dc4yti1lzbBXHu9p5rHfkK.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

Education department primary director Giriwar Dayal Singh suspended acting principal of GA Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya Meena Kumari at Lalganj block in Vaishali district and Kamlesh Kumar Swalambi of Uchha Vidyalaya Tenua at Kalyanpur block in East Champaran district after the district education officers of respective districts submitted a report in this connection.

In case of GA Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya, district education officer Sangita Sinha on her visit to the school found that the attendance register had caste of students mentioned before their names. The school also had separate sections for students belonging to separate castes. Acting principal Meera Kumari said, ""This practice was prevalent since 2014 and it was started by former principal Phool Chand Ansari as a tool to save time and quick implementation of government schemes catering to particular caste."" She added they had no intention of hurting the sentiments of anyone.

In case of Uchha Vidyalaya Tenua, no separate classroom was found. However, students had their castes mentioned before their names.

Calling the incident as unfortunate, state education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma said, ""Such things cannot be tolerated. CM Nitish Kumar is working for the welfare of the common people and we do not believe in caste and religion"". He also ruled out a report that one student Anjali Kuamri of GA Uchha Vidayalaya, who took the matter to Vaishali DEO was deprived of the benefits.

"2035","","NEW DELHI: After 'happiness' and 'cleanliness' curriculum, the Delhi government will now launch a special curriculum from the next session in its schools to motivate students to become entrepreneurs.

The 'entrepreneurship curriculum' will train the secondary and senior secondary students, from Class 9 to 12 before they start college. Explaining the rationale behind this curriculum at the first convocation of Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said, ""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers"".

The curriculum will be based on a four-fold framework -- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self-designed micro research, involve through local community, and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects.

Sisodia said, ""Barring few exceptions, once the child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary class, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package after completing education. This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful.""

""If our schools and colleges continue to churn out batches of students who are going to join the queue with the mindset of job seekers we will soon be left with very small number of job givers,"" he added.

While rooting out such illegal schools is something governments have to do on a war footing, the condition of some state-run schools in the city is no better. Buildings with roofs partially caved in, cracks running across walls, leaking ceilings, broken urinals in washrooms and crumbling walls are what several government schools serve to the hundreds of students who turn up for classes every day. District elementary education officer Prem Lata Yadav, when asked about the state of infrastructure of government-run schools in the city, said, ""The reason behind the poor condition of school buildings is lack of funds.

Across the building, the seepage is so heavy that during monsoons this year, the roof of one classroom collapsed,"" said Virender Singh, guest teacher.

TOI also spotted dogs roaming in the classrooms. ""This entire building is unsafe and unfit for tiny tots. Since there is no guard, cows wander in and take shelter inside at night. I'm not paid to clean up the dung,"" said Rahisa, the school's sole sanitation staff. Since the building was constructed in 1972, no teacher has spent more than a year in this school.

Shivji Park Primary School doesn't even have its own building. It operates out of Government Senior Secondary School Kadipur, whose classrooms are in a shambles.

The state's ambitious project of offering affordable international schooling to government schools, will be named after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. A funding of Rs 10 crore will be issued by the state government every year to the Maharashtra International Education Board (MIEB) which will run these schools.

The Maharashtra government's education department formed MIEB earlier this year. The objective is to bring government schools at par with international standards. While the plan is to create 100 such schools by helping existing government schools to affiliate to MIEB, the first 13 Zilla Parishad (ZP) schools have done this.

These ZP schools will now be called Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee International Schools.

"2041","","JAIPUR: Involvement of government teachers and education department officials in the recently concluded Vidhan Sabha polls for over ten days coupled with the formation of a new government is likely to delay the exams for classes V and VIII in government schools.

The District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) responsible for holding Class V exams has hinted that since the model code of conduct was in place since October, the examination process for about 20 lakh students has slowed down.

The involvement of teachers in elections has derailed the course schedule and examination process.

The exam for Class VIII is conducted by the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) which is already overburdened with class X and XII board exams and has expressed reluctance in taking up any additional responsibility.

""It has certainly affected the process but I am sure that teachers will complete the curriculum on time. Examination forms are being submitted in schools for both classes,"" said Arunesh Sinha, director of DIET, Jaipur.

Some officials shared the inside story. ""Since the model code of conduct is in place since October, the decision-making has become extremely slow. The system will not normalise until the new government is formed.

"2050","","BHUBANESWAR: Parents beware! Your ignorance at the time of admission may result in joining of your wards in unrecognised schools which in turn may make things worse for them. In the absence of adequate knowledge and awareness among the parents and guardians, sources said some students have already fallen into the trap of unauthorised private/public schools and faced problem while taking admission in other institutions or pursuing higher studies in the recent past.

With the number of such unauthorised schools mushrooming in various parts of the State, the Government has advised parents to remain alert and not admit their wards in schools not having 'No Objection Certificate' (NoC) issued by the competent authority. The Directorate of Secondary Education, functioning under the School and Mass Education (S&ME) department, has warned all parents in this regard.

""Complaints are being received from different quarters that some public schools are running unauthorisedly and due to lack of information, parents are admitting their wards in these institutions thereby causing problems for them,"" a notification issued by the Directorate said.

Meanwhile, a list of English medium schools having NoC has been prepared and notified by the Directorate. As per the list, only one English medium school each in Dhenkanal and Kendrapara have obtained NOC while two private schools have authorisation for admission of students in Nayagarh and Malkangiri districts.

Similarly, three private schools in Jagatsinghpur, four each in Kandhamal and Nuapada, six in Bhadrak, nine each in Angul, Balasore and Jajpur and seven in Kalahandi have been granted NoC. The number of public schools having NoC in the remaining districts is above 10, the notification stated. The Directorate has also warned strong action against unrecognised schools.

At the beginning of the 2018-19 academic session, the department had also issued a notice asking students and parents to remain careful about unrecognised institutions which were coming out with advertisements in print and electronic media for admission into higher secondary schools.","Odisha government 's advisory for parents on unrecognised schools","1015242495","2018-12-10","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2018/dec/10/govt-advisory-for-parents-on-unrecognised-schools-1909562.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"2052","","BENGALURU: Activists and parents are wary about the proposal on making government schools the first choice for enrolment under the Right to Education (RTE) Act from the coming academic year.

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

Education department officials admit that no new government school has been opened in the state in the past three years.

Citing a 2017 study by the RTE Forum, a national organization, which states that 90% of RTE students paid fees to private schools,Y Mariswamy, chairperson (in charge), Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, ""We get a lot of complaints from parents. It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE. As we are the monitoring body for RTE and as well as child protection laws, I feel this move will give a boost to government schools and put in place systems required in these institutions.""

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them.

"2055","","BENGALURU: The state cabinet on Wednesday gave its approval to amend the Right to Education (RTE) Act to ensure primacy of enrolment in government schools of Karnataka.

Emulating models of neighbouring states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the state government plans to amend the Act allowing parents to enrol children in private schools only if there are no government schools in the vicinity. The Act defines vicinity as a radius of 1km.

Briefing mediapersons after the cabinet meeting, state minister for law Krishna Byregowda said: ""The primary intention of RTE is to provide education to all class of students. For students from BPL families it is free of cost. Till date, Karnataka had allowed parents to admit children in private schools despite having government schools in the same neighbourhood. This has resulted in the enrolment ratio dropping drastically. We have decided to amend the RTE Act allowing parents to admit children in a private school only if there are no government schools in the vicinity.""

States like Kerala and Tamil Nadu already have such a law in place and it is said to have yielded positive results in terms of the number of students enroling in government schools.

The move to reduce admissions in private schools under RTE was first initiated in 2017 when then education minister Tanveer Sait had said the cost of educating children in private schools was a huge burden on the exchequer.

""In the past five years (2013-2017), the Karnataka government has spent over Rs 800 crore to educate children in private schools,"" Sait had said.

"2058","","BHUBANESWAR: After drawing flak from various quarters, the State Government has asked the district education officials to take steps for appointment of special educators in primary and upper primary schools to improve the standard of education for differently-abled children.

The Directorate of Elementary Education under the School and Mass Education (S&ME) department has issued an order to the District Education Officers (DEOs) and Block Education Officers (BEOs) in this regard seeking an action taken report at the earliest.

Sources said the move came after the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) intervened into the matter and asked the department to look into it. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, which came into force in 2016, has provisions for appointment of special educators in schools at primary and upper primary levels to improve the standard of education for children with special needs. As per provisions, the Government will ensure appointment of at least one special educator in each primary and upper primary school. However, not a single special educator has been appointed in these schools so far, sources added.

In June, the Secretary of Social Security and Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (SSEPD) had urged the S&ME department to implement the provisions and submit an action taken report in this regard. However, the department had failed to act, sources said.

Sources in the Directorate of the Elementary Education said there is a provision of '3,000 per year for every child with special needs studying in Government and Government-aided schools for his/her study materials and stipend.","Appoint special educators in schools: Odisha government to district officials","1009648046","2018-12-03","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2018/dec/03/appoint-spl-educators-in-schools-dist-officials-told-1906583.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"2059","","Most of us will agree that there is a role for government in facilitating the poorest of the poor to receive a good education. But this doesn't translate into government owning and running schools.

No matter which way one looks at it, there is no widespread market failure in school education. There is the matter of supporting poor children, but as far as the supply of high-quality supply is concerned, there is overwhelming evidence that the market is competent to do so without any government involvement.

On the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence of the failure of government education. As the Secretary to the government of Assam for Education in the early 1990s, I quickly became aware of how the Minister of Education (in a Congress government in my time) used the appointment and transfers of teachers as the key mechanism to extract bribes. The director of education of Assam was the conduit for this. The entire system was totally broken: many schools only existed on paper and ""teachers"" drew salaries when there was nothing on the ground.

The seriously misguided policy idea that the government must directly own and run schools came about as a result of a grievous error of analysis made by Lord Macaulay nearly two hundred years ago. This misconception continues till today among the ""educated"" who are not aware of the ground reality. The socialist Aam Aadmi Party's misplaced passion for government schools is one such example, and discuss my meeting on this issue with a senior AAP leader some other time.

The ""educated"" typically have a belief that parents won't send their children to school unless they are compelled by the state to do so. It is believed that given a chance, poor parents prefer to deploy their children as child labour. But the reality is that - as James Tooley's research has confirmed this fact that was well-known to many of us - all over India hundreds of millions of poor parents are sending their children to for-profit low-cost private schools. Roughly a third of India's poor children attend such schools.

Further, that some parents may indeed deploy their children as labour (extremely rare today) is actually the inevitable consequence of socialist policies that make parents view education dimly - as not being worthwhile since it won't improve their children's job prospects. There is a strong factual basis for this perception since millions of low quality ""graduates"", who are totally unsuited for the job market, are found unemployed today across India in second-tier towns and in the villages. Let's us, therefore, agree that there is no one more keenly interested in the welfare of their children than the parents. We must harness this powerful force instead of rejecting it.

Second, there is a mistaken belief that a school must have significant infrastructure and paraphernalia, or that its teachers must necessarily be ""highly qualified"". But as Gandhi said in a speech at Chatham House in 1931: ""the schools established after the European pattern were too expensive for the people"" and ""The village schools were not good enough for the British administrator, so he came out with his programme. Every school must have so much paraphernalia, building, and so forth"".

Gandhi, therefore, said: ""I defy anybody to fulfil a programme of compulsory primary education of these masses inside of a century. This very poor country of mine is ill able to sustain such an expensive method of education. Our State would revive the old village schoolmaster and dot every village with a school both for boys and girls"". What a brilliant thought! - except that there must not be any direct role for the state even in such schools.

James Tooley's book, The Beautiful Tree, shows that children who attend low cost for-profit private schools (including in India) achieve much higher educational outcomes than children from comparable government schools, despite such private schools having virtually no infrastructure and the teachers of such schools not even being ""adequately"" qualified. The reason these schools succeed while government schools fail is that teachers in the private schools are held to account for outcomes by the Principal, who is often the school owner. These for-profit undertakings depend critically on demonstrating real results in order to continue to get the custom of the poor parents who pay a small fee on a monthly basis and will quickly switch their child to a competing school if they don't' see significant progress each month.

Tooley's research enables us to totally dispense with the myth that government schools are required to educate children. This research has also confirmed Gandhi's assertion that excellent village schools operated in India prior to British rule. These schools functioned from the houses of the teachers, did not need a vast paraphernalia of infrastructure, and all sections of the community were able to send their children to these schools to avail high quality, low-cost education. In Shanti Niketan, Rabindranath Tagore was basically attempting to replicate this form of education, with a focus on learning and not on facilities or infrastructure.

Unfortunately, Macaulay's misplaced paternalism injected government into schools in India and was also copied by the UK, which had an entirely private (or local) school education system prior to that. In both cases, the effect was harmful, as the number of students and quality of education plummeted. Till today, an average government school across the world performs much worse than an average private school, barring a few exceptions.

We noted at the outset that the government must support the poor to access education - to ensure equality of opportunity. There is a simple and direct way to achieve this without owning and running schools, by providing vouchers of certain nominal value (depending on the income level of parents) for each poor child up to year 12 that can only be exchanged for school education (including for vocational education). This is our party's policy. These vouchers would enable the children of poor parents to attend a good for-profit private school.

The idea of vouchers has a long history and has also been tried out in a number of ways across the world, although not in the full-blown manner that's our party's policy. Milton Friedman is probably best known for his advocacy of this system but his ideas did not go far enough. He was willing to allow competition between private and government schools but our party does not see any role whatsoever for even a single government school. Our party is committed to the total privatisation of all government schools - in a well-structured manner.

The alignment of incentives when parents choose (and themselves fund, even if to a small extent) for-profit private schools is the best way to quickly and significantly improve India's dismal quality of school education.

Our party would, of course, remove most regulations in this area, such as requirements for infrastructure, playgrounds or even for the qualification of teachers. The market will determine who is best placed to teach. All we would require is that each school pick an affiliating board (such as CBSE, but that would need to be disbanded and private boards would emerge) and demonstrate high quality student outcomes in order to be eligible for the school vouchers. This would be an outcomes-based regulatory system, with detailed management (including things like the medium of instruction) left to schools and parents: the parties with the deepest direct interest in outcomes.

We therefore disagree with things like the Right to Education Act which we see as a socialist anachronism. India needs to fully liberate the education sector to allow the best private sector initiatives to emerge, unfettered by the misguided notions of any delusional (and mostly corrupt) bureaucrat or minister.

The government has sufficient core work to perform, in which it has repeatedly failed. When Indian governments can't deliver security and justice, how can they possibly deliver education? Today India is led by a government which can't distinguish between mythology and cosmetic surgery, between homeopathy and medicine. So what makes us think it can teach our children?","There is no role for government in owning and running schools","1008550133","2018-12-02","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/seeing-the-invisible/there-is-no-role-for-government-in-owning-and-running-schools/","The Times of India",FALSE

The government has given full powers to school authorities to seize the mobile phones if any students were found violating the order.

A Nov.22 circular, issued by the Department of Pre-University Education, says that the students of PU institutions coming under the PU Board, including government, aided and private colleges, are barred from using mobile phones during college.

"2067","","As much as 80% of students from the economically weaker sections in the city face corporal punishment, according to a report released by a Gurugram-based organisation on Tuesday.

The survey found that 88% students were allegedly beaten up, as a matter of routine, multiple times a week in some government schools, while in other government schools, around 30% experienced corporal punishment multiple times. All 50 students from low-cost public schools, who were part of the survey, reported that they were beaten up.

On an average, almost half of the children interviewed were allegedly beaten by teachers multiple times a week. The report, Choking Childhood, is based on the findings of research undertaken by social organisation Agrasar, which works with disadvantaged communities.

A total of 521 children and 100 parents sampled randomly were surveyed, and an informal group interview with 12 teachers from two different government schools was undertaken.

There are around 130 primary government schools in Gurugram, from which the students were randomly selected. There are around 18,000 students in the primary schools, as per estimates.

The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, prohibits 'physical punishment' & 'mental harassment' under Section 17(1) and makes it a punishable offence under Section 17(2).

""The report studies the impact of corporal punishment on the psyche of children who are doubly disadvantaged by virtue of them being children who are predominantly from poor migrant communities and first-generation learners,"" said Prerit Rana, co-founder and CEO of Agrasar. He added that corporal punishment in schools was not only a violation of human rights, but also impaired the health and education of the children.

According to the report, 70% of the children reported that they were beaten at home after parents learnt that they were beaten in school. More than 70% of the parents said that they beat their children, as they believe punishment is for their child's well being.

The report also outlined the challenging working conditions and lack of professional conduct among teachers in government schools fostered an environment that puts deprived children at risk of experiencing corporal punishment.

Responding to the findings of the report, Premlata Yadav, the district elementary education officer said, ""I will have to see the report to know how the survey was conducted. I do not agree with the findings of the report. One can expect 1-2% of such cases but it is incorrect to say that 80% of the children are beaten.""

Yadav added that teachers are not allowed to punish students and strict action is taken if such a complaint is raised. ""If we receive information of this nature, we warn the teachers and sometimes, it can also lead to their suspension. We take strict action on reports of corporal punishment,"" she said.

A Sanskrit teacher at a government school said that corporal punishment is rarely doled out. ""Teachers rarely beat students. However, sometimes children do not understand and teachers are compelled to take matters into their hands. I do not raise my hands at my students. I either ask them to do rounds of the ground with their hands raised up or call their parents,"" she said.","80% of students from EWS beaten in Gurugram government schools: Report","999808975","2018-11-21","https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurgaon/80-of-students-from-ews-beaten-in-gurugram-government-schools-report/story-auSmJj0RkOTmSBi8QwotRJ.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"2068","","HYDERABAD: The National Achievement Survey (NAS) second cycle data for class 10 students released by NCERT has put the focus again on quality of education being imparted in government schools. Subject-wise performance evaluation of students from government and private schools from the state, revealed the performance of government school students to be poorer than private schools in all districts, apart from Hyderabad where the performance was on par.

Looking at the data, it should not be a surprise that parents prefer shelling out more money in sending their children to private schools for education than government for better education. As per available data, more than half of the about 48 lakh students studying in various schools in Telangana, are studying in private schools.

For example, while the performance of students from government schools in Nalgonda was 31 per cent and 33 per cent in Mathematics and Science, it was 39 per cent and 40 percent respectively by private school students. Similarly, while the performance of government school students in Karimnagar in Social Science and English subjects was 38 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, it was 46 per cent and 56 per cent in private schools.

Only in Hyderabad, the difference between performance of government and private school students was not significant.

Urban-rural divide also deep

Significant difference in performance of students in various subjects has also been observed with respect to whether a student belongs to rural or urban area, indicating the disparity in quality of education received by students depending on where they belong from.

In the NAS it has been observed that in all districts of the state the performance of students in urban areas is higher than those from rural areas. For example, in Rangareddy district while the performance of students in Mathematics and Science in rural areas was found to be 33 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, in the urban areas it was 41 per cent in each subject. Similar is the case in all other districts.

Caste affects spoken English

The NAS also highlights the need for ensuring that education reaches every student equitably, regardless of the caste of the student. Significant difference has been found in the performance of students from the general category and those from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

A difference of almost 5-10 per cent was observed in the performances of students from general categories as compared to those from reserved categories. The difference was prominent in all the subjects that students study at the high school level.

However, the difference is most pronounced, as much as 15 per cent, in case of English language. For example, while the students belonging to the general category had an average performance percentage in Mathematics of 41 per cent while English had 50 per cent. On the other hand, among the students from Scheduled Castes it was 31 per cent and 35 per cent respectively.","Government, private schools worlds apart in Telangana, says NCERT","999370155","2018-11-20","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/nov/20/government-private-schools-worlds-apart-in-telangana-says-ncert-1900566.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

"2070","","Dr Raja Muzaffar Bhat

At a time when Government talks about ""Digital Literacy "" how is it possible that people especially students don't have access to electricity? Despite the obvious connection between electricity and educational achievement, however, the troubling scenes in Jammu and Kashmir are repeated as there are thousands of Government run schools without electricity. Present and past Governments in J&K, have been focusing on administrative affairs of education department or even pedagogy, but very little focus has been given to electricity in Government schools. The absence of focus on this issue is detrimental because, a study has put it like this, ""education is also widely recognized as one of the most essential components for poverty reduction"". Lack of electricity at primary, middle and secondary schools therefore creates considerable obstacles towards escaping poverty and correlates with many factors that contribute directly towards it. It is a big impediment towards digital literacy as well because when there is no electricity in a Government school, the children will have no access to computers and other digital equipment. The report on link between education and poverty assesses the direct link between electricity and education.

Based on the most recently available survey data from the World Bank and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the report first describes the current state of electrification of schools. According to the this data, roughly four out of every five primary and secondary schools in African countries (Govt and Private schools) surveyed lacked access to electricity, along with almost three quarters of village schools in India. This is much worst in Jammu & Kashmir state as more than 70 percent Government schools are un-electrified in this 21st century. When it comes to Kashmir division, more than 80 percent of Government schools are un electrified and these details I have been provided officially by several Chief Education Officer (CEOs) when I sought details under Right to Information Act (RTI). In Jammu province also the majority of Government schools in Rajouri , Poonch , Doda , Ramban , Reasi , Kishtwar and Doda are still un electrified.

Based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and policy literature concerning electricity and education, the report mentioned above assesses the educational benefits of electrification of primary and secondary schools, including lighting and access to information and communications technologies (ICT) as well improvement in staff retention and student completion and graduation rates. The final two main parts of the report, drawn from energy policy, development studies, and innovations in financing and public private partnerships literature, discuss the challenges facing school electrification, such as lack of financing and technical problems with equipment, along with the solutions and incentives with the potential to overcome them, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Rajouri , Srinagar

At a time when Government of India is celebrating achievement of 100 percent electrification feat across country, information available reveals some astonishing facts. As per the Government figures, there are 1720 Govt schools in Rajouri district and out of them 1484 (over 86 percent) don't have access to electricity. Out of 1720 Government schools in Rajouri district , there are 995 primary, 557 middle, 117 high and 41 higher secondary schools. In addition to these there are 6 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalyas (KGBV) across the district.

In Srinagar district, more than 300 Government schools have not been provided electricity connection by Government till date. More than two years have passed since Government had ordered to get all the schools electrified. In Srinagar there are around 519 Govt run schools out of which there are 204 primary schools, 211 middle schools, 74 high schools and 30 higher secondary schools. Out of the 519 Govt schools, there are around 305 schools which are still un electrified.

Budgam, Ganderbal

In Budgam district there are more than 81 percent Government run schools which are un-electrified. This is an official information that was provided to me by Chief Education Officer (CEO) of Budgam under RTI Act. CEO Budgam informed me in his reply that there are around 1,036 schools in the district out of total 1278 that are ""without proper electricity connection"". Actually I had sought the details of all the un electrified Govt schools in Kashmir valley under RTI Act. I filed application before the designated Public Information Officer (PIO) in the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK). Instead of providing the information , PIO passed the buck to all the Chief Education Officers (CEOs) of Kashmir valley plus Leh and Kargil . That is why I got the details from each district. I also sought information about the number of girls' schools without a toilet facility and the number of schools without a proper electricity connection, boundary wall and drinking water facility. CEO Budgam in his reply said that ""all"" the girls' schools had a washroom facility, ""there are dysfunctional toilets "".

In Ganderbal district out of 587 government schools, 434 schools are un electrified which means around 83 percent Government schools have no access to electricity. These details were revealed by Chief Education Officer (CEO) Ganderbal in a reply to my Right to Information (RTI) application.

Conclusion

Why is Government compromising on providing the basic infrastructure to Government schools while as no such compromise is done when it comes to perks and salaries of Government employees especially Govt school teachers ? Infrastructure and level of education is coming down in Govt schools , but this is not the case with Government's own employees ? Their salaries continue to be hiked. Govt spends more than Rs 1.40 lakhs every month on an average Government school in J&K. Do poor kids enrolled in these schools get the desired facilities ? On contrary to this, not even Rs 50,000 is spent on an average private school in J&K by local school management, but the results are quite different. Board of School Education (BOSE) collected an amount of Rs 16.81 crores from students in shape of exam fees in Kashmir valley recently, but the class Xth & XIIth students were forced to write exams under candle light as there is no facility of gen-sets in the exam centers. Not even heaters are made available in Govt schools (exam centers) by BOSE and children are made to shiver in the cold. I have been forced to seek intervention of J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) where I filed a petition recently.

I hope to get some good direction soon from SHRC. Imagine kind of trauma poor kids are facing in classrooms during June , July and August when temperature rises above 30 degree in valley and more than 40 in Jammu plains or in Rajouri , Ramban or Poonch districts ? After missing the initial deadline of May 2017, the Narendra Modi government on April 29th this year announced ""electrification"" of all inhabited villages in India has been completed.After having all the data available vis a vis un electrified schools in J&K , it clearly indicates that announcement by Government was largely symbolic. In a state where 75 to 80 percent Government schools are still un electrified how can Government claim to have achieved 100 percent electrification target ? How can Government claim to achieve digital literacy target in future if Govt schools are not electrified?

""My children go to a private school Madam, it is close to home, they learn English and mathematics"", says Selvi with a big smile on her face. Selvi, a Marathahalli-based domestic worker, like many others from low income households in Bangalore, finds private schools a better choice for her child.

Research has often pointed out that there is not much difference in the learning outcomes of children in government schools and in private schools. Yet in Bengaluru, like many urban centres in the country, children across income groups are flocking to private schools. While the number of private schools are rapidly rising, government schools are increasingly being merged/shut down in the name of low student enrolment. The narrative around government schools remains one of poor accountability and infrastructure, poorly trained or absent teachers, poor attendance and pass rates of students.

In 2016-17, Bangalore Urban had 1403 government schools, and almost thrice as many - 3426 - private schools. Student enrolments illustrate the trend better. That year, only 1.8 lakh children were enrolled in government schools, compared to nearly 11 lakh children in private schools.

The most commonly cited concern about government schools is the lack of sufficient, well-qualified teachers.

Dr V P Niranjan Aradhya, Programme Head (Right To Education) at the Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, points out that there were over 28,000 vacancies for government elementary school teachers in Karnataka as of 2016-17. ""The number of sanctioned posts was 1.94 lakh, but only 1.66 lakh teachers were working then. The department has been talking about plans to recruit teachers, but currently poorly-paid guest teachers are being appointed in many vacancies,"" he says.

Given the low rate of enrolment in government schools in the city, there are schools with only 10-15 students spread across grade 1-5, or schools that have only 30 students overall from class 1-7. Such schools often have only one or two teachers. These teachers have to teach every subject to students across all grades, even if they are not qualified for it, says Aradhya. Teachers are also burdened with additional duties and administrative tasks. There are even schools in the city that lack a Headmaster, requiring one among the skeletal teaching staff to do the additional administrative tasks of the HM.

Anurag Behar, Vice Chancellor at Azim Premji University, says the low quality of schools comes down to the poor quality of teacher education. Behar was part of the implementation committee for the Justice J S Verma Commission report on teacher education. The Justice Verma Commission, set up by the Supreme Court, had pointed out in its 2012 report that the majority of Teacher Education Institutions (TEI) in the country were highly commercial private establishments.

Behar says: ""In the 1960s, India had only about 1300 TEIs. In the early 1990s, it was about 1500. Then, between 1993 and 2011, this number rose to about 16,000. In this period, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) gave licenses to many private institutions that were fraudulent and corrupt; many of these institutions don't even hold classes."" He says that out of nearly 18,000 TEIs in the country now, about 92% are private.

Other issues pointed out by the Verma Commission Report include: teacher education curriculum remaining unchanged for over 65 years, TEIs being standalone institutions rather than being part of universities, the generalist nature of M.Ed programmes etc. The Commission had in fact reviewed 291 TEIs in Maharashtra, and recommended that 85% of these should be shut down.

Though much of the Commission's recommendations have been ignored, there have been a few initiatives such as the centre's budget announcement this year to introduce an integrated B.Ed course. ""But what about the existing 16,000-odd TEIs that are of low quality? Nothing much has been done about those,"" says Behar.

While shortage of qualified teachers is a major concern, both Aradhya and Behar say that teachers are not respected or incentivised enough in the education system. Teacher absenteeism - i.e., absence without a valid reason - has been blamed for much of the shortcomings of government schools.

But a 2016 study by Azim Premji Foundation (APF) across over 600 schools in six states including Karnataka, had shown that teacher absenteeism was only 2.5%. However, the overall teacher absence was around 19%, which was due to other administrative or departmental work they were assigned, trainings, or legitimate leaves; that is, teachers were absent due to systemic issues rather than a lack of professionalism.

The current system, wherein teachers' promotions are based entirely on tenure, hardly incentivises high-performing teachers as well.

Bengaluru's government schools are also affected by bureaucratic procedures like frequent teacher transfers. ""The transfer process is lengthy, and happens just a few months into the academic year. Events like elections can delay it even more. Neither the teacher nor the students would know if the teacher would remain in the school that year. This affects consistency in academic inputs,"" says Kapil Dawda, Bengaluru City Director for the non-profit Teach for India. Teach for India's fellows work as full-time teachers in low-income schools; currently they work with 24 government schools in the city.

Jean Boddu, Senior Program Manager at Mentor Together, another non-profit that works with government schools, says the distribution of bags and books to students also gets delayed by 2-3 months from the start of the academic year. ""Also, there is a huge dropout of students in 9th standard, as students who are academically weak are neglected, and fail exams."" Boddu says such students are not supported well enough as the school is worried that its 10th standard pass percentage may drop down if they continue there.

In terms of infrastructure, Bengaluru's government schools do have basic infrastructure like toilets and electricity, but in many cases the infrastructure is not functional. For example, schools that have toilets may lack water; or the toilet is kept locked. There is little investment in the operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. In Bengaluru, corporates have adopted many government schools, providing funds, books, infrastructure etc.

Dawda says that schools located in areas like Whitefield which have a high concentration of corporates, tend to have better essential infrastructure because of this. ""Government schools in these areas often have a science lab, computer lab etc., which schools in areas like Ejipura or Goripalya don't have,"" he says. Since such philanthropic work is not streamlined and coordinated by the Department of Public Instruction, the results are often skewed and less effective.

In education system, the Cluster Resource Person (CRP) who oversees some 10-12 government schools per cluster, is the academic authority, says Aradhya. ""CRP has to monitor the quality of learning process, but he usually ends up doing administrative work and collecting data from schools. Parents also don't know that it's the CRP they have to approach, to hold their child's school accountable,"" he says.

The Karnataka School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Council (KSQAAC) routinely assesses government schools in the state and accredits them. Schools have to undergo both a self-assessment and external assessment, and are graded on multiple aspects like learning achievement, learning environment and physical environment. They are then given accreditation in grades ranging from A+ to D.

The Council has routinely ranked schools poorly. In 2014-15, for example, it had assessed 1220 government schools, 917 aided schools and 24 unaided schools in the state. In Bangalore Urban overall (Bangalore North and South educational districts combined), out of 78 schools, no schools got A or A+ grade, and only eight got B+. Sixteen schools got B grade, 33 got C+, 17 got C and four schools got D grade.

Aradhya opines that the accreditation system is useless as long as there is no initiative to improve the quality of schools. ""If the government is providing functional infrastructure, recruiting teachers and monitoring the learning process in schools, then it has the right to give accreditation. Else, continuing this exercise without doing anything to improve quality, only sends the message that government schools are bad,"" he says.

While government schools compulsorily have to submit to the KSQAAC accreditation process, private schools are not bound to. In the current system, private schools can participate in the accreditation process if they want to, by paying a fee to KSQAAC. Very few usually do.

Currently there isn't a system to assess private schools on their quality. The majority of private schools in Bangalore are low-income schools without adequate infrastructure or well-qualified teachers. However parents are keen to send their children to these schools because of the English language education offered, and the general perception that these schools are better.

Accountability remains the core difference between public schools and private ones, according to Shashi Kumar D, General Secretary of KAMS (Associated Management of Private Schools in Karnataka). ""There are issues with private schools, they are not isolated from the problems of running a school. For example there may be a lacuna with the lessons offered, or the hire of unskilled teachers. But because of the pervasive accountability in these establishments the teachers increase their skills, knowledge and teaching ability,"" Kumar says.

However, research has often showed that there isn't much of a difference in the quality of education in government and private schools. World Bank's World Development Report 2018 says that, in the 40 countries it researched on, including India, there were no differences in the learning outcomes of children in private and public schools, given that they had matching familial backgrounds. Any marginal difference was because private schools mainly admitted students from advantaged backgrounds. That is, student performance depended on the student's household, and not the quality of education offered by the school. Another study by APF in rural Andhra Pradesh in 2015 had shown similar results.

Behar says, ""There would be less than 2% private schools that are elite and actually have the resources to run a high quality school. But even their quality of education is suspect. The remaining low-fee private schools are mostly much worse in quality."" Behar says there would be only 10-15% private schools that are truly committed to providing good quality education. ""For the rest, it is a business,"" he says.

Dr Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education Department), says that government school students often lack a good support system. ""First-generation school goers cannot study the way a typical private school student studies - by rote. There are no support systems for public school students, no remedies and no help at home. That is why, now we are attempting to bring a more holistic form of learning; and we are doing this along with NGOs across the city, like Akshara.""

Whether government schools will in fact get the right support, or whether they will continue to be shut down further in the name of low enrolment, remains to be seen.","What ails Bengaluru's government schools? |","993929392","2018-11-14","http://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/education-quality-in-bangalore-government-schools-deteriorating-28980","bengaluru.citizenmatters.in",FALSE
"2075","","HYDERABAD: While in the last four and a half years, the TRS government had undertaken several initiatives to improve the quality of education in government schools, various reports -- both government and private -- published recently makes it look like the State government has only been selling half-truths.

The government had introduced digital classrooms in high schools, infused of ICT as part of pedagogy, brought in subjects like robotics in residential schools, and most recently, made over government schools by turning their walls into canvases.

However, it seems their efforts don't prove much because the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), National Achievement Survey (NAS) by MHRD, and the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) have thoroughly highlighted the poor quality of government schools in Telangana, with respect to infrastructure as well as quality of education being imparted.

In fact, compared to the data published in the UDISE for the academic year 2014-15, this year's report revealed that not much has changed in government schools since TRS had come to power. One glaring example is that of computer availability in government schools, which has actually gone down to 36 percent from being 37.5 percent in 2014, as per the UDISE numbers. In secondary schools, it has increased slightly from 29 to 31 percent.

When it comes to matters of infrastructure in primary schools such as having boundary walls, single-room classrooms, playgrounds, and kitchen sheds, the data indicates stagnancy. While studies showed that there was a steady improvement in the performance of residential schools run by the social welfare department -- where just about 15 per cent of students studied -- other government schools like the zilla parishad schools were constantly ignored.

Another example is that of science laboratories in secondary schools. The percentage of schools having Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer and Maths labs have down to 17.6, 17.5, 16.9. 11.7 and 6.3 percent from 19.3, 19.2, 18.5, 12.7 and 8 percent respectively.

Poor quality of education

Various reports released in the last four years raised questions over the quality of education being imparted in government schools of Telangana. For example the NAS report released this year pointed out that performance of school students in Telangana in all the subjects was poorer than that of students from most districts of other southern states.

Even the Comptroller and Auditor General in its audit report released this year pulled up the Telangana government as it found that 14-26 percent children in primary schools and 21-47 percent children in upper primary schools scored less than 40 percent in the years 2014-17. It also pointed out issues like unhygienic conditions of kitchens in schools used for cooking midday meals.

TRS government can't walk the talk?

It's no news that the TRS government has never forgone an opportunity to talk about its achievements in residential educational institutions run by the social welfare department. Good performance of students in SSC exams, competitive exams, academic and extra-curricular initiatives has often been the talk of the town during TRS rule.

However, government teachers point out that these residential schools -- home to jus10 percent of the 22 lakh students enrolled in different government schools across the State -- are not run by the Department of School Education (DSE) and receive ample funds, as a result they deliver better results. The government is all-talk when it comes to these schools and mum when it comes schools that come under the DSE.

The stark difference could be seen in this year's SSC results as the pass percentage in residential schools was above 90 percent whereas in zilla parishad schools it was just about 75 percent.

Telangana State United Teachers Federation, general secretary, Chava Ravi, said, ""Around 20,000 teacher positions are vacant in government schools. The TRS government has not recruited a single teacher since 2014, even though the TRT was announced for 8,972 posts last year.""

""There are several schools where one to two teachers teach 5 classes and cover 18 subjects. Moreover, in this academic year, school maintenance funds have not been released yet by the State government and the amount is expected to go down with the merger of SSA (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan) and RMSA (Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan).

Negative marks for TRS government on school fee regulation issue : Parents

Parents across the State have been crying hoarse demanding fee regulation. The Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) has conducted many protests on this issue, including writing a post card to the Chief Minister and producing a song chiding him for not taking any action on the issue. The post even went viral on social media.

These protests and promises by the government -- especially the education minister -- notwithstanding, the TRS government has failed to address problems of exorbitant fee. The State government constituted a committee to look into the issue, headed by former Osmania University Vice Chancellor, Prof Tirupati Rao. The committee was formed in March 2017 and was supposed to submit its report in the next one month. It actually did so only in December. It's a year since the report was submitted, but it has not been made public yet. The government did not even form the district fee regulatory committees.","Despite measures here and there, quality of Telangana government schools poor, say studies","993753135","2018-11-13","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2018/nov/13/despite-measures-here-and-there-quality-of-telangana-government-schools-poor-say-studies-1897480.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

Furthermore, the bench directed the authorities concerned to file their counter affidavit by December 6. It also impleaded the Director of State Council for Education, Research and Training, as a party.

According to the petitioner, there are about 37,211 government schools, 8,403 government aided and 12,419 private self-financing schools, imparting education to about 1.25 crore students. Around 40 lakh students study in 12,419 private schools. The State spends Rs 27,000 crore for education per annum.

Although as per the State's education policy, English is taught as the second language from Class 2 to 12 in Tamil medium aided and unaided schools, despite having successfully completing Plus Two with high marks, a student was unable to speak or understand any communication in English.

Moreover, he was also unable to converse or write fluently in English.

This leads to communication problems for him when he pursues professional courses or higher education that are imparted only in English.

However, the students who study in CBSE schools find it easier to understand and communicate in English. Therefore, a need has arisen to lay emphasis on spoken English, said the petitioner.","Government advised to introduce spoken English in Tamil medium schools","993674360","2018-11-13","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/nov/13/government-advised-to-introduce-spoken-english-in-tamil-medium-schools-1897418.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

"2082","","Scotland only decriminalized homosexuality in 1980, 13 years after England and Wales. Yet it was ranked as the most gay-friendly and tolerant nation in Europe in the 2016 Rainbow Index compiled by campaign group ILGA-Europe. In what is being considered a world first, Scotland made it mandatory for government schools to teach LGBT+ issues in a move aimed at tackling homophobia and discrimination.

The government said schools would be required to adopt an ""LGBT+ inclusive"" curriculum, including tackling homophobia, biphobia and transphobia and promoting awareness of the history of LGBT+ movements.

""Scotland will become the first country in the world to have LGBTI inclusive education embedded in the curriculum,"" said a statement released on Thursday.

Deputy First Minister John Swinney added that it was ""vital the curriculum is as diverse as the young people who learn in our schools"".

Campaigners said the move sent a ""strong and clear message"" that LGBT+ pupils were valued in Scotland.

""This is a monumental victory for our campaign, and a historic moment,"" Jordan Daly of the Time for Inclusive Education Campaign, which had lobbied for the change, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""This sends a strong and clear message to LGBTI young people that they are valued here in Scotland.""

More than 40 percent of Scottish LGBT+ students said they had not been taught about issues concerning sexuality, according to a 2017 survey from British campaign group Stonewall.

Just 22 percent had learned about safe sex in relation to same-sex relationships, the study found.

""Under these new proposals, teachers will have access to the resources and training they need to create more inclusive learning environments and better support LGBT students,"" said Colin Macfarlane, director of Stonewall Scotland.

""In schools that teach about LGBT issues, LGBT young people are more likely to feel welcomed, safe and accepted.""

Scotland only decriminalized homosexuality in 1980, 13 years after England and Wales. Yet it was ranked as the most gay-friendly and tolerant nation in Europe in the 2016 Rainbow Index compiled by campaign group ILGA-Europe.

"2083","","They were an exuberant lot of ladies, all from the United Kingdom (UK) and a few other countries waiting in the reception area of The Green Hotel on Hunsur Road. Just that morning a few of them had visited the Government Urdu Higher Primary School at Nachanahalli Palya on Manandavadi Road and soon after lunch, nearly ten of them led by Dame Hilary Blume (Director, The Green Hotel and Founder, Charities Advisory Trust in UK) were ready to hop into the mini bus and visit a few more schools run by the Government of Karnataka.

As the bus drove towards the congested Kyathamaranahalli and entered a small lane, the women, who alighted from the bus, were surprised to see a clean, well-maintained Government Higher Primary School. There was a welcome committee with the Head Master of the School V. Ramaswamy, a disciplined, dedicated teacher and H. Saraswathi, the Director of RLHP (Rural Literacy and Health Programme) who is coordinating with Charities Advisory Trust, greeting the group of lively women.

Walking up a flight of stairs that led to the library of the school at the far end, the students, both boys and girls, all dressed neatly in green uniforms got up shyly but most of them immediately recognised the familiar of face of Dame Hilary Blume, who is no stranger to Mysuru.

""Do you recognise Madam Hilary?"" asked the Head Master and most of the students immediately recalled her earlier visit to the school. The library is well- equipped with books, desks and benches (all funded by the Charities Advisory Trust) and the visitors were keen to see how many students were really into reading the books.

A few of the students got up to demonstrate how helpful the reading habits they had been inculcated with had worked. A girl from eighth standard picked up a book in English and read without any mistakes in clear diction while a few others read from books in Kannada related to freedom fighters and scientists. Then they sang a few patriotic songs.

Now, it was the turn of the motley group of exuberant women, mostly in their sixties and seventies, to become children. They started singing the nursery rhyme for kids, 'Head, Shoulder, Knees and Toes.' Led by 'Good Giver' Annie Taylor, who had taught little children in Ethiopia, they began on a slow pitch and accelerated. The children who joined them sang with gusto and joy.

Impressed by the kind of work done by the school and RLHP, Hilary Blume asked the Head Master, what else they required for their school. He said that they needed a water filter and a LCD screen projector. She promised to install both through the profits earned in The Green Hotel.

""The profit of every meal eaten in The Green Hotel helps buy an egg for a child or for the books of children,"" she told SOM.

The children then wanted to know more about the visitors and they introduced themselves. There were two Elizabeths, one from Canada and another from England, both of whom were doctors. There was Ann Kingston, who was the knitting teacher for the ""Knit for Peace"" group and Danielle Liebech, who had visited The Green Hotel five times and there was also the young L. Marie, originally from France, who is working with Hilary Blume.

After a satisfying visit at Kyathamaranahalli, the group moved towards Sathagalli, where there is a slum and another Government Higher Primary School. It was around 4.30 pm. The RLHP runs a nutrition programme here in the school premises. A few of the infants and children were sitting there along with their mothers. A young woman, fondly called Akhila aunty by the Sathagalli slum residents, had brought ragi porridge which had a healthy mix of pulses and greens like drumstick leaves.

Along with the porridge, the kids were also given boiled eggs. A few of the mothers told this reporter how useful this programme was, as it had helped their malnourished children gain weight and improve their health.

Then right next door was the Government Higher Primary School where in the evening free supplementary classes are run for the children. Children in the age group of six to 14 were sitting there quietly waiting for the classes to begin.

All of them in unison welcomed the idea of the evening classes and how they were all happy to be there studying.

RLHP Director Saraswathi asked one of the students to get up and welcome the visitors. A tenth standard student B.B. Mehak got up and welcomed the group. This girl, who is the Malala Yousafzai, (Nobel Laureate from Pakistan who is an activist for female education) of Mysuru, had stopped a child marriage in her area a couple of years ago.

One of the teachers, Seema, was a child labourer, who used to roll agarbathis. But today she has completed her Pre-University education because of the support of RLHP and Charities Advisory Trust.

The slum children here are so vibrant that when they were asked to sing a song, four girls got up and began singing Jalle Kabbu..., a folk song in faultless Kannada and dancing to choreographed steps. Asked for their names, they said Luhia, Simran, Husna and Rafia.

Everyone was moved by the effort that had gone into preparing the deprived sections of the society to face the world boldly.

""The Charities Advisory Trust is supporting many causes including the beauticians' course, nutrition programme, sponsoring health camps from the funds collected through Good Gift India. Their focus is also on libraries and they have helped setting it up in nearly 100 Government Higher Primary Schools,"" said Saraswathi.

Later, speaking to Star of Mysore, Hilary Blume said that 'Knit for Peace' is an initiative of the Charities Advisory Trust started as an income generation project for Hutu and Tutsi widows, victims of the Rwandan genocide and civil war.

""At our suggestion, the widows knitted school jumpers for the many orphans and we paid them by raising funds through featuring the project in Good Gift Catalogue, another of the Trust's initiative,"" said Hilary Blume.

""Good Gifts is an initiative started by me. This is a concept where the giver knows exactly where the money goes. Hence, we came out with Good Gifts Catalogue where people can identify with a range of causes; in fact, there are over 400 ways to help people take their first step out of poverty, enjoy better health and increased opportunities,"" she said and added, ""I ask the givers to come and see how the concept works. That is how I bring such people to visit Mysuru to see the schools and slums and how the money they have given is spent. Our next visit with the 'Knit for Peace' group is in early January,"" she said

Asked whether she believed like many others who are doing charity work that charity is also a business, Hilary Blume said, ""These are causes that I was introduced to, and continue to support, as I believe in them. I believe that once I give money, then the money is out of my hands to control. So it is important that I can trust those organisations I support. Administration is critical to keep a charity going, but too many big charities waste too much money.""

On whether she has written any books on charity having worked for more than 40 years in the field, she recalled five books titled, 'Fund Raising - A Comprehensive Handbook,' 'Accounting and Financial Management for Charities,' 'Charity Trading Handbook,' 'Museum Trading Handbook' and 'Charity Shop Handbook' she has written. Hilary Blume also revealed that she is penning the sixth one now called 'The Ethics of Charity Giving.'","UK-based Charities Advisory Trust at work in State Government Schools - Star of Mysore","990398090","2018-11-09","https://starofmysore.com/uk-based-charities-advisory-trust-at-work-in-state-government-schools/","starofmysore.com",FALSE
"2084","","While there are thousands of schools in India's state capital, there isn't a system to evaluate them relative to each other. However, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), a state government department constituted under the Child Rights Act of 2005, aims to change this.

Next month, the DCPCR will undertake a rigorous assessment of 5,800 schools in the capital -- all of which are administered by the state government's education ministry and/or New Delhi's three municipal corporations- as a precursor to creating the country's first ever 'School Development Index' for a state.

Owing to the sheer number of schools involved and data required, earlier indices compiled by the government have focussed on the state or districts as a whole rather than individual schools.

Unde the School Development Index, Delhi's schools will be ranked according to three parameters, as devised by the Adhyayan Foundation - an NGO that focuses on capacity building of schools.

The first parameter is safety and security, the second is teaching and learning outcomes while the third parameter is community participation and social integration. Each school will be given a rank between 1 to 4 for each criteria, with 1 indicating that it has the most room for improvement.

The assessment of Delhi's schools is expected to continue into next year, with a final report from the DCPCR due in May. The government body has made sure to clarify that the exercise is not a punitive one but an instructive one. The exercise will give the administrators of these schools an insight into best practices and facilitate an environment for collaboration.

Education has long been a priority for the current state government of Delhi. When contesting state elections for Delhi in 2015, the made the improvement of education outcomes one of the core aspects of their platform.

So far, it seems that they have kept their word. For example, in July this year, the government launched libraries in 100 primary schools in the city, in addition to a 100 last year. In June, it announced the planned launch of a ' happiness curriculum' in government schools, which involves meditation and life skills training. They have also instituted school management committees, improved the infrastructure of schools and invested in teacher training.","The state government of India's capital New Delhi is all set to rank 5,800 schools in the city  --  the first such evaluation exercise of its kind","988445656","2018-11-07","https://www.businessinsider.in/the-state-government-of-indias-capital-new-delhi-is-all-set-to-rank-5800-schools-in-the-city-the-first-such-evaluation-exercise-of-its-kind/articleshow/66534731.cms","businessinsider.in",FALSE

The resolution, issued on November 1, has also directed education inspectors to check attendance records of students who were given admission under the 25 per cent quota of the RTE Act before disbursing reimbursements to the schools.

The education official also claimed the provision of not reimbursing schools that are built on government land has always been in place, although its mention has been formalised thanks to the government resolution.

"2088","","One student is making a drone, another a dancing robot. Scenes from two government schools in Delhi

The walls of the entryway of the school are covered with bright charts that talk about everything from sustainable development and 'Swachh Bharat' to 'happiness goals' and exam schedules. The cream-coloured floor gleams and the sun peeps out from the clouds behind the rows of students -- dupattas pinned, shirts tucked in, not a hair out of place -- sitting quietly for morning assembly. It's 8 a.m. on a hazy Delhi morning and this school in Dwarka Sector 10 is about to flip my perception of government schools completely.

""Government schools in India get a bad rap,"" says Principal T.P. Singh. ""But with RPVV, we try to do better."" The results are evident. The Dwarka branch of RPVV or Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, along with its counterparts in Lajpat Nagar and Rohini Sector 11, are the three schools from Delhi that have made it to the nationwide list of top 12 government schools that's been compiled by EducationWorld portal as part of its India School Rankings 2017-18. In fact, the Dwarka school tops the list, with the Lajpat Nagar and Rohini schools at No. 6 and No. 12, respectively.

Labs and libraries

The RPVV schools, a Delhi government initiative to provide quality education to marginalised sections, were first opened in 1997, with one each in Rohini, Paschim Vihar and Surajmal Vihar. Twenty-one years later, there are 22 schools, with five of them launched last year alone.

All of them boast of language labs, upgraded auditoriums, relatively well-stocked libraries and, most importantly, a teacher-student ratio of 1:35. They take in students from Classes VI to XII and admissions are through an entrance test. Students are eligible only if they have studied in a government school for a minimum of two years.

When RPVVs were started as schools for high performers, they had the same shortcomings as other government schools -- poor infrastructure, undefined learning outcomes, dated teaching methods. ""But the last four or five years have seen a lot of change,"" says geography teacher Neerja Lamba, who has been with the school since 2003. ""We have a stress-free learning and teaching environment now. There are cultural activities and exchange programmes; students want to come to school,"" she says. Singh points out that the Delhi government has given the schools a free hand for improvements. ""For example, for any expenditure below ₹50,000, I don't have to write to the government. Little things like this make it so much easier.""

Over the past four years, the Delhi government has steadily increased funding for education, from 20% budgetary allocation in 2015 to 23.5% in 2017 and 26% in 2018.

The schools' improved infrastructure is testament to that. In the Dwarka branch, there's a fully air-conditioned auditorium, a conference hall open to both teachers and students, and a spanking new running track that instantly catches the eye. The labs have the latest equipment; there's a 'project development' room where students are recycling paper; and there are working water purifiers on every floor.

Robot Gangnam Style

The change is nowhere more perceptible than in the Rohini Sector 11 school, halfway across the city, where I find Class X student Prashant Kumar elbow-deep in a half-built drone. He is working after school hours in what the school calls the 'Atal Tinkering Lab'. ""I'm pretty sure I can get it to fly in a day or two; I just need to stabilise the gyro sensor,"" Kumar says confidently. His supervisor Vivek smiles behind him. ""That's going to need another month or two,"" he says. Close by, Class XII student Pratham Chopra's robot is dancing to 'Gangnam Style'. The coding took four months, says Chopra.

In the corner there is an actual 3D printer, the table around it littered with prototypes of printed whistles. The design's final version is now being used by the school's PT teachers. Science teacher Sadaf Fathima shows us a keychain printed in the shape of her name. The lab is the school's pride and joy, set up as part of the Central government's Atal Innovation Mission. Nearly 10,000 schools across the country applied for the grant, and RPVV-Rohini was among those to bag it in the first round.

Food, water, lessons

The one-year-old lab has sparked an interest in science among students, helping also to bring more girls in, say teachers. There are only three girls in the Class XII science stream this year, but the trend is beginning to slowly change in the younger classes, they say.

Social sciences teacher Shivani Singh says such facilities help immensely to address one of the biggest

problems of government schools: dropouts. In the Dwarka school, 63% of students come from families with monthly incomes below ₹5,000; their parents are rickshaw-pullers, labourers, sweepers, tailors, mechanics, domestic help, etc. When these students come into Class VI, they are undernourished, unable to take home school work, and, in some cases, have to contribute to the household income by taking up odd jobs.

But even as the dropout rate in Delhi government schools has been increasing, from 2.9% in 2014-15 to 3.4% in 2016-17 (Praja.org study), with worse results in municipal corporation schools, the RPVVs don't have any dropouts. ""Children want to do more than just study from textbooks. The 'more' is what we provide,"" says Shivani. ""They get clean water and nutritious food like dal chawal, daliya porridge, poori-sabzi. Girls get sanitary napkins,"" she says.

Walking through the school's corridors, both at Dwarka and Rohini, there is a steady stream of 'good morning' greetings around us. The students, free for the day after a gruelling exam, are not reticent and engage with their teachers comfortably. ""That took a lot of hard work,"" says Principal Singh. It was not just academics but also student-teacher relationships that needed overhauling. From improving teachers' listening and communication skills to newer teaching methods and learning objectives, ""we needed a change in pedagogy,"" says Singh.

A new pedagogy

It was this need that led him to begin the Cluster Leadership Development Programme, running now in all schools under the Directorate of Education in Delhi. ""We select 10 or so principals, area-wise, and get them to work with a facilitator-trainer. The principals, in turn, go back to their schools and work with the teachers,"" he says.

This has reduced teacher-student conflict, Singh says. ""And communication skills among students have improved; it's not great, but it's much better than what it used to be.""

The clubs and extra-curricular activities also play a big role. RPVV Rohini, for instance, has a Legal Advocacy Club where lawyers and judges address the children once a month. The Bal Bhavan Kendra is an arts and crafts initiative sponsored by the government's National Bal Bhavan in addition to regular art classes. I find a classroom filled with Madhubani paintings, wall hangings, home decor items, and more.

"2089","","HYDERABAD: What started as an attempt to salvage government schools, soon became a hit among parents. The decision to convert hundreds of primary schools into English medium schools in districts like Karimnagar, Warangal and Nizamabad by teachers and its success led to the government giving the official nod to other schools across the State to follow suit.

As expected the enrolment rate in government schools has shot up. But the education experts think that despite the change in medium of instruction, it has had little effect on learning outcomes of government school students.

In 2016-17, for instance, 4,872 schools in the State were given permission to convert to English medium. Earlier back in 2008, in the united Andhra Pradesh, for the first time the then government had granted permission to run high schools with parallel mediums - 5,500 in Andhra and 2,200 Telagana area.

A social audit of learning outcomes carried out on 1,302 students from Class V to X by Campaign for Learning Outcomes, released last week confirmed this belief. It revealed that while 650 students could neither read nor write English, 271 could read only small sentences but not entire paragraphs.

Problem of parallel medium

Apart from granting the approval for change of medium of instruction, teaching community alleges, that the government did little to ensure that the move actually benefits students. In fact, the decision to run two parallel mediums is part of the problem. With the teacher-student ratio dismal in government schools, forcing one teacher to handle not just several classes but to even teach in two different languages.

""Most teachers are from Telugu medium background so for the sake for convenience they end up teaching in Telugu. Also, they find it difficult to alternate between Telugu in one period and English in the next. Students are not able to get acquainted with the language"" said T Venkateshwar Rao, President, English Language Teachers Association.

Proper training needed

The problem is further compounded by insufficient training of the lack thereof. For instance, in 2016, select primary teachers were provided five-day English language training. This was supplemented a year later by another five-day training for the same set of teachers.

""Now only a couple of teachers are trained from each school and later they too were transferred. Last academic year in Warangal, teachers from 132 primary schools have been trained but soon they got transferred to Telugu medium schools. This beats the very purpose of having English medium schools,"" said Nagati Narayana, an educationist.

Since a number of teachers themselves took the initiative to start classes in English medium and when it started showing positive results, teachers feel the government became complacent.

"2091","","Teachers at government schools across Delhi on Monday announced they would be going on an 'indefinite strike' from November 20 demanding their safety at schools. The move comes two days after a government school teacher was assaulted with a metal rod by a student in Saket because the teacher reprimanded him over low attendance.

On Monday, the government schools teachers' association (GSTA) held a meeting attended by hundreds of teachers to raise concerns over their security at school campuses. ""Teachers at government schools are suffering because of the government's apathy. Saturday's incident was not the first time when a teacher was assaulted by a student.

Singh said the teachers will be sitting on a strike outside Delhi Secretariat from November 20. ""We will not call off the sit-in till we are given a written assurance from the government,"" he said.

Sanjay Goel, director of the Delhi government's Directorate of Education (DoE) said he will meet the teachers and discuss their issues soon. ""How can we give protection to teachers from students? We cannot deploy security guards inside classrooms. We will anyway discuss what they want us to do,"" he said.

Teachers, however, said that the government should itself decide what measures can be taken for their safety. ""The government cannot deprive us from our right to live a dignified life. We are not here to be humiliated and assaulted by students and their parents,"" Singh said.

In September, a government school teacher was injured when a chunk of roof fell on her head.

"2093","","KOZHIKODE: Time's up for CBSE schools which have been functioning as a law unto themselves after obtaining the mandatory No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the state government. The revamped 'CBSE Affiliation Bye-Laws 2018', brought out recently by the board has given more control to the state government over the functioning of such schools and also upcoming ones in the state.

The new bye-laws have also designated the state as the 'appropriate government' which would solely decide if the existing 1,300 CBSE schools in the state, as well as those in the pipeline, meet the prescribed norms in terms of infrastructure, safety, sanitation and land ownership. ""The CBSE would not re-check any aspects vetted by the state government during its inspection of schools,"" the bye-laws state.

The state government has also been given the power to bring in regulations on fees levied in CBSE schools. As per the bye-laws, fees would be charged as per the regulation of the appropriate government (state) and fee revision shall be subject to its laws, regulations and directions.

The 'Recognition' clause

Moreover, CBSE's insistence on 'recognition certificate' would be another crucial aspect which would enable the state government to make errant CBSE schools fall in line. Though CBSE schools in Kerala obtained a one-year relaxation from the board, all 1,300 plus schools will have to obtain it fairly soon from the state. ""Earlier, once the NOC was obtained, we had no business with the state government. We only needed to renew our affiliation every three years with the CBSE. Now, the state can cancel the NOC and prescribe a new set of rules while granting fresh NOC or during issuance of recognition certificate,"" said the manager of a leading CBSE school.

Kerala CBSE School Managements Association general secretary Indira Rajan said the new bye-laws have reduced procedural delay in getting affiliation. ""If the school managements have concerns about the state government getting a decisive role in affiliation process, it can be addressed through dialogue with all stakeholders,"" she said.

'NOC a policy matter'

General Education Secretary A Shajahan said the grant of NOC to CBSE schools is a 'policy decision' which needs to be taken at the highest level. Since the LDF Government assumed power, fresh NOC has not been granted to any CBSE school. Aggrieved school managements had taken legal recourse and obtained a court verdict that schools which meet the prescribed norms are eligible for NOC.

""The government is planning to approach the court seeking more time for implementation of the order.

She was speaking at an event organised to sensitise government schools about people like Nikita under the Purple Board project, being implemented by the Society for Peoples' Awareness Care and Empowerment (SPACE) in collaboration with the Directorate of Education and supported by the embassy of the Netherlands.

The first phase of the project, targeted at the ones in a leadership position, will create awareness among principals and teach them about gender identities, including transgenders and homosexuals, and issues like Article 377. On Tuesday, the principals were encouraged to designate one toilet in their school as a unisex one, to frame anti-trans bullying rules and to organise multi-gender activities in their institutions.

Santosh Gupta, principal of a Seelampur school, admitted that for inclusive education, it was important to embrace the transgender community. ""I agree that education is the only way in which we can empower people from disadvantaged communities. Along with us, it is also important that the parents are included in this awareness programme,"" said Gupta.

In another phase, sensitisation events will be held for the nodal teachers of a school and then for the secondary students of the schools involved. Following this, a school that is determined to be ""trans friendly"" will be given an award.

Sanjay Goel, director, DOE, asked the principals to accept people from gender communities and work for their empowerment. ""They have their own way of living and they should be accepted as an important part of inclusive education,"" said Goel.

Meanwhile, lauding the government for accommodating of the rights of transgender, Anjaan Joshi of SPACE pointed out that people belonging to that community faced several hurdles. ""The first and the foremost of the problems is there is no separate column for the third gender in school forms.

The project will be implemented jointly with the Social Justice Department.

As part of its first step, the state government will start 1,000 pre-primary schools in the state with adequate facilities and necessary infrastructure by coordinating with the available anganwadis in the vicinity of government schools.

The schools will give stress on educating children through activities, games without using text books or slates. However, the government could not give a timeframe as to when it start the new system owing to delay in the release of fund from the Union Government. The schools will focus on a unified child-friendly curriculum encompassing physical, social, intellectual, and emotional development of the child.

The General Education Department has also decided to provide space for anganwadis in government schools where excess accommodation was available and pre-primary school was not functioning.

SCERT Director J Prasad told Express that the new curriculum will focus on activity cards rather than using textbooks.

""In an effort to make the pre-primary education system scientific, we are introducing a new curriculum. As part of this, we have already started activity cards named 'Kalithoni'. The cards have 30 different themes and the first part is the collection of 10 themes.

""The cards aim at children's physical, creative, language, scientific and social and emotional development. Besides children, the new programme will also benefit the pre-primary school teachers"", Prasad said.

He, however, is apprehensive about the fund for implementing the project. ""We had long back submitted a project report to the union government for the funds.

""Apart from benefiting the children, it could also help to give a good pay to the teachers. The engaging of pre-primary staff by the PTAs could not be termed as statutory appointments by the government.

""Therefore, their claim for salary was not sustainable. Similarly, employees in the government sector, such as anganwadi workers, helpers and alternative school teachers, were paid only honorarium.

Rural Development Ministry data shows access to highest level of school education remains a concern, only 6.57 per cent villages have up to senior secondary schools.

New Delhi: Over 14 per cent of villages in India don't have schools, while as many as 10 states in the country have over 15 per cent such villages, shows the latest data available with the Rural Development Ministry.

Collected under Mission Antyodaya, the data also shows that around 47 per cent villages have schools only up to the primary level.

The comprehensive data, an assessment of village-level infrastructure facilities and amenities across states and Union Territories, is currently available for 5,27,507 villages and 2.3 lakh gram panchayats.

Apart from the 75,613 (14.33 per cent) villages that don't have schools, data shows 21 per cent villages have up to middle level schools (Classes 6 to 8), around 11 per cent have up to high schools (Classes 9 and 10) and only 6.57 per cent have up to senior secondary schools (Classes 11 and 12).

The ministry's aim behind collecting village-wise data is to identify gaps in villages based on the set parameters to ensure targeted development and execution of schemes.

Ten states -- Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Manipur, Goa, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- are worse off than the national average, with over 15 per cent villages reporting no school at all.

Mizoram, Kerala and Gujarat, meanwhile, have less than 2 per cent villages with no schools.

Kerala also does exceedingly well with respect to higher education, with senior secondary schools available in as many as 80 per cent villages, and 11 per cent villages reporting at least up to high school level. This implies that the state has less than 10 per cent villages which have schools only up to middle or primary level.

The poorest performers at senior secondary level school education are Odisha, Nagaland and Jharkhand, with only 1.7 per cent, 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent villages, respectively, with such schools.

Ministry officials explain that the data is only for villages and not at the Gram Panchayat level -- which usually has a cluster of villages under it. The ministry hasn't yet collected Gram Panchayat-level data.

Effectively, this means that the 14 per cent villages that don't have schools might have one in a neighbouring village. This also implies that access to school education may not be as difficult.

"2535","","Bus accident - Gujarat Recent mishaps involving private picnic buses claimed lives of children

Close on the heels of accidents involving buses, in which a number of school children lost their lives and many others were injured, the state government on Wednesday banned school picnic buses from plying at night.

Eight children from Surat were killed and several others were injured when a private bus they were travelling in fell into a 300-feet deep gorge in Dangs on Saturday night. They had gone to Dangs for a picnic. In another incident, a bus conductor died and 24 children of a school in Ahmedabad were injured when their bus rammed into a tree in Godhra in the wee hours of Tuesday.

Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel told reporters that the decision had been taken during the weekly meeting of the state cabinet, presided over by chief minister Vijay Rupani.

""Our government has decided to impose a ban on buses with school children from plying between 11pm and 6am to avoid accidents such as these in the future,"" Patel said.

The deputy CM said the decision had been taken bearing in mind the safety of children.

""The bus operators will be required to stop the journey during night time. They will also have to make lodging and boarding arrangements for children,"" he further added.

Chief secretary Dr JN Singh said, ""The issue was discussed with utter sincerity in the cabinet. The government has made it mandatory for school authorities to get sanction from concerned RTO office for educational tours. The RTO will assess the condition of the vehicle for transportation and number of students travelling on the bus viz-a-viz capacity of the vehicle.""

In case of both accidents, private luxury buses had been hired for picnics. In the first case, the bus was hired by a tuition class. Eight children and two others were killed in the accident in Dangs. In the second one, one person was killed and two dozen children were injured when the bus, returning from a picnic in Madhya Pradesh, met with an accident near Godhra.

The Ahmedabad RTO released a circular saying that all tour operators will have to abide by the new rules and that the number of children can't exceed the total capacity of the vehicle. The RTO also announced that strict measures would be taken against those tour operators who flout rules.","Gujarat govt bans school picnic buses plying at night","1027158933","2018-12-27","https://www.dnaindia.com/ahmedabad/report-gujarat-govt-bans-school-picnic-buses-plying-at-night-2700801","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE

"2537","","Lucknow, December 26: Aggrieved by the inaction of civic authorities, farmers in Aligarh district locked over 800 cows inside a government school and a primary healthcare centre on Tuesday. The bovines were later freed by the police personnel, who carried them in trucks to the nearest gaushala.

Farmers in Gorai and Tamautiya villages of Aligarh were forced to lock up the cows as several acres of farmlands have been destroyed by the bovines, left stray by their owners after they no longer yielded milk. Cow Slaughter, Banned by UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Creates Bovine Menace in State.

Speaking to reporters, the local farmers in Tamautiya said they are forced to remain awake throughout the nights in their fields to prevent the stray cattle from eating the the near-ready to harvest crops.

The number of bovines have multiplied exponentially over the past couple of years, since the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP was elected to power. The state government has rigorously enforced a ban on the slaughter of cows and cow progeny.

Apart from the government-enforced ban, vigilantes affiliated to some right-wing groups have been involved in attacks on cattle traders -- which has forced many of them to abandon their animals.

The incident on Tuesday in Aligarh led to a brief law and order violation as well, as the police team which arrived to free the cattle and take them to the nearest gaushala faced protests, including stone-pelting. The demonstrators were mobilised through a WhatsApp rumour claiming that the cows are being sent for slaughter.

The situation was brought under control, said said senior police officer Ajay Kumar Sahni, adding that four miscreants have been arrested.","UP: Over 800 Cows Shut Inside Govt School, Health Centre by Aligarh Farmers to Protect Crops | LatestLY","1026774837","2018-12-26","https://www.latestly.com/india/news/up-over-800-cows-shut-inside-govt-school-health-centre-by-aligarh-farmers-to-protect-crops-559009.html","Latestly",FALSE

"2540","","Kolkata, Dec 26 (PTI) In order to raise awarness about obesity-prevention among students, the West Bengal Education Department has decided to introduce lessons in the school curriculum on the importance of maintaining healthy lifestyles for addressing the health problem, a senior official said. The course will be implemented from the primary education level for which disbursal of funds have already started, he said.

Besides imparting theoretical knowledge, the curriculum would also highlight the practical aspect of tackling obesity such as the necessity of physical activity, regular measurement of certain parameters and eating healthy food, the official said. Teachers will be taught to induce among students the habit of practising yoga to prevent obesity. The teachers in turn will teach the students, he said.

""The lessons will explain the necessity of regularly monitoring certain parameters like blood pressure, blood sugar and body weight. The first two factors have an intimate relation with obesity. ""All these will be explained in the curriculum to raise the awareness level of the students, which will eventually help their parents know about the basic things about obesity,"" the official told PTI.

In fact, measurement of blood pressure, blood sugar and body weight should be regularly done among school students, he said.

""The instruments for measuring these parameters will be bought by the schools from funds provided by the department, mainly meant for this purpose,"" he said.

The department has already purchased sphygmomanometer and stethoscope for measuring blood pressure, he stated.

Weighing machines, skinfold callipers for determining state of obesity and glucometer for measuring blood sugar have also been purchased, he said. ""The teachers will be trained by physicians in handling the instruments. They will also be taught about the impact of blood pressure, blood sugar and how obesity can be controlled or prevented through controlling food habits and regular exercising,"" he said.

"2541","","The Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) has proposed that the central government deploy two fulltime counsellors in each school.

WITH 49 student suicides reported over the last five years from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas across India, the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) has proposed that the central government deploy two fulltime counsellors in each school, NVS Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh tells Ritika Chopra. Excerpts:

Close to 50 suicides in five years. Is there something that the JNVs are doing wrong?

Student suicides in JNVs have to be understood in the context of the social background and psychological make-up of the children who study here. Entering the (Navodaya) system is a big change for them. There is a world of difference between rural life and life in a Navodaya Vidyalaya. I think we need a specialised set-up to help children acclimatise.

Although we have a system in place, it is not a specialised set-up. Our teachers are working hard on this front, but you have to acknowledge that one JNV teacher is responsible for 80 kids in a school. Raising even two children is a big challenge for parents these days. The teachers have largely succeeded (in helping students acclimatise), but there have been incidents of suicides.

Have you identified the main reasons behind the suicides?

Advertising

As I have mentioned already, the culture shock that a village boy or girl experiences after joining a JNV is a big reason. This is probably why suicides peak in July, August and September, which is right after the two-month summer break. The second peak period is exam season, January and February. Unrequited love and a hostile relationship between parents also drive students to an early grave. Lastly, corporal punishment or humiliation suffered at the hand of a teacher is also a reason why suicides have happened in the past.

Read: Suicides in Navodaya schools: 49 in 5 years, half of them Dalit and tribal students

What are you doing to stem these deaths?

Instead of leaving a chunk of teaching to the last few months before the exams, we have asked teachers to complete the syllabus by November, so that students have enough time to cope with stress. We are keen on engaging at least two counsellors in each school and we have recently submitted a proposal to this effect to the HRD Ministry.

We also noticed that a majority of suicides is by boys. This is probably because there are not any full-time wardens for the boys' hostels. The girls' hostel has had matrons since 1993. In the last one year, we have tried recruiting ex-servicemen as wardens, but there are not enough candidates. We have decided to not restrict the post to ex-servicemen.

Has the government agreed to the proposal on employing full-time counsellors in JNVs?

The proposal we sent involves an expenditure of Rs 56 to 60 crore every year. It is very expensive. So we are now looking at achieving the objective in an economical way. The fact remains that we do not require counsellors throughout the day. So now, there are two thoughts. First, why not have reputed institutions, which can be available on an on-call basis or which can counsel students online? Second, we could assign a counsellor to a cluster of five schools.

What do you do after a suicide to help other JNV students cope with the tragedy? Are they counselled?

Our school principals have certain amount of contingency fund, which can be used to hire a professional, but in general that does not happen. Usually, we depute teachers from other schools to ensure that they speak to the students so that they are not scared.

In many cases, JNV principals and teachers have been either suspended or transferred after a suicide for not being able to spot change in a child's behaviour or tell-tale signs of depression. They feel it's unfair to expect the overburdened employees to know what's going on in every child's mind. Your comment.

Advertising

When you head an institution you have to responsible and accountable. We have acted against principals and House Masters only in cases where we noticed they haven't discharged their duties properly. In 2017, a child in a JNV in Haryana committed suicide because a classmate didn't reciprocate his feelings. In such a case, the school authorities cannot claim they weren't aware of the change in the child's behaviour. The children are in our custody and the teachers should have known what the boy was going through. In a residential set-up, it is wrong for a teacher to think that their duty is only to teach. Also, should we not act in cases of corporal punishment? These incidents warranted action. We are not trying to harass teachers. Before any action there are two levels of inquiries.","Navodaya Vidyalayas Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh: 'Have proposed that govt deploy two full-time counsellors in each school'","1025968766","2018-12-24","https://indianexpress.com/article/india/navodaya-vidyalayas-commissioner-bishwajit-kumar-singh-interview-on-suicides-dalit-tribal-students-5508388/","The Indian Express",FALSE
"2542","","It is biting cold on a winter morning. Children are trickling in to a government primary school in Raipur, in sub-urban Dehradun, and jostling for space on jute mats spread inside the classrooms as well as outside the classes on the school premises.

The school has 144 students but does not have a single piece of furniture or boundary wall on one side, posing a security threat.

The administrative work of the school is managed by a teacher as it doesn't have a principal. The former principal passed away in 2017 and no appointment was made since then.

This is one among several schools in the state that are struggling without basic necessities.

State education minister Arvind Pandey has been pushing for better facilities for students in government schools, but they are still a distant dream for many schools in the state.

According to the education department data for 2017-2018, out of 1,412 schools in Dehradun, 649 schools do not have a playground, 329 schools do not have ramp facilities or boundary walls, and fencing is missing in 117 schools.

Sunita Rawat, the teacher in charge of the primary school in Raipur, said: ""We got ~50,000 from the department this month and we will use it to repair the floors and toilets. We never had furniture in the school and students have been sitting on mats only.""

She also added that even the neighbouring schools don't have such facilities and they ""never asked the department especially for furniture"".

Another teacher said on condition of anonymity: ""We requested the department to release funds for repairing the boundary wall many times as it is a worry if any child sneaks out through the broken part of the wall.""

SB Joshi, chief education officer of Dehradun, said: ""There are over 1,000 schools in the district and we are trying to provide furniture to all. Till then, jute mats and carpets are provided for students to sit on.""

The department of school education sanctioned Rs 10 crore in November to all 13 districts for buying furniture for government schools.

""We received money from the government and have disbursed it to different districts but issuing of tender and other such procedures may take time,"" said VS Rawat, additional director, elementary education.","No furniture, students in this Dehradun govt school sit on the floor","1025618359","2018-12-24","https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-furniture-students-in-this-dehradun-govt-school-sit-on-the-floor/story-pTjoQK6MfaGzUNWckX22fJ.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"2543","","Tirupur: A group of alumni and many villagers have helped to revive a five-decade-old government school in Perumanallur in the district. After it was 'abandoned' a decade ago, the school had become a den for anti-social elements to play cards, booze and indulge in prostitution.

The state government has recently passed an order to start a government girls' high school in the building, which was inaugurated last week by the state school education minister K A Sengottaiyan.

The school was started in 1957 in a tile-roof building at Perumanallur. It was upgraded as government higher secondary school. When the strength increased, lack of infrastructure in the school became an issue. So, the students were shifted to a higher secondary school functioning on Kanakkampalayam Road, around 10 years ago. But the old school building was 'abandoned'.

""Especially women would fear to go near the school building because of the anti-social elements. Apart from the prostitution activities, many college students would camp in the dilapidated classrooms and involve in gambling. Despite continuous complaints, numerous incidents were happening in the school building. A few months ago, a class VIII girl was allegedly molested,"" said P Mouleeswaran, secretary, alumni association of the school.

""After our continuous requests to restart the school, the school education minister Sengottaiyan visited the abandoned school building. Quickly, the government passed an order to divide Perumanallur government higher secondary school, among four other government schools in the state, and separate the girl students from the school. Now, Perumanallur government girls' high school was started in the abandoned building,"" he said.

""A group of alumni of the school has come forward and helped to restore the buildings and established a smart classroom. With 10 classrooms, a well-furnished toilet facility, equipped with sanitary napkin incinerator. The alumni have, so far, spent, more than Rs 40 lakh,"" said Mouleeswaran, the 1981-batch student.

""It is commendable that the alumni were putting their hearts out in reviving the school. The government has ordered to transfer 249 girls, between class VI and class X, from Perumanallur government higher secondary school to this school, which is now Perumanallur government girls' high school. After completion of half-yearly exam holidays, the school will start functioning on January 2,"" M Dhanabaggiam, headmistress of the new school told TOI.

"2544","","Mumbai: The Bombay high court has directed the state government to regularise the job of a widow in a government school who was given a job on compassionate grounds by the school management.

The state government refused to regularise her job as there was a stay on approvals as per the 2012 state decision. But the court held that jobs given on compassionate grounds were not fresh jobs and hence, not in want of approval by the state.

A division bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dangre was hearing the petition filed by Samita Desai seeking directions to the state to regularise her post. The petition also sought directions to the state to pay her the dues accrued to her while working as a peon in the school.

According to the plea, Desai's husband, Sameer, worked as a peon in the school and his post was an approved one with his salary being paid by the government. However, he died on November 2, 2011 and Samita was left with two minor children. On March 26, 2012, the school management decided to appoint her in place of her husband on compassionate grounds.

The school sent an application on August 7, 2012 to the education department to regularise Samita's job, which was refused on grounds that there was a ban on approving new staff since May 2, 2012. Thereafter, Samitai and the school approached the court.

Public prosecutor, Shruti Vyas, argued that there was a ban on approvals and the post had not been sanctioned as per the 2013-14 staffing pattern for the school.

The court, however, rejected the contentions and stated that Samita's appointment was done as per a December 2, 2002 state order which superseded the 2012 ban.","Regularise widow's job in govt. school: HC to state govt","1024794686","2018-12-22","http://www.asianage.com/metros/mumbai/231218/regularise-widows-job-in-govt-school-hc-to-state-govt.html","The Asian Age",FALSE

This initiative -- called 'ReACH' -- is aimed at improving the conditions of rural schools in an eco-friendly manner. ReACH is part of Shaastra, an annual technical fest scheduled in the first week of January.

IIT-M student Sawni Gupta said during their visits to some schools, they had seen children sitting on the floor with their back hunched.

""So we decided to create desks with cheap and sustainable material. We collected discarded cardboard boxes from nearby stores and used them to make desks,"" she said.

""We designed them in such a way that students can use them to keep their books on them and read. Tapes were used for providing a smooth finishing at edges. After testing the strength, we distributed them to students in eight government schools,"" she added.

Though the minister admitted that it is necessary to reduce the burden of children, he said solid foundation of education should be imparted too.

""The root of education should not be weakened. We have to check the books as well. There is no need to rush as it is for the benefit of students,"" he added.

"2549","","Govt. school in Hassan taluk has raised the bar for SSLC students this time

The Government High School at Attavara in Hassan taluk gives a tough fight to private schools nearby by securing good results in SSLC, besides organising some unique activities to improve the learning ability of students. Unlike many schools in rural areas, the school registered 100% results in SSLC this year. Of the 29 students who took the exams, 27 secured first-class marks.

""This time our target is 100% results will all first class,"" said K.P. Narayana, headmaster. Last year, we had 98% results and constant efforts by teachers helped improve the results this year. ""There is a notion among the public that rural students do not study hard. We want to prove that wrong. We, teachers, maintain a good rapport with students and their parents and monitor their studies regularly,"" he said. Interestingly, teachers take out their personal time to visit their students late in the evening. Sometimes students are surprised to see their teachers on their doorstep. ""We go to their place and speak to their parents. The exercise helps us develop a contact with the parents and also see if students set aside enough time for studies at home,"" he said.

Recently, the school conducted a rangoli competition for students. It was unique because the students were told to draw the diagrams they study as part of their science syllabus. A student drew an image of the brain, nervous system, and respiratory system using colours provided by the teachers.

After school hours, students of classes 8, 9, and 10 have to take part in group studies. With the help of villagers, the school has got special benches on the campus for evening classes. All 98 students attend the classes, before leaving for home. H.L. Nagaraj, Assistant Commissioner of Hassan sub-division, has taken a special interest in improving basic amenities in the school. He visits the school regularly and motivates teachers and students for improving results.

The school has a rainwater harvesting system. Making use of the available water, students grow vegetables on the campus as part of their co-curricular activities. The vegetables grown are used for midday meals.","Teachers in this govt. school go the extra mile","1023246367","2018-12-20","https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/teachers-in-this-govt-school-go-the-extra-mile/article25791759.ece","The Hindu",FALSE
"2550","","A state-run school in Bihar's Vaishali district has been found allegedly segregating students along caste and religious lines, prompting the government to order an inquiry, an official said Thursday.

The district administration has also asked the Bihar education department to take ""exemplary action"" against the school's principal as the ""allegations have been found to be, prima facie, true"".

District Magistrate Rajiv Raushan said the inquiry was ordered following media reports claiming that students belonging to different castes and religious communities were made to sit separately at the G A Higher Secondary School in the district's Lalganj block.

He said they have also written to higher authorities in the education department to take ""exemplary action against the school's principal in order to deter others from adopting such practices"".

Students from scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other backward classes and upper castes, as well as from the Hindu and Muslim communities, were assigned separate sections in their respective classrooms, according to the reports.

The reports had also claimed that separate attendance registers were, therefore, being maintained for students belonging to different social segments even though the children freely intermingled outside the school.

""The allegations have been found to be, prima facie, true in the inquiry. This is a very serious and sensitive matter,"" the district magistrate said.

Orders have been issued to immediately do away with the discriminatory system prevailing at the school, he said.

"2552","","NEW DELHI: The Delhi government's evaluation of safety standards and academic facilities of all 5,600 schools in the city has become the latest flashpoint between the BJP-led corporations and the AAP government.

Alleging that the inspections by the government teams are ""motivated"" and ""an attempt just to tarnish the image of civic bodies"", the education committees of both south and north corporations have directed their officials not to let the ""survey teams enter the school premises"".

The government has asked Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to assess each government, private, and municipal school on parameters like safety, teaching-learning facilities and community engagement. DCPCR is the statutory body to monitor implementation of rights of children and Right To Education Act, 2009 in the city.

The chairperson of the south corporation's education committee, Nandini Sharma, said the House had already rejected the inspection proposal. ""The survey teams had taken permission from us three months ago after showing us a set of questions. But now they have completely changed their track, which is unacceptable."" These inspections also disrupt entire work in schools, she added. ""No permission is sought from the principals and committee members barge into classrooms,"" she alleged.

Sharma's counterpart in the north corporation, Ritu Goel, said she had directed education officials to discontinue the visits with immediate effect. ""We had agreed to the exercise keeping child welfare in mind but the government is using it politically to malign the image of corporation schools."" Goel said she had received complaints from 20-25 teachers about the conduct of inspection teams.

The little kids are asked ""motivated"" questions, Goel alleged. ""Which brave child gets beaten by teachers? Which good student brings the tea for teachers? When a teacher is talking on mobile phones then you don't disturb them -- such types of questions are being asked,"" she said. ""The purpose is only to create a controversy.""

Showing the files about the ""agreed-upon"" questions, she added that the survey was meant to be about issues like safety of kids, guard rooms and visitors in the school. Corporation officials were also asked to provide details of students' family members but they are yet to send any information.

DCPCR member Anurag Kundu, however, claimed that the corporations couldn't legally stop the inspections. ""DCPCR is not under Delhi government and it is an independent statutory body. It is legally obligated to monitor implementation of RTE Act in all schools. The education committee has no authority to stop us,"" he said.

Kundu said the teams were asking the questions agreed upon in joint meetings in September. ""The questions cited by the education committees are not being asked. Only questions like how do you feel in classroom? Are you allowed to ask questions,"" he added.

He also pointed out that Quality Council of India, a central government agency, had been selected as the project management agency for the survey.","School survey causes fresh Delhi govt-corporation rift - Times of India","1022704519","2018-12-20","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/school-survey-causes-fresh-govt-corpn-rift/articleshow/67169561.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"2553","","Krithik Ramesh, a 16-year-old boy of Indian origin who lives in Denver, decided to do something a little offbeat on his vacation to India. He came with the sole aim to pay a visit to the government school at Deviyakuruchi near Attur in Tamil Nadu, where his grandfather had completed school.

But when he got there, what he saw shocked him. The school was utterly dilapidated and Ramesh couldn't bear to see it in that condition.

Together with his father M Ramesh Babu and grandfather V Muthuraman, Krithik decided to start Empowering Rural India Foundation, a non-profit organisation, with the aim of uplifting government schools across the country.

But soon, Krithik realised that he did not have enough funds to take his vision forward. His folks suggested he look for sponsors.

Once he had the funds ready, Krithik approached the school management. Upon enquiring about the needs of the school, he was told that it faced occasional power outages, and the headmaster suggested that installation of solar panels would be of great help.

The family approached many solar service providers before finally zeroing in on a company, that two weeks ago, successfully managed to provide the school with the necessary infrastructure. With the installation of solar panels, the school can now easily save up to Rs 15,000 that otherwise was spent on electricity bills once in two months.

Interestingly, the solar panels can produce about 2kW of power, which is more than what the school needs. So, Krithik suggested that the school sell the excess power to the state electricity board.

His father, Ramesh, stated that they intend to put in place sustainable and renewable energy systems that will serve schools across India for a long time and will pave the way for improved academic success through self-sustaining solutions.","NRI Boy Uses Rs 2 Lakh Prize Money To Transform Grandpa's Dilapidated Govt School In Tamil Nadu","1021258434","2018-12-18","https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/human-interest/nri-boy-uses-rs-2-lakh-prize-money-to-transform-grandpa-s-dilapidated-govt-school-in-tamil-nadu-358826.html","indiatimes.com",FALSE

According to the school authorities, several letter have already been sent to the CM. The school has also moved the Delhi high court, which has issued a notice to the directorate of education (DoE) and asked it to reply in a week, said Michael Williams, director, Mount Carmel.

A student, Madhurima Paul, has started a petition on change.org, 'Join hands to recognise Mount Carmel Dwarka', which has so far been signed by over 4,000 people. ""Considering the idea of graduating from a great school, which is just officially de-recognised, it is the value of the students' degree at stake. It is our admission in colleges at stake.... What really concerns me as a student is just that one parameter cannot and should not make the entire school shut down,"" Paul said in the petition addressed to Kejriwal and Sisodia. She has requsted that the school be recognised again.

On the note sent on December 11, the school said, ""We thank you for your continued support and trust in Mount Carmel. If you wish to extend your support, kindly send your emails with a copy to us addressed to chief minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia.

""So in the directorate's words, 'in the interest of parents and students the school has been de-recognised',"" said the note.

"2556","","In August, 2018 -- 42 years after Qaumi Senior Secondary School was razed to the ground during the Emergency -- the Delhi High Court had ordered the Delhi Development Authority to give 4,000 square metres of land for construction of an Urdu medium school for its students. On Saturday, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia alleged that former Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash had decided to reduce this to 1,600 square metres, with support of DDA members.

On August 27, a High Court bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao had asked the DDA to complete all formalities with regard to the land in three months, and give possession to the Delhi government. It had asked that the government and various agencies cooperate for the development of a top-class Urdu medium school at the site of a vacated abattoir, which had earlier been earmarked for a parking lot.

On Saturday, Sisodia alleged that on September 12, Prakash convened a meeting without informing him, and that it was decided to reduce the size of the school to 1,600 square metres. ""They did so stating that 1,600 square metres is sufficient in accordance with CBSE's affiliation rules. They said children studying in classes XI and XII can be moved to other schools. However, that is irrelevant as according to the 2021 Delhi Master Plan, 4,000 square metres is the minimum area to set up a school -- which was promised at the HC for a senior secondary school,"" alleged Sisodia.

He further alleged that the matter was discussed in two DDA meetings -- one in September and one on Friday -- and that BJP members of the DDA supported ""commercial use"" of the land.

Advertising ExplainedRespite after decades, but only short-lived

The Qaumi Senior Secondary School used to operate from a five-storey building in Sarai Khalil, demolished in 1976 during the Emergency. Since then, it has been operating out of rooms separated by tin sheets in a Shahi Dargah in Quresh Nagar, with classes beginning from the primary section and going up to Class XII. The management's struggle to rebuild the school received relief in September 2017 when the HC asked that the possibility of allotting land to the school be explored. Now, the fate of the project hangs in the balance again.

When contacted, Delhi Leader of Opposition and DDA member Vijender Gupta said, ""AAP gives everything a political colour. The area in question is extremely congested. It is completely commercialised and parking is a matter of highest priority... It is not possible to comment on this issue as the facts are not before us, but school, parking, everything can be worked out in the space. Anyway, the Delhi government has so much land for constructing schools and does not do so.""

Firoz Bhakt, in response to whose petition the HC had passed its order, said he has no option but to move court once again. ""This is unethical and illegal. The three-month period given by the court has lapsed and the land grant has not moved forward. Instead of reducing, they should have been considering alloting more land so a playground can be developed for the school.""","Delhi: School razed during Emergency at centre of fresh govt-bureaucracy row","1019438123","2018-12-15","https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-school-razed-during-emergency-at-centre-of-fresh-govt-bureaucracy-row-5495588/","The Indian Express",FALSE
"2557","","With barely a few months to go for the National Achievement Survey (NAS), the state government has swung into action, to better the results this time. Facing criticism for failing to do a lot in primary education, the government has decided to introduce weekly tests in schools for students of classes 3-8. Starting from December 22, students will appear for tests every Saturday with Gujarati being the first paper followed by Math, Environment, English, Hindi and so on.

The NAS survey, which was conducted in all the 33 districts of the state, interviewing over 1.25 lakh students, showed a consistent decline in the learning levels of students in mathematics, languages and science from Class III to Class VIII in the government school system -- both government schools and government-aided schools.

Confirming the same, state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said, ""We had got cent percent score in infrastructure but in learning outcomes, we lagged behind. This idea emerged from Mission Vidya, which was launched this year to focus on weak students in every class.

Students of a private school have lot of benefits as their parents are educated so they pay attention to their wards. Whereas the situation in government schools, city and rural, is bad as in many cases, parents are not educated so they are unable to pay attention to the children.""

"2558","","The Economic Offences Wing of the Cyberabad police in Hyderabad on Friday arrested a government school teacher, the alleged kingpin of a Rs 150 crore ponzi scheme.

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

""A cheating case was registered against Ravinder under section 420 of the IPC besides Section 5 of Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act, 1999.

While the students from classes VI to X are accommodated in a new block, 500 children of Plus One and Plus Two attend classes in the South Block. The school has another Thendral block, which is in a good condition. But the block is used by the Kasturba Gandhi Government College for Women.

The South Block was constructed in the 1970s and all the 14 classrooms and labs for physics, chemistry and biology used by students of classes XI and XII have developed cracks on the ceiling and the roofs are leaking owing to lack of maintenance.

These courts are part of the Delhi government's initiative to involve various academies, clubs and trainers in the training of student sportspersons in government schools. Under the initiative, private academies can use the premises of government schools for commercial use. But they cannot charge fees from government school students, who must make up half the total number of children enrolled for training at the premises.

These academies are given land for free and can use it commercially on two conditions -- half of all enrolments should be from Delhi government schools and that these students are not charged a fee.

Mr. Sisodia said the policy has received very enthusiastic response from organisations with expertise in sports training, and imparting art and cultural activities to children.

Stating that there should not be any difference in the quality of training, the Education Minister instructed the academy to ensure there is no segregation between students from surrounding areas and those from Delhi government schools.

He also asked the MLA and the school principal to explore the possibility of organising inter-school tournaments once the students are trained.

The Delhi government has also rolled out a 'Play and Progress' scheme to help talented sportspersons at the school-level hone their skills. Under the scheme, sportspersons under the age of 14 years are eligible to receive a quantum of assistance of ₹2 lakh per annum and ₹3 lakh for students in 14-17 years age bracket. The quantum of assistance can be enhanced by 20% in some cases.

Specialised training for these sportspersons is organised at 18 places, including Chhatrasal Stadium, Thyagaraj Sports Complex, East Vinod Nagar Sports Complex and Najafgarh Stadium.

Another scheme rolled out for established young sportspersons, called 'Mission Excellence', aims to see 100 top-level sportspersons of Delhi receive training and coaching sponsored by the government to prepare for international tournaments and championships.

Mr. Sisodia said that the problem with sports administration was that decision-making powers are held by those who have had no link with sports in their lives.

"2565","","BENGALURU: The decision taken by the state government to bring amendments to the existing Right to Education Act (RTE) by giving priority to admission at neighbourhood government schools, has drawn opposition from parents and RTE activists.

Just a day after the amendments were approved by the cabinet, several RTE activists threatened to stage a protest if the government tried to implement them. BN Yogananda, general secretary of the RTE Students and Parents Association, said, ""It clearly shows that the government yielded to pressure from the private school lobby. If the government dares to place it at the upcoming assembly session, we will be forced to take to the streets and fight for the rights of children.""The association will fight the issue legally, he said.

Another parent said, ""My daughter is studying under RTE quota at a private school. Being an auto driver RTE helped me admit her to a private school. I want the same for my younger one.""

However, private schools welcomed the move.Subject experts feel that what the government is trying to do is according to the Act, but at the same time, it should ensure implementation of Sec 12 (12) of the RTE Act, which mandates that private unaided schools should provide education for weaker sections.

Dr VP Niranjanaradya, an expert on the issue said, ""I welcome this, but private unaided schools which have taken substantial benefit in terms of land and other facilities, should provide admission for weaker sections within the neighbourhood, and the state is not obliged to reimburse them.

"2566","","Parents are always concerned about their children getting a quality education. In a bid to that, many of us choose private over the government schools because of undeniable reasons. But not everyone can admit their child to the private institutions due to its high annual fee charges. Hence, they end up in government schools.

"2567","","NEW DELHI: Bluebells School International, East of Kailash, has asked its parents to provisionally pay ""hiked fees"" since its financial situation is precarious and could lead to closure. However, reacting to the circular issued by the school on November 28, 2018, the directorate of education (DoE) has claimed that it has surplus funds of over Rs 2.5 crore. The DoE had ordered a rollback of the hike in fee, accusing the school of ""misuse of funds"".

The school says it was denied an opportunity to convey its stand and that it had increased the fee to meet the salary burden of the Seventh Pay Commission. It has moved court against the order.

In an order sent to the school in August 2018, the DoE said: ""The total funds available for the year 2017-18 amounts to Rs 20,16,52361 out of which cash outflow in the year 2017-18 is estimated to be Rs 17,61,95435. This results in surplus funds amounting to Rs 2,54,56,926. In view of the examination, it is evident that the school is having sufficient funds to meet the financial implications for financial year 2017-18 after meeting its expenditure.""

DoE audited the school's finances after some parents complained to the deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio.

The DoE has also accused the school of misusing the development fund collected from the students. The order says that under a provision in the Delhi School Education Rules of 1973 (DSER), ""schools can charge development fee not exceeding 15% of the tuition fee for purchase, upgradation (and) replacement of furniture fixture and equipment."" The order raised red flags on the purchase of desks and chairs and on the transport fee collected from students.

""The school is collecting transport fee from the students but (it's) not shown in the financial statements of the school till 2015-16,"" said the order. The government has also questioned the amount spent by the school on computers. ""The expenditure on purchase of computers in 2016-17 was Rs 28.73 lakh, in 2017-18 it was Rs 50 lakh and the proposed expenditure for 2018-19 is Rs 10 lakh. A computer is a capital asset and lasts for many years. So much expenditure incurred every year (does) not appear to be correct,"" said the order.

""All the observations in the order are one-sided,"" protested principal Suman Kumar. ""No opportunity was given by the DoE to the school to clarify its stand...For example, the fact that today computers are central to education and need rapid upgradation has been ignored. Phased purchase by the school against a strength of about 1,900 students has been perceived as misutilisation. The stock can be verified. The buffer of Rs 2.5 crore worked out by the DoE is based on erroneous omission of accounting facts on record.""

""Similarly with regard to the transport fee, a separate account was maintained...as per the guidelines of the DoE issued in the past.

"2569","","The Delhi government's Directorate of Education (DoE) on Thursday issued an order withdrawing the recognition given to a private school in Dwarka for what it termed was an arbitrary increase in fees during the 2016-2017 academic session.

The order said the DoE had no option left but to withdraw the recognition given to Mount Carmel School, Dwarka, under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973, after issuing notices and holding hearings on the matter since 2016. The school had increased the fee by 25% in 2016-2017, the DoE stated.

Keeping the students' interest in mind, the withdrawal of recognition would take effect on April 1, 2019, the order said, adding that no new admissions should be made in the meantime.

The school had argued that it had not been given land by the Delhi Development Authority on concessional rates, so the Delhi High Court judgment that gives the DoE the power to regulate fees of such schools was not applicable to it, the order said. The DoE, however, said the March 9, 2000 allotment letter for the land given to the school showed it had been given the property at a concessional rate.

The school had also argued that being a minority institution it was exempt from the requirement of prior approval for increasing fees, but the DoE said the Supreme Court and High Court orders cited were about EWS admissions in minority schools, not fees.","Govt orders derecognition of school over fee hike","1012362230","2018-12-06","https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/govt-orders-derecognition-of-school-over-fee-hike/article25683903.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

"2572","","Nine months into the academic session, as many as 44,191 government school students are yet to receive subsidy for uniforms from the directorate of education (DoE) as their bank accounts are ""non functional"". The DoE transfers the subsidy directly to students' bank accounts.

According to the circular issued by DoE's consultant (planning) NT Krishna to the heads of all government schools in Delhi last week, the department has transferred the subsidy to 14,20,191 students. ""The directorate of education is unable to disburse the money to 44,191 students as their bank accounts have not been submitted/entered online on the directorate website or their accounts are non-functional,"" the circular said.

The highest number of complaints about bank accounts -- 9,692 -- was reported from schools in north-east district of Delhi, followed by those in the south-east at 6,629, and 5,810 from east Delhi schools.

""The head of schools are advised to act fast and enter details of these students latest by December 10,"" Krishna said.

As per the Right to Education (RTE) Act, students of government schools are entitled to receive free books, stationery items and uniforms up to class 8. The Delhi government distributes books to these students and transfer subsidy for uniforms and stationery directly into their bank accounts once a year.

Sanjay Goel, director DoE, said, ""These students are either irregular or took late admissions. There are cases wherein students had enrolled in schools but never turned up. In such cases, it is very difficult to trace them. We have asked our district education officers to personally monitor such cases,"" he said.

Members of National Association of the Deaf (NAD) sat on dharna at New Delhi's Civil Lines on the occasion of World Disability Day on Monday over the social welfare department's ""refusal"" to vacate the premises of a school for deaf students. NAD said the Delhi government department is occupying the premises of Government Lady Noyce Senior Secondary School at Feroz Shah Kotla in the national capital for more than 10 years now and had been making false promises to move out.

NAD Executive Director Anuj Jain, through his sign language interpreter Shivoy Sharma, said: ""The Government Lady Noyce Senior Secondary School for the Deaf, which is grappling with space constraint with every classroom being in a decrepit state and packed more than its capacity, has seen its number dwindling ever since the social welfare department of the Delhi government encroached on its space. Many deaf students have had to be transferred to the school's branches in Kalkaji and Mayur Vihar, and some even have to be turned away at the time of admission owing to lack of space. The quality of education in the school is suffering with the government department squatting not only in classrooms but also the playground.""

Jain said the school, established in 1931, currently has 500 students; the number was around 1,500 before the social welfare department occupied school in 2003. He added: It is the deaf students among the disabled who are most exploited as they cannot really advocate for themselves.""

"2574","","The Delhi government plans to come up with a fresh policy to regulate the school transport system plying in the national capital by January 2019.

Transport officials said they have written to the education department asking them to collect data of students enrolled in all city schools including public-private and details of the transport used by them. They have requested for the data by December end.

""We have written to the education department to collect data of schools, students, owned buses, and hired cabs to assess the total demand and supply of such vehicles in the city. Similar data will also be asked from municipal corporation-run schools. Once the data is collated and studied, a fresh scheme will be formulated to grant permits for school cabs with additional incentives,"" said, a senior Delhi government official.

The government's transport department has already sent a proposal in this regard to transport minister Kailash Gahlot. The decision was taken during a high-level meeting on Thursday.

Sanjay Goel, director, Directorate of Education (DoE), said, ""We are yet to receive an official communication in this regard. We will be ready to provide the data, as it will help regulate illegal vehicles ferrying school children.""

The move comes after an eight-year-old was killed in a school van accident in north Delhi earlier this week. The cab was plying without a permit as well as was ferrying above capacity, which are major violations.

Earlier this year, a seven-year-old was crushed to death while 17 others were injured in a similar accident. After this the government had announced it will bring changes to the existing School Cab Policy 2007, as it was ""outdated"".

Following the incident, the transport department has formed 20 teams of five members each for a month-long drive to crackdown on illegally plying school vans. The drive will begin from Saturday.

According to data available with the department, at least 25,000 such illegal cabs are plying as school vans in the city putting the lives of thousands of children at risk. Most of these vehicles have only private licenses and are required to get school van permits to ferry school children, under which they will have to follow guidelines mandated for children safety.

Besides, the official said, the department will also invite applications from cab operators to apply for valid permits.

""The applications for this purpose may be called in next fortnight. It is expected that illegal operators may seek permit during this window to avoid impounding of their vehicles,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the Delhi traffic police have already started a crackdown on these vans. At least 1,511 school vans have been prosecuted over the last three days by the traffic police.

"2578","","Heavy bags can cause spinal damage, spondylitis and affect mental growth

Fifth-grader Tushar Mehta walks gingerly with his overwhelmingly heavy bag, from his home to his school in Jhandewalan. It's a two-km daily drag for the little kid.

""We're forced to carry all textbooks and notebooks. If we miss anything, we get wooden scale slaps or have to stand outside the classroom for the whole period,"" he said, with sadness in his eyes and sharp pain in his tiny shoulders.

This is the story of most schoolchildren in Delhi-NCR. While the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) asked all states and Union Territories (UTs) on Monday to regulate the weight of school bags, a Mail Today reality check with a weighing machine showed this is going to be a daunting task as children remain crushed by the heavy bags they carry. Most bags weighed double the limit prescribed by the government. Many small kids were seen carrying even 10-kg bags. Those in classes III and IV were the worst suffers.

As per the government circular, the weight of schoolbags for students of classes I and II should not exceed 1.5 kg, while those of students of class III to V should weigh between 2 kg to 3 kg. Schoolbags of students of classes VI and VII should not be more than 4 kg, while the weight of schoolbags of classes VIII and IX students should not be above 4.5 kg. The schoolbag of a class X student should not weigh above 5 kg.

But the reality is painful, and it will take some doing before the burden can actually be reduced. Shruti Desai, a class III student of a private school in Mayur Vihar, carries a 5 kg bag. Her mother, Kavita Desai, said nothing much can be done. ""Kids carry only what they are asked to. They have five subjects. Each subject has three books. There are computer and art books. Plus, there are notebooks. Teachers can ask for anything,"" she said.

She is worried about her child's health. ""She is so fragile and often complains about her back. The problem can be fixed only by schools and teachers, we can only request them,"" she said.

The idea behind the government circular is to ensure good health and physical growth of growing children who are often seen complaining about back and shoulder pain.

JS Bhasin from the pediatric department at BLK Super Speciality Hospital said 68 per cent of the children in the age group of 7-13 face risks of a backache and hunchback because of heavy schoolbags. ""These problems may lead to early spondylitis and severe neck and back pain. It may also cause serious spinal damage and irreversible back problems. It also affects the mental growth of children as they feel tired all the time,"" he said.

He said heavy textbooks should be replaced with notepads. ""It's a one-time investment. Schools can provide files of various subjects,"" he said.

Avadesh Kumar Ojha, principal of Government Sarvodaya Coed Vidyalaya, Rohini Sector-8, said heavy bags are a result of traditional teaching patterns. ""Schools nowadays are focusing more on finishing the syllabus rather than enhancing students' learning abilities.""

""In my school, students don't carry water bottles weighing 1 kg as I have installed water purifiers. Similarly, if the school starts providing textbooks in classrooms, children will not have to carry such heavy bags,"" the Ojha said.

Many luminaries of Odia literature like Mayadhar Mansingh and Rajkishore Ray were a part of its teaching faculty.

However, for a school with such glorious past, its premises is dotted with government offices hampering education of the students.The present building of the school was constructed in 1936 by the then chief engineer of Kalahandi Indramani Kar, who was an alumni of the school. It was considered one of the best in the State but after 1970s, performance of the school started declining due to negligence of the authorities.

The school was initially spread over an area of about 10 acres. Although playground is considered a mandatory component of a school, Brajamohan High School currently does not have one. Unfortunately till 2017, the land was not recorded in name of the school by the State Government. In 2004-05, playground of the school was used for setting up the Town Planning office and Kalahandi Judicial Complex. After an outcry by alumnus, the Government recorded 6.66 acres of land in favour of the school on June 17, 2017.

This apart, many Government offices have come up on the school premises and this has been hampering the ambience. The District Education Office has been occupying a substantial portion of the school for the last 30 years. The 4(O) Naval unit of NCC currently functions from the hostel building of the school and another building of the school is occupied by Rashtriya Madhyamik Shikya Abhiyan office. The offices are frequented by a lot of visitors and this affects education of the students.

Sources said to start the course, the offices need to be shifted and it seems difficult at this moment.

"2600","","HC quashes AAP govt circular on giving preferential treatment to city residents at GTB Hospital

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the AAP government about the steps taken by it to ensure implementation of its circular on ensuring safety of children in all the schools in the national capital.

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao directed the Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government to state in an affidavit the standard operating procedures laid down or instructions issued to implement the circular issued on August 11, 2018 and listed the matter for further hearing on January 24 next year.

The August 11 circular issued by DoE said that despite court orders and directions of DoE to the schools to carry out ""self inspection"" of the infrastructure and submit quarterly safety reports, there has only been ""half-hearted compliance"".

It also said that such ""half hearted approach"" would not work if the schools were serious about providing foolproof safety and security to the students.

The circular had suggested setting up of a school safety committee, holding monthly safety walks and submitting online safety reports to DoE and had warned of severe action, including withdrawal of recognition, against aided and recognised schools for repeated violation of the guidelines.

It had also warned of disciplinary action against the heads of the government-run schools for failure to follow the guidelines laid down in the circular.

The non-compliance of the circular was raised before the bench by advocate Ashok Aggarwal, who has been appointed as amicus curiae by the court to inspect schools in the national capital and ascertain how safe and secure they are for the children studying there.

Aggarwal was appointed as amicus in a PIL initiated by the court on its own after receiving a letter written by an advocate seeking improvement of the conditions in schools here.

Delhi resident Dishant Sharma had written a letter to the High Court seeking framing of guidelines to make schools accountable for children's safety.

He has also sought police verification of the support staff in the schools, counselling of all staff, installation of CCTV cameras on school premises, separate washrooms for students and no direct access of support staff in the premises.

In his report submitted before the court, Aggarwal has said that he visited six schools in the national capital and found that they were overcrowded, lacked proper infrastructure, were not completely disabled friendly, toilets were in bad shape and drinking water was not properly available.

Apart from that the two complaint boxes set up inside the schools to be checked by the police and the school, were never ever opened, he said in his report.","HC asks Delhi govt about steps taken to implement its circular on school safety","982153980","2018-10-30","https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/hc-asks-delhi-govt-about-steps-taken-to-implement-its-circular-on-school-safety-118103001074_1.html","Business Standard",FALSE

"2605","","HC asks AAP govt about steps taken to fill vacancies in Delhi Fire Service

The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Centre and the AAP government to sit together and work out a solution regarding the future of a 99-year-old school, which is in a dilapidated state, and the students studying there.

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao said the ""endeavour at first instance"" should be to provide a suitable alternative site to shift the Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, currently located in Delhi Cantonment, and the second option ought to be accommodating the students in other schools.

The direction by the court came after the Ministry of Defence said the land where the school is located cannot be handed over to the Delhi government for setting up a new institute.

""Handing over the land in question is out of the question,"" the ministry told the bench.

The Delhi government, on the other hand, said that while it can accommodate the students in other schools, it needs the school in question as its other educational institutions are ""overburdened"".

The court, thereafter, directed that deliberations be held at the highest level to work out a solution and a report be filed in three weeks.

""Endeavour at the first instance shall be to provide a suitable alternative site for the school,"" the court said and listed the matter for further hearing on January 8, 2019.

The bench was hearing a PIL by NGO Social Jurist which has alleged that Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, taken over by the Delhi government in 1975 and getting 100 per cent aid from it, was in a horrible condition.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government had earlier told the court that a joint inspection of the building had revealed that it was constructed in 1919 and has outlived its useful life and was unsuitable for habitation.

Advocate Ashok Agarwal, appearing for the NGO, had earlier said around 450 students are studying in the school and they have been unjustly deprived of adequate physical infrastructure and academic faculty.

The plea has said though the school is open for all, it mainly caters to the children of servants of military officials who are not in a position to educate their kids in private school.

It has alleged that the school lacks basic amenities, including potable drinking water, functional toilets, science and computer labs, clean classrooms and proper boundary wall and several posts of teaching staff are lying vacant.

The petition has sought direction that the existing building of the school be demolished and rebuilt as a state-of -the-art school.","HC asks AAP govt, Centre to sit together and decide fate of 99-yr-old dilapidated school","979258993","2018-10-26","https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/hc-asks-aap-govt-centre-to-sit-together-and-decide-fate-of-99-yr-old-dilapidated-school-118102601123_1.html","Business Standard",FALSE

"2607","","Coimbatore: With his vivacious and cavort dance performance, Y Sujith, 16, stole the show at the 'Kala Utsav 2018' held in the city on Tuesday.

A Class XII student of government higher secondary school at Karamadai, Sujith is not a professional dancer. Nor did he undergo any proper training.

As his father Yesudass is a truck driver, Sujit couldn't afford to take proper training in a dance academy.

Inspired by a senior who danced with dexterity during a school function when he was in elementary school, Sujith learned dance movements from watching movies.

Five years ago, when he was in Class VII, Sujith started to train himself by watching dance programmes in TV shows and YouTube.

Today, Sujith has won medals in more than 20 district-level competitions. He has also performed in programmes, including marriage functions.

Competing with more than 100 students from various schools, Sujith won the first prize in solo dance category competition at the 'Kala Utsav 2018' by performing folk dance.

Sujith has been selected for the state-level competition to be held in Chennai.

Of the eight students selected to participate in the state-level competitions under various categories, Sujith is the only student from government school.

""All I need is a platform to showcase my dancing skills and feedback from the viewers, so that I can improve myself. Dancing makes me happy. This is what matters to me and I am least bothered about winning or losing a competition,"" he said.

""I wanted to join in a dance academy. But, due to my family's poor financial condition, I did not ask my parents to admit me in one,"" said Sujith.

""The first dance that I choreographed on my own was when I was in Class VII for a school programme,"" he said. ""It gave me happiness when teachers and students appreciated my dancing style,"" he added. He has mastered western and folk dance.

""It is my ambition to become a professional dancer. But my parents want me to get a degree and join in a job,"" he said, expressing his hopes that they will eventually understand what dance actually means to him.

He said he is planning to do automobile engineering to make his parents happy but will never stop dancing.","King of swing: This govt school boy, a truck driver's son, dances his way to stardom - Times of India","977667043","2018-10-24","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/king-of-swing-this-govt-school-boy-a-truck-drivers-son-dances-his-way-to-stardom/articleshow/66354779.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

To cater to the needs of tribal students in Periyur, Agnipavi, Sengulam, Kovil Natham and Sundaipodu hamlets in the hills, the Department of Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare started a primary school at Kongadai in 1993 that was later upgraded into middle school in 1998.

Apart from this, the School Education Department runs four primary schools while three special schools of National Child Labour Project (NCLP) were also run by an NGO, Service Unit for Development Activities in Rural (SUDAR) in the area.

After completing Standard 8 in the tribal school, students have to go to the Government Higher Secondary School at Bargur to continue their Standard 9. Since, the school is located about 29 km. from Kongadai, a few attend the school and stay in the hostels while most of them turn to be school drop outs.

With the demand for upgrading the school grew up, the State government had last year announced that the school would be upgraded. Hence, 50 students were admitted to Standard 9 in the current academic year. However, teachers are yet to be appointed.

S.C. Natraj, Director, Sudar, said that though the announcement for upgradation was made in September 2017, teachers were yet to be posted. Without teachers, the life of the students is affected who face many challenges in coming to the school, he added.

The woman has been working as a part time 'kuhar' since 1977 at a school in Sangrur district. 'Kuhar', according to Shanti Devi's counsel, is a person appointed to serve water and perform other menial tasks. ""In accordance with the state government policy, her services will now be regularised as a sweeper,"" her lawyer Charanpal Singh Bagri said.

The High Court also ordered regularisation of services of a 48-year-old woman, who has been working as a sweeper at another school since 1993. The two women had approached the High Court in 2014.

""After perusing the records and in view of the age of the petitioners, who are working in their respective schools from the last 21 to 35 years and still continuing in services, which are perennial in nature, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondents to regularise the services,"" the order reads.

According to the case details, Shanti Devi has been working at Government Senior Secondary School, Khanori Kalan since October 1977. According to her Aadhaar card, her date of birth is January 01, 1934. Her counsels Charanpal Singh Bagri and Gurjit Kaur Bagri pleaded in the High Court that she has continued to work in the school due to extreme poverty and the school is in need of a full-time employee on the post.

""The petitioners are having good moral character and continuous attendance above 80 per cent since the time of their appointment,"" the counsel had submitted. The state government had contended that she has already attained the age of superannuation in December 1989 and until that year, her turn for regularisation of services had not come as per the seniority position defined in the policy.

However, Justice Jitendra Chauhan in the judgment said that Shanti had put in more than 12 years of service by the time she had reached the age of superannuation and as she is continuing her services, she cannot be denied her legitimate claim. ""Since the petitioners are working for the past 21 to 35 years in their respective schools, it is manifest that there is requirement of the posts.

"2613","","Coimbatore: Students of government higher secondary school at Irugur staged a protest on Tuesday, urging officials to render the subway that the railways department constructed more than a year ago usable by laying a service road to connect it with the approach road.

With the subway that is built between Irugur town and the school where a four-line railway track runs through remaining unusable, students are forced to cross the track to reach the school daily.

Local residents said work on the subway, which commenced in 2014, was completed around two years ago. ""But the service road to connect the subway to the approach road has not so far been laid by the highways department.""

Pointing to the risk factor involved in crossing the railway track, CPI functionary V Vijayaraghavan, who is also a resident of Irugur, said the subway would help students reach the school safely. ""Presently, students have to walk a long distance to reach the school, if they are not crossing the railway track. Once the subway is ready for use, they have to walk just 200 metres.""

Presently, school teachers make sure that students cross the tracks safely every morning and evening, said headmaster P Krishnasamy. He said the students, who are afraid to cross the tracks, have to walk around 1.5km to use a rail over-bridge, which doesn't have a pedestrian walkway, posing danger from speeding vehicles. ""We had made several representations to officials of district administration, school education and highways departments about the pending work, but to no avail.""

"2614","","MUMBAI: An Andheri school has terminated the services of a mathematics teacher who was recently convicted of sexually harassing students, management authorities informed the education department on Monday.

The teacher, now out on bail, continued to teach at the school despite concerns raised by its principal who has pursued the case since 2013 when the harassment charges were registered.

In August 2018, a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court convicted the 40-year-old teacher and sentenced him to three years imprisonment for sexually harassing minor students five years ago, in 2013. The teacher, though, secured a bail within three days of his conviction.

The principal said 39 students had given written complaints to her about the harassment they faced, three of whom deposed before the trial court.

The court allowed the convicted teacher's plea to be released on bail to file an appeal and told him to pay a fine of Rs 25,000 to the three survivors who had deposed.

The principal raised an alarm after the convicted teacher returned to teach and thereafter education department officials summoned representatives of the school management. ""On Monday, the management submitted a letter stating that they had terminated the teacher's services. They said they were waiting for the end of the 60-day grace period after conviction to allow an appeal to a higher court, as required under the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools Rules (MPSE), 1981. The 60 days ended on Sunday,"" said Anil Sable, education inspector, Mumbai West.

MEPS Rules' Section 33 states that in case an employee is convicted in a lower court, the management can conduct an inquiry but not issue any order till the time the employee is entitled to appeal to a higher court against the conviction. ""Though the teacher said he had already moved Bombay high court against the lower court order, the management said they were unaware of the development and therefore gave him his termination letter on Monday,"" said Sable.

A copy of the letter has also been sent to the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, the police and the suburban district collector's office -- all of whom were informed by the principal that the teacher had returned to the school. The principal, who has followed up on the case for years, said, ""The teacher's presence in the premises in spite of a conviction for such a grave case was dangerous.""

The school trustee did not respond to calls for a comment.

When TOI contacted the teacher, he said he had moved the high court on September 28. ""I will also approach the education department's tribunal for action against wrongful termination.

Irani wanted all states in India to replicate Tithi Bhoj model of Gujarat where community participation is encouraged to serve food in schools. However, not many states had shown interest and it could not be implemented in all states.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-Day Meal Society, Department of Education, Punjab, said that concept of Tithi Bhoj was similar to concept of 'langar' in Punjab. ""In both practices, community participation is encouraged. On special occasions, community members can contribute food for children's mid-day meal in local government schools. However, this is the first time that MHRD has issued orders to organise Tithi Bhoj on two particular days as part of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It will be organised on October 31 this year and then October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), 2019. We have ordered schools to implement it. They can either seek help of gurdwaras and local families to prepare feast for children or cook some delicacies in schools itself. Earlier too, when proposal was mooted in 2014 by former MHRD minister Smriti Irani, Punjab had no problem with it. In fact, we had even implemented it for few months and collected food materials from those who wanted to donate. But we do not collect any funds. Those who want to contribute can give food items only.""

He added that schools can organise Tithi Bhoj as per arrangements they have and there is no particular menu. ""They can prepare some desserts like kheer, halwa, other sweets or serve chana-poori, halwa-puri or something which is not served as part of regular menu. We have not given specific menu items so that teachers are not troubled but Tithi Bhoj has to be organised on October 31 and children should be served a feast in memory of Mahatma Gandhi,""

said Singh.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, In spite of many schemes including 'School Chalen Hum', running in the state, the number of children in government schools is declining year after year. This has been revealed in the report submitted by the school education department in the last assembly session.

In the last three years six lakh children have left the government schools. Chhindwara district tops in the number of dropouts, whereas Satna and Rewa are second and Shivpuri is in third place.

Children enrolled in government schools through school education department are counted through mid-day meal and free textbook distribution. The number of children in the year 2015-16 is 76,23,522, which fell to only 70,20,008 in the year 2017-18.

All the schemes are aimed at luring the children to the government school. Funds of crores are given under 'School Chale Hum' campaign by the Central Government. The entire budget is also being spent every year, but still the number of children is falling in schools.

Either this budget is being spent on paper, or the schemes are not proving to be effective in attracting children. In order to increase enrollment of children in government schools, the government is running schemes like free textbooks, uniforms and bicycles distribution. In this every year bill of crores rupees is wasted.","Number of children declines in MP govt schools | Central Chronicle","1029852802","2018-12-31","http://www.centralchronicle.com/number-of-children-declines-in-mp-govt-schools.html","Central Chronicle",FALSE
"3045","","26,000 Kannada-medium students of T. Narsipur taluk are preparing for the English fest tomorrow

Suneetha and her classmates at Government Higher Primary School at Madrahalli in T. Narsipur taluk of Mysuru district have been reciting English rhymes in the last fortnight as the day to present their newly acquired English talent is fast approaching.

The school in the tiny village has around 101 students and each one has to speak English with their teachers, friends, and students throughout the day on January 1, 2019. While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T.

A number of parents said that there are several private schools that are giving winter tutorials to the students in the early morning.

He said that this seems to be a punishment to the students and nobody from the education department is showing any concern to overcome the issue.

Another parent while lamenting on the issue said that her ward felt ill twice due the cold and he is not able to go for winter schooling in the misty morning.

A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and P Rajamanickam passed the interim order on a plea by Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK)'s Cheyyur town secretary M Thiagarajan seeking action against the correspondent of RC Middle School, a government aided institution for allegedly compelling students to clean the toilet.

This apart, the petitioner also wanted the court to set up a district level committee of officials known for their integrity and commitment to cause of student welfare to inspect all government and government-aided schools to ensure adequate toilet facilities are provided along with sanitary workers.

According to the petitioner, his wife Parvathi was working as a science teacher in the school for the past 10 years on consolidated pay. But after the incident came to light and the petitioner sent representations to various authorities seeking action against the management, his wife was terminated without any reason, he said. It was purely to take revenge against him, the petitioner submitted. The management claimed it was the petitioner's wife who made the children clean toilets and that was why she was sacked.

The petitioner further submitted that undeterred by the action of the management he continued to petition the collector to take appropriate action against the correspondent and ensure toilets were cleaning only by sanitary workers.

The act of the school management not only amounted to abuse of children against the Constitution it also meant forced manual scavenging as they were compelled to clean the toilets without any safety gadgets, the petitioner submitted.

As the authorities failed to take any action on his representations he approached the high court. When the plea came up for hearing, the bench directed the collector to file the report and posted the plea to January 25 for further hearing.","How many govt schools in Kanchi district have toilets, HC asks collector - Times of India","1026682797","2018-12-26","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/how-many-govt-schools-in-kanchi-district-have-toilets-hc-asks-collector/articleshow/67252712.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

Though the Aadhaar biometric attendance system was already being used in 9,349 government-run schools in 12 districts across Telangana, now the Directorate of School Education has decided to extend the system to about 25,000 schools, including primary, upper primary and high schools.

The attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff will be recorded twice a day -- morning and evening -- and for students, before serving the mid-day meal, so that the attendance recorded on the biometric machines could be matched with the bills submitted by school managements to ascertain the number of students consuming the mid-day meal.","Biometric attendance to be made compulsory in Telangana govt. schools from next year - The Siasat Daily","1024430855","2018-12-22","https://www.siasat.com/news/biometric-attendance-be-made-compulsory-telangana-govt-schools-next-year-1448648/","The Siasat Daily",FALSE
"3059","","Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

"3060","","Hyderabad: Starting next academic year, students and teachers of all government and local body schools in Telangana will mark their attendance on a biometric fingerprint machine instead of the conventional manual system.

About 25,000 schools -- including primary, upper primary and high schools -- will get the biometric equipment. Already, the Aadhaar biometric attendance system was being used in 9,349 government-run schools in 12 districts across Telangana. Now, the Directorate of School Education decided to extend the system to all government-run schools and sent a proposal to the State government seeking budgetary support for installing the machines.

The department tied up with Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and Telangana State Technology Services (TSTS) for implementing the Aadhaar biometric attendance. One biometric machine was being provided for every 100 students, with managements being directed to record attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff twice a day -- morning and evening -- and for students, before serving the mid-day meal.

""The attendance recorded on the biometric machines will be matched with the bills submitted by school managements to ascertain the number of students consuming the mid-day meal. As it is linked with Aadhaar, the managements cannot duplicate admissions,"" an official said.

The machines and software were designed in such a way that biometric fingerprints captured are immediately verified with the biometric details available with UIDAI using Internet and is reflected in the dashboard of the School Education Department's website. A software was being developed to transmit the captured details offline or when network is available in the schools located in remote areas.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, More than 52 thousand guest teachers have been arranged on the basis of their choice filling to ensure smooth running of educational activities in government schools in the academic session 2018-19 in the state.

The proceedings were postponed due to the completion of the proceedings of the first phase and the postponement given by the court. According to the order of the court, the school education department has taken necessary action.

Two development blocks and one district have been selected by the applicant at the time of choice filling. The applicants who have not participated in choice filling, considering the development block of the applicant's verification clause as the development block of the applicant's priority, a panel has been generated for the subject-post for each development block. This panel can be seen without any password.

Applicants appearing in this panel are being sent state-level SMS for them to be present in the school till December 20 to send application. Applicants registered in gfms portal must submit their application portal generated by the score card.

Instructions for approval of the panel of applications received on December 27 at the school level have been given to the District Education Officers. Applications of the applicants, who are not registered in the gfms portal, can be received by the school till December 25. The entry of selected guest teachers has been asked to be completed by December 30 in the gfms portal.

Special concession

Due to less number of applicants in the English panel in secondary and high school, permission has been given to keep applicants with higher qualifications in the English panel.

They will receive the honorarium of guest teachers. Apart from the Sanskrit panel, guest teachers will be placed in the schools with Urdu students, after the approval of the Urdu post apart in addition to Sanskrit as per nomination.

Similarly, due to the less number of postgraduate applicants in the agriculture faculty, graduates will be invited for the post of guest teachers.

"3064","","Sisodia said students need to become job providers and a entrepreneurship curriculum will train them before they begin college.

He also described Kashmere Gate as an ""incubation centre"" for universities, saying it is a coincidence that several varsities, which were based in the area, are now moving to bigger campuses.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" Sisodia said.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life. If our schools and colleges continue to churn out batches of students who are going to join the queue with the mindset of job seekers we will soon be left with very small number of job givers,"" Sisodia said.

He said the entrepreneurship curriculum will be for students of classes 9 to 12 with the vision that every child should have the confidence of being creator rather than just being a consumer.

""The curriculum shall be based on a four-fold framework-- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self designed micro research, involve through local community and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects,"" said Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio.

To take this idea forward, he has directed the secretary education to set up a high-powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, school principals and individuals having domain expertise as members.

""SCERT Delhi will organise a conference in January where it will invite organisations and individuals to present their ideas for the design of the entrepreneurship curriculum as per the framework of the government to a working group.

""Based on the inputs received, the pilot curriculum shall be rolled out from April 2019 onwards,"" Sisodia said.

He said they will try and ensure they take it to private schools as well.

In the convocation, as many as 1,161 students, comprising 504 undergraduates, 656 post graduates and one doctorate, were awarded degrees.

Thirty-eight chancellor gold medal, vice-chancellor gold medal and exemplary performance silver plaque were given to students across the years at the event.

Baijal congratulated the students and also suggested that entrepreneurs should be supported by the government when they start out.

"3067","","Embracing technology to evoke interest among students, the school education department has gradually started to introduce video lessons in the classrooms of government schools across the state.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely.

Schools run by the West Bengal government will soon have to put up a notice in classrooms, with detailed information about the curricula and chapters that would be taught by the teachers during a particular semester, an official said.

A notification has been issued by the department of school education, asking all state-run schools to abide by the instruction from the next academic session, he said.

""The new rule is aimed at giving the students a clear idea about what they will learn before the next summative internal assessment test. It will also apprise the teachers of the lessons they need to cover in a given period,"" the school department official said.

Three summative assessment tests are held every year in state-run schools - one during March-April, second around July-August and the third in November-December.

""Ideally, the schools can also put up the same notice somewhere on its campus, where the parents have access. The notice will have to be updated from time to time so that students have no confusion about their academic progress,"" the state official said.

The government's move came in the wake of frequent complaints by students that teachers do not cover syllabi properly, he said.

""While the students claim that syllabus has not been covered in classrooms, the teachers allege that those complaining either skip schools or remain hooked to their mobile phones during lessons,"" he maintained.

The school education department has also stressed the importance of holding regular parent-teacher meetings for the overall benefit of the students, the official said.

""The parents should have knowledge about the performance of their wards, their strengths and weaknesses,"" he added.

Out of the 162 schools in the zone, no school has been provided with electricity while as few schools are using 'temporary solar lighting systems'.

He said that the solar lights are also used in the offices rather than in classrooms.

The locals said that the government schools including High School (HS) Kilshay, HS Gujran, HS Mallangam, Middle School (MS) Busgay and MS Mastan have a good roll of students but still very less attention is paid to the infrastructure of these schools.

Similarly, the Girls Middle School (GMS) Markoot, GMS Dawer, GMS Wanpora, Middle School (MS) Banjran, MS Dangan, Primary School (PS) Badoub, PS Marnoo, PS Mazgund, PS Nayal Higher Secondary School (HSS) Izmarg, HSS Bodagam, Boys Higher Secondary School (BHSS) Dawer and Higher Secondary School (GHSS) Dawer are also without electricity and boundary walls.

"3075","","LUCKNOW: After getting de-recognition threat from the state education department, 15 city schools bowed to government pressure and agreed to organising the measles-rubella (MR) vaccination drive on their campuses.

These 15 schools were among 53 others in the city which had said no to MR vaccine for their students citing reports of children taking ill after being given the vaccine.

On Tuesday, the education department had sent notices to these schools with a warning that they will lose recognition if their students were not given MR shots by December 14.

By Thursday, 15 schools approached the health department seeking dates for vaccination.

Meanwhile, district inspector of schools (DIOS) has issued notices to eight more schools for saying no to MR drive.

DIOS Mukesh Singh said, ""The schools are obstructing in government work. They been given three days to either fall in line or lose their NOC if they are CBSE and ICSE board schools, or will be de-recognised if they come under UP Secondary Education Board.""

Basic education officer Dr Amar Kant Singh had earlier said that schools had refused to join the campaign after parents raised objections over the drive.

"3076","","Bengaluru: As the students of Government Lower Primary School (GLPS) Ravindranagar sang their prayer at the morning assembly on Thursday, the young faces were euphoric to see a total makeover of their once dilapidated school building and campus.

Along with the refurbished school's inauguration on Thursday, a nationwide government school rejuvenation programme by The Akshaya Patra Foundation (TAPF) was also launched by the scion of Mysuru royal family Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar.

Titled 'School and Student Transformation - A Model School Initiative', the project aims to build 100 model schools pan India in the first phase and scale up to 500 in the second phase.

Elaborating on the project, TAPF CEO Shridhar Venkat said like GLPS Ravindranagar other schools will also be equipped with colouful and innovative compound walls, safe food storage facility, hand wash stations, zero maintenance bio-toilets and play area.

The model school initiative at GLPS Ravindranagar has been supported by Shyamala Prabhu and Kavita Shastry from the Institute of Indian Interior Designers and organisations such as Let's Endorse, Smile Charitable Trust, and The Aravani Art Project.

In a special interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Yaduveer said that infrastructural development of government schools was essential to help students benefit better from the system. Excerpts:

Experts point out offering better opportunities for students in government schools as well keeping the system of public education alive. How can this be done?

Going forward from initiatives like the School and Student Transformation model put forth by TAPF, encouraging children to grow up in a sustainable environment and ensuring they get access to experiential learning platforms is important. A transformation towards getting better in all ways - in terms of education, infrastructure and advanced learning prospects is essential for government schools to be more appealing to students and parents.

Do you believe beginning English medium classes or schools in the public education sector would improve government school enrolments and thereby quality of education offered as well?

Merely changing the medium to English would not improve the system at a larger scale. Even though learning English would help students get recognised as a global citizen, one cannot neglect the local language and culture and hence learning in Kannada is equally important. Knowledge in more languages right from the formative years is always good as it helps better brain development. However, a system to offer both Kannada and English mediums and either of them as a second language should be in place. The final call should be left open to each student/parent catering to their individual needs.

Will you prefer sending your son to a government school for education?

That will be a matter of practicality and we'll take a call depending on what is right for him at that point of time. He's just one year old now. I've seen several government schools that are very good and way better than their private counterparts with an enabled and progressive outlook. Good things take time and hopefully with such initiatives, government schools will retain its past glory. To be very honest, we haven't given this much thought as to how we should have already.","Make govt schools appealing to students, parents: Mysuru scion Yaduveer Krishnadatta","1018018094","2018-12-13","https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/141218/make-government-schools-appealing-to-students-parents-yaduveer-krish.html","Deccan Chronicle",FALSE

Sisodia made the comments during a panel discussion on ""Living Mindfully: Initiatives and Learnings"" at New Delhi Institute of Management (NDIM).

He said the biggest reason why India has been a developing country since such a long time is because ""we focus on schooling, not education"".

""We only study to get a degree but not adapt those lessons in our daily life,"" the Deputy chief minister said.

"3078","","When Ravi Pratap Singh, principal of a primary school in Gonda district, joined the institution in August 2013, only 138 students were enrolled there. The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them.

He started using his mobile phone and tablet to teach students rhymes and realised that their interest levels increased sharply. Seeing Ravi's performance, a local MLA supported him with cash prize of Rs 1 lakh which he used to buy a projector and speakers etc.

Seeing its performance, the state government rewarded the school with a cash prize of ₹ 1.2 lakh in 2015-16. ""I used the money to buy audio video gadgets and transformed the school into a smart class. I started using the audio-visual mode of communication to teach other subjects as well. The attendance began improving. Now there are 325 students in the school. Today, the students don't want to miss any class,"" he said.

This is not the lone example.

Alpa Nigam, headmaster of a school in Gorakhpur, said when she joined in 2010, very few students were enrolled and most of them ran away after lunch time. To catch their interest, Alpa too started using a mobile phone and speakers.

Impressed with her dedication, Rotary Club and other well-wishers donated a projector, which is being used to screen educational movies for students. Now the school has three laptops and learning is fun here.

Sushil Singh, principal of primary school Gulriha in Harak block of Barabanki district said, ""We had received ₹1.2 lakh from the state government as part of an excellence award. We used the prize money to buy a projector, speakers and an inverter and started smart classes. The results have been encouraging. We hope other schools will follow our model instead of waiting for government assistance.""

The number of government schools in Uttar Pradesh running smart classes had been slowly but steadily growing, said a basic education department official. He said this was largely due to efforts of individual teachers who were seeking help from good Samaritans or opting for crowd funding to arrange the money needed to digitize the teaching process.

At a time when the state government is still to make any budgetary provision for running smart classes in schools, these teachers are doing their best to equip their institutions with the latest technologies and compete with private institutions mushrooming in small districts.

Now the basic education department is preparing a database of all such schools.

""The findings, so far, have come as a surprise. Nearly 1,200 schools (out of the total 1.54 lakh in the state) are running smart classes,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh. He said it was equally surprising that the state capital was yet to catch up with other districts in this respect.

He said that most of these institutions were concentrated in far off districts like Gorakhpur or smaller ones such as Hardoi and Sitapur.

""Gorakhpur has the maximum number (124) of smart class schools. Hardoi is a close second with 122 schools, and Sitapur is next with 120. Some of the other districts with such schools are Azamgarh (33), Mau (28), Muzaffarnagar (20), Bulandshahr (18), Lalitpur (17), Kaushambhi (15) and Jaunpur (10),"" he said.

Singh said that by integrating technology with education, these schools had transformed the teaching-learning process, making it far more interesting.

""It has helped a lot in increasing student retention. For instance, now a science teacher doesn't just talk about blood circulation but actually shows the students how blood is circulated in the body via arteries and veins,"" he said.

The official said that soon these teachers would be invited to the state capital where they would interact with other government school teachers, inspiring them to generate resources to make their respective schools more appealing for students.

Also, the education department is planning to extend the Government Model Primary School (GMPS) in Sector 49 to middle level (till class VIII). This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

""There are the schools which do not have good infrastructure and have less number of students, so we will be adjusting students in nearby schools. Also, the schools which are large in spaces will be further upgraded,"" said an official from the UT education department requesting anonymity.

The shifting, as per teachers may prove to be an unsuccessful task as the schools, especially in Mauli complex, railway colony and Manimajra are already overcrowded.

The schools that will get prior attention from the education department include Government Primary School in Maulijagran, Government Primary School in railway colony and Manimajra-II as these are running in worst conditions of all. GPS in Mauli and railway colony are not even having their own buildings and are being run in rented buildings.

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

The department is also planning to close Government Primary School in Buterla, Sector 41 due to low enrollment of students. ""The building can be put to some other good use. There is no point in running a separate school for a few students,"" the official added.

The school has 130 students at present studying in nursery class and classes I-V.

These schools further lack basic facilities like playgrounds and teachers have to be on toes to ensure students don't get injured as few swings that lie in the corner of small yards. Thus, making it unsafe for students. In some schools situated in Mauli complex and railway colony, they utilize the adjoining neighbourhood park as they don't have their own playgrounds. This, however, raises security concerns for children, as the park is also used by people and vendors.

He said the government was committed to tutoring rural children in English, which was now important in global communication.

The Karnataka government had in October issued an order to introduce English-medium classes in 1,000 primary schools of the state from standard one. Responding to a query by Umesh Kotian of the BJP, during the question hour in the assembly, regarding steps taken to teach in English from the next academic year, Kumaraswamy said he was aware of the constraints of teaching in English. Those eligible to teach in English would be appointed after selection test.

He said, selected teachers would be given 15 days training at the entrance level from the Regional Institute of Education (RIE) after which they would have video conferencing with the institute every month. In response to another question, Kumaraswamy said adequate text books and smart classes facilities would be provided to teach in English, with the help of Department of State Education Research and Training (DSERT).","Karnataka govt recruiting 1,715 English teachers for schools: CM","1015829178","2018-12-11","https://indianexpress.com/article/jobs/teachers-jobs/karnataka-govt-recruiting-1715-english-teachers-for-schools-cm-5488950/","The Indian Express",FALSE
"3086","","Soon, there will be a parents' corner/ counter in all government primary schools in the state. ""The idea is to inform parents and community members about various government welfare schemes, so that they could benefit from them and improve their living standards,"" said an official. Parents would also be able to inquire about their child's progress at these centres, he said.

The initiative stems from a successful experiment undertaken at a government primary school in Gonda district.

To connect better with community members, the primary school in Dhaurahra area of Gonda set up a parents' corner/ counter on its premises. ""The response was overwhelming. Parents and community people immediately connected with the school, inquiring about different welfare schemes,"" said principal Ravi Pratap Singh.

Now, a state government order, dated December 6, has directed officials to implement the initiative in all government primary schools in UP.

Director basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh, said on Monday, ""It was an innovative idea of a visionary teacher in a Gonda school -- a wonderful move to connect with the community! It also helped increase the participation of community members in the school's activities. We now want to replicate the initiative in other schools, so that more people can benefit from it.""

""The parents' corner will disseminate information on emergency services such as Dial 100, 1090 (for women in distress), fire and ambulance services, as well as road safety and traffic rules,"" he said.

The initiative will also look at improving women's literacy in every district, as envisaged in the Centre's 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' (BBBP) campaign. ""It will educate masses about free and compulsory education for all children under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. For people who are uncomfortable in filling up bank cash deposit forms, the schools will keep deposit forms of different banks and help community people in filling them up,"" said director basic education.

He said the counter would also educate community members about the health department's new welfare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and other programmes, including free cataract operations, vaccinations, and facilities available for pregnant women.

Explaining how the school managed to make a strong impact with its parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh said, ""We informed the locals about the government's Ujjwala scheme and many of them benefited from it. We followed it up with information on the CM's helpline for Swachh Bharat Mission, which enabled people to register their complaints. Likewise, we kept passing useful information to them from time to time.""

Gram pradhan Rajani added, ""As agriculture is the only occupation of villagers, the school's teachers took out time to educate farmers about the latest technologies that would improve their yield and lower costs. Teachers also educated villagers about the ill-effects of liquor and tobacco consumption on their health. How to preserve the environment for a better tomorrow was another subject on which the teachers created awareness.""

Apart from pioneering the idea of the parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh also introduced digital methods of imparting lessons at his school. He said that when he joined the school in August 2013, only 138 students were enrolled there. ""The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them. I started using my mobile phone and tablet to teach them rhymes, and realised that their interest levels went up substantially,"" he said.","Soon, parents' corner in all UP govt primary schools","1015402112","2018-12-11","https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/soon-parents-corner-in-all-up-govt-primary-schools/story-yjCpopnN3xoQpRWu6oiakK.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

Lobo said this while speaking to media in Calangute when he came to inspect work that is being carried out in government primary schools.

He said, although the government is improving the facilities in the government primary schools all over Goa, these were not enough.

Along with infrastructural improvement, there also has to be improvement in educational standard in government schools, he added.

""Teachers need to be provided training in order to improve the quality of teaching and bring government primary schools on par with private schools. However, this is not happening and, hence, Goan parents prefer to wait in queues to enrol their wards in private schools,"" he lamented.

"3088","","NEW DELHI: About 670 IT-assistants, hired by the Directorate of Education for various government schools across the city on contractual basis, allege that they have not been paid salaries for almost five months.

The computer professionals said they joined the schools in June 2018, but were paid a month's salary only in November this year, a day before Diwali. The assistants claim their complaints to CM, deputy CM (who also holds the charge of the education department) and public grievance cell have failed to provide them a relief.

The assistants said they were hired by Intelligent Communication Systems India Limited (ICSIL) and sent to Delhi government's DoE, which, in turn, deployed them in various government schools.

""When we did not get our salary for three months, the company that hired us told us to contact the DoE. When we talked to the education department officials, they said paying salaries was the responsibility of the company that outsourced the manpower. We have only been shuttling between the two offices,"" said an IT Assistant, requesting anonymity.

The job responsibility of the assistants include managing the attendance of students and teachers, monitoring the e-mails, orders and circulars coming from the DoE and sharing them with the head of the school.

The education department had initially hired 1,068 IT Assistants and later advertised for another 670 more computer professionals for schools that have more than 1,200 students and thus have more work load. While the 1,068 IT Assistants, hired for two years, have been getting their salaries regularly, the 670 have not been paid.

""Despite being working hard all these months, sometimes on Sundays and holidays as well, our salaries have not been released. We all our working under duress and are sustaining ourselves by taking loans from friends, families and even from banks. We are under severe financial pressure,"" said another assistant.

Sanjay Goel, director of DoE, told TOI: ""The contract of the 670 IT assistants was for six months. Till June their salary has been paid. For the extension given from July, the salary has been processed and will be given to them soon.""

A representative from ICSIL said the IT Assistants were first hired for three months and in June, it was decided to extend their contract for one year. ""However, the file to extend their contract was not approved by the government, and that's why the salaries were not paid. Their extension of work contract has now been approved and the salaries will be released in the next few days,"" he added.","Delhi: IT-assistants at govt schools claim not paid for 5 months - Times of India","1014558167","2018-12-10","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/it-sahayaks-at-govt-schools-claim-not-paid-for-5-months/articleshow/67016817.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"3089","","Gurgaon: Little scholars in their sundry uniforms head towards a dusty pink building on a nippy winter morning in Basai. Chatting about the upcoming examination and reciting multiplication tables, they are getting ready for another day at the Government Senior Secondary School here.

From the outside, there's nothing extraordinary about the scene but as you enter, a pleasant surprise awaits.

Neatly furnished classrooms, a library and lab form part of an encouraging attempt to give these children quality education infrastructure, all thanks to an experiment by Brahm Prakash Shastri, a former principal of the school.

By bypassing administrative procedures and seeking help directly from NGOs, and tapping various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Shastri's endeavours have ended up benefiting teachers as well as some 20 government schools in the district. And it's the power of community, he believes, which has helped turn his simple idea into gold, in the space of four years.

As a rule, to channel CSR funds, corporates and NGOs must approach the education department but this is a process that can, and often does, take a long time. ""And all the donations don't necessarily reach us,"" admits Shastri, who eventually sought the assistance of the big companies, with due approval from the education department. Now, the govt school in Basai has an impressive science and computer lab, an RO water purifier for clean drinking water, refurbished toilets, a diesel genset and split air-conditioners, besides well-furnished classes and staff rooms. Behind all this is teamwork.

Villagers, for example, have contributed by whitewashing the walls. ""Several local NGOs approached us for basic things, like installing RO and donating books. We then asked the companies to invest directly and they have helped (with) the entrance, walking tracks and boundary walls,"" Shastri adds.

According to a notification under Section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, it is compulsory for companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, in any given financial year, to spend two percent of their net profit on CSR programmes.

And following the successful Basai model, government schools in Carterpuri, Jacobpura, Tikri, Shakurpur, Bhondsi and Tikli (and one in Sarsa, Bhiwani), have undergone renovation. The Tikri school, TOI found, is getting a new washroom for boys, girls and handicapped children (courtesy a North American real estate firm). Tulsiram, the principal here, happily acknowledges the transformation. ""Our school was initially in a very bad condition - there was no sewer connection and the boundary wall was in a dilapidated state,"" he recalls, sitting in his office-cum-staff room. ""We are not aware of the expenditure, but this CSR activity has brought a positive change in the school.""

Indeed, in two years, CSR funds have ensured that the Tikri govt school is not lacking when it comes to the bare essentials, among them a water tank, utensils for midday meals, a level playground and washrooms.

Dinesh Shastri, the district education officer, has visited 20 such schools across the state and claims that facilities are on a par with those in private schools. ""The drop-out rate has come down heavily too,"" he says.

However, for all the progress in infrastructure development, there are still more than 30,000 vacancies for teachers in the state. The data report card of the District Information System for Education (U-DISE) corroborates this fact, pointing out the acute shortage of teachers and principals in Haryana.

Still, with over 540 government schools in the district, there is no dearth of corporate majors who are prepared to come forward and do their bit towards make the learning ecosystem more welcoming and fun for children.","Principal channels CSR funds, sets makeover template for govt schools - Times of India","1013943369","2018-12-09","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/principal-channels-csr-funds-sets-makeover-template-for-govt-schools/articleshow/67006991.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

Karnataka cabinet on Wednesday accepted the proposal to amend the rules, making it mandatory for parents to approach government schools which are situated within 5 kms radius before applying for RTE seat in private schools in the area.

The present RTE rules does not stipulate parents to approach government schools before applying in private schools and students are eligible for the RTE fee reimbursement.

Briefing the reporters, Parliamentary affairs minister Krishna Byre Gowda said, under the proposed change, the child would be eligible for a RTE fee reimbursement from a private school only if there is no government school within the 5 kms radius or if he failed to get a seat in the government school.

"3091","","CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government has directed district collectors to declare holidays only in case of severe inundation or flooding in any area leading to paralysis of transport facilities. Mere rain or drizzle should not be taken as a cause for declaring holidays, it said.

Directing the collectors to exercise extra caution in declaring school holidays, school education secretary Pradeep Yadav has issued a series of guidelines to protect the interest of students.

This comes after the government noticed that the district collectors resorted to declaring holidays even on a normal rainy day ""without realising that it disturbs the entire lesson plan for teaching and learning.""

""The decision to close schools may be taken three hours before the opening of schools, taking into account the situation prevailing at that time,"" Yadav said.

The chief educational officers shall assess the gravity of the situation and suggest the area and day for declaring the holiday to the district collector.

Holiday may be restricted to the affected areas only. Revenue district need not be the unit of declaration of holiday, while educational district, block or any other local body could even be the unit for declaring holiday, Yadav said.

The official said the announcement for declaring holiday on other accounts such as local temple festivals should also contain the day on which compensatory classes would be held.

Each holiday declared in any area should be duly compensated by opening schools in that area on Saturdays so that schools do not miss any lesson planned for the day of holiday.

""Efforts should be made to open schools at the earliest,"" Yadav said. Camps, if any, should be shifted to other facilities available in the vicinity. Pumping out of water in case of water logging and cleaning of premises should be given the utmost priority in the scheme of relief and rehabilitation.

In Tamil Nadu, the holidays to schools are declared in a routine manner on the previous day itself on mere warnings of cyclone, irrespective of intensity. It has been noticed that on the days of holiday due to rain, there is bright sunshine.

The government schools are normally the first target for selecting as relief centres without even exploring other facilities such as community halls, service centres, cyclone shelters in the vicinity.

The studies of students studying particularly in government schools are adversely affected, Yadav said. There is also a predetermined schedule of tests and examinations, which gets derailed due to declaration of too many holidays.","Tamil Nadu govt directs district collectors to exercise caution in declaring rain holidays for schools - Times of India","1010850407","2018-12-05","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-govt-directs-district-collectors-to-exercise-caution-in-declaring-rain-holidays-for-schools/articleshow/66949072.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

"3093","","Govt schools short of text books, BOSE says consignment 'stuck' in highway

Government-run schools in Jammu and Kashmir are without text books as authorities say that the truck -- carrying the consignment was stuck ""somewhere"" in Jammu-Srinagar highway.

Meanwhile with the government announcing winter vacations, students of these government schools were in a dilemma as they have not received their textbooks yet from the school authorities.

The annual examinations in government primary and middle schools culminated last month but the promoted students have not been provided with various textbooks by School Education Department (SED).

The teachers in various government-run-schools said that there is a non-availability of mathematics, history and geography books for the 9th standard and mathematics, Science in 10th standard also.

The teachers also said that the students from 5th to 8th standard are also without mathematics, history and civics textbooks.

Official sources in SED said that the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) was probably supposed to order 50 lakh textbooks but this year the department ordered these books late.

""However the board have received some of the books but few books are yet to be received and the School Education Department,"" he said.

""SED has given a deadline to the JKBOSE for availing the pending books of various classes till December 05, sources said adding, ""The school authorities have been also asked to distribute the pending books on 15th of December to all respective students.""

He said that the JKBOSE was also directed to provide books and stationery to the school authorities of Ladakh district first because of the road closure issues.

Lamenting on the non-availability of various books in Srinagar district he said there is a huge non-availability of various books from Ist to 10th standard in the district.

Chairman, JKBOSE, Veena Pandita said, ""We have science books available but mathematics and Urdu books are pending for two classes."" ""Actually the trucks carrying the books are stuck somewhere in the highway. But in coming two days we are hopeful, we will receive these books too,"" she assured. She said that for the rest of the classes there was no shortage or non-availability of any book.

He was speaking after inaugurating the centenary celebrations of Gadichowka Government School in Lakshmipuram, organised by Reachout India, Inner Wheel Club of Mysore West, DRC Cinemas and other educational institutions recently and said the school has contributed immensely by helping thousands of poor students in the last 100 years to make a mark in the society.

This is where the contribution of NGOs like Reachout India and organisations like Rotary and Lions become important as they can provide basic facilities like libraries, toilets, books and desks to run such schools, which are starved of funds, he said.

He said that if everyone has to be educated then the government schools' standards should be improved and see that the parents and students seek these schools to learn.

This can happen only if every parent sends his or her child to school, he added.

On the occasion, Vana Mahotsava was also celebrated by planting a few saplings.

"3095","","Thiruvananthapuram: Ashok Kumar, station officer of Thiruvananthapuram fire station, could not help but recall how schools in the city had turned a blind eye towards the free training offered at the pool set up at Government UP School, Nedumcaud, here. The sense of dismay was visible on the face of the officer, who is also in-charge of the swimming course conducted by the government, while leading the search operations to recover the bodies of two siblings from Karamana river on Tuesday/Wednesday.

""People are yet to realise the importance of teaching their children how to swim. Many drowning deaths could have been avoided. Government schools are not paying heed despite repeated requests,"" he said. Kumar is inching towards the fag end of his career and in the past one year alone he had attended more than ten similar cases of drowning.

Jalaraksha is a government project aimed at imparting free swimming lessons to students of government schools. The government also provides funds for free refreshments, including milk, egg and bread, to students enrolled under this scheme. Schools can approach local fire stations to avail the scheme. Private individuals can also avail the training here, but, only by paying fee.

It was in 2016 that the pool was constructed at Nedumcaud by local administration as a permanent facility for the scheme. ""It was more than two months ago that the last batch of students completed training here. After that no school has sent their students to make use of the opportunity,"" said Premkumar, a fireman as well as member of scuba diving team of the department, who is one among the trainers. At present around 300 children are taking swimming lessons at the facility, but all of them are from private schools and enrolled by their parents not schools.

Abdul Rasheed, district fire officer, said as per Jalaraksha scheme, people could avail swimming lessons for their wards from the personnel of all local fire stations, provided there was a pool in the locality. ""But, we hardly get any applications,"" said Rasheed said adding that major share of fund allotted by the government to buy refreshments for the students was yet to be spent. He also added that the lukewarm response to the project was because of the apathy of teaching faculty.

"3101","","Students during a workshop on ""menstrual awareness and hygiene"" in Sarvodaya co-ed Senior Secondary School in Nanak Puri.(NGO Sacchi Sahel)

For most part of the 14 years of his life, Priyanshu Singh, a class 9 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Yamuna Vihar, had no clue why his female friends complain about mood swings and abdominal pain for a day or two every month. Whenever the girls declined to participate in sports activities, he would mock and even crack jokes at their expense.

But all of that changed this September.

That was when Singh understood that it happens when the girls are either going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or on their monthly period cycle. ""While I knew what periods are, I was unaware about the difficulties women face when they are on their natural cycle. I used to laugh at my friends when they would complain about stomachache and mood swings. Now, I understand that mood swings are because of the PMS and it's normal to have stomach pain while they are on their periods,"" he said.

The change in mindset and the awareness was only possible because the school organised a workshop on 'menstrual awareness' in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sachhi Saheli. ""It was overwhelming to see the students, especially boys, asking menstruation-related queries with so much confidence. At the end of the workshop, the boys distributed packets of sanitary napkins among girls without any hesitation and pledged to make the campus period-friendly,"" RP Singh, principal of the school, said.

Now, the school is planning to organise a workshop for parents as well. ""Most of these students come from families where such discussions are prohibited. We are planning to organise a workshop for parents to sensitise them and encourage them to discuss these topics with their children,"" he said.

But their school is not an exception.

As many as 30 co-educational government schools have approached the NGO this year to organise workshops in order to sensitise students about menstruation. Till July this year, the NGO was conducting these workshops only in all girls' schools. ""We wanted to impart basic education about menstruation to students studying in government schools. We had contacted the Directorate of Education (DoE) last year and briefed them about our plan. The DoE gave us permission to conduct these workshops in girls' schools running under the Delhi government and the civic bodies. But, this year we started receiving requests from co-ed schools as well. We have already covered around 10 co-ed schools in the last four months and it has turned out to be a wonderful experience,"" said Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli.

During the workshops, the students are told about the science behind menstruation and the myths surrounding it. The girls are also taught basic hygiene that should be maintained during periods. ""We do not discuss about menstruation with boys at home or school and still expect them to be sensitive and supportive. It's very important to remove stigmas and taboos attached to periods from their minds. That's why we show them sanitary napkins and explain the importance of their use. We also tell boys about the physical and mental strains girls go though during their menstrual cycle,"" Singh said.

At another co-ed school in Nanakpura, a class 10 student Sagar Malik said he gifted his mother a pack of sanitary pads after attending the workshop. ""I had come to know about the issues women face in case they use cloth instead of sanitary pads during their periods. I requested the teacher in charge at my school to give a packet for my mother because I did not know what she uses. I have never heard anything about menstruation at home. When I gave her the packet, she looked shocked. But when I told her what I had learnt at school, she looked happy and relieved. She even called me a Padman,"" the 14-year-old said.

Meanwhile, a group of boys at a government co-ed school in Vasant Kunj has pledged to educate people in their localities about ""menstrual health"". ""We have decided to go from door to door in our localities and tell people the importance of maintaining hygiene during periods to avoid infections,"" said Lalit Singh, one of the students.

Girls, too, are happy with the change.

Divya Singh, a class 9 student at a school in Janakpuri, said she used to bring a 'black polythene bag' to carry the packet of sanitary napkins the school distributes under the Centre's Kishori Shakti Yojna. The girls in her school would collect their packets from the medical room after classes got over. Under the Kishori Shakti Yojna, girl students, between the ages of 11 and 18, are distributed a sanitary napkin packet every month in government schools across the country.

However, Singh and her classmates have now asked the teacher to distribute the pack of sanitary napkins in the classrooms. ""We had never uttered the word period in the presence of our male classmates before. It was the first time when a group, having more boys than girls, was sitting and discussing the myths and taboos attached to menstruation. Things have comparatively changed. Now, we do not have to think hundred times before talking about periods in school at least like we have to do at home,"" she said.

According to a survey published in Journal of Family and Community Medicine (JFCM) in September, 40% girls remained absent from school during their menstruation for reasons such as lack of privacy at school, source of information on menstruation and anxiety about leakage, and staining of their uniform. The survey was conducted on 600 girls studying in government schools in Delhi.

Experts say it's important to impart basic knowledge about menstruation at schools. ""It's important to make both make both genders aware of the science behind menstruation. While for girls, good menstrual hygiene can help prevent any kind of pelvic inflammatory diseases and infections, such talk sessions are equally important for boys to remove all the taboos and preconceived notions about periods. They should understand that it's a part of a girls' life and absolutely normal,"" said Dr Anuradha Kapur, a senior gynecologist at Max hospital in Saket.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said the government will encourage more co-ed schools to come forward and organise such workshops.","Menstrual awareness workshops: Breaking stereotypes in co-ed govt schools","1002729156","2018-11-25","https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/menstrual-awareness-workshops-breaking-stereotypes-in-co-ed-govt-schools/story-irz2aBnhNQCFRv0mPlk8aK.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

Anger simmers in the villages of Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts. It has been five days since Cyclone Gaja reduced their homes to rubble. A sea of discontentment is all that remains for the people in Thalayamangalam in Tiruvarur and Vizhanthamavadi in Nagapattinam districts. Despite the TN Chief Minister's claims that relief works started hours after the cyclone made landfall, people in these two villages deny it completely.

Villagers are involved in protests across the districts in the past two days alleging that no relief has come from the government's side for them. ""We (common men) immediately pitched in money and bought power saws to cut the trees. The trees in Rajagopalapuram village were cleared by the villagers after a lot of struggle.

Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's pet scheme to promote solar energy in households through a subsidy scheme has been left languishing in cold storage since her death in 2016.

4. 32-Year-Old Man Murdered in TN, Police Probe If It Is a Case of Hate Killing

32-year-old Esakki Shankar body was sprawled on wild foliage, deep cuts visible on his hand and his chest. A fatal knife wound on his neck police believe was the likely cause of his death. Shankar's body was found at around 7.30 am on Tuesday at the banks of the Thamarbharani river which flows near his home at Vellanguli in Tirunelveli district. Shankar was murdered when he went to take a bath at the river.

But over a day after he was hacked to death, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who conducted the preliminary investigation says that they have established neither the motive for the murder nor zeroed in on possible suspects. An investigating official in his team however on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that they were looking into two possible motives, one of which is a hate crime.

6. 187 Buses Shifted from CMBT to KK Nagar Depot

A month after shifting Andhra Pradesh bound buses to the newly developed Madhavaram Mofussil bus terminus (MMBT), the Transport department has shifted buses operating to Puducherry, Cuddalore and Chidambaram from Koyambedu bus terminus to K K Nagar MTC depot. The move aimed at decongesting the Dr MGR bus terminus in Koyambedu and Inner Ring road, is expected to bring down travel time by 30 minutes.

Some 167 buses run by Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Villupuram) and 20 buses of Puducherry Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) have been shifted to K K Nagar MTC depot, two weeks ago. The decision was also attributed to the frequent accidents at Ashok pillar junction by official sources.

"3104","","Nagpur: In a big setback to Maharashtra government, particularly to education minister Vinod Tawde, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday, protected rights of grant-in-aid school and junior colleges' managements to select and appoint teachers.

About two dozen schools from Vidarbha, receiving full or partial grant-in-aid from the exchequer, challenged the amendment made by government in Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Rules, 1981, by introducing online recruitment system through its 'Pavitra' portal and also to make appointments through eligibility/aptitude test conducted by it.

A notification was issued in this regard on June 22 last year while Tawde had declared to fill up over 18,000 teachers posts in aided schools through 'Pavitra' portal, during assembly session, here on July 9. He justified the move asserting that it would ensure total transparency and end any chances of corruption. Earlier, there were several complaints that the school managements used to charge in lakhs for single appointment.

""The procedure for teachers' selection and appointment in private schools should be governed by MEPS' Rule 6(1), (2) and (3) read with Rule 9 (2A) and (2B), without interfering with right of the management/committee to select and appoint qualified, eligible and suitable candidates by holding interviews,"" a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi ruled, while partly allowing the bunch of petitions.

The petitioners though counsels Bhanudas Kulkarni and Ravindra Khapre -- had termed amendment as violation of their fundamental right to carry on the occupation of education, as guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. It encroaches upon their autonomy and privilege to select and appoint the teachers. They also challenged government resolution (GR) of June 23 last year, which binds the management to make appointments as per merit list of candidates, who cleared the eligibility/aptitude test.

The bench observed that Rule 9 (2B) of the MEPS Rules, retains power with school management/committee to select the teachers of its choice among the qualified candidates. ""We reject the state's argument that Rule 9 (2B) has to be interpreted in such a fashion so as to mandate the management/committee to appoint teachers strictly as per the merit list of those clearing eligibility/aptitude test conducted by centre/state without judging comparative merits and suitability to select the candidates on the basis of oral interview.""

The judges added that the school committee retains its powers under Rule 9 (2B) to conduct oral interview of candidates, and appoint a suitable one. ""We, however, make it clear that to maintain transparency, each member of the management/committee will have to mandatorily record reasons in brief for deviating from the order of merit shown in the list of successful candidates in the eligibility/aptitude test. The decision of majority will prevail in the matter of selection and appointment of teachers.""

They added that if government's interpretation was accepted, they have to strike down provision of Rule 9 (2B), to the extent it deprives right of the management to select and appoint teachers on grounds that it suffers from incompetence, makes right to appoint illusory, and violates fundamental rights of management.

Pavitra app was bound to fail, says Ganar

The setback at the HC for government over its Pavitra app has not surprised MLC Nago Ganar, who says it was 'bound to fail'.

Ganar, who represents the teachers constituency, said the government should have simply made an amendment in the act that regulates the hiring. ""The act says that management has the right of appointment, so unless that is modified by the legislature things will not change. It was a step in the right direction to end corruption, but the route the government chose was incorrect,"" said Ganar.","Setback to govt, as HC upholds schools' rights to appoint teachers - Times of India","1000338875","2018-11-21","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/setback-to-govt-as-hc-upholds-schools-rights-to-appoint-teachers/articleshow/66741520.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

"3109","","NEW DELHI: Following a review of mid-term results at Delhi government schools, the Directorate of Education has started sending showcause notices to institutions that have recorded pass percentages of below 40 in classes IX, X, XI and XII.

The review of mid-term results at 1,100 government schools threw up worrying trends. In class IX, on average, 80% of the students failed; this number was slightly lower at 70% for class X. However, in classes XI and XII, the average pass percentage was 50%. In total, there were 34 schools in classes XII (science, commerce, arts and vocational stream), XI (science, commerce, arts), IX and VIII, which had zero pass percentage.

According to a circular issued by education officer of zone 10 of Northwest district, a notice has already been sent to a school where the pass percentage was below 40%. A copy of the notice is with TOI. ""The results of mid-term examination of this school is less than 40%, which is very poor and below norms. It is hereby directed to explain the reason behind the less result of the school. The explanation must reach the DDE office within three days of receipt of this notice, failing which action as deemed fit will be initiated (sic),"" the circular stated.

Similar circulars have been sent to schools in other districts too. Unlike last year, when showcause notices were issued to individual subject teachers, this time, schools are being held accountable. The principal of a school in outer Delhi attributed the poor results to non-availability of teachers in certain subjects and also due to lengthy absenteeism among students.

When Shobha Suryanarayan, a volunteer with Acharyas for a Better Community (ABC), first approached Vijayanagar Lower Primary School in Whitefield, the students could barely string together a sentence in English. The school had over 50 children from classes 1 to 5, but there was only one teacher and a headmistress (HM) to teach all of them. Children in classes 1, 2 and 3 would sit together; they were taught by the HM once she finished her official work. Children in classes 4 and 5 would sit together, and were taught by the other teacher, says Shobha.

ABC, an NGO based in Bengaluru, is driven by volunteers who go to teach in government schools. They also get CSR funding to meet each school's individual requirements.

At Vijayanagar school, the teachers asked ABC to take over English classes. In last November, ABC appointed a full-time teacher in the school, whose salary is paid with CSR funds. Within just three months, there was a huge difference, says Shobha. ""The students spoke in English, and even performed a skit in English. When I first had gone in, they had no idea about sentence structure,"" she says. ABC also appointed a janitor since students themselves used to clean the school, including its toilets, up till then.

ABC is also refurbishing the school, and setting up a peer lab and library there, with CSR funds. ""We have built a dining area and washing area for the kids. The ground has been levelled and cleaned up so that children have a safe place to play. We also raised the compound wall and put up barbed fencing to prevent anti-social activities that used to be common in the school premises at night,"" says Shobha. CSR funds also cover students' breakfast, which has resulted in both higher attendance rates and better attention span among students. Overall ABC has got Rs 40 lakhs as CSR funds for Vijayanagar School.

In Pattandur Agrahara School behind ITPL, the student enrolment went up from less than 10, to 96 now. The school which was in threat of being shut down, was rebuilt by ABC. ABC's volunteers also teach in the school. The school's transformation has most benefited children from the migrant construction labourer community who live nearby. Similar was the case with Nallurhalli Government Primary School.

ABC is one among the many volunteer-driven initiatives in the city that's changing government schools, one at a time. In addition to registered trusts like ABC, there are also informal volunteering groups, like one led by Anupama Harish in Malleswaram.

The shortage of competent teachers in government schools, lack of functional infrastructure, and difficult familial circumstances are causing many students to perform poorly in schools or to drop out altogether. Many low-income families also spend a large part of their income to send their children to private schools, in hope of better education, especially in English. However, studies show that low-income private schools are hardly any better than government schools in terms of learning outcomes. It's in this scenario that volunteer interventions are strengthening the public school system in Bengaluru.

Many volunteering organisations start off without much of a plan.

Malleswaram volunteers had come together when local resident Anupama Harish proposed her idea of volunteering in the 'Malleswaram & Suttha Muttha' Facebook group. Of nearly 12,000 members in the group then, many responded. Since 2015-16, Anupama's team has been teaching Mathematics in the Malleswaram 18th Cross Boys' High School.

The group has three volunteer-teachers for Maths each in 8th, 9th and 10th standards. Each teacher picks a favourite topic in Maths to teach - algebra, geometry etc. At any time, the group has 10-15 volunteers.

The school initially asked Anupama to get the permission of the Block Education Officer (BEO). The BEO was happy to have volunteer-teachers since the school had teacher shortage, especially in Maths. Maths was also the subject in which majority of the 10th standard students had failed in the previous year, in board exams.

After discussions with the school's head teacher, the group got a timetable. From this year, they have also been teaching Social Studies here. The team has developed a structured syllabus. They also update their progress in a common document so that there is no overlap in what's taught.

Having a structured syllabus is important since volunteers may otherwise teach random topics, concurs Jayashree Narayanan, who was a teacher-volunteer with the NGO OBLF (One Billion Literates Foundation). Jayashree, by her own initiative, had approached Kaikondrahalli Government School a few years back, interested in being a volunteer-teacher. She then became part of OBLF, which signed MoUs with the schools to allow its volunteer-teachers there.

Jayashree then found interested volunteers through her personal networks. OBLF volunteers have worked with five schools in Sarjapur Road area so far, but the volunteering has been stalled for this year because of the lack of committed volunteers. Jayashree plans to resume the programme next year.

OBLF volunteers start off the academic year by assessing students on spoken and written English. ""So we know where the kids stand, and we teach them from that level. We give another assessment at the end of the year to see how far the kids have progressed,"" says Jayashree. The team gets only a one-hour slot in a day. Usually there are two volunteers teaching English in each grade - one teachers three hours and the other two hours per week, so that there is continuity. Jayashree says schools have been open to them since they come from a registered NGO, with proper permissions.

ABC had started informally in 2016, as a group of 10-15 people. They initially had difficulty getting CSR funds, but this changed with their success in Pattandur Agrahara School. In late 2017, ABC registered as a Trust since corporates would fund only formal entities. Currently the NGO is a loosely structured organisation with a CSR group, operations group, social media group etc, all driven by volunteers. The organisation has about 50 volunteers in the city, and has worked with around 20 schools so far.

ABC starts engaging with a school by holding sports or art events, or by donating school bags etc to the students. During events, the team identifies the requirements of the school by talking to teachers and students. ""When we hold an event, they understand that we are serious. We list down requirements and create a proper project for the school,"" says Vikas Chandra, co-founder of ABC.

The requirements are put up on ABC's Facebook page, where people interested in volunteering or donating respond. The NGO also approaches corporates for CSR funds to do building repairs, set up new infrastructure, appoint teachers, distribute bags to students etc. It takes a good deal of time and effort to get CSR funds approved, says Chandra.

Volunteers say that working with high school or PUC students is more difficult as they often lack basic knowledge in subjects. Brijesh of the Malleswaram group says teaching 10th standard students was an uphill task. ""They didn't even know basic maths such as addition and subtraction. But we made sure that students who would come to 10th standard from 8th and 9th standards would get the basics right,"" he says.

Working with primary school students is more fruitful than working with high school or PUC students, opine volunteers. Younger children are more receptive to learning, and can get a good foundation at the appropriate age, they say. ""We want to enter the primary school sector now. If we strengthen the basics of primary school children, teaching high school students will become easier for our own volunteers,"" says Anupama.

Many students also come from very unstable backgrounds, such as abusive/alcoholic fathers, along with socio-economic backwardness or migrant nature of parents jobs. They need to be motivated to study, say volunteers. Schools get very little amounts for annual maintenance, and hence lack essential stationery materials and staff. In some schools, toilets are locked up or students are made to clean those due to the lack of cleaning staff. ""In a class of 30-40 students, only 10-15 would really want to learn. The other children don't even want to come to school,"" says Jayashree.

Coordinating between volunteers and schools is a challenge for volunteering organisations. Volunteers come from varying backgrounds, but most are homemakers or working professionals. While homemakers are available to volunteer on weekdays, coordinating with professionals on their time slots at the school can be a challenge. Negotiating with the school to get good time slots for teaching, having the school not cancel a time slot randomly, and having committed volunteers who go to the school regularly, are all challenges. Most volunteer organisations ask its members to commit to teaching in a school for at least a year.

The volunteering system acts as a self-sustaining system, where the interested, committed volunteers stay on their own. Volunteering groups say that most volunteers who stay on are well-qualified and passionate about teaching.

However, finding committed volunteers who are fluent in both English and Kannada has been difficult in Sarjapur Road area, says Jayashree. ""Many volunteers, once they start teaching, realise that not knowing Kannada is a barrier in reaching out to primary school children, since these children are very young.""

Some volunteers at ABC circumvented this problem by taking a six-month course in Kannada to learn the basics. ""This leads to a reverse teaching process in the class. Students love that they can teach Kannada to volunteers,"" says Shobha. Sometimes, if a student in the class knows Hindi, the child will act as a translator between the Hindi-speaking volunteer and other students.

Gaining entry into a school in the first place can be difficult as well. ""We struggle with regulatory challenges - BEO permissions, HMs not wanting to cooperate etc. For teachers, it is judgement on their work when we go in. So there is a lot of resistance. Sometimes we bulldoze our way through. But sometimes we find very cooperative and committed teachers,"" says Shobha. However, once the volunteers bring about good results, schools are only too happy to have them continue, say volunteers.

While volunteers pitching in with teaching, infrastructure support and funds is impactful for that specific school, it is not an institutionalised solution, and hard to sustain in the long run. Systemic changes to the education system need more thought out interventions and reforms, which we shall explore in subsequent stories.","How volunteer teachers are making a difference in Bengaluru's govt schools |","995016000","2018-11-15","http://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/bangalore-volunteering-in-government-schools-aims-for-better-quality-education-29007","bengaluru.citizenmatters.in",FALSE
"3114","","From hiring teachers to sanitation staff, heads of Delhi government schools were on Wednesday asked by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia to utilise the funds allocated to School Management Committees (SMCs) for improving their schools.

In a first, Mr. Sisodia, who is also Education Minister, began a series of meetings with heads of schools, starting with 150 on Wednesday, a government statement said. He will be meeting heads of all around 1,000 Delhi government schools in the coming days.

Speaking to heads of schools about the ₹5 lakh to ₹7 lakh SMC fund per school, Mr. Sisodia said: ""Now you have the financial grants and powers both. Till now, heads of schools were dependant on the Directorate of Education for every small work. Heads of schools are the chairpersons of SMCs, and together with the elected members they can now run their schools efficiently.""

Appealing to heads of schools to use the amount efficiently, Mr. Sisodia said: ""You can now hire teachers for up to 200 hours and you can engage gardeners. Depending on the need for cleanliness and other sanitation issues, you can also hire additional labour.""

He added that the SMC fund can be used to hire resource persons or experts for subjects and co-curricular activities. Mr. Sisodia said heads of schools who are able to utilise the funds well would be rewarded while those do ""indulge in wrong practices will be punished"", the statement said.

Speaking about the happiness curriculum, which was introduced earlier this year, Mr. Sisodia asked heads of schools to emphasise the programme that focuses on teaching mindfulness to students.

""Mindfulness is the most important element of the happiness curriculum. We have to make our children attentive instead of asking them to practice meditation. In case we succeed in inculcating the habit of being attentiveness in our children, they will do well throughout their lives,"" he said.","Heads of govt schools asked to use additional funds","994611338","2018-11-14","https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/heads-of-govt-schools-asked-to-use-additional-funds/article25500330.ece","The Hindu",FALSE
"3115","","Three institutions under the 'Presidium' school franchise became 'Prudence' schools last week -- a change which a section of parents say they were not informed about, and for which the Education Minister says no application was submitted.

The guardians of students at the three schools -- in Ashok Vihar, Dwarka Sector 22 and Dwarka Sector 16B -- operating under the banner of Presidium, which runs eight other schools across Delhi's satellite cities, were informed through circulars that the schools were dissociating from the name 'Presidium' and changing to 'Prudence'. The circulars were signed by G S Matharoo, who was a part of the management team of Presidium group in the role of Advisor. In the circulars, his designation read 'Chairman of Prudence'.

The circular stated that the decision to dissociate from Presidium was due to its ""change in emphasis"" from ""an academically oriented, student-centric academic institution to a profit-centric institution"".

""The three schools are run by three different societies which are their governing bodies, and Presidium was only a brand they associated with. In July or August, Presidium placed a demand that the schools pay 20 per cent of their total collections in order to continue using the franchisee name. The governing bodies of all three schools passed unanimous resolutions rejecting this and they will now be operating under the new brand Prudence. Apart from the name, the entire management body remains as it was. It is the prerogative of a governing body to change the school's name,"" Matharoo told The Indian Express.

However, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia said that while a school cannot be forced to be a part of any franchise, the change has to receive government approval. ""A complaint from parents regarding this matter was received on Monday, and no prior intimation or application was received for the change,"" he said.

The circular was followed by a message by Presidium chairperson Sudha Gupta, circulated on social media, calling the change ""an act of fraud"" and ""sabotage"". Gupta added that ""to the best of my understanding, the change in name has not been done in accordance with the law"". Another circular by Matharoo followed, accusing Presidium of misappropriation of funds. Multiple attempts by The Indian Express to contact Gupta went answered. The founder of Mother's Pride, a chain of playschools, she is married to former MCD executive engineer Devinder Gupta.

Meanwhile, parents also objected to the change: ""We suddenly get to know our children are studying in a school with an unknown name,"" said Amit Kharkhari, whose children study in the Dwarka Sector 22 school.

The Presidium website markets joining the group as a franchisee as a ""smart business decision"", the requirements for which are land area, cost of construction, working capital for the initial years, and a franchisee fee comprising a licence fee and a percentage of revenue. In return for this, the franchisee is promised the ""backing of, and association with, a respected brand in education"" and ""full support in recruitment, training staff and marketing"", the agreement for which lasts 45 years.","New Delhi: 3 Presidium schools change name, govt says no intimation","993730844","2018-11-13","https://indianexpress.com/article/education/new-delhi-3-presidium-schools-change-name-govt-says-no-intimation-5445107/","The Indian Express",FALSE

In a statement issued on Tuesday, the CPI (M) State Secretary M Y Tarigami said till now the Government has failed to put a control on the nexus between the private schools and publishers, who are fleecing parents by selling textbook and notebooks at exorbitant prices. ""The government's failure has resulted in public outrage,"" he said.

He alleged that the private schools, which include elite ones, reportedly charge the commission of around 40 to 60 per cent on books being sold by them in the school premises or at the designated bookshops. A textbook of the first standard which would not cost more than Rs 40-50 is being sold at Rs 250-300 with both publisher and school management sharing the undue profits.

""There is no uniformity as every private school has its own set of textbooks being prescribed to the wards which result in murky business of the commission. This has been going on for years and it is a practice which is beneficial for both publishers and private schools. But the parents are bearing the brunt of this nexus which needs to be broken,"" Tarigami said.

He urged the Government to immediately issue instructions to private schools to stop this ""illegal profiteering"" by selling books at exorbitant rates.

Chowdhary said school management is facilitating the sale of the books on the advise of the parents for their own conveniences.

He said like any other commodity sold in the market, books are sold to parents as per the MRPs only and no parent is overcharged.

""School is only a facilitator between parents and the booksellers. They don't have to earn any profit or commission from the booksellers as they are being accused of. If parents are overcharged or if they have any complaint, the Legal Meteorology department can take action against the bookseller or retailers or publisher as per the consumer protection laws,"" he said.

""Parents also have their own choice to purchase books from any vendor in the market and they are not given any instruction by schools about purchasing books from any particular place.""

Chowdhary said over 90 percent parents of the students are seeking facility of sale of the books at one place and only less then 10 per cent parents make hue and cry.

""We have to take into consideration the wishes of the parents how they feel comfortable. The sale of the books at one place only makes things easier for the parents.""

JKJCCPS has urged government to take on board school associations along with the representatives of parents in resolving the issue amicably once for all instead of labeling them as extortionists which only harms education system here.

He schools make huge investment in the form of land, building, latest teaching aids only to provide quality education to the students so that they may only excel in academic but also compete with the best students in the world.

""Government should appreciate our works how we strive to provide quality education to the students but unfortunately the schools are being tagged as extortionists and their reputation is being unnecessarily harmed,"" said Chowdhary.

JKJCCPS warned if government continues to harass private schools without resolving the issues amicably, they would be compelled to take some actions to which only government will be responsible.

""Despite continuous harassment, schools have only sought amicable solution for the benefit of the students and comfort of the parents.

""During Azad's 10-year stint as the country's first education minister, institutions as University Grants Commission (UGC) and IITs were established,"" the CM said.

"3131","","Unavailability of teachers, irregular classes, and technical glitches in uploading results online are some of the reasons cited by several government schools in Delhi behind their poor mid-term results in classes 10 and 12. According to the Delhi government's Directorate of Education (DoE), only 30% of class 10 students and 50% of class 12 students passed the mid-term exams conducted in September.

According to officials at Government Boys' School, Karol Bagh, the classes remained irregular due to the ""unavailability"" of teachers. ""There was no permanent mathematics teacher for class 10 till August-end in our school, so classes could not be held regularly. A post-graduate teacher (PGT) who teaches class 11 and 12 filled in and took some classes. Similarly, the PGT for English was appointed very late, due to which the classes were irregular,"" an official at the school, who wished to remain anonymous, said.

Similarly, officials at another school in Jor Bagh, where a parent had helped the class 12 students complete the Physics syllabus last year because of the unavailability of teachers, also complained of a delay in the appointment of trained graduate teachers (TGTs), who are eligible to teach up to class 10, this time around. ""After the promotion of many TGTs as PGTs, there occurs a shortage of permanent TGTs in the school for many subjects such as Hindi, English and mathematics. The guest teachers were assigned late and, hence, the classes for these subjects were interrupted till August,"" an official said.

Sanjay Goel, director, DoE, accepted these problems. ""Some schools have also approached us saying there were technical glitches while uploading marks online. They said the scores for practicals could not be uploaded, due to which the score of their students were below the pass-mark. However, they have added the practical marks in the hard copy of results handed to parents last month,"" he said.

The DoE Monday summoned all the zonal education officers and head of schools (HoS) where results were below average and discussed a course of action. ""All the zonal education officers have been asked to conduct surprise visits to schools under their jurisdiction and all HoS directed to prepare modules for mock tests and extra classes for students set to take the board-level exams. The HoS are also going to sit in the classes where a large number of students failed. We are expecting to improve the results in the pre-board exams, to be held in December,"" Goel said.

Last year, only 31% students passed the class 10 pre-board exams, following which the DoE issued show-cause notices to as many as 120 schools. The results, however, improved to 69.32 % in the board exams.","Delhi govt schools blame unavailability of teachers for mid-term results","987407505","2018-11-06","https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-schools-blame-unavailability-of-teachers-for-mid-term-results/story-ujbIDZS7RYIhqVIrUoWGHJ.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"3132","","Nagpur: School owners coming under the ambit of RTE admission quota have said the government must give parity in reimbursements so that the friction between the stakeholders concerned decreases.

Currently, the reimbursement in Maharashtra is approximately Rs 17,000 per year per child, but some school owners say that it is very less as compared to their original fee structure.

A school trustee in Nagpur said that only budget schools would charge lower but very few people line up for admissions in such schools.

""CBSE-affiliated schools are mostly in demand followed by state's English medium schools. The cheapest CBSE school in Nagpur would charge around Rs 25,000 annually but the average cost would be nearer to Rs 35,000. This means the government's reimbursement is half of what schools are charging to non-RTE students,"" said the trustee.

These are some of the issues the school owners will be discussing in December when they meet for a state-level conference in Chandrapur. TOI had reported about the latest RTE guidelines and how schools expressed unhappiness over the government's increasing paperwork.

While western Maharashtra-based trustee associations' leaders spoke openly against the government policies, local members preferred to remain anonymous. ""The government is putting its responsibilities on us. We have been asked to reserve 25% seats and we don't have any problem with that, but it should make financial sense.

The company also said staying closely engaged with the local governments and the consumers is ""super important"" in the markets, adding that the strategy had worked in the Maggi noodles case of 2015.

"3765","","The United Nations says that by 2050 over two billion people -- 20% of humanity -- will be 60 or over; Kavita Sivaramakrishnan traces rapid worldwide transformations in conceptions of ageing.

In the 1940s and 1950s, western scientists saw ageing as mainly bio-medical, with implications for productivity and national security. Non-western oncologists like Vasant Ramji Khanolkar and Theodore Gillman investigated the effects of poverty, malnutrition, diet, and infections -- not employment, even in uranium mines -- on ageing, and thereby undermined the often racist theories then underlying gerontology. Western anthropologists, nevertheless, identified enduring patriarchal networks and the unsettlement which industrialisation and urbanisation were already causing in agrarian societies.

It was extremely difficult, however, to establish chronological age in cultures where age and status were marked mainly by events like circumcision or initiation rites. After 1947, Indian officials tried to determine age by people's recollection of, say, famines (the author's inference that the officials were trying to shape national memories is somewhat implausible). After the war, gerontological associations expanded. U.S. anticommunism dominated policies, and in the early 1970s oil-price rises caused sharp cuts in state funding for public services. Neoliberals criticised the so-called failure of development, but obscured two key points -- the specifiable global successes of post-war social democracy, and the documented managerialist hijacking of social-democratic institutions in the 1980s.

Challenges to neoliberalism were ignored, including Irene Taeuber's demonstration that transitions to low-fertility societies would not be globally uniform, and Simon Szreter's exposure of the fallacy that population control alone enables development. The author says development itself is perhaps the best contraceptive, though she could have shown more clearly that in neoliberal doctrine, family matters are private. None of the 62 recommendations made at the 1982 U.N.-sponsored World Assembly on Ageing in Vienna was carried out.

Governments around the world make the family responsible for the aged. India was publicly criticised for its Vienna statement that it had ""no problem of the aged,"" but its Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act 2007 lays a duty on adults to support their parents. Secondly, the author's comment that the private sector's increased involvement is ""pragmatic"" seriously understates that ideological takeover.

The Indian statute, in effect, restates social and moral orthodoxies. Sivaramakrishnan notes organisational improvements within NGOs, but her comment that many of them do not evaluate states' and international bodies' welfare priorities is unfair; India often threatens to expel world-renowned NGOs.

The text is unfortunately diminished by many grammatical and other errors, but the author shows that ageing must be seen in the context of practices, cultures, and histories; those, however, are as challengeable as earlier gerontologists' racist assumptions.","'As the World Ages  --  Rethinking a Demographic Crisis' review: Learning from ageing","991193614","2018-11-10","https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/as-the-world-ages-rethinking-a-demographic-crisis-review-learning-from-ageing/article25454533.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

Investing in children is critical to achieving the sustainable development goals, Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli said as he inaugurated a three-day South Asian Conference on 'Learning Generation and Delivery Approaches', organised by UN Children's Fund (Unicef ) in Kathmandu.

Nepal's Constitution guarantees right to education to every child, Oli said.

Regional director for Unicef South Asia Jean Gough said: ""While impressive strides have been made in achieving universal primary education, we have a learning crisis in South Asia with only about half of primary-aged children receiving education with minimum learning standards.

""We need much greater investment and increased quality education for girls and boys alike if we hope to see the next generation reach their full potential"".

"3769","","That country is suffering from education crisis is clear. Now we need to fix the system. Better pre-service teacher training coupled with transparent and merit-based recruitments is the lasting solution

Maninder Kaur Dwivedi

January 2018 saw the release of two educational surveys -- one privately sponsored and the other by the government. The non-government survey was the 12th round of ASER, conducted for the first time with secondary school-level children, as opposed to elementary level in earlier rounds. Meanwhile, NCERT released the fifth National Achievement Survey (NAS), done simultaneously for classes 3, 5 and 8. Earlier rounds of NAS were done at three-year intervals so that a cohort could be followed, as it progressed through classes 3, 5 and 8. NAS informs districts what is the average number of children who have mastered specific competencies.

While the specific headlines announcing both survey results may seem marginally different from before, the underlying message of both exercises remained the same as earlier editions -- that the country faces a learning crisis. This manifests in children's low levels of learning outcomes and inequity in education. In none of the survey findings so far is there a narrative as to how the previous exercises have been used to find solutions, to realise educational promise for reaping our demographic dividend. These assessments of varying methodologies have red flagged the issue yet again. We need to move forward from there, instead of being caught up in repetitive cycles of tweaking the methods, samples or indicators -- as if the means were the end.

So who is going to fix the system we have been told repeatedly needs fixing? After all the hype has subsided, it can only be the teacher. The assessments do not capture the teacher availability or the average instruction time for any class. The results are averages over large samples, so are dip stick of health of the system. The individual teacher has to make a change in her classroom for averages to change. The teacher is the only one who interacts with the child, who has to teach at the level of the child, so as to ensure that each one moves forward in his/her learning journey. Good teachers would not have been surprised by any of the findings, they would intuitively know the students' levels. The typical administrative reactions of more monitoring, more tests, extra classes, etc, will have limited value. Nuanced action is required.

In the short term, effective teaching time has to be ensured. Schools in most parts of the country open in April, and for Board classes it is expected that they will complete the syllabus by November. Deducting summer vacations, internal assessments, sundry holidays and activities, this leaves 25-28 weeks for active instruction. Breaking this up into hours, as per assigned subject periods, each teacher gets 120-150 hours with a class.

Given such timelines for Classes 10 and 12, the task before the teachers is difficult to say the least. It is made more challenging by the various 'events' and 'abhiyans' schools and teachers get routinely roped in to participate, as each takes time away from the limited instructional period. School autonomy and functioning should be sacrosanct, free from all events, rallies, human-chains and melas the state administration may be conducting.

In the medium term, school-wise pupil teacher ratio, including subject-wise at secondary level, should be mandatorily enforced. Ideally, assessments should be limited to such schools, till deficit of provisioning is made up in rest of the schools. It is a given that up to 80% of any educational budget in developed countries will go for teacher salaries. This should neither be a deterrent to adequate teacher provisioning nor grudged while planning budgetary outlays, for no country has built an educated skilled populace without a strong public education system.

Another medium-term intervention is making the sectoral manpower policies teacher-friendly.

Teacher shortages and poorly qualified teachers are both a cause and effect of poorly paid and managed teaching cadres. A few states have introduced better policies like transparent transfer mechanisms, which urgently need upscaling and strengthening. After adequate teacher positioning, school autonomy and teacher collaborations have demonstrated in many pilots to be the catalyst that transforms the education system. Teacher's own collectives or networks built collaborations and institutional capacities of teachers.

There are numerous examples like in Jhunjhnu in Rajasthan or Channapatna in Ramanagaram district, Karnataka, where school teaching learning has transformed as a result of investment (which is of time and trust, less financial) in the social capital of teacher's networks. In the long term, better pre-service teacher training coupled with transparent and merit-based recruitments is the lasting solution. There is a remarkable lack of awareness amongst youth about career paths, as the ASER team documented. They enroll in courses without knowing the prospects or progression.

If the teacher education sector is brought within the ambit of the University system, where subject knowledge is learnt along with a course in teacher education, it will improve the academic quality of new teachers, compress the period required, and also give alternative career options to the students. We need to reinvent our existing practices if results of future surveys have to change. Else, it's only repetitive commotion, full of sound and fury, but without any upward movement in quality or spread of education; ultimately signifying nothing.

"3770","","New Delhi: The Delhi government on Monday announced the launch of ""Mission Buniyaad"" for improving learning skills of children studying in state and municipal-run schools.

The announcement was made by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in New Delhi, days after the National Achievement Survey (NAS) showed that the entire country, including Delhi, was facing a learning crisis in schools.

Under the programme which will run from April to June for Class 3 to 5 in Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) schools and for Class 6 to 8 in government's schools, children will undergo a reading level assessment based on which they will be enrolled in specialised ""Mission Buniyaad"" classes.

""For children who are not able to read, I request all parents to cancel their vacation plans during summer holidays and send their children to school for remedial classes. I appeal to parents of children to support the Delhi government and MCDs in this campaign in the interest of their children's future,"" Sisodia said in a press conference.

Officials of the education department will run the campaign in ""mission mode"" for three months from April to June this year, Sisodia said.

Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, said that the programme is being designed on the lines of Delhi government's 'Chunauti scheme', after two rounds of meetings with MCDs, the Delhi Cantonment Board and the North Delhi Municipal Council.

""The NAS survey demonstrates that close to half of all children in our schools are not able to read their grade level textbooks. In the secondary schools run by the Delhi government, various programmes we initiated have improved reading ability by about 20 per cent.

""However, children in primary schools that are under the MCD are not able to read and thereafter when they study in secondary schools they find it difficult to cope up with the advanced levels,"" he said.

The deputy chief minister said it was in the interest of the children of Delhi that the efforts made by the government be extended to MCD schools as well.

""The municipal bodies that run primary schools in the city will raise a cadre of teachers who will drive the program, in a manner similar to the Mentor Teacher Program run in Delhi government schools. One teacher will take care of five schools and will train teachers of these five schools on enhancing readability of children,"" he said.","AAP launch 'Mission Buniyaad' to fix learning crisis in Delhi schools","816724517","2018-02-20","http://www.asianage.com/metros/delhi/200218/aap-launch-mission-buniyaad-to-fix-learning-crisis-in-delhi-schools.html","The Asian Age",FALSE

This is being aimed at improving the time that will be dedicated for experiential learning, sports and life-skills.

He emphasised on the need for extra-curricular activities and added that these activities are as important as the syllabus taught in classrooms. He was speaking at an event organised in Pune by Dhruv Global School, India Today reported.

India Today quoted Javadekar as saying, ""We need to have equal focus on experiential learning, sports, physical education and life skills education for the holistic development of the child. We are trying to reduce the burden of classroom syllabus in a phased manner to facilitate this thought.""

Furthermore, the minister added that the government will be reducing the syllabus by 10 per cent this year and 20 per cent the next year so that students can make time for the above-mentioned activities.

"3773","","About 40-odd students of 8th grade assemble in a classroom and are making miniature cars out of sun board, toothpicks, rubber bands and other such material. Each vehicle is unique in itself -- single seater with no boot space, family passenger car and some resemble a big tow truck. Ask the students what they are doing and they reply in unison, 'We are making a car that doesn't crash.'

The students are given an assortment of raw material to choose from to manufacture the car within a fixed budget; it is up to them how they want their vehicle to look like. Mind you, it is no craft class, it is the Tinkering Lab.

I was curious to see the Tinkering Lab live when I heard of the concept. On a busy Monday morning at 11.30, I find myself attending an 80 min Tinkering Lab session at Lions West Sevaniketan School in Gokulam. After the car is manufactured, an egg is placed in place of the driver and the car is ready for the test drive. The students are given a problem that the car shouldn't crash. They have to find a solution however they want to.

'I don't miss school on Mondays even if I am sick because we have tinkering lab on Mondays,' says Samudyatha, an enthusiastic 8th grader.

Started in 2014 by two ex-techies from Namma Mysuru, with tinkering as a medium, Science Ashram aims to revolutionise the education system with curriculum that encompasses STEM education and beyond. Problems that mimic real-world scenarios empower children with necessary skills and competence to face challenges in the future thus preparing them for life beyond the classroom. Even adults would enjoy dabbling in it. It aims at reorienting education from knowledge acquisition to skill mastery thus granting the students the freedom to innovate and take decisions.

'It is a revolutionary concept aimed at making our children think out of the box. We introduced the Tinkering Labs in 2018 for the students of 6th, 7th and 8th grades and the newly gained confidence in the students is conspicuous,' beams Ln. K.S. Gururaja, the President of the School. 'The entire cost of the project is borne by the school. It is completely free for the children.'

Why the need for Tinkering Labs: The academic curriculum doesn't allow much scope for experimentation and is not application oriented. Conventional teaching is aimed at producing workers for industries but the economy doesn't need only workers, it also needs leaders, consumers, thinkers. Most importantly, there is a need to reinvent our skill sets at every stage hence the concept of Science Ashram,' explains Rohan Ramanuja, an ex-techie from SJCE who started Science Ashram with childhood friend and college mate Dhruva V. Rao.

'The Lions Sevaniketan School was very encouraging when we sent the proposal to them. As of now, we have introduced the concept in 15 schools in Mysore and Bangalore. We plan to increase it to 30 this year and take it to other cities.'

I watch the children work in teams, discussing with each other, helping those who are stuck. 'The world belongs to artificial intelligence. We are very good at reproducing what we have learnt but little deviation from it and we whine the question paper is out of syllabus,' laughs Rohan who is walking me through his Start-Up, the proud smile playing on his lips all through.

What's unique: Unlike conventional curriculum, there is no uniform takeaways for the participants. To each one to his own. The most interesting about the whole concept is it allows children to make mistakes and learn from them. There is no teacher, only a facilitator.

I am eager to evaluate what I have been told. I approach a bunch of students and ask them what they have learnt by making a car that doesn't crash. 'Now I know how to design a car,' says Dhanyatha. 'It also helps us in learning how to take decisions,' adds Harshini. 'After making the car, I like to study Science.'

I notice a shy looking boy who hasn't opened his mouth until now. I lean towards him. 'What is the learning for you dear?'

'Maam, we should always wear seat belts while driving. My egg (read driver) fell out of the car in the test ride because I hadn't put seat belt for him.'","Tinkering Lab concept at Lions Sevaniketan School: Learning made fun - Star of Mysore","1023877119","2018-12-21","https://starofmysore.com/tinkering-lab-concept-at-lions-sevaniketan-school-learning-made-fun/","starofmysore.com",FALSE
"3774","","As many as 30 students from across India are busy gaining hands-on experience and additional knowledge through the radio astronomy winter school which is a joint initiative by NCRA - TIFR (National Centre for Radio Astrophysics and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research) and IUCAA (Inter University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics). The sessions are annually held in the month of December and is alternatively conducted by the two institutions. The eleventh batch of students this year have been attending sessions from December 14 which will go on till December 24.

The joint collaborative initiative was started in 2007 and the Radio Physics Laboratory has been conducting the Radio Astronomy winter schools for college students (RAWSC) from 2008 onwards.

The students of the winter school are those who are passionate about astronomy or physics. Most of them want to be part of either of the two institutions. Isha Shailesh who is studying Integrated MSc in Physics and in her third year said that she is part of the group which is experimenting at Inter University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) and has visited IUCAA for the summer course too.

Bhavesh Rajpoot is a 2nd year student of BSc with specialisation in Physics at Fergusson College and he said, ""Apart from academics, the best part of being shortlisted for the course are the experiments,"" said Rajput.

Poorva Bhalerao is a BTech student of computer engineering from MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for women said, ""This course exposes us to all branches of astronomy and is a detailed study of what is in the universe. As a child I would often look up at the night sky and wonder. Now we get to study about the higher elements out there."" Kaustav Goswami from Dibrugarh University found the course to be different from the other workshops that he has attended. ""With the hands on training, it is easier to understand how to apply the theories learnt. Goswami revealed that he plans to pursue a doctorate in Radio Astronomy after which he wants to be part of NCRA. Shantanu Saha who is studying second year BTech in aerospace at IIST Thiruvanthpuram said, ""Lecturers are teaching us all about astronomy besides telling us about future prospects and growth of this field."" Jameer Manur, coordinator and electronic engineer (research) IUCAA said that the winter school was co-founded by Professor Joydeep Bagchi from IUCAA and Professor Bhal Chandra Joshi from NCRA in the year 2008.

""This year NCRA has been hosting the 11th winter school for a period of 10 days starting from December 14. The school provides hands on training program for the second and third year BSc and B Tech students interested in Astronomy in general and Radio Astronomy in particular,"" he said. The students are exposed to a series of lectures by eminent scientists. They also get ample opportunities to carry out simple radio astronomy experiments which in turn exposes them to new developments in radio astrophysics. The students are exposed to radio astronomy techniques, analysis and they learn to interpret from simple hands-on experiments. The students of the winter school are taken on a visit to GMRT (Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope) operated by NCRA, in which they get a see how it functions and how the data processed.

""Motivational speech and interaction with eminent scientists who are pioneers in their fields also takes place. Last year Professor Govind Swaroop , Pioneer in Radio Astronomy and founder of NCRA interaction with the students of winter school. This year, Professor Jayant Narliker, founder and former director of IUCAA will be visiting the students to guide the students on their career path,"" said Jameer.

Subhashis Roy, co ordinator for radio astronomy winter school from NCRA said that it is the only programme which emphasizes on hands- on experiments.

""Majority of students who attend the winter school have gone to some of the finest premier institutes to do their Ph D. The main goal is to provide a platform for training undergraduate students of science and engineering in radio astronomy techniques and instrumentation, thereby generating enough human resources for various national facilities for radio astronomy and also for enhancing Indian participation in international radio astronomy facilities,"" he said.","Campus connect: Radio astronomy winter school at Pune gives experimental learning experience to 30 students ","1023824986","2018-12-21","https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/campus-connect-radio-astronomy-winter-school-at-pune-gives-experimental-learning-experience-to-30-students/story-sGtxQ7cFudmUXQvSK99ugM.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

"3776","","Navy chief Admiral Sunil Lanba said the three services were moving towards jointness, but remained divided on the proposal for integrated theatre commands.

New Delhi: India's top military officer Monday said the Army, the Navy and the Air Force were in disagreement over the creation of integrated theatre commands.

But he did say the services were moving towards ""jointness"", and the biggest example of this is that wannabe chefs of the Indian Air Force are being taught to cook and serve by the catering school of the Indian Navy -- generally rated the most hospitable force.

Responding to a question at his annual Navy Week press conference Monday, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba said: ""You are right, there are differences.

""The three services have agreed on a permanent chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. The proposal is with the Ministry of Defence.""

A review committee set up by the Central government after the 1999 Kargil war had recommended the creation of the post of a Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) as a single-point military adviser to the government. A 'permanent chairman' is not quite the same.

Admiral Lanba is also chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, and earlier corrected a journalist who had addressed him as 'Permanent Chairman, COSC'.

The chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee is usually the senior-most among the chiefs of the Army, Navy and the Air Force, making him the most senior military officer in the country.

Also read: History tells us Indian military was not always marginalised by civilian officials

Integrated Theatre Commands (ITC), a concept for a modern military apparatus, has been adopted by most Western countries and also China.

It envisages the creation of a single military machine with a single task -- whether it is for a front or for training purposes -- that would combine under a single 'theatre commander' elements of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.

Proponents of the theatre command concept in India -- most notably the Army -- argue that a multiplicity of commands is obsolete in modern concepts of warfare. Multiplicity of commands also leads to confusion in other spheres.

For example, while China has a single 'Western Theatre Command' on India's north, the Indian Army alone has four commands on the China frontier -- northern, western (which is tasked with the Pakistan front), central and eastern. In addition, there are three commands of the Indian Air Force for the same front.

Such a situation often queers the pitch for India's military diplomacy, as happened in July and August when the Chinese wanted a hotline connection between Indian Army Headquarters in New Delhi and their Western Theatre Command in Chengdu. India rejected the idea on grounds of protocol.

Those who oppose the concept of joint theatre commands -- notably the Indian Air Force -- say the nature of its operations are so fluid that all of India is one theatre. Also, there are issues of who will be the commander of a particular theatre.

The Indian Air Force has proposed a Joint Operations Command (JOCOM).

Lurking behind these differences is the suspicion that senior positions in the IAF and Navy would be subsumed by the Army, by far the largest among the three services.

Admiral Lanba Monday practically brought out these differences into the public sphere for the first time.

""We will have to decide who will be the operations commander here (meaning at headquarters in New Delhi) who would look after all the theatres. Service chiefs cannot be operational commanders,"" he said.

Also read: There is growing civil-military dissonance and acrimony in India's defence ministry

Admiral Lanba's own service, the Navy, will be taking a step towards jointness -- not to be confused with 'integration' -- between January and March 2019.

The Navy's largest drill, called Tropex, that is practically spread across the Indian Ocean Region, will include within it a coastal defence exercise named 'Sea Vigil'. Units of the Army and the Air Force will be involved on both the eastern and western seaboards.

The Navy, as mentioned above, will also be 'catering' to jointness.","Indian military divided on integration, but air force chefs are learning from Navy school","1009306094","2018-12-03","https://theprint.in/security/indian-military-divided-on-integration-but-air-force-chefs-are-learning-from-navy-school/157978/","ThePrint",FALSE
"3777","","Online education has become popular among working professionals and students in higher education. These categories of online learners find immense benefit in the autonomy, and flexibility, that these courses offer. Online courses can be planned into their schedule, which may include full-time employment, internships and caring for family. It can also help them take out quiet time to study.

Distance learning has been around for a long time, even before technology made it extremely accessible. Traditional schooling is now seeing an increased proliferation of virtual training materials and online courses. Even in a world of tried and tested schooling systems and curricula, the most successful schools are the ones who adapt to the changing times, as well as to the expectations of students, parents and the society. If online education is here to stay, then what are its implications for traditional learning? Instead of focusing on pros and cons, the conversation we should be having today is about leveraging online education to make our education systems more conducive to learning.

Online courses call for a greater amount motivation and self-discipline than a classroom-based course. A classroom has one or more instructors and peers, who can hold a student accountable for their course-work. In contrast, online courses involve setting our own goals, tracking progress and meeting deadlines. One does not learn in isolation, so online courses do offer discussion forums, email and one-on-one support. Technology also adds on to the visual experience by incorporating animations, that can be used interactively for effective teaching, and communication.

The classroom advantage

A school provides structure, support, and a system of rewards and penalties to groom its students. Classroom education has the benefit of face-to-face interactions with peers, which are typically moderated by a teacher. It provides children, especially those in their early developmental years, with a stable environment for social interactions, helping them develop skills like boundary setting, empathy and cooperation. This also allows plenty of room for spontaneity, unlike a virtual learning setup.

Online education in the context of schooling

As students' progress to higher classes, they seek more autonomy and intellectual freedom. Online learning can help them pursue highly individualised learning programmes, possibly even college level courses. These, combined with hands-on exercises, real world exploration, and thorough assessments, can be highly beneficial to their learning progress. They can explore their options, by trying out introductory topics from different fields, before committing to a specialization. Online learning platforms can help these students become more independent learners, before they make their way into college. I believe that we must not hold students back from picking any online course, but instead act as their guide as they navigate through it.

Mobile apps that provide enhanced learning opportunities for school children have become mainstream. Since mobile phones have already found their way into their hands, these apps are being used to supplement classroom learning. Teachers and parents need to act as anchors and mentors, curating the kind of educational content students are exposed to, during the tricky phase of finding the right career to pursue.

Virtual public schools, that offer a full scale K12 education, have already sprung up in some parts of the world. They even offer a combination of the traditional system with online education. There are programmes that provide support to families that wish to home-school their children, in the form of online course material. These programmes bring parents and teachers into the fold, by involving them into their child's education from the get go. However, their effectiveness in the long term needs to be studied.

Online learning programmes will also open up opportunities for children from weaker socio-economic communities, who possess a limited access to learning resources i.e. teachers, text books and infrastructure. It will connect them to a global network of online learners, exposing them to new perspectives. The ideas that they receive, will not be limited by the number of heads in one classroom.

Online education for educators

Online education can also be designed to be accommodating of a variety of learning styles among students. As educators, it is likely that we will have to put in additional efforts to incorporate online learning programmes into the curriculum, in the most suitable manner.

Online training programmes are helping teachers/educators advance their skills in curriculum implementation, policy, education systems and leadership, both independently and with the support of their institutions. It lets them collaborate with their peers, and learn new instructional skills, that are relevant to their career. These programmes can help them develop new skills and capabilities in their students, with the help of technology and interdisciplinary approaches.

As the overlap of the traditional and online educational worlds is becoming more and more inevitable, we owe it to our students to make their education relevant to their future, through our own ingenuity, passion and careful planning.

It is an 8th grade science class. Students are learning the concepts of Force and Pressure. The lesson starts off with activities, involving them in a game -- a tug of war or arm wrestling each other. Throughout the lesson, there are several images and videos that demonstrate the concepts.

Their homework for the day is to help at home in preparing rotis, which would involve activities such as separating the hardened dough, rolling it etc -- all connected to the concepts that they had studied earlier that day.

This is how a lesson looks like, in a class that uses the application developed by the Bengaluru-based organisation Meghashala (School in the Cloud). Lesson plans for Grades 1 to 8 for the subjects English, Math, Social Studies and Science, which are in sync with the Karnataka State syllabus, are developed by the organization and made available through their app on Google Store since 2017.

""We ensure that our lessons cater to the needs of the students at different learning levels, and of different learning styles. Our lessons include a lot of activities, images,videos and they are always related to real life experiences,"" says Sharvari Tilloo, Product Lead with Meghshala.

Mallikarjuniah teaches Mathematics, English and Science to grades 5th, 6th and 7th and regularly uses the application with the tablet and projector provided by Meghshala to his school GPHS Kodathi in Bengaluru. He observes how earlier he had found it extremely challenging to teach concepts such as elements and compounds, and now through the app, through visuals and activities, students are able to have a deeper understanding of concepts.

His views are echoed by Suneetha T, who teaches at GPHS Chikkadevasandra in Bengaluru. She mentions how student participation and engagement in class have increased since she started using the app two years ago. She mentions how students are able to navigate the app on their own on the tablet and revise chapters in the rare occasions where she has to step out of class to do administrative work. The success that she has found upon using the lesson plans provided by the application has encouraged three other teachers in the school to use the application. Currently they have formed a time table, based on which they access the tablet and the projector.

While there have been several interventions in primary and elementary education in the past two decades such as the District Primary Education Program (DPEP) in the 1990s, or the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) scheme in the early 2000s, most of these interventions have focused on increasing enrollment and ensuring adequate infrastructure in schools; not on quality teaching and learning outcomes. The abysmal learning levels of the students in both government and private schools are evident from the outcomes of the yearly Annual Status of Education Report since 2005.

There is a direct correlation between quality of teaching and student learning levels. Student learning levels are bound to be low if government school teachers are constantly disheartened and demotivated. A significant number of teachers working in government schools face several challenges (varying in degree from state to state) including having to teach in schools that are understaffed where they would have to combine multiple sections/classes, or facilitate learning for students who are at varied grade levels in the same class. Most of the trainings that they receive do not factor in these realities.

There is always constant pressure from the administration to ensure that the syllabus is complete; which takes priority over learning outcomes. The administration seems to value provision of requested information on time, proper record keeping of attendance / midday meals etc, more than learning outcomes.

An earlier article in this series points to poor quality training and curriculum at Teacher Education Institutions, teachers having to spend a large portion of their time on administrative work, promotions being based on tenure and not performance, as some of the reasons for poor quality of government schooling in Bengaluru.

Meghshala believes that the most effective way to transform the ailing education system in the country is by focusing on the heart of the education system - the teachers, by empowering them to lead enlightened classrooms.

""I have been grappling for over a decade with questions of and the need to provide equitable education to all. The sheer number of students in the country that were not receiving quality education was overwhelming, and it wasn't until improvements in technology, that I could think of a solution that could start addressing these concerns,"" says Jyoti Thyagarajan, an educator with over 40 years of experience across the globe, who co-founded Meghshala in 2014.

Once the first versions of the app was designed, thirty government schools in Bengaluru were selected as sandbox or test schools, and a set of one laptop/ tablet and a projector was provided to each school. The app was modified based on the feedback provided by the teachers, and was released in 2017 on Google Play Store.

Currently Meghashala says they support 180 schools in 13 districts of Karnataka. 98 schools located in Bengaluru are provided with a tablet and a projector. One teacher is selected as a Meghshala Fellow from the school, who receives technical support from the Meghshala team, and continues to provide feedback about the tools. Manjunath H M, Implementation Lead at Meghshala says that in several schools the Fellow having found the application to be beneficial has encouraged other teachers to use them as well. And in such schools time tables have been created based on which teachers access the tablet and projector. There have been instances where the school leader has approached corporate organizations to donate projectors, so that more teachers can use the app simultaneously.

Manjunath points to how the response among teachers and schools have been very varied across districts and blocks in Karnataka. In the southern blocks of Bengaluru, the responses from teachers have been positive, whereas the responses from the northern blocks haven't been to that extent. The app is able to capture the teacher usage information, and they are still in the process of analysing the data to understand why certain schools have higher usage than others.

Meghshala plans to develop 10 models schools in the various blocks across 13 districts where they work. Through the meetings called by the Block Education Officer (BEO) who have constantly supported them, they are reaching out to a large number of teachers. During these meetings, the teachers are introduced to the app, are encouraged to download the app on to their phones and use them in class. Manjunath points to how teachers from the blocks and districts where they don't have a presence are unable to use the app, as they are discouraged by higher authorities from using smartphones in the class.

Meghashala is currently in the process of signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Karnataka State Government, which would allow them to conduct their training and introduce the app to Master Trainers at every District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) in Karnataka. The master trainers would then introduce the app to all the teachers during the training at the Block level. The reach would be much higher where all teachers in the state are familiarised with the app and its usage, compared to Meghashala's current interventions at the block level.

At present, based on feedback the app is being revamped, redeveloped and a newer version will be available on Google Play Store by end of November 2018. Lesson plans in Hindi and English based on the NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) syllabus will be an addition to the upcoming version of the app.This would enable and encourage a lot more teachers across the country, who follow the NCERT syllabus to use the application.

There are other initiatives that aim to support teachers such as The teacher App that currently provides resources to teachers in Hindi through interactive videos on core concepts in Pedagogy, Science, Math and Language. Teachers of India, an initiative by Azim Premji Foundation, provides resources in Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and English for teacher educators, teachers and others working in the field of education.

The Ministry of Human Resource Development( MHRD) has in the past year launched a digital initiative called Diksha that provides online resources for teachers in several languages, and is available as app. The content partners for this initiative include Meghshala, The teacher App, Teacher of India, Tata Institute of Social Science and several other organisations.

Several teachers from Bengaluru have spoken about the usefulness of the lesson plans in the app and Meghshala through its advocacy is in the process of reaching out to many more teachers in Karnataka and India.

While Meghshala provides the resource for school teachers to facilitate learning of concepts to children better at different learning levels and different learning styles, there is the need for several systemic changes, in order for teachers to truly benefit from it and other such initiatives. Teachers will only be able to perform average work at best if they have to manage several classes/sections due to shortage of teachers in their school. There will be a shift in teachers taking initiatives to ensure student learning if they work and performance are recognized. As mentioned above quality education and learning outcomes aren't prioritised. There needs to be a move towards this, and away from merely completion of syllabus and administrative tasks.","A school in the cloud contributes to quality of teaching and learning in Karnataka's schools |","995922988","2018-11-16","http://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/meghshalas-teaching-and-learning-app-for-teachers-students-parents-28885","bengaluru.citizenmatters.in",FALSE
"3785","","Anna Kirchgater Elementary School in the Elk Grove Unified School District is boosting state test scores with new leadership in the mix and and a hunger for results in reading.

Since 1957, Anna Kirchgater Elementary School, named after a legendary strict no-nonsense Elk Grove grammar school teacher with high expectations for all students, the school's population has doubled to nearly 700. New to Kirchgater, Principal Cheri Sanchez aims to continue the school's rich tradition of setting high expectations and have all students perform at or above grade level in reading.

Principal Sanchez noted literacy as a long-time goal at Kirchgater, and recent changes have resulted in soaring student success with this year's state assessment scores rising over 8 percent. The state average increase was only 1 percent. With the increased emphasis on reading, the school anticipates double digit improvement each year to eventually become a high performing school within the next three to five years, ranking amongst the finest that the Elk Grove Unified School District has to offer.

The approach is simple at Kirchgater; it is to teach to each child's individual reading level and assess their progress throughout the school year. Principal Sanchez says, ""Our belief is that if we truly understand where each child's instructional needs are, we will be capable of addressing these needs and will be able to bring them up to grade level or beyond in a relatively short period of time."" To uphold this belief, each teacher explicitly teaches their students at their instructional reading levels each day through the use of an approach called Guided Reading -- a method of teaching reading where the teacher guides students in small group instruction to fill in their gaps of knowledge and bring them up to the next level. The increase in student performance has also made a positive change in the school's culture as students are more confident in themselves and caring of others.","KIRCHGATER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GATORS STATE TESTING RESULTS RISE ABOVE THE REST WITH INDIVIDUALIZED LEARNING - The Newsman","994727619","2018-11-14","https://thefreenewsman.com/kirchgater-elementary-school-gators-state-testing-results-rise-above-the-rest-with-individualized-learning/1185680/","The Newsman",FALSE
"3786","","Children's Day 2018: A recent opportunity to interact with kids from an underprivileged background had this parent thinking about the enormous gap in exposure between sections of society.

By Ritika Jain

Of late, I had been pondering over ways in which I could contribute towards a social cause. I often see intolerance around us and think that it boils down to education to cure people of this malaise. So when a neighbour asked me if I would fill in for her at a local MCD school, I readily agreed to teach English to Grade 3 kids. The classes are for one hour, thrice a week. It may seem like a small step but I'm sure even the smallest pebble causes a ripple. Initially, I had thought taking out three hours in a week isn't a big deal but once you commit, it's a fixed task in your schedule and teaching isn't something you take up casually. For one, the kids get attached to you and actually look forward to the next class. Their eagerness to learn, in turn, is actually what keeps you going.

When I started, the first thing I noticed is the irregular attendance at the government-aided school. Compared to my daughter's reputed public school, where you need to take a leave application for missing even one day of school, this is the norm here because most of the parents are day labourers who themselves don't understand the importance of good education or aren't much bothered about the kid's homework at the end of a hard day. I was also shocked to see the gap in the vocabulary of a third grader here versus that in an elite private school. It's not that the kids aren't intelligent, but just that nobody reads to them and nobody in their vicinity speaks with them in English. In fact, their Hindi is far better than kids in private schools.

I would like to illustrate this with an anecdote. I had figured out a way in which I could have them all engaged simultaneously, by drawing whatever we had learnt in class. Each one of them loves to get a 'star' and a 'very good' at the end of each class. I had asked them to observe and describe their classroom. I would explain the usage of 'There is' and 'There are' as we went along and sometimes offer to translate certain words to Hindi, their first language. I told them rules mean Niyam and cupboard means Almaari. Then, pointing to a map, I said map. Quickly, a bright young spark corrected me and said Naksha. So it wasn't one-sided, I internally chuckled to know I was being taught too.

I hope to keep them interested by way of inclusive activities, where even a non-reader can contribute and gradually pick up pace to match a student that can read an entire passage. As for spoken English, they get bonus points simply for trying, especially when they aren't too confident of using a word. I hope this small nudge will propel them towards better opportunities in the future and make them believe that they can strive for more than what their immediate environment would have them believe they're good for.

If only I could give you a glimpse into this classroom, where naughtiness goes hand in hand with innocence, where the fights are about who will bring a chair for the teacher and who knows more about Halloween; the smiles and 'V-signs' that go up when you take their photograph; so you'll know that kids are kids no matter where they come from. Their upbringing might be different but they all respond to praise and encouragement, and they all want to share their stories.","Children's Day 2018: Learning while teaching bright sparks at an MCD school","993977166","2018-11-14","https://indianexpress.com/article/parenting/blog/childrens-day-learning-teaching-students-mcd-school-5445627/","The Indian Express",FALSE
"3787","","GADAG: While public opinion about government schools is turning increasingly negative, here is a school at Narayanpur village in Gadag district which has taken an innovative approach to make learning easier and more interesting.

Both students and teachers should be thanked for setting such a good example for other schools to follow.

To build a strong mathematics base among rural children, the Government Higher Primary School Narayanpur village conducts ""Maggi Suggi"" (recitation of multiplication table) session from 3.50 pm to 4.30 pm every day.

Though it sounds quite common, its impact on children's learning ability is high. The session is being conducted for the past seven years.

Widely known among villagers as 'Maggi Share' (school of table), students recite multiplication table up to 50 and also in reverse order. Even students of lower classes recite table up to 25 and special training is being given every day to those who are unable to catch the pace of learning of other students.

Ambikadevi Malipatil, a student, said: ""We love to memorise tables. Now I am in the 4th standard and I can easily memorise tables from 1 to 50. I can also say tables from 50 to 1 without stopping.

"3788","","A new World bank study show how vital it is to invest in improving leraning outcomes among school students in EMEs

Education, during one's formative years, is of paramount importance. It is also the most cost-effective in terms of money spent on education at any stage of a child's life. James Heckman, in 2007, showed that the emotional, social and physical development of young children has a direct effect on their overall future development. That is why investing in young children is so important. However, according to the World Bank's 2018 World Development Report and UNESCO, millions of students in developing countries are in schools that are failing to educate them to the level that they should have, with 617 million children and youth of primary- and secondary-school age not learning the basics in reading -- shockingly, two-thirds of them are attending school.

The need to invest early education is clear, as also is the need for data and statistics on learning outcomes of children of primary/secondary school age. Such outcomes are studied and analysed by collecting data on children's ability to read and comprehend what they are reading. The ability to read enables children to access curricula and is thus a good indicator of whether the education system is doing its job. Reading makes them independent learners for life, reduces the cost of schooling, and raises the efficiency of public spending. With appropriate data available, the progress of each student/class/sub-section can be studied and, accordingly, beneficial policy responses can be designed that fulfil the child's development potential. Early grade assessments have produced national learning studies for more than 80 countries, including ASER in India. Such globally-shared metrics of learning, which can be compared across countries and over time, have enormous value. Crucially, they also show that the global learning crisis is deep. But, this is only the first step. Above and beyond metrics of learning, education and learning policies have to be designed and implemented. To that end, the Union government in India tying financial incentives for states, under the centrally-sponsored schemes, to the latter improving learning outcomes is a welcome move.","How vital it is to invest in improving learning outcomes among school students in EMEs","979576954","2018-10-26","https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/how-vital-it-is-to-invest-in-improving-learning-outcomes-among-school-students-in-emes/1363053/","The Financial Express",FALSE

"3791","","With its innovative and international pedagogy, Early Learning Village has emerged as the preferred choice for early schooling by parents for their wards with all of its seats filled in it's first successful year of operation.

The school has witnessed enthusiasm and interest among parents even in its secondth operational year. Early learning village is grounded on a content-rich International Early Years Curriculum (IEYC) which lays the foundation of knowledge and learning for children aged 1.5 to 4.5 years. Children embark on their journey towards learning in an environment that provides stimulating spaces and exciting experiences.

""We are still receiving many enquiries from parents for admissions. This has primarily been achieved through references and word of mouth. In a short span of time, we have been able to make a difference to the teaching environment in the city with our focus on experiential and play-based learning. With the freedom to explore, our children engage in hands-on activities, learn to think creatively and evolve to develop skills like problem solving and critical thinking. When children enter our gates with enthusiasm, it only endorses our efforts and innovative teaching-style. We hope to empower and equip each child with the excitement, curiosity and love for learning for life!"" says Mrs Priya Saxena, co-founder and Principal at Early Learning Village.

""At Early Learning Village, we focus on quality and learning for both our children and teachers. We ensure the best of learning environment and material is provided to our students. We also commit to providing sufficient teaching training and resources to all our teachers. We are happy that both our students and teachers are in harmony with each other and are able to make so much more out of their association and friendship"", says Mr. Pradeep Jolly, Co-Founder, Early Learning Village.

Teaching at Early learning village is a very holistic process where not only the child's cognitive well-being is taken care of, but the child's emotional, social, physical and spiritual growth and needs are also taken care of. A child's day at Early Learning Village has a balance of open-ended activities, exploration, child-initiated play supported by adults, focused-learning with adult guiding the learning through playful and rich experiential activities. Through role-play, messy play, water and sand activities, construction and small world children at ELV engage, explore and learn. We value outdoor learning as much as indoor learning and invest a lot of time and planning to provide children with unique, safe, rich and dynamic experiences in our natural outdoor play spaces. Our outdoor activities provide children with a range of engaging and challenging opportunities to explore freely, develop physically, take risks, solve problems and grow in confidence while playing independently and collaboratively.

ELV outdoors offer children opportunities to play in the treehouse, vegetable farm, musical garden, sensory path and sensory fountain. All these activities are on the lines of international practices as the Co - founders of the school-Ms Priya Saxena, Ms Priya Dhawan and Ms Heba Zaidi Khosla, have taught at The British School and other global schools.

At Early Learning Village, ELV teachers work in small groups, with each teacher responsible for a group size of 4 - 6 children. Small group work increases the attention and focus the child receives. A unique feature of the school is that it encourages one of the parent of the child to be present during the first few days of transition.

The teachers at ELV are qualified teachers, who go through initial hand holding and shadow sessions and then work daily to master their expertise. This is important as it helps them align their knowledge and skills with the international curricula that this school offers. They make the children adept in storytelling, rhymes, phonics, coloring, art and crafts, painting, drawing, dance, music, singing, drama, theatre. There are specific classes for gardening, pottery, no flame cooking, etc.

ELV has partnered with 'Music Together' for music sessions, Art of Sport for physical development session and 'My dance academy' for dance session for their children. Field trips and story are a regular feature at ELV. ELV is more than just a workplace, it is a community of like-minded people who have come together for a common purpose - ""children first"".

ELV resonates compassion, love and laugher among all its stakeholders. It is a vibrant place for learning, for one and for all.","Early Learning Village Pre-School Emerges As Preferred Choice For Parents in Gurgaon","953294333","2018-09-24","http://www.newspatrolling.com/early-learning-village-pre-school-emerges-as-preferred-choice-for-parents-in-gurgaon/","newspatrolling.com",FALSE
"3792","","The Right to Education Act, 2009 (RTE) provides for all governments to provide 'special training' for out-of-school children and puts the onus on them to mainstream them into formal schooling system at age-appropriate level.(HT file)

Ensuring all children are in school is the first step towards ensuring quality of education. However, India is home to the largest number of out of school children in Asia and second highest in the world.

Estimates of the exact numbers vary, ranging from 226 lakh in the National Sample Survey (2009-10) to 381 lakh in Census 2011 and 60 lakh according to MHRD.

Even greater numbers of out of school adolescents exist. Concrete plans need to be put in place to ensure that these children are not deprived of educational opportunities.

The Right to Education Act, 2009 (RTE) provides for all governments to provide 'special training' for out-of-school children and puts the onus on them to mainstream them into formal schooling system at age-appropriate level.

State governments are responsible for planning, designing and implementation of programmes to bring out of school children into school and ensure age appropriate admission.

Unfortunately, comprehensive national analysis of implementation of accelerated learning provision is missing. We undertook a study on the implementation of this provision for Accelerated Learning in four states which provides some indication on how these are implemented. Standalone studies for accelerated programmes in other states also exist.

While most states have guidelines for implementation of special training, these have frequently not reached the district level and have not formed the basis of orientation of concerned officials. Clear delineation of the roles and responsibilities to specific officials has also not been done resulting in poor roll out.

There is also no consistency in terms of the qualifications and working conditions of teachers providing special training leading to poor quality of teaching.

Poorly qualified teachers frequently fail to understand and transact subject content and are unable to address psycho-social needs of out of school children.

Poor salaries have been found to lead to high levels of attrition among teachers. In all four states studied by us, special training teachers were not satisfied with training provided to them.

Teaching dropouts and never enrolled children is a difficult task and calls for the hiring of the best teachers, which is almost never done. Monitoring mechanisms of these centres have also varied.

This calls for exploring new and different approaches to ensuring that India's youth is educated and no one is left behind through innovative methods. In order to achieve this, the content should be flexible, curriculum, materials and pedagogy accelerated, gender sensitive and inclusive and promote empowerment and psychosocial well-being.

Special training should be undertaken in inclusive and safe learning environments by teachers who are adequately qualified, supervised and remunerated, and who receive adequate opportunities for continuous professional development. The centres must be effectively managed and run in close tandem with the community.

Behind patchy delivery of special training is limited fund flow from the government. Recent budgetary analyses, like a recent study undertaken by CBGA, point towards high disparities between approved allocations and actual expenditure on mainstreaming out of school children.","Accelerated learning for out of the school children","942047947","2018-09-08","https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/accelerated-learning-for-out-of-the-school-children/story-diFyXWeuz4K7CQhwGl6VDN.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"3793","","BENGALURU: Two years ago, most of the children studying at the BBMP Higher Primary School in Shivajinagar were struggling to write words and some even struggled with alphabets. Today, they can not only read and write difficult words, but can pronounce them with a proper accent, all thanks to the efforts of their teacher.

Meet Radha Kumari K S , English teacher at BBMP Higher Primary School at Tasker Town in Shivajinagar where 121 students are studying from Classes 1 to 7. Her teaching methods go out of the textbook so that every single child recognises words and understands the meaning.

A Bachelor's degree holder in Arts (BA) with English Major, followed by a Diploma in Education, Radha studied in Kannada medium till PU II, all through in government schools and colleges at Kolar. Radha just learnt English like any of her classmates -- to read, write and pass exams.

""When I opted for BA with English Major, I was scared. Initially, it was very difficult to understand. But then slowly, I started reading with the help of a dictionary and I started enjoying the language,'' she said.

Radha adores her teacher Deepa who taught her while she was studying DEd. ""Deepa would teach us English teaching methodology with a passion. I then decided to take tips from her. This is my seventh year at the BBMP school. I make sure the children like me first. Once they like the teacher, they will start loving the toughest of subject,'' she added.

When this reporter visited the school, she was teaching the chapter 'How do Bees Make Honey' to Class 6 students. Instead of just reading and explaining the meaning, Radha had drawings of the bee on the blackboard.

She even got her students to make beehives using cardboard and asking them to cut it in hexagonal shapes while another set of children drew honeybees. Children learnt the word hexa (six) and even started explaining how honey is made. Needless to say, they explained in English.

'Chose profession to help kids achieve their dreams'

Radha uses simple methods. She teaches English words along with Kannada meaning. She also teaches them rhyming words which help children recognise different words with similar pronunciation.

What makes her job all the more challenging is that the children studying here, who are from an economically poor background, speak different languages -- Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil and Urdu. ""This is the most challenging when I am teaching them pronunciations,'' she says. ""I too had dreams like these children to become a doctor engineer or lawyer, but could not become one. But I have chosen a profession that can lay the foundation to help these children achieve their dreams,'' she beams.

Twelve-year-old Steven told TNIE that his father is a cab driver and mother a domestic help. He wants to become a lawyer and travel across the globe. ""I need to learn English to study law. If I travel to different countries, I need English again. I like the way Radha ma'am teaches us.''

Mogan Kumar, who speaks Tamil at home, wants to become a software engineer. Both his parents are tailors. ""After Radha ma'am's class, I try to converse in English with my friends to improve my language,'' he says. Ganesh, a Class 7 student whose father works as watchman at a shop on Cunningham Road, said, ""Radha ma'am makes us feel that English is a easy language,'' he said.","At this BBMP school, learning English was never this easy","939240668","2018-09-04","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/sep/05/at-this-bbmp-school-learning-english-was-never-this-easy-1867813.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

The Delhi government suspended the vice-principal of a government school on Friday -- the day of her retirement -- for allegedly keeping a part of the money meant for teachers to purchase teaching-learning material.

Gomti Devi, the vice-principal of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya (Annie Besant) in Mayur Vihar's Phase II, was suspended after an inquiry was conducted. When contacted, Devi said she was being victimised for being from the scheduled caste.

An order issued on August 30 by Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash read, ""In exercise of power conferred by sub rule (1) of Rule 10 of CCS Rules 1995 hereby places Gomti Devi under suspension with immediate effect. It is further ordered that during the period that this order shall remain in force, the headquarters of Gomti Devi should be in Delhi and shall not leave the headquarter without obtaining permission.""

According to the government, teachers are given Rs 500 to purchase teaching-learning material, which includes, stationery, globes, maps and charts. The government has alleged Devi was giving Rs 350 from the amount to teachers, and keeping Rs 150, claiming it was ""GST deduction"".

Education Minister Manish Sisodia had ordered the inquiry following complaints. Following the completion of the inquiry, she was suspended.

Devi, when contacted, said: ""The Education Minister and the Director, Education, had come to the school for inspection. The computer lab was not working so I told them I have informed the company and officers about it. As I raised my voice against the officer, I am being subjected to this. I am a single woman and an SC candidate, so an easy target. I have 40 years of service without facing any such allegation... why should I do all this when my career is at an end? I have been in this school for the past five years.""

She said she received the suspension notice at 12.30 pm on Friday: ""Now they will stop my gratuity and all financial benefits. I don't know what to do.""

"3797","","Vadodara: Games in tablets and mobile phones are best friends of school going children these days due to which not only the traditional board games like snakes and ladders and tic tac toe among others have been long forgotten but have also drawn kids away from socializing.

However, around 50 teachers of city-based Navrachana School have designed innovative board games which will draw the students out of the mobile phones, throw challenges at them and create a fun learning experience.

After working for six months, the team of teachers has created at least 200 board games which are based on lessons of NCERT books. Teachers of five subjects - social studies, science, mathematics, English and Hindi - have done their own research and created board games for students of class I to class VIII.

""Currently these games are made on the basis of first two chapters and we will expand these to later chapters. The board games are helpful for introduction, recapitulation and testing students,"" said Kashmira Jaiswal, vice-principal of the school who conducted a workshop for teachers on 'Gaming in Classroom'. She added that there are elements of excitement, winning and scientific pedagogy in these games and teachers can also spend less time on chalk and talk method of teaching.

The games are designed on the lines of games like snakes and ladders, tic tac toe and playing cards where children also have to answer the questions from their syllabi posed at them through the games and the evaluation is done by their classmates.

The games have also been helpful to students who are slow learners. ""Slow learners take days to understand something which is taught in a traditional way, but through these games they can learn concepts quickly because these games encourage them to think,"" Jaiswal said.","City school uses traditional board games for better learning - Times of India","932640431","2018-08-26","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/city-school-uses-traditional-board-games-for-better-learning/articleshow/65555196.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"3798","","At the 65th Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) meet held earlier this year, the Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar declared the launch of 'Operation Digital Board' in all schools within five years.

At the 65th Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) meet held earlier this year, the Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar declared the launch of 'Operation Digital Board' in all schools within five years. This reminds us of a similar effort in 1987 when 'Operation Blackboard' sought to provide minimum, essential facilities to improve the quality of primary schooling. Unfortunately, 30 years later, the larger political discourse for improving learning continues to prioritise infrastructure enhancement. Such initiatives indicate that teaching-learning is seen as a largely teacher-directed process, focusing on transmission of information to students. Seymour Papert, the famous MIT professor of media technology and once lonely evangelist for personal computers in classrooms, had said: ""Nothing could be more absurd than an experiment in which computers are placed in a classroom where nothing else is changed"".

Technology has the power to disrupt the traditional classroom space by giving students more agency and pushing teachers to reconsider their roles as experts.

Recognising this, the Connected Learning Initiative (CLIx), a technology programme for high school students, was seed-funded by Tata Trusts in early 2015, and it is being delivered through a collaboration with MIT Boston and Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) Mumbai. CLIx aims to demonstrate effective and sustainable changes in classroom learning, using ICT to both improve student learning and create effective models of teacher professional development.

An ecosystem of collaborators has spearheaded the design, development and implementation of CLIx, including Eklavya, Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, and a number of strategic national partners and the state governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram and Telangana, to impact 478 government schools, 2,130 teachers and 32,437 students as a 'proof of concept'. CLIx also recently won the UNESCO King Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa Prize for the use of ICT in education.

CLIx reaffirms the vision of the National Curriculum Framework (2005) to provide opportunities to students to be ""producers"" rather than ""consumers"" of information through ""hands-on"" time with computers to learn digital skills, as well as develop deeper understanding of the subject matter.

CLIx modules aim to improve digital skills, conceptual understanding in maths and science, communicative english and values for the 21st century for high school students. To support use of CLIx student modules, professional development courses for teachers are made available in the massive open online course (MOOC) format and can be accessed via smartphones. The teacher courses are hosted on a platform called TISSx, which is modelled on the lines of Open edX platform.

What we need today is not smart board technology that will make teaching easier, but dynamic technology tools that give students opportunities to think and create. ICT, when used to its full potential, can change the learning culture from an authoritative teacher-led one to a student-led one. It's not too late to reimagine the Operation Digital Board.

"3800","","RANCHI: Learning Braille will now be self assisted for the 24 students at Rajyakrit Netrahin Madhya Vidyalaya in Harmu, Ranchi. The school students will learn braille from Annie, the first self learning Braille literacy device in the country developed by Bangalore based start-up, Thinkerbell Labs.

A total of 20 Annie-s, complete with a digital Braille slate, a braille keyboard and a braille display were officially launched in Ranchi on Tuesday. These devices are designed to instruct the students in learning both Hindi and English braille through voice commands in Hindi language.

""Braille literacy is extremely low in the country because learning the language needs person to person contact. The teachers need to spend time with the students individually. Annie, which is a voice coordinated device, eliminates the need of a teacher's physical presence and teaches the students through voice commands. The biggest upside is the instantaneous feedback, as a student can understand that they are making a mistake as soon as they enter a letter,"" said Avinash Kothuri, project manager at Thinkerbell Labs, which is a part of Startup India Project.

A team of nine students from BITS Pilani Goa and other colleges of national repute, the prototype of Annie was inspired by the lack of braille teachers in India.

""The employment rates of visually impaired individuals is co related with braille literacy. Many do not have access to private tutoring and learning in groups of as small as eight students can be arduous. Though a lot technological developments have been made in increasing braille reading, Annie is the first device developed for teaching the language instead,"" added Kothuri.

Deputy commissioner Ranchi, Rai Mahimapat Ray told TOI: ""The device is aimed at improving the rate of Braille literacy through an interactive interface. Since we have one blind school in the district, the pilot project has been launched there. But in case any other schools or organisations want to use the device, they can contact us.""

Dr Louis Marandi, minister of minority and social welfare and women and child development was present at the launch event. ""This is a revolutionary device for boosting the Braille literacy numbers. We will soon be expanding the project to all the blind schools and institutions in the state so that more and more people can benefit from it,"" said Marandi.","Ranchi school students to learn Braille from Annie, country's first          self learning device launched - Times of India","911911179","2018-07-24","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/ranchi-school-students-to-learn-braille-from-annie-countrys-first-self-learning-braille-device-launched/articleshow/65123608.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"3801","","'For the teachers, by the teachers' programme in government schools is an initiative well-began to elevate quality of education A classroom full of girls, a school bustling with activities of 1200 students, teachers using zero investment innovative ideas for holistic teaching, text books replaced by unique self-explanatory stuff made of waste material - this is not a figment of imagination, but something that one can find in Meerut's government schools.

This transformation of a government school, initiated in 2016, is because of the efforts of Zero Investment Innovations for Education Initiatives (ZIIEI) by Sri Aurobindo Society, an NGO, as part of its nationwide education transformation programme - 'Rupantar', in association with HDFC bank.

In a short span, the project has helped in catapulting the quality of education by introducing initiatives to elevate the teaching practices and empathy-based teacher enablement initiatives, which means a teacher uses techniques after understanding the family background or community of the students.

Master trainer Goutam Kumar Rawani, says, ""After convincing state education departments and signing MoUs with 22 state governments, ZIIEI has been able to orient over 1.2 million teachers across the country to use innovative ideas to bring a change in government schools."" ZIIEI focuses on empowering teachers to adopt and share small, yet effective methods to transform education in schools.

A school teacher of Government Girls Inter College, Hapur Road, Meerut, Aayushi Sharma says, ""I use waste material to make the students hone their artistic skills and tell them the importance of cleanliness in their life.""

Another teacher of the same school, Rashmi Ahlawat, introduced 'teach your parents' initiative as summer holiday homework to first-generation students. She also conducted an orientation programme for the parents to make them understand the importance of education.

Bashir Ahmed Dagga, a government school teacher from Jammu and Kashmir, says, ""There was no furniture in my school, so I made my students sit in geometrical formations like a circle or a triangle to teach them shapes.""

A teacher from Sikkim, Bhim Rai says, ""I felicitated Jharna Rai, mother of one of my students, for sending him to school daily in a tidy uniform to encourage other mothers to follow the same."" 'Project Inclusion', yet another programme introduced by the society is changing the image of government schools.

Under the project, 7,500 teachers have received special training and 4,000 possible cases of Neuro developmental Disorder (NDD) in students have been detected by teachers.

Rawani says,""Teachers participated in three or five days orientation programmes, so, now teachers identify student with NDD and we provide special training to them."" The Ministry of Human Resource Development has also recognised significance of this programme, which will be extended to schools in Leh.","Experiential learning changed the face of this government school.

"3802","","""At least half the time when I give feedback from an evaluation, a parent becomes teary,"" says neuropsychologist and study leader Deborah Waber, PhD, who directs the Learning Disabilities Program at Boston Children's Hospital. ""The effect on families is not trivial, and it's been under-appreciated. It's always good to ask families about stress and anxiety if they report concerns about academics.""

Waber and her colleagues developed a survey-based screening instrument to gauge the effects of learning problems on the child's and family's quality of life. They first sent a 35-question survey to 151 families whose child had been referred to them for evaluation of learning disabilities. They then shortened the survey to 15 questions and sent it to families in a single lower- to middle-income school district in the greater Boston area.

Of the 325 parents or guardians who completed the revised survey, 93 had children who had been identified as having learning problems and were receiving special education support on formal Individualized Education Plans. The remaining 232 had children in general education.

Survey questions focused on such issues as parents' anxiety about their children, children's anxiety and frustration over school work, children taking a long time to complete homework, having to limit family activities because of homework and family stress caused by the child's learning problems.

Psychological fallout

The two groups showed a dramatic difference. Compared with the general education group, parents of children with learning problems reported significantly more quality-of-life problems related to academics, for both the child and the family. Quality-of-life problems fell in the ""at risk"" or ""clinically significant"" range in half of the learning problems group, versus only 15 percent of the general education group.

The quality-of-life impacts of learning problems were greater for middle-school-age children than younger elementary-age children, and were greater in boys than girls, with the gender difference widening in the older grades. However, families of children with and without learning problems gave relatively similar ratings to teachers and school support systems, suggesting that they did not blame shortcomings of the school for the child/family distress.

Waber and her colleagues now routinely give the survey to parents whose children are being evaluated in the Learning Disabilities Program. They plan to follow up a year later to see whether quality of life has improved and, if so, to what extent the improvement is related to how the schools responded to the evaluation. Since the survey is easy to administer through an online link, Waber hopes to see others adopt it.

""We hope its use will make schools, other educators and pediatricians more aware of the distress children with learning problems and their families may be experiencing and take steps to address it,"" Waber says.

"3804","","Guwahati, May 30: Who says retirement is the end of one's career? Actually it is the beginning of a new one, and perhaps a more fulfilling one, as former Assam Director General of Police (DGP), Mukesh Sahay, has proven by taking up a teaching assignment in a government school in Guwahati.

These days, the retired top cop, who hung up his boots earlier this year, teaches mathematics to class 12 students of Sonaram Higher Secondary School in Guwahati.

Talking about his teaching experience after working in the police department for close to 34 years, the Bihar-born IPS officer told ANI, ""I do this for my happiness and the benefit of the students. This is a small effort towards the development of students.""

Guwahati: Former Assam Director General of Police (DGP), Mukesh Sahay teaches Maths to students in a government school. He says, ""I do this for my happiness and the benefit of the students. This is a small effort towards the development of students"". #Assam pic.twitter.com/nZs3X8z3j2

-- ANI (@ANI) May 29, 2018

Regarding what prompted him to be a teacher of the co-educational school established in 1936 near the banks of mighty Brahmaputra River that flows through the heart of the city, Sahay told Firstpost, ""It all happened when the school invited me for a programme last year as a chief guest.""

""While enquiring about the history of the school, I found they do not have a mathematics teacher. So, I told them that I could step in to fill the void. But it was difficult when I was in service as I could not commit to a particular time. Such was my nature of work. After I retired, I called up the principal to inquire if there is a need for my services. The principal told me to come as no one had joined till then,"" he added.

The well-respected retired top cop added that teaching is a learning experience for him.

""Even though I have to teach in the vernacular, I have no problem. Mathematics has its own language. Whether it is in Assamese, English, Bengali or Hindi, it doesn't matter, unlike literature subjects.

"3805","","Mumbai: The state education department has revealed that the new textbooks of state board school students will be based on practical and conceptual learning, and in a manner that the students remember what they learn forever.

Sources said that presently, if a class VIII student studies a certain chapter, he/she may forget about it by the time he/she reaches class IX where he/she reads a new chapter on the topic.

To prevent such a situation, an ""introductory system"" will be initiated before beginning every chapter with a view to providing a quick revision for the student.

This, according to state education minister Vinod Tawde, will provide continuity and maintain an overall circle of education for every student. ""In the new up-gradation of the curriculum, it will be based on the spiral methodology.

Here, it will maintain a continuous process where the student will remember what he or she learned in the previous academic year, thus creating a strong base for the students.""

Mr Tawde said that the idea was suggested by education experts and was approved by the board of studies which also includes teachers.

Department officials said that only the textbooks and manner of teaching will change and not the syllabus. Also, latest developments will be included in the chapters instead of old ones. ""Students will find it interesting when they are given examples and chapters which they are familiar with,"" said an official.

According to experts however, upgrading the curriculum alone will not be enough; what is required is a change in the assessment and evaluation process.

Fr Francis Swamy, joint secretary, Archdiocesan Board of Education (ABE), and former board member, said, ""We are still stuck in the old procedure when what we need is an application-based curriculum. It should be in a way that the students are prompted to think and reflect. Instead of just learning and reproducing it in the exam, we should make the system action-oriented.""","New school textbooks to be based on practical learning","869757211","2018-05-17","http://www.asianage.com/metros/mumbai/170518/new-school-textbooks-to-be-based-on-practical-learning.html","The Asian Age",FALSE
"3806","","Mumbai [India], May 16 (ANI): Innovative and experiential learning is the need of the hour in the Indian education system.

The challenge is to move from the futile tradition of rote-learning to methodological and practical learning processes.

To make learning more meaningful, the Adani Foundation and UK-based Cambridge University Press signed a letter of intent on Wednesday in Mumbai for a large scale educational skill development program for schools.

Adani Foundation Chairperson, Dr Priti Adani, and Cambridge University Press Chief Executive, Mr. Peter Phillips, signed the Letter of Intent.

According to them, the objective of this collaboration is to introduce a futuristic teaching-learning experience into the Indian education system.

The Adani-Cambridge collaboration will focus on three key futuristic educational initiatives. First is the introduction of 'Coding' in Indian schools to hone proficiency of learners in computer science and Information and Communication Technology.

The 'Coding Sandpit' program is aligned with the government's 'Digital India' initiative with an aim to develop computational thinking skills of students and introduce coding for schools from Class 1 to 8 to solve complex problems.

Secondly, the cross-border collaboration plans to roll out the Cambridge Language Solution, a digital language lab for schools specifically focused on sharpening the two important skills of listening and speaking.

The Adani Foundation and Cambridge University Press also plan to introduce eight level methodology books consistent with the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) and National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) guidelines to offer a natural acquisition of English via a comprehensive input approach.

The Adani Foundation hopes to take its mission of 'Brighter Thinking; Better Learning' forward with the immense experience and thought leadership of Cambridge to schools across India.

This collaboration is poised to be one of the leading educational programs by Adani Foundation, and is aimed at fulfilling the potential to groom future leaders for India.

"3810","","Lalita Dhole, a domestic help, dreams of providing the best education to her children. Her biggest worry is not how they will perform in their exams, but their safety. Her apprehension stems from the fact that her children have to meander through a rut road and a forest for an hour before reaching school.

Dhole is not from one of the BIMARU states, but a satellite town of Mumbai, Thane, which boasts of world-class educational institutes and a throbbing commercial apparatus.

The anxiety is shared by parents, most of them illiterate, from 16 tribal hamlets in Thane, whose children have to overcome several obstacles.

""No vehicles enter our area due to the kuchha road. There are no streetlights, which make us worried that animals may attack our children. During the monsoon, it becomes impossible to send them to schools because of waterlogging,"" says Dhole.

Amid talks of making Maharashtra a trillion-dollar economy by 2025, education seems to be a luxury, not a basic right for students from tribal hamlets in Kasar Vadavali at Ghodbunder Road and Yeoor Hills. Even the Right to Education Act, passed nine years ago, has not nudged the Thane authorities to make education more accessible by building roads and ironing out other mobility issues.

However, Takadapada and Paankhanda villages, which are 3km-4km from the hamlets, have schools till Class 8.

Most hilly padas are home to Warli tribes, with no access to electricity and water. One of the tribal hamlets in Kasar Vadavali, Pachvadpada, which is half an hour away from Thane station, overlooks high-rises. Seventy families living in the pada are labourers or work as house helps in these high-rises.

""As our parents never sent us to school, we don't want this thing to happen to our children. Though we have enrolled them in schools, there are various problems, which make it difficult for them to continue education,"" says Anita Dhandekar, resident of Pachvadpada. The nearest school for Anita's son is at Takadapada, and he leaves an hour before the school time.

One class too many at kindergarten

The fallout of far-off schools is that tribal children, even 10-years-old, are studying in a kindergarten (balwadi centre) at Pachvadpada, run by a non-governmental organisation, Hari Om Trekkers.

Manisha Rathore, who is now a Class 5 student studying at Anmol Vidyalaya (an aided school) at Vasant Vihar in Thane, used to go to the kindergarten along with eight other children. ""Most parents prefer sending their children to this balwadi because they aren't many schools nearby. Students who are eight or ten years old are still studying here because they can't go alone to school. Another incentive is that the centre provides meals too,"" says Nandkumar Nikte, volunteer at the balwadi.

TMC schools

NGO Matrushakti Sevanyas runs a hostel for tribal girls, including Manisha Rathore, in Vasant Vihar. These students complain about the quality of education at schools run by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), says Sandhya Sawant, founder of the NGO. Now, they are happy that they are getting good education at Anmol Vidyalaya.

""There (at civic schools) are just four or five teachers. Given their background, these students need special attention. As they do not get that attention in the school, most of them drop out,"" Sawant says.

'College is a dream'

Vasant Gavit, village head at Pachvadpada, said apart from his children, there are only two boys who have studied till Class 12 in his pada.

""Notwithstanding our proximity to Mumbai, we do not get enough facilities,"" complains Gavit. Gavit informs that a few village heads have acquired five-and-a-half acres of land from the collector. A part of the land is likely to be used to open a small school or a balwadi. The plan may take more than three years before it comes to fruition.

""None of the children from our pada has studied in college. Boys mostly leave studies after Class 8 owing to the distance, while girls are expected to stay at home. College seems like a distant dream for the children,"" Gavit contends.

'Not out of the woods'

A self-help group run by the wives of village heads intends to write to the TMC, asking it to provide better roads. Ramesh Tokre, president of Vanhakh Samiti, reveals that 150 students enrolled at the Paankhanda school last year. They take the kaccha road to reach school.

""The civic body doesn't get permission to build a school because the land is forested. The other problem is that no one really demanded that students be provided with transportation. Even if we are provided with one, it will have to drop students half a kilometre away from the school because the road is bad. The other option is hiring an autorickshaw, which we can't afford,"" said Tokre.

Officials from TMC's education department point out the same difficulty in building schools.

""If we get one room on rent, we are willing to provide education to these tribal students. But this isn't the case in tribal padas. We cannot take over forest land for schools,"" said the official.

What the law says

According to the Right to Education Act, 2009, for Class1-5 students, the nearest school must be within a km

Schools for Class 6-8 students must be within a radius of three kilometres

If schools are farther the prescribed limit, the authorities need provide free transportation, mandates the Act","Distance learning?

"3812","","Arghya Banerjee solving puzzles with students from The Levelfield School

When Arghya Banerjee was running the Indian operations of Irevna around 2006-2008, then a fast-growing equity research outsourcing firm, he experienced the famous Indian talent crunch first-hand. MBAs and CAs who had just graduated didn't come prepared with the work skills which were required of them when they were hired - a result of the rote-learning education system.

""Basic skills that you expect after years of education - ability to write a professional e-mail, ability to logically express your idea - were woefully lacking. This was the first trigger,"" says Banerjee, recalling the incident which pushed him to take a brave decision such as starting The Levelfield School which breaks almost all the norms of what 'education' means to us in the Indian setting.

He was also trying to put his 4-year-old daughter in school at the time and found that the leading schools in the large cities, while big on infrastructure, seemed lacking in thought and philosophy.

Banerjee realised that the only way to get help children grow and prepare them for the future was to give them the correct sort of education - ""schools where children would learn to think, rather than to memorize facts.""

""I wanted the 'perfect' school for my daughter. Since there was none that satisfied me, I set out to create my own,"" he says.

""Unthinking memory-driven learning or rote-learning is clearly one of the biggest problems in Indian school education,"" says Banerjee. The biggest challenge is changing the education system lies in making the majority, including the officials in charge, understand WHY it is even a problem.

Rote-learning is not just about memorizing dates of battles and formulas of science, but takes place every time we switch off our brains and perform an activity without thinking. ""When we recite facts but do not question them, it is rote-learning,"" says Banerjee.

""For example, when your child knows the names of the capitals of countries, but do not know why countries need capitals. When we can only solve specific problems that we encountered before, but cannot draw a general lesson from them, it is rote-learning as well -- for example, when your child can read an English textbook, but cannot comprehend an unseen passage,"" explains Banerjee.

When children are taught to copy numbers neatly in good handwriting (because numbers are quantities, not pictures), or are asked to memorize multiplication tables (because memorizing three fours is twelve is same as memorizing 'Baa Baa Black Sheep'), they are all instances of rote-learning. These skills do not have any place in the future.

Not only does rote-learning kill the joy of education and learning, it has a far bigger ill effect.

It creates graduates and postgraduates who are unable to think and innovate since their formative years have been wasted in unthinking memorization. So, they become unsuitable employees who lack the important working skills.

Arghya Banerjee says that we are still following an education system which was made for the 19th century ""when the aim of the school system was to create an army of clerks, factory workers and soldiers.""

""That education system aimed to create a bunch of obedient followers, because that's what the newly industrialized nations needed at that time,"" he says.

This is the reason behind the school uniforms, assembly, strict discipline and rigid routines.

""The aim was to foster obedience and uniformity. If we are to move forward in the 21st century, we have to question that old paradigm of education,"" he says.

We are approaching a future where routine jobs will all be automated. So, The Levelfield School tries to focus on debates, literature, movies and writing in order to create individuals who can think and analyse for themselves rather than only following orders.

The school doesn't focus on the narrow subject areas as ""real-life problems do not come packaged in neat subject boundaries.""

""In the future world, where most routine tasks may be automated, we must build thinking individuals who cannot be replaced by algorithms,"" Banerjee says.

The primary skills required to get a job now include reading and speaking in English, and the knowledge of handling computers.

While children living in metro cities or born in middle class or upper class families can learn these skills in the home environment away from school, small-town or village kids are unable to obtain these skills as their school and education system fails them.

""It is the lack of English speaking skills which is the biggest issue in villages and small towns, because in the rest of the skill areas (logical thinking, cogent writing etc.) it is not as if the city kids do well either,"" says Banerjee.

When it comes to improving the education system in rural areas, Banerjee believes there is ""no need for endless committee sittings"". Basic spoken English and other employability skills would go a very long way here.

Banerjee put his life's saving of around 50 lakhs towards building the school but it wasn't enough. He then reached out to angel investors and banks but got a rude shock when he realized he needed to show proof-of-concept. The investors needed to know the plan would work before they invested in the same.

The banks too wanted to fund a school that's already 'affiliated', or a school that's already up and running.

""For a new business in an unconventional area (read non-technology), being a start-up in India is tough,"" realized Banerjee.

He gave up the idea of angel funding and set up the school on a rented premise in the small-town location of Suri -- 200 km from Kolkata.

This was Banerjee's hometown and he had first-hand experience of the problems faced by small-town kids in successfully dealing with life later on because of the lack in our education system.

The Levelfield School is a tranquil setup combining traditional ambience with modern infrastructure to transform the way we study. Over 5-6 years, it grew to its current size and infrastructure and is now a Cambridge International School, affiliated to the IGCSE board, UK.

""It was a big step to give up a high-paying corporate leadership role, pack your bags, and relocate to a small town. But my family was surely supportive of this unconventional idea,"" says a grateful Banerjee.

Convincing parents to give a chance to the new education system Banerjee was trying to implement was a big challenge.

""In the first admission seminar, when I told a group of parents that rote-learning is an evil and we must ensure learning with understanding -- they seemed very appreciative, but only in theory. As the school started, I saw that they were scared of any new method of imparting education. They demanded textbooks, homework and more conventional 'subjects', rather than skills,"" he says.

Till class 8, The Levelfield School uses curriculum and teaching methodologies developed by themselves, including 12 apps that the put in Google Store, almost all of which are among the top educational apps there.

""Our graded-reading program (Delta) and problem-solving program (Delta Math) - are browser-based software developed inside the school,"" says Banerjee.

After that, the Cambridge International Board is followed.

""Till class 8, I decided to prioritize three skills - reading, logical thinking, and social maturity,"" Banerjee says.

The common learning method followed teaches children to read by studying the same textbook thoroughly, a number of times, for a year.

""How can a student learn to read by reading a 70-page English textbook 15-20 times a year?"" asks Banerjee.

""We all learned to read well by reading novels, newspapers, magazines - so why not replicate that process?""

So, Levelfield tries to introduce kids to a variety of reading material like novels, newspapers and magazines. The challenge, in this case, was finding so much of reading material appropriate for children of primary classes.

""Children's books available in the market did not fit the bill, so we set out to create our own library of reading materials by simplifying many classic stories like 'The Prince and the Pauper' or 'The Gulliver's Travels',"" says Banerjee.

The Levelfield School library now houses enough books to ensure that even the primary-grade students do around 1500-pages of reading a year.

Children won't learn to build analytical and thinking skills if they solve the same type of mathematical or scientific problems every day. So, they are exposed to a variety of thinking-based problems.

""We take inspiration from Japanese puzzles like Nonogram and Shikaku, and oriental board games like Go or Gomoku,"" explains Banerjee.

Building social awareness is the next important step but textbooks of social science lack the kind of material which can increase a child's maturity. They need to 'see' the world within their classroom walls. The best way to do this is through stories and cinema, and by analyzing the daily news from newspapers.

""If you are discussing the history of Nazi Germany, why not screen Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist'? While teaching about revolutions, why not use George Orwell's 'Animal Farm'?"" says Banerjee.

Practices that improve hand-eye coordination of kids, help them speak confidently in public, or taking classes outdoors in the lap of nature are other methods used for a wholesome development of the young minds.

""The transformation of the students has to be seen to be believed,"" says Banerjee, speaking about how journalists and principals from other schools have been amazed by the children's ability to speak English fluently and their mature understanding of the world.

Besides winning many nation-wise writing contents, the students have also performed brilliantly well in standardized tests.

Twenty-eight Levelfield students came among the top 1 per cent performers in ASSET all over India, a nationwide standardized test by Educational Initiatives taken by 3000 top metro-city schools, where students' skills are tested in the subjects of English, Mathematics, Science, and Social Science based on CBSE/ICSE board syllabus.

""Our students manage our school's technology infrastructure, our blog, and Twitter feed (@levelfieldpupil). You should really check out some of their writing in our school blog, and you will see that such maturity and ability are not evidenced in kids of this age anywhere,"" says Banerjee.

His wife Suman was seen greeting the children with familiarity. She had been visiting the place for some time now with her husband to get to know the children and to provide them with aids that are necessary to each one of them. ""I don't believe in giving money without addressing the major concerns ourselves. We should look at the need of the people we are trying to help and act accordingly. Only then would the help reach the right and deserving people in useful ways. We visited them and spoke with them and understood their basic needs and hopefully have addressed them,"" she said.

""Firstly, our admissions started late in this session which delayed the commencement of classes till December. We were waiting for classes to begin when regular students were appearing in their semester exams. And, now they have announced a wrap up without completing our syllabus,"" he said.

The students also alleged that they have not received the complete study material. ""Last month, the DU had released the datesheet for several SOL courses even as their classes had not started by then. The students are still confused about their syllabi as the university has not even released their study material so far. This is sheer injustice,"" said Snigdha Sharma, another student, who participated in the protest led by Krantikari Yuva Sangathan (KYS), a students' body.

Alleging ""apathy"" from the administration's side, the students said, ""We had earlier, on many occasions, submitted memoranda to the SOL administration and had even tried to meet DU V-C yesterday concerning the problems, but the administration remains unmoved,"" said Harish Gautam, a KYS member and a student.

Students also anticipate ""mass failure"" citing ""institutional failure"". ""When more than 50% students fail in examinations every year and almost 95% students perform badly in the examination, is the institution not responsible?"" he asked.","Classes wrapped up abruptly, School of Open Learning students left in lurch","838949046","2018-03-27","http://www.dnaindia.com/delhi/report-classes-wrapped-up-abruptly-school-of-open-learning-students-left-in-lurch-2598144","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE
"3815","","In a series of educational reforms that the Tamil Nadu government has been working on to implement from the next academic year, the school education department will be embedding QR codes in books for primary school students. One tablet will be provided for every five students in all government elementary schools across the state from the academic year 2018-19.

""It is to inculcate digital learning with a child-friendly pedagogy,"" said a senior official from Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), the body in-charge of implementing the changes across the state.

The official said changes were being made almost half a decade after the implementation of Simplified Activity Based Learning - Active Learning Methodology (SABL-ALM). ""With more than 70% of 37,999 government schools in the state having only two teachers, the students are forced to wait for the availability of cards of SABL-ALM as only a set of cards are distributed per school and duplication of the cards is not possible,"" the official said. The QR code and tablets will ensure the students can access lessons online without any delay.

To check feasibility of the new technology 826 elementary schools in 14 districts have been selected where tablets were distributed, the official added. Based on the funds granted, tablets would be issued to all the elementary schools in a phased manner, the official said.","Digital learning in primary school - Times of India","837452388","2018-03-24","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/digital-learning-in-primary-school/articleshow/63436442.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"3816","","NEW DELHI: Poor school infrastructure has emerged as a key factor why children are ""not learning"" in government and government-aided schools across the country. A state-wise analysis of the National Achievement Survey 2017 for classes III, V and VIII has highlighted that not only do school buildings need significant repair, the learning environment also doesn't seem to be too conducive for teachers burdened by work overload, lack of drinking water and toilet facilities. In some state as high as 58% of the school buildings need significant repair, while nearly a quarter of the government and aided schools lacks drinking water and toilet facilities, as captured in the survey.

TOI had in one of the most comprehensive analysis of the NAS 2017 on February 24, 2018, highlighted how staff crunch, crowded classrooms and inadequate funds are to blame for poor learning outcomes in government schools as captured in the survey. The state-wise analysis was finalised by NCERT and submitted to the ministry of human resource development recently, a copy of which is with TOI.

While across states, over 95% students like coming to school - a large number of students find the travel difficult. Lack of electricity at many schools is also one of the major factors highlighted by teachers in the survey.

Reading between the lines from the 700-district study which was released by the NCERT in December 2017, TOI found that students are learning less as they move to higher classes, a survey of over 2.2 lakh students in government schools in over 700 districts shows. On average, a class VIII student could barely answer 40% of the questions in maths, science and social studies. The national average score for language was a little better at about 56%.

The findings raise doubts about the demographic dividend India hopes to reap because of a young population. Educationists, experts and rights' activists are not surprised. They say this is a result of insufficient investment in public education and the government's inability to implement the Right to Education Act (RTE) in letter and spirit.

The state-wise analysis, a copy of which has been accessed by TOI from the MHRD, for example revealed that 58% of the schools in Arunachal Pradesh, 43% in Assam, 35% in Uttar Pradesh, 30% in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh are in need of significant repair of the buildings.

Similarly, even some basic necessities like drinking water and toilet facilities are still lacking in large number of state-funded schools across the country. In Uttar Pradesh, which TOI earlier highlighted as having the maximum number of worst performing districts in the learning outcome, 24% teachers responded saying there is lack of drinking water facilities, while 29% highlighted the lack of toilet facilities and 39% said there is lack of electricity in schools. Likewise, in West Bengal, 26% teachers said there is lack of drinking water and toilet facilities, while 9% of them said there is lack of electricity.

These are just a few examples as the survey report in state after state highlighted similar data and pattern. Two other major factors highlighted in the survey was the difficulty students' face while travelling to school and ""work overload"" for teachers. And that number is also not low as on an average nearly 20% students ""find difficult to travel to school,"" while equally large number of teachers are saying there are overloaded with work.

That proves the point what Ambarish Rai, national convener of RTE Forum, had to say that governments have failed to provide adequate funds for school education and implementation of the RTE Act. ""RTE is a package for school development. We cannot look at any part of it in isolation."" He said the RTE Act prescribes one teacher for every 30 students at the primary level, and for 35 students in higher classes, but these have not been implemented. The country is short of 10 lakh qualified teachers, he said.

While Prof R Govinda, former vice-chancellor of National University of Educational Planning and Administration, said, ""The results don't surprise since basic skills are not being inculcated and cumulatively, the deficit will increase. The results for the last 10 years have been the same, which means we have not done anything.""

"3817","","The announcement by Human Resource Development Minister, Prakash Javadekar, that the syllabus of National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) books for classes 1 to 12 will be slashed by half is welcome, but also raises some vexing issues. The government's emphasis on digitisation and slimmer textbooks will help reduce the weight of schoolbags. These changes may be in place by 2019. Mr Javadekar said the school syllabus at present was more than that of B.Com and BA courses. The burden of course work left teachers with little time to impart life skills and inculcate creativity among students.

But the reduction of the quantity of course syllabi should not come at the cost of learning. As it is, the comprehension levels of students across the country are below par. The recently released Annual Status of Education Report for 2017 said 40% of students between the ages of 14 and 18 surveyed in rural schools in 24 states across the country couldn't tell the time from a clock and 57% couldn't do basic mathematics. It is not hard to understand why. Our education system has not focused enough on learning outcomes. It has not kept up with advances in technology. Improving the quality of our students may involve enhancing the quality of our educators. Of the 20 lakh teachers which were to be trained in 2015 under the Right to Education Act, only five lakh have been trained so far. There is a clear mismatch in the supply and demand for educators with 70 lakh teachers teaching close to 26 crore students in 15 lakh schools across the country.

So, merely dropping chapters from books might not be enough. It needs to be augmented by greater rigour in the evaluation process. An element of competition among students through regular assessments is desirable to improve their learning abilities. To its credit, the government has brought back board examinations for class 10 in 2017 and is planning to introduce a Bill in the Parliament to restore examinations and detentions. In 2017, the Right to Education Act was amended to incorporate a competency-based evaluation study covering 2.2 million students across 110,000 schools to understand what a child should be learning in various classes. One of the recommendations of the T.S.R. Subramanian committee, entrusted with preparing a new education policy for India, is compulsory certification for teachers in government and private schools, with the provision for renewal every 10 years based on independent external testing. Lighter textbooks with relevant course work and better teachers could well be the recipe for improved learning outcomes.","Cutting school syllabus by half shouldn't come at the cost of learning","820674838","2018-02-26","https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/cutting-school-syllabus-by-half-shouldn-t-come-at-the-cost-of-learning/story-u0BeOj2mAfvWzypEKmOIJP.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

"3819","","The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan(SSA) has introduced a new child-friendly learning method using tablet computers in government primary schools in the district.

The system, developed by SSA after experimentation with teachers and students for many months in real classroom situation, was recently introduced in Salem rural and Veerapandi blocks in the district on pilot basis.

The tablet computers have been distributed to five primary schools in each of these blocks in the ratio of one tablet computer for five students and one teacher. The children of classes I to III will be taught using the tablets in these schools.

A.Gnanagowri, Chief Education Officer, reviewed the progress of the new system, its adaptation cum training in the city on Saturday, in the presence of Palanisamy, assistant project director, SSA, and Ashok Kumar, assistant elementary education officer.

Under the new system, lessons will be taught for 15 periods per week using tablets. The subjects taught are Tamil, English, mathematics, science and environmental science.

The School Education department sources said that this system will be expanded to other government schools in a phased manner soon.","Child-friendly learning method for primary school children","812346597","2018-02-14","http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/child-friendly-learning-method-for-primary-school-children/article22745699.ece","The Hindu",FALSE
"3820","","Investigators from MassGeneral Hospital for Children (MGHfC) report the results of their study of the BOKS (Build Our Kids' Success) Program in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

""We know that physical activity can have positive effects on children's health - ranging from decreased rates of obesity and obesity-related illnesses to improving school performance and overall well-being,"" says Rachel Whooten, MD, postdoctoral fellow in the MGHfC Division of General Academic Pediatrics, and first author of the study.

""Despite these benefits, it's often hard for children and families to find opportunities to be physically active. Our study evaluates a widely available, easily scalable and innovative program that may create more physical activity opportunities for school-aged children.""

An initiative of the Reebok Foundation, which was a co-sponsor of the current study, the BOKS Program is currently available in more than 3,000 elementary and middle schools in the U.S. and other countries. Following a 12-week curriculum, the program provides hour-long, before-school sessions up to three days a week.

Each session begins with a warm-up game, followed by a running-related activity; activities incorporating ""skills of the week,"" such as push-ups or sit-ups; a game to end the session, and nutrition discussions during stretching and cool-down. Sessions are led by volunteers, who have been trained with BOKS program materials.

While the training, BOKS curriculum and support materials are provided to participating schools at no cost, schools need to provide some basic supplies as well as locations for the program.

Previous small studies have documented improvements in body fat and aerobic performance in BOKS participants, compared with nonparticipants. The current study was designed to evaluate both how a 12-week BOKS program affects participants' body mass index (BMI) and whether any differences resulted from participating two or three times a week.

In twenty-four elementary and middle schools in three eastern Massachusetts communities during the 2015-16 school year, the parents of all students in grades K-8 were invited to enroll their children in the BOKS program and the study. Parent of those not participating in BOKS could allow their children to participate in the comparison group.

School districts determined whether the program would be offered two or three times a week, depending on resources and preferences. Twice-a-week sessions were offered at sixteen schools, while eight schools conducted sessions three times a week.

Overall, 274 children participated in the twice-a-week program, 151 in the three-times-a-week program, and 282 in the comparison group, for a total of 707 study participants.

In addition to measurements of height and weight taken before and after the 12-week program, participants ages eight and older completed surveys evaluating their social and emotional wellness - including their overall mood, interaction with peers, satisfaction with their lives and involvement in their studies.

At the end of the 12-week BOKS program, children participating three times a week had significantly better BMI z scores - an age- and sex-specific measure used to track changes in weight status - and a greater chance of moving to a lower BMI category - such as normal instead of overweight - than did children in the comparison group. Three-times-a-week participants also had better scores regarding their engagement in schoolwork, while those in the two-times-a-week group had significant improvements in mood, vitality and energy.

Elsie Taveras, MD, MPH, chief of the MGHfC Division of General Academic Pediatrics, who led the study, explains that the before-school nature of the BOKS program offers several advantages, including not conflicting with after-school activities and family commitments. "" The program's structure in which volunteers from within the school receive brief training and then follow a standard curriculum can overcome the concerns of some teachers and parents that they don't have the knowledge to help kids be more active. The flexibility of the BOKS program and the lack of a required investment in material resources can be helpful for schools with limited equipment and financial resources.""

Three elementary and middle schools in the eastern Massachusetts city of Revere have implemented the BOKS program for the current school year as part of a new study, led by Whooten, that is now underway. Barbara Kelly, principal of the Paul Revere Innovation School, says, ""The BOKS program has become vital to the fabric of our school. The morning program sets the tone for each participating student's day. Their engagement and excitement in BOKS has carried over to the classroom, with parents and teachers alike having seen academic improvement. Students thrive on the program's structure and are so proud to belong to the club. I can't imagine not having BOKS in our school.""

A professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, Taveras adds, ""Childhood is an important time for the establishment of healthy habits and routines that might protect children from chronic diseases including obesity, heart disease, and depression, which are the biggest contributors to morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Programs such as BOKS that help children not only develop healthy habits to promote optimal growth trajectories but also promote social and emotional skills that can help them better handle stress, peer interactions, and negative feelings are just what children need and should be broadly scaled. The program's being school-based and run by volunteers gives it the potential of affecting a large number of children equitably without the need for substantial resources.""

"3821","","""Can a three year B-school training impart a business acumen equivalent to a lifetime of learning from a business family?"" asks Pratish Sanghvi, cofounder of Grab.in, a last mile delivery service company.

The year is 1858, the British have just suppressed the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and there is intense mutual hatred among the two communities. A young Parsi graduate joins his father's export trading firm, interacting with English merchants and selling goods in India. Attracting the suspicion of the English, he also earned the spite of the Indians as someone who is complicit with the 'enemy.' But the intense desire to grow, to expand, to establish a legacy and overall be the 'Father of Indian industry' is what drove Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata to create an empire that is still regarded with reverence and respect in the chronicles of Indian business.

Business leaders who followed in his footsteps are innumerable. From Dhirubhai Ambani to Naryana Murthy, living in one-room chawls or being dependent on one's wife's last savings of 10,000 rupees could not deter the vision these people had. But one often wonders-Would they have been able to continue with such bravado, had a huge book or a PPT screamed out to them 'it's over, according to statistics, there's no hope in business for you, leave, now'.

It is a known fact that knowledge, as it opens our intellect, also restricts our instincts. Infants would not deter from putting their fingers in the fire as they do not know better. But, as we equip them with knowledge, along creeps in the sense of fear, then risk, then failure, so on and so forth. Gradually, a conservative attitude develops which allows you to lead a good life, but not a great one.

Business schools today, in their quest to create individual stars of the future commercial ecosphere, often forget to instil the fundamental lessons that segregate the successful entrepreneur from the rest. While traditional businesses and family enterprises often start training the younger members of the family from a very young age, they are often not allowed to handle the significant matters. It is a bottom-to-top approach which is followed, in contrast with the B-school curriculum which from the very beginning, only trains students to become CEOs and managers, without giving them basic knowledge of the groundwork. As a result, in the real world, the PPTs and blueprints prepared by B-school grads fall flat on their face as they are impractical and made by considering only what Case theory 101 ordered, not the ground reality.

Another observation in B-school teachings: Their lack of attention to detail. Generations of business tycoons have grown up listening to stories of how JN Tata used to throw a fit even if there was one chink or a spot in the cutlery or plates on AirIndia's flights. While these maybe ignored by B-school students as 'redundant information' or minor issues, the attitude of delivering an impeccable experience to the customer develops only when you have a strong sense of identification with the business and the desire for perfection.

It is no wonder then that even now, according to a recent study by OnStartups, 48.1% of entrepreneurs' state that they grew up in a family business. While this does not indicate that entrepreneurs only belong to certain social strata, it poses an important question: Can a three year B-school training impart a business acumen equivalent to a lifetime of learning from a business family?

The answer can be a triumphant yes, if only that education goes far beyond academic restrictions and focuses more on practical lifesaving tools. The business world today is affected by an array of dimensions, from managing the various profiles of the business to handling consumer complaints on social media platforms. B-schools need to provide an ideal simulated condition for students to hone comprehensive skills that help to tackle all these issues, or start exposing them to the real business world early through meaningful internship programs. The very factor of an agile and impactful business decision, coupled with the constant desire for growth and higher revenue, is the ultimate tightrope walk any prospective entrepreneur needs to master, which can happen only through continuous exposure to such situations.

The difference between academic learning and learning from your familial settings is often summed up by the A to B exercise. Two children were asked to draw out a line from point A to point B, while one drew out the line according to the pathway given, the other straightaway joined A to B. Thus, while it is often necessary to circumvent the restrictions of the question to focus on the goal that needs to be achieved, receiving the right education and harnessing skills is also extremely important to survive the streets, as life, and especially business, is not always a straight line.","To B Schooled or Not to Be Learning Business from Family versus a B School ","808016009","2018-02-06","http://bwdisrupt.businessworld.in/article/To-B-Schooled-or-Not-to-Be-Learning-Business-from-Family-versus-a-B-School-/08-06-2017-119704","BW Disrupt",FALSE

Sharma in his speech strongly advocated for change in the present educational set up and suggested to introduce moral education subject in every school from primary level. He said parents and teachers have also greater role to play in this direction and they must instil the moral ethics and rich ethos of Indian culture in the students so that they become good citizens and contribute for the welfare of the society and nation. He said on the eve of New Year ""we all should take a pledge to save the Girl Child and raise our voice against the crimes against the females and to contribute for a healthy and prosperous society"".

He asked teachers that while nurturing the students to achieve new highs in science, technology and modern studies, equal attention is paid to outdoor activities like sports, travel, etc which enables physical and mental development of the child.","Introduce moral education subject in every school from primary level: Sham Sharma","1030170287","2018-12-31","http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/introduce-moral-education-subject-in-every-school-from-primary-level-sham-sharma/","Jammu Kashmir Latest News | Tourism | Breaking News J&K",FALSE

Speaking about the initiative, V Kamalesh, 24, who studied in the school from 1999 to 2003, said they had formed a volunteer forum called 'Young Heartz' through which they do philanthropic activities every New Year. ""This year, we decided to help our school. About 25 old students from various batches got together and started collecting funds for the cause,"" he said.

The alumni members shared their initiative on social media platforms, which helped them connect with more old classmates. Eventually, they were able to collect about Rs 70,000, said Kamalesh.

The youngsters started the work on December 23 and completed it on Monday, said M Gopinath, 24, another alumni member.

Their main motive, the youngsters said, was to improve the student enrolment. ""While we were students, the school, which had Classes I to V, had two sections in each class. Now there is only one section and the strength has come down. We want to improve the situation,"" said Kamalesh.

It is through a lot of hard work that we developed a comfort level in studying in English. Now, if we go back to learning lessons in Hindi, it will undo whatever we learnt over the past few years.""

In 2015, the basic education department had converted a few primary schools of Uttar Pradesh into English medium institutions. The primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar was also made English medium at this time. It has 434 students enrolled in it and most of them do not wish to switch over to a Hindi medium school.

Officials said that after seeing the craze for English-medium schools growing in the state, the BJP government decided to convert 5,000 primary schools to English-medium ones from the April 2018 session. At present, 4,97,108 students are studying in these government-run primary schools.

""In Lucknow alone, there are 44 such schools where more than 6,200 students are enrolled,"" said Amar Kant Singh, Basic Shiksha Adhikari, Lucknow.

Hariyali Srivastava, assistant teacher at primary school Gejha, said the problem was that most students coming to government-run primary schools hailed from humble backgrounds. ""Their parents can't afford to send them to private English medium schools in Class 6, as the fee is very high,"" she said.

Corroborating what the teacher said, Kajal added, ""I want to study only in a government-run English medium school because my father (an e-rickshaw driver) can't afford to pay the fees charged by private English medium schools.""

Zainab Khatoon, another Class 5 girl of the same school, said that she wanted the state government to intervene in the matter.

Making an appeal to senior officials in the basic education department, Srivastava said, ""The students have learnt all terminology in English. Now, they will have to study in Hindi medium upper primary schools, which will be very difficult for them. Our students are asking for help. They want schools to be made English medium till Class 10.""

Chhavi Agarwal, assistant teacher of another primary school, said she teaches 280 students. ""Similar requests are pouring in from my students too.""

Lucknow BSA Amar Kant Singh agreed with the teachers and said that the demand for English medium schools after Class 5 was ""quite natural"". ""After studying in English medium institutions, students will not like to go back to Hindi medium schools,"" he said.

A senior basic education department official added that they were aware of the growing demand for government-run English medium schools and were looking into the matter.","English medium primary school students in UP don't want to switch over to Hindi after Class 5 ","1027303094","2018-12-27","https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/english-medium-primary-school-students-in-up-don-t-want-to-switch-over-to-hindi-after-class-5/story-JvFSnKwuPIzdvdRvEfBniO.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"3827","","IIM Ranchi would see if the reorganisation has brought any benefits for students as well as the education system(HT File)

The Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, will evaluate the merger of primary schools in Jharkhand. The state education department has roped in the institute for a detailed study of 4,600 merged schools to find out if the reorganisation has brought about any improvement or not, department officials said.

State education secretary AP Singh said, ""IIM Ranchi would see if the reorganisation has brought any benefits for students as well as the education system. It would also evaluate if the initiative brought about any improvement in the education of those students who were shifted to other schools in the merger process,"" he said. ""We have sought a financial proposal from the institute for the study.""

The reorganisation exercise of schools had also caught the interest of IIM Bangalore, which expressed its willingness to carry out a study on the process and its benefits, said the secretary.

Merging schools with low enrolment is an exercise that has been undertake by Rajasthan and Jharkhand in the country with the support of the Union government and NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog, the policy think tank of the Government of India. Jharkhand started the merging procedure in 2016-17.

Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) director Uma Shankar Singh said that there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under the education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or fewer students. These schools had an average of one or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four-five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools?"" he said.

The council said that a four-step process -- field inspection; cross-district verification; block and district consultation; and final notification -- was undertaken to merge the schools.

Singh said that 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools had been shifted and 96% of the students had expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty in shifting 150 schools due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue has been resolved, and students from 120 schools have been shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students, giving them better teacher availability, and cut the requirement of 4,500 teaching positions. The merger process saved the government Rs 400 crore by reducing teaching positions and infrastructure requirements, said JEPC officials. The officials added that the funds thus saved would be spent on strengthening the education infrastructure of the merged schools.","IIM to study impact of primary school merger in Jharkhand","1024436117","2018-12-22","https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/iim-to-study-impact-of-primary-school-merger-in-jharkhand/story-AO8N0uUTtcg5GPXywdw16N.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"3828","","Teachers at the Primary School Perai are using the game to motivate students to be successful in life by climbing the simple ladder of hard work, without worrying too much about the hurdles -- represented by snakes.(HT)

A primary school in Kaushambi district of Prayagraj is using the popular 'Snakes and Ladders' board game to create awareness among students regarding the importance of looking beyond usual vocations while choosing their career path.

Teachers at the Primary School Perai are using the game to motivate students to be successful in life by climbing the simple ladder of hard work, without worrying too much about the hurdles -- represented by snakes. They are especially encouraging students to dream big and think beyond the professions of their parents.

In this rural area, most students hail from a humble background. Someone's father is a plumber, someone else's a carpenter, mason or daily wager. The school authorities are trying to help these children look beyond these professions that would fetch them only a meagre income.

""We help our Class 5 students aspire for more in life instead of settling for small goals. With the 'Snakes and Ladders' board game, we create awareness among them about professions of teaching, medicine and engineering, which could make their lives prosperous and help them turn around their family's fortunes,"" said principal Hari Om Singh.

""The game is simple. Rules are similar to the traditional 'Snakes and Ladders', with some additional interesting information shared to benefit the students and retain their interest. Children are told not to get disheartened if they slip down due to a 'snake bite', for they need to remember that there is always the 'ladder' of hard work available to help them make it to the top,"" the teacher explained further.

He said the idea was to make students aware of the professions they would normally not think about on account of their rural background and tender age.

""The game is very interesting,"" said Tej Singh, a Class 5 student whose father runs a shop. ""We learn so much more about professions such as being a bureaucrat, cartoonist, animator, teacher, doctor and engineer,"" he said.

Another student Manu Singh said, ""It is great fun to play the game with friends and get information about new things at the same time. We learnt a lot from this drill, especially about the various career options open for us.""","UP: Primary school using board game to create career awareness in students","1020468934","2018-12-17","https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-primary-school-using-board-game-to-create-career-awareness-in-students/story-QSASNR6W6GFyQDTjZZugiP.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

"3834","","BARIPADA: Exposing themselves to vagaries of nature, students of Shrishapal New Primary School in Moroda of Mayurbhanj district attend classes under a thatched roof with no wall. Lacking a building of its own, the primary school has been running from the shade since 2002 after a tribal villager Shymasundar Majhi donated six decimal land. Both students and teachers sit on the ground. A total of 33 students including 18 girls study in the school.

Locals said though '50,000 was sanctioned by the State Government for construction of a permanent building, the school authorities could not utilise it as the piece of land originally belonged to Majhi, a Scheduled Tribe. As per land laws, SC/ST land can't be acquired by the Government or any other community. Parents and villagers had met the higher officials to find a way out but nothing has materialised yet.

Ramay Marandi, a villager, said despite several requests to the Block Education Officer, District Project Coordinator of SSA, the Collector and MLA Maharaja Prabin Chandra Bhanjdeo for construction of a building, no step has been taken. During rainy season, villagers hesitate to send their kids to the school which remains closed for most of the days, he added.

Headmistress Salma Hembram said, ""The State Government had provided financial assistance of '50,000 for a building. But, it remained unspent for several years and later we returned the fund. Though the kin of late Shymsundar Majhi had given no-objection certificate (NOC) through an affidavit on the land, the block education officials are yet to take steps in this regard.""

When contacted, District Education Officer (DEO) Dhruba Charan Behera said due to land dispute, the district administration has failed to construct the school building. Steps are being taken to resolve the issue for larger interest of school students, he added.

According to sources, Shrishapal school is not the solitary example in the district which has several pockets where primary education is in a shambles despite money in crores being spent for infrastructure and a host of schemes being launched for this sector.","Primary school runs from a shade","1004844692","2018-11-27","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2018/nov/27/primary-school-runs-from-a-shade-1903841.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

The incident came to light when the teachers and students arrived at the school on Monday.

B A Khader Shah, assistant director, department of information and public relations, also an alumnus of the school said the school authorities had been repeatedly requesting the owners of the adjacent property where the containers were stacked, to remove them in view of danger it posed. Containers were also blocking natural flow of air resulting in a stifling atmosphere inside the school, causing inconvenience teachers and students, he said.

The nominal hike of 22 paisa and 33 paisa per meal for primary and upper primary schools respectively has made authorities wonder about how would it help.

""I am directed to say that it has been decided with the approval of competent authority to increase the cooking cost under the National Programme of Midday Meal in schools, by 5.35% with effect from April 1, 2018, for the year 2018-19 over and above the existing cooking cost. The cooking cost will be shared between the Centre and the states in the ratio of 60:40 for non-north eastern region (NER) states and UTs with legislature, 100% for UTs without legislatures and 90:10 for NER states and three Himalayan states -- Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand,"" read the order issued by G Vijaya Bhaskar, director, midday meal.

The conversion cost of the midday meal until now was Rs 4.13 and Rs 6.18, respectively. After the increase, the cost is Rs 4.35 and Rs 6.51, respectively for primary and upper primary school students.

The order further stated, ""The above cooking cost rates indicate the minimum mandatory contribution by the Centre and state governments/UTs. However, states/UTs may contribute more than their prescribed share as some states/UTs have been contributing more than their minimum mandatory share from their own resources for providing meals with better nutrition under the midday meal scheme.""

Midday meal scheme was started in 2001 by the central government with a view to enhancing enrolment, retention and attendance in government primary schools and simultaneously improving nutritional level among children. Under the scheme, a student of any government or government-aided primary schools has to be served a meal with a minimum content of 300 calories of energy and 8-12 gram of protein a day for a minimum of 200 days.

Talking with TOI, basic shiksha adhikari of Agra Anand Prakash Sharma said, ""The cooking cost in UP covers cost of pulses, vegetables, cooking oil, condiments and LPG. Food grains, including wheat and rice, are not covered under the cooking cost and are provided by the Food Corporation of India.""
