A decision to this effect was taken by the university after an experiment with such a move proved successful in J R S College at Jamalpur recently.

Sources said VC Ranjit Kumar Verma was on a visit to the Jamalpur college when a Chemistry teacher complained to him that hardly three to four BSc (Hons) students used to attend his classes.

Appointed last year on the recommendation of Bihar Public Service Commission, the teacher sounded frustrated and wanted the VC to transfer him to any other college where his pedagogical skills could be put to better use.

The VC, however, advised the teacher to form a WhatApp group of his students and their guardians and post on it the attendance details of students every day.

""The teacher followed the advice, and it worked wonders: The attendance increased from 3-4 to 35 within a fortnight,"" VC Verma told this correspondent on Thursday.

He said principals and teachers of other colleges in the university would also be directed to form such WhatsApp groups. ""Those who do not have WhatsApp on their cellphones will be apprised of the attendance details through SMSs,"" Verma said."
