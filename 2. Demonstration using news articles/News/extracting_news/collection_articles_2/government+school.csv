The latest data from the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database of information about schools, says that the situation is particularly grim in states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, West Bengal, and some north-eastern states, as per 2016-17 statistics.

In these states, the percentage of students dropping out of school in secondary classes was considerably higher than the previous years. For example, in Bihar, in 2016-17, 39.73 per cent students in secondary classes withdrew from school, as compared to just 25.90 per cent students in 2015-16.

In Jharkhand, 36.64 per cent students dropped out in 2016-17, the last year for which data is available, which is over 12 per cent more than the previous year. The Union Human Resources Development Ministry has been boasting about making significant changes in the school education sector.

It's own figures, however, suggest that while the gross enrolment ratio was over 100 per cent at the primary level in 2016-17 (GER can be more than 100 per cent at the primary level because of overage and underage children taking admissions), it Is less than 80 per cent at the secondary level and is yet to reach 60 per cent at the senior secondary level.

Education experts said that while lack of access in rural areas and lack of interest in learning are major factors why children in higher classes drop out of schools, the no-detention policy till class VIII, which was introduced as part of the Right to Education act, could also be a reason.

""The government has now moved to end the no-detention policy, but in the past many year, it has been seen that children who were not assessed properly till class VIII, lose interest in studies when they don't do well at higher level examinations,"" said educationist Varsha Narain."

Arti Qanungo (39) was shortlisted from among a lakh participants from 179 countries. A teacher at Government Girls Senior Secondary School, School Block, Shakarpur, Qanungo has been teaching for the last 17 years.

She began her career as a teacher at a civic body school before moving to a Delhi government school in 2010.

A mother of three, Qanungo is known for her innovative teaching ways. Last year, too, she was given a state award for best teacher, and had also received an award from a university in London.

""English is a subject in which students in our government schools don't feel very comfortable. I diagnosed the problem and developed a strategy. Rather than making it a subject confined to reading and writing, I worked on developing listening skills of the children. I would ask them to hear the announcement at railway stations, metro, radio and call centres. The strategy worked and students became very confident,"" Qanungo said.

It was her daughter who asked her to apply for the global award given by Varkey Foundation. ""My daughter got an Economic Times cutout and asked me to apply for it. I thought when my daughter was so confident, I should apply,"" Qanungo said.

The global award carries a cash amount of 1 million dollars and would be handed at an event in Dubai next March.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal congratulated her on Twitter for taking Delhi's education system to a global platform. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia also congratulated her.

Born and bought up in Delhi, Qanungo completed her schooling at Lilavati Vidya Mandir Shakti Nagar. She did her teachers training from District Institute of Education and Traning (DIET), Keshavpuram.

They have built a school by pooling Rs 2.20 crore with 24 classrooms and imparting English education alongside Kannada, and it is all set for inauguration.

The 43-year-old Government Higher Primary School, Daddalkad, Bantwal taluk, was in a dilapidated condition in 2015 and had only 30 students. Now it has around 500 children, studying from LKG to class VIII, where English is taught along with Kannada.

It was all possible because of the efforts and foresight of Shree Durga Friends Club, Karenki, led by Prakash Anchan, a garment merchant from Bantwal.

""When most Kannada-medium schools across the state are closing down due to various reasons, we wanted to show the world that this school can be saved by adopting new teaching skills, and today we are successful in doing so.

The first phase of the school with eight classrooms was inaugurated last April, and second and final phase will be inaugurated by governor Vajubhai Vala on January 5.

Anchan added that they collected all the money from generous donors, who included locals, parents and others. ""We have not taken a single penny from any government be it the Centre or state. When we proposed the same building plan, the government estimated a cost of Rs 6 crore, but we have completed the work by spending Rs 2.2 crore.""

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

As per the information, this was done because the school authorities were found to be unaware about the law that applied in such a case.

With help from his grandfather and his father M Ramesh Babu, Krithik, an Overseas Citizen of India, started an NGO, Empowering Rural India Foundation, about two weeks ago. When funds became an issue, his family members suggested him to find sponsors.

But the 16-year-old donated his own money of 6,000 US dollars. ""In May, I won the first prize in an international science fair held in Pittsburgh and received a cash award of 3,000 US dollars. Besides, I decided to put another 3,000 US dollars from my savings,"" he said.

In the confines of Pongalur, this former government-aided school teacher has dedicated her verdant eight-and-a-half acre to hundreds of trees. The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times.

Over the last few years, many have been struggling for regular posts and salaries across Punjab. In the absence of assured income, they have been hard-pressed to maintain their families.

These teachers have come together to overhaul infrastructure in as many as 1,700 schools. Efforts are on to take the number to 4,250.

LITTLE ONES: KG classes in Government Primary School, Jhans started 2 years ago

Principals, head teachers and teachers are spearheading the change with the help of philanthropists.

Here are a few stories of faith and transformation.

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

Government Primary School, Nathewal

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

He has now been asked to guide other schools in the district"

Teachers said the duty should be given to someone else so that they could focus on students, who are left in schools all by themselves. With Exams nearing, most of the schools are yet to complete syllabus of senior classes. During a visit to schools on Monday and Tuesday, TOI found teachers handling multiple classes. In some schools, especially primary schools, only the in charge of the school was present as other teachers were out for conducting survey.

The in charge had been managing all the classes together. In some schools, teachers had combined various classes to manage students, while in others students were made to sit in the open so that teachers could conduct activities for all throughout the day.

""Parents of most of the students are working. Therefore, we have to start with the survey early in the morning. December 8 is the last day of submition and all teachers have been sent to conduct it. We have no other option,"" said one of the in charge of a government school requesting anonymity.

Arvind Rana, teachercum-president, SSA teacher's welfare association, said: ""Child mapping survey is a non-teaching task. Section 27 of the RTE Act, 2009, states that teachers cannot be assigned with non-teaching work, except, decennial census, disaster duties and election duties for the legislature and state assembly.""

An emergency meeting of the executive members of the Joint Action Committee (JAC) was held on Tuesday. The meeting was held to discuss the problems being faced by teachers while conducting the survey.

""Students are suffering due to such activities. Teachers should not be involved in non-academic activities at the cost of studies of the students. Keeping in view the studies of students and security of teachers, such nonteaching activities should be allotted to an outsourcing agency so that teachers can concentrate only on the studies of students,"" said Bhag Singh Kairon, president, JAC. Various leaders of the JAC appealed to the education department that they should not assign such activities to teachers and also minimize other non-teaching activities in the schools in the interest of students.

Teachers said they were further facing problems as residents did not cooperate with them most of the times and treat them as salespersons and humiliate them. Problem of stray dogs was also listed."

Two of the axed trees were of unknown variety.

Investigation officer assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Amar Singh said, ""On the complaint of the BDPO, we have registered a case against one person, who has been identified as Maya Ram, under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. The accused has stated that he was asked by the village sarpanch to cut the trees in order to prepare a ground on school premises.

The school is located in PMC Colony area near the Patil Estate slum which suffered a fire incident three days ago. The children running in the corridors are not on campus for education but for mere survival after losing their entire households in the fire.

""Most of the children in the school are from Patil Estate. The school was informed about the incident and the required arrangement was made a little after 2pm (The fire brigade received a call at 1.10pm). The teachers were in the school till around 6:15pm when the last child was handed over to his parents,"" said Shilpa Gholap who works closely with the principal of the school.

The principal of the school, Anjali Mandhale, was on leave when the incident happened and the school was headed by Ujwala Nangre, vice principal, in her absence.

Ganesh Sonune, disaster management department officer at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said government structures for such situations are pre-identified and people are shifted there and provided with water, sanitation and food.

""That is the protocol. For example, people were provided with blankets and donations from us as well as private organisations.

Well, he has only three students. If the teacher takes off, the school is shut for the day. The three students study in Classes 1, 2 and 5. The government primary school in Bandemma Nagar near Naragund town once had a good numbers of students but after locals started to migrate, the school was left with only three children.

The teacher, H S Sunkad, hails from Naragund and he was appointed on deputation to this school four months ago.A few years ago, Bandemma Nagar had several families living here and many children went to the school. However, most of the residents got houses under a Central government scheme and left the village.

The three children continue to come to school, thanks to their dedicated teacher. ""When I first came here, I was surprised to see only three students. But it is my duty as a teacher to teach, irrespective of the number of students. I teach all the children in the same class. Of the three students, one was planning to quit school and had joined his father in cattle grazing. But I convinced the family as well as the boy to pursue his studies.

importance to martial arts training for girl students as part of its self-defence programme, this government higher secondary school in Kurichi has been a pioneer in the field with seven of its students getting ready to participate in a State-level meet to be held soon.

Even its first year of training, as many as 120 of its 147 students participated in the divisional meet concluded in the city; 91 of them managed to bag medals too. The school offers training in various disciplines like fencing, judo and taekwondo.

At a time when most government schools in the city and rural areas alike concentrated on conventional games like kabaddi, volleyball and football, this schools took the initiative to introduce martial arts with the help of its physical education teachers P Sivaprakasham and N Nisar. This training was then extended to the school's girl students in the form of self-defence lessons. Teachers wanted them equipped to handle any situation they might face. After being briefed about the different forms of martial arts, many girls volunteered to be trained in fencing; they also managed to win a few

medals, he recalls.

Five girls -- S Swetha, D Mercy, R Ranjani, of class XI, and Rajeshwari (class X) and K Logeshwari (class IX) -- have been qualified to participate in the State-level event to be held soon in Kankeyam

of Tirupur district. The girls, on their part, are happy to have overcome all odds to make a mark in the

sport. Though their mothers were hesitant to allow them to be trained in martial arts, all parents are now happy that their girls have managed to achieve so much. Now, they eagerly inquire about fencing practice before asking about academics, narrates Swetha.

Headmistress N Shanthi cannot appreciate the effort more. The teacher's job is not just to improve the students' skills in academics; they should also identify their talents and put them on the path of development. She also remarks that such training has increased attendance among students. A year ago, only 50 per cent of students were willing to attend classes; this has increased to 95 per cent, she claims.

While the school might have its reasons to introduce martial arts to its students, the motivations for single

mother M Gowri are quite simple. Raising her two girls -- M Praveena and M Durgadevi -- on her own, after the demise of her husband, she wanted them to be fiercely independent. When the school

announced self-defence lessons, she was more than happy to sign them up for it. True to spirit, the girls managed to bag a silver medal in karate and Praveena has a bronze in fencing to add to it. It was the mother's aspiration that pushed them to their best, Praveena declares.

The school allows students to excel in swimming too. Four boys -- T Akash, V Mahadevan, M Muthukathiravan, S Logeshwaran (all class VIII students) -- were identified after teachers saw them

swimming in the Kurichi lake, located adjacent to the school.

All these boys had not had formal training before. Akash learnt to swim in the Kuruchi lake, for Mahadevan it was a check dam near Madukkarai and Muthukathiravan and Logeshwaran had the good local old wells."

One class for all students is held in this special classroom inside the plane. The students feel so thrilled sitting in a plane that they don't want to go home even after school gets over.

""It has become a major attraction in the village,"" says principal Pushpa Meena. ""Even people from outside the village come here for posing in front of the plane. It has become a selfie point in the village,"" she adds.

Meena said recently after a wedding, the bride and groom came to the school for a photo shoot near the plane.

Until six months ago, the Indargarh government school, 16km from Alwar city, had a dilapidated building, broken classrooms, ceilings that leaked and an unattractive facade.

According to 2016 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey of schooling and learning levels in rural India, Rajasthan is among the top three states with highest dropout rate in children of 11 to 14 years. Against the all-India average of 3.5%, Rajasthan has 5% dropout rate in this age group.

Unattractive schools are a major reason for high dropout rates.

The district unit of Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) took up the renovation of the Indargarh school six months ago. SSA junior engineer Rajesh Lawania prepared a proposal for developing facilities at the school and constructing an airplane for a classroom. He approached Sehgal Foundation, a non-profit organisation that has developed 30 government schools in the district, with the project.

In six months, the foundation has spent Rs 45 lakh on the development of the Indargarh school, said foundation official Mahipal Singh.

The classroom inside the plan is fitted with an internet-enabled LED screen where senior students get YouTube lessons and the juniors watch cartoons and hear stories, said the principal.

""The school is already drawing new students. This year, we have had 22 new admissions. The plane classroom has started only this week. We hope to reap its benefits in the next academic session,"" she added.

""Kabhi nahi socha tha ki hawai jahaz me baithkar padhenge, yeh kisi sapne se kam nahi hai (We never thought we will ever sit in a plane. This is nothing short of a dream),"" said Priyanka Saini of Class 11. Her friends, Kanchala and Anju, couldn't agree more.

The villagers are happy with the development and feel a sense of ownership. ""We will look after the school. It has changed our vision towards a school,"" said Jatan Singh, a local.

Former sarpanch Ramjilal Meena said the gram panchayat was fortunate to have a school like this.

The plane has two entries with stairs to climb. There's pathway from the classrooms to the stairs with trees on both sides. ""We planted 1,100 plants to improve the landscape and make the campus children friendly,"" Lawania said.

The SSA engineer had earlier got classrooms of a government school painted like the coaches of a train. ""I am constantly thinking of innovations to make the schools attractive to increase enrolment and to check dropouts,"" he said.

Lawania said he has also never been inside a plane. He looked at YouTube videos to see the insides before designing the classroom."

The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), which compiled the report titled Survey of Fruits, Vegetables and Juice Intake of School Children, Nutritionists and Dieticians, found that students in government schools consumed around 250 grams of vegetables in a day while those in private schools had only 210 grams.

The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, recommends that a person should consume at least 300 grams of vegetables a day. Of this, according to NIN guidelines, 50 grams each must constitute leafy vegetables and tubers, while 200 grams should be other vegetables. The institute also recommends intake of 100 grams of fresh fruits.

""Schoolchildren need maximum nutrition and deficiency of micronutrients leads to fatigued learning. Non-consumption of vegetables leads to deficiency of micronutrients, which significantly affects learning abilities. Hence, it is important for schoolchildren to have the required amount of vegetables (micronutrients),"" said Dr YG Deosthale, former director of NIN.

The ICRIER, as a part of the survey, studied the dietary habits of 98, 596 students across 36 government schools and 54 private schools in the city. The students were from Class V to Class XII.The survey found no significant difference in the intake of fruits and vegetables between girls and boys. ""More than 56 per cent students enrolled in Classes V to XII in Delhi-NCR consumed lesser green vegetables than what is mandated. And, only over one-fourth of the students ate fruits daily,"" the report said.

However, according to the report, students in private schools consumed more fruits that those enrolled in government schools. ""While 34 per cent of students enrolled in private schools ate fruits daily, only 25 per cent of those in government schools consumed fruits,"" the report said.

The principal of a private school said that it was not the school's duty to instruct kids on what to eat. ""Almost all students eat what they are told to by parents. What we can do is to make them aware of the benefits of healthy eating. But, in the end they will follow the dietary routine of their house,"" she said.

However, no funds were sanctioned under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) for purchasing uniforms for APL students. On the other hand, the SSA sanctioned '6.44 crore in the academic year of 2017-18 to procure uniforms for 1.61 lakh students. There are a total of 40,000 APL students in the district.

There are 1,381 government-run primary and upper primary schools in the district that get funds under SSA.

Having spent many years in Kerala, these workers can speak Malayalam. Now, the PTA and the public have come up with a project called Njangalum Vayikkum, which translates into ""we will also read"", to enhance reading skills.

""The migrant workforce is fast becoming the backbone of several sectors in the state,"" he pointed out.

The school authorities got support from Usman Koomanna, who helps migrant workers and teachers here communicate with others in a better way.

While many private schools in the district have managed to complete 80% of the SSLC syllabus, students of government institutions are contending with prolonged truancy of their teachers. Consequently, a very significant amount of their syllabus has not been covered, leaving the students in a lurch.

The teachers have laid the blame squarely at the doors of the officials of the department of public instruction (DPI) for the protracted delay in finalising the transfer process. Sources in the Karnataka primary and secondary education department said that the process was initiated as early as December 2017, but stiff resistance from teachers unwilling to relocate to rural areas resulted in the delay.

An officer in the primary education department said, ""We will complete the transfer of primary school teachers by October 30, following which we will start the transfer process of high school teachers. As a result, many schools will not have teachers for various subjects till December, which might pose problems to SSLC students.""

That private schools were holding camps on how best to tackle SSLC examinations set the dire situation in state-run institutions in stark relief, he said. ""At government schools, students are more worried about, who their new teacher will be, whether he or she will complete the syllabus on time and if the teacher will continue where the previous one stopped, etc. In the absence of a full-time primary and secondary education minister, this is a fiasco. Students at government schools are likely to lose some marks owing to the delay in completion of syllabus,"" the official added.

President of the primary school teachers' association Basavaraj Gurikar attributed the delay in the transfer process to software glitches. ""We hope things change in the next few years and the process can be completed in a seamless manner, so as to avoid trouble for the students,"" said Gurikar.

Raghu Kumar, an SSLC student at a government high school in Mysuru city, said, ""The government must not let the students down. If a teacher is transferred in the middle of the academic year, it creates a lot of problems for the students. The government must ensure that such a situation does not arise next year.""

Deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru Mamata said that as many as 2,032 primary school teachers from across the district had sought transfer. ""The transfer of primary teachers was to be completed by October 22,"" said Mamata.

Former primary and secondary education minister and BSP leader N Mahesh told STOI that the delay was the result of a host of issues - the result of elections, confusion pertaining to additional teachers and technical glitches. ""It is unfortunate that students have to suffer. But, the department was also helpless in many cases,"" he added."

Basic reading and writing constitutes the child's ability to read simple sentences like: 'My name is Ramesh' or ""Gaay ghaas khay che"" (Gujarati for: A cow eats grass).

""They could not even do basic maths like answering 2+2=4; 3+7=10; 7-4=3,"" the official said.

This revelation on the shocking state of education was revealed in the seventh edition of the 'Gunotsav' drive, a study undertaken by the state government where primary school students are assessed to ascertain their levels of learning.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama admitted that the major learning gap was a cause of concern. He said that state was committed to turning the situation around.

""Gujarat is the only state that has assessed the problem. Once we knew the problem, we first initiated an out-of-box measure like Mission Vidya to remedy it. After this intervention, where earlier only five students in a class could read or write, now only 5 can't,"" said Chudasama.

Mission Vidya was launched recently by the Gujarat government, where teachers are asked to give 3 hours of extra classes to weak students for 35 days.

At the end of Mission Vidya, 43% of the weak students identified were able to read and write simple sentences and do basic maths.

Officials, however, admitted that the huge learning gap would need more than stop-gap interventions for quality to be improved.

""The no-detention policy, where students are not detained till class 8, has done significant harm to the quality of education. Teaching also has to be more holistic and focused on ensuring that every child at least gains basic education levels,"" said an educator."

Issues like missing classes, misbehaviour towards teachers or school staff, bullying classmates, eve teasing, indulgence in behaviour of moral turpitude, propagating a strike or connection with a banned association, gambling, theft of school property, smoking or chewing gutkha/paan/khaini, and the practice of casteism or untouchability will attract strict actions from the head of the School.

All these actions form a section of the forbidden list of behaviour.

Breaking of such rules, the circular dated September 10 says, will lead to suspension of the student or detention in which the student might be asked to complete his school work during recess time or any similar task, and in the cases of higher classes (class 9 to 12), expulsion or rustication of students in rarest of the rare cases.

In order to ensure a safe environment for students and teachers in Delhi Government schools, the Delhi Government's DOE has issued an order, asking students and teachers to refrain from missing classes and maintain decorum.

The circular, ""Model Code of Conduct"", has been issued after a three-year-old girl was allegedly sexually exploited within her school premises in northwest Delhi area earlier this month.

Bengaluru: Karan Jani studied at a school with no science lab. Today, he is a renowned scientist who was part of a historic discovery that launched a new branch of science three years ago.

Jani and his teammates at Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) were the first to detect the universe's gravitational waves. The feat, which was the culmination of a decade of efforts, won the team the Nobel Prize and the Special Breakthrough Prize in Physics last year.

This scientist's journey is one budding scientists around the country can identify with. One of the most prominent voices of Indian science online and offline today, Jani tours the country giving lectures. But getting there involved bucking the rat race, as well as advice from seniors to go for an MBA even though he was pursuing a bachelor's in physics.

Jani attended a government school in Baroda, Gujarat, where education was subsidised. ""We didn't have science labs. Our library was (a room of) tables and chairs where we all went to play 'book-cricket',"" Jani told ThePrint.

Growing up, there were no science idols to look up to. The only name he probably heard, he said, was Vikram Sarabhai. This was likely because the father of India's space programme was from Ahmedabad, Baroda's neighbouring city.

Jani subsequently joined Maharaja Sayajirao University, a public institution in Baroda, for an undergraduate degree in physics. He wasn't sure about his career, but was confused why seniors were advising him to appear for the Common Admission Test for admissions to the Indian Institutes of Management.

One day, as he was wandering outside his college, he picked up Stephen Hawking's iconic A Brief History of Time from a street-side book vendor. He was hooked from Page 1, and it was like a new world had opened up for him.

""Until I read the book, facts were always presented as a fact with no context or explanation to convince you of it,"" he said. ""But that book floored me and changed my entire outlook.""

He then set about approaching universities around the world with queries about their undergraduate astronomy programs. Penn State, US, unexpectedly responded, encouraging him to apply for a transfer there. Everything worked out, and Jani left for Pennsylvania after his first year for a B.S. in astronomy and astrophysics.

It was here that he got interested in general relativity, and obtained a simultaneous undergraduate degree in physics with a minor in mathematics.

It was during his undergraduate studies that he got the opportunity to meet Hawking, when he was a visiting scholar at the Albert Einstein Institute in Germany. At this 'Comic Con for physics', seeing Hawking was a routine affair. Eventually, Hawking invited Jani and other undergraduate students for a lunchtime interaction.

A few years later, Hawking would be a part of the committee that decided to give Jani and his team the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for the LIGO discovery.

Among his other inspirations, Jani names astrophysicist Rainer Weiss, who led the LIGO team, and theoretical physicist Abhay Ashtekar. ""It is a fantastic feeling when your idols go on to become your colleagues and you can see them at work,"" he said.

Jani went on to do his PhD at Georgia Tech University, writing his thesis on binary black holes. ""When I started my PhD, binary black holes, where two black holes orbit each other, were still hypothetical,"" said Jani.

During his PhD, Jani worked a fair amount with LIGO, simulating and modelling findings the detector could make. He subsequently joined the observatory as a resident fellow.

Jani was at a US airport when he got the text informing him that LIGO had detected gravitational waves. Back-of-the-envelope calculations blew Jani away. ""It was not the fact that these were real gravitational waves, but that the source black holes were massive,"" he said, ""I had never seen anything of this scale before.""

The actual independent confirmations went on for several days, and the time leading up to the press announcement simmered with excitement. ""This was the culmination of my work, my colleagues', and so many of my superiors', who had been working on this all their adult lives,"" he said, likening the discovery to the time humans landed on moon.

""It was an emotional moment when I saw tweets from (former US president Barack) Obama and (PM Narendra) Modi congratulating us,"" he said.

""When I told my parents to watch the press conference, I was thinking of exactly the right circumstances that prompted me to pick up the book by Hawking in Baroda,"" he told ThePrint.

From then on, the excitement in Jani's home state spiked with every subsequent discovery made by LIGO.

The idea to tour Indian colleges came as Jani and his colleagues were invited to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""He encouraged us to go visit as many colleges and universities as we could in India and talk about science and LIGO-India,"" Jain said.

LIGO-India, a gravitational-wave observatory to be set up in the country as part of a worldwide network, is likely to be commissioned by 2024.

Two of his favourite speaking gigs involved an interaction with the disabled in Gujarat, and an address at a Forbes awards ceremony alongside theoretical physicist Lisa Randall, Nobel peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, and entrepreneur Richard Branson.

On his college tours, Jani specifically picks public institutes because ""that's where I would be had I stayed in India"".

Students in India aren't exposed to a lot of open problems in their fields because of lack of research in their institute or by their professors, and that is something he hopes changes. He especially wishes Indian undergraduate research becomes a norm, just like lab courses are.

""Unless you have a problem in front of you that you are aiming to solve, there really isn't much difference between, say a BSc Physics and an MSc Physics,"" he added.

He recalled a tidbit from his own academic life to stress the need for more conferences for students where they can interact with the stalwarts of academia.

Attending a conference for undergraduate physics students at Fermilab, the iconic particle physics and accelerator laboratory in the US, was one of the best experiences of his life, he said.

""It was absolutely incredible that the people who worked there interacted with us, undergraduate students,"" he added, ""Leon Lederman, a particle physics Nobel laureate, attended our poster sessions and asked us questions when we were presenting.""

Jani is now focussed on the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which will measure gravitational waves from space and is due for a 2034 launch. He also serves as an education policy adviser for the Gujarat government.

LIGO-India is also big on his agenda.

""LIGO-India is a very important, landmark scientific project for India because this is a field that has just been born and it is important for our country to train the next generation of scientists,"" he said.

""Scientists who work on LIGO-India will also work on LISA, and when LISA flies, we will have a wealth of resources ready to lead gravitational-wave astronomy,"" he added.

Gravitational-wave astronomy has just seen its break of day, and many like Jani are hopeful that it will help us solve some deep mysteries about space, for example, what happened in the few zillionths of a second immediately after the Big Bang.

Jani also focuses on science communication online, being a firm proponent of its importance in an age of rampant pseudoscience and misinformation.

""Pseudoscience from members of the public can be pardoned, with the hope that the next generation of students is able to successfully counter it and stomp it out,"" he said.

""But when it comes from policy-makers and politicians, it becomes a matter of concern,"" he added.

""Unfortunately, everyone, whether a politician or a troll, is a product of our system, and that is an example of how our system fails our citizens,"" Jani said. ""Sadly, the burden of fixing this problem lies on our future generations, which we can hopefully steer in the right direction."""

In an exemplary move towards ensuring punctuality, teachers at some government schools in the national capital of Delhi have been reaching half-an-hour early and even staying late. And just in case you are left wondering what caused the emergence of this seemingly unusual trend, blame the introduction of the biometric system of attendance for teachers.

Teachers say they need to stand in a long queue to mark their attendance via biometric system and enter the Aadhaar number, which takes time and could lead to them being marked late. The details of the employees' timings were made available to the public through the Employee Attendance Report released by by the Directorate of Education (DoE) on its website, The Indian Express reported.

Understandably, most of the teachers are unhappy with this biometric system claiming that they still need to mark their attendance on register.

A teacher at a school in Delhi's Kohat Enclave claimed that while the school starts at 7 am, most teachers have started to reach by 6.15 am-6.30 am. The teacher alleged that feeding in Aadhaar card numbers is a time-taking process and nobody wants to risk being late. ""So I thought it is better to come early and punch in. If we come a little late, it means again standing in the queue and sometimes getting marked late,"" the teacher was quoted as saying by IE.

Many teachers have also raised questions over the purpose of introducing the system and entering Aadhaar numbers. ""Why can't we have a system where there is no need to give our Aadhaar numbers? This is the main reason why it takes such a long time. It is not a good system... Several times, it fails to read our fingerprints. Teachers who live far from the school have ended up missing their trains and reaching home late,"" said Shoaib Rana, a teacher at the Government Boys Senior Secondary School.

Another teacher questioned,""What is the point of bringing in this technology when we have to record it on paper again. Isn't it a waste of our time?"""

Goel visited the government school on Wednesday morning for a surprise inspection only to find that the principal and the vice-principal were absent. He was informed by senior teachers that the district DDE had called them. However, the DDE told Goel that no such message had been relayed by him. It was later found that the school officials had gone to the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights to appear in a hearing.

""It is not understood how, during working school hours, both officials i.e. principal and vice-principal left the school without giving any information to any of staff, leaving the school in total chaos,"" Goel wrote in his inspection report.

He also found the midday meal being provided to students was of substandard quality, and the supply was far more than what was needed in the school. The distributing staff at the school later told Goel that the weighing of the midday meal food was not done for the last one year and that no weighing scale was available in the school.

The director also came to know that the midday meal in charge of the school had not informed the NGO concerned about the requirement of the meals, as a result of which only 30% of the food was consumed. ""The rice was half-boiled and the curry supplied lacked proper nutrients,"" said Goel."

The police officer handling the case reportedly said, ""The body has been sent for the postmortem and the report will soon be out. We are carrying out the investigation.""

The confrontation began on September 15 when Kumar slapped one of his schoolmates for allegedly snatching his best friend's cell phone. After the incident the accused summoned 15-20 of his friends, some of whom were school seniors outside the school premises on September 17.

After stepping out of the school Vikas was surrounded by the accused and other boys and a heated argument ensued. In the heat of the moment, one of the minors in the crowd allegedly took out a knife and stabbed Vikas.

All these years, parents had to apply for scholarships from the government on their own. This year, the CM has instructed the authorities reach the 100% target and enrol all eligible students at government and aided schools. So, the pressure was passed on to the teachers.

Following the government's direction, teachers have asked the students to bring their parents to schools with necessary documents like Aadhaar card, income and cast certificates among others. But teachers are facing a tough time collecting and uploading details of many children as their parents do not have income certificates.

Karnataka State High School Assistant Teachers Association president H K Manjunath said, ""This is real harassment for the teachers.

People in Kerala might not be able to forget the 'deadly months' of July and August because of the massive effect of the calamity on life and infrastructure.

Help has been pouring in from all over the country for those who have been hit by the flood. Despite fewer resources, Keralites have come together to help each other.

This government lower primary school at Kurichiarmala in the district will remain the testimony to nature's fury that has left a trail of death and destruction across the state.

A landslide on August 9 had torn through the school's one-acre compound and created two craters near the building and making it inaccessible.

Until Monday, the teachers and villagers were unsure of the future of the institute's 92 students.

In two days, the uncertainty gave way to a new-found confidence -- now seen across the state -- as the exuberant students started school on the top floor of a madrassa, barely a kilometre away.

The temporary establishment has become a symbol of communal harmony and determination of a resilient village that refused to be cowed down by adverse conditions, despite their debilitating effect.

There was an effort to clean up the three-foot mud and slush from the school building so that the classes could commence. Recurring landslides, however, posed a constant risk, forcing the authorities and volunteers to abandon their efforts.

Realising the need for continuing the school, the local mahal committee stepped in and offered space in the Hayathul Islam Madrassa building. Local residents and volunteers swung into action and made necessary arrangements on the top floor of the building.

They converted the top floor into a full-fledged school with four classrooms and a staffroom in 72 hours.

As the classes restarted on Wednesday morning, the building earned the distinction of having a madrassa, a mosque and a government school under the same roof.

The school, meanwhile, adjusted its working days. It would be closed on Fridays -- so that the faithful would have enough space for their prayers -- and instead, would work on Saturdays. The arrangement would continue for the rest of the academic year.

Authorities said the school would function in the madrassa until it a new building somewhere nearby.

Among the students who attended school on Wednesday, five have been rendered homeless by the landslides. A Facebook community, Human Being Collective, Malabar Flood Relief Forum and Green Palliative Volunteers had raised around Rs 4 lakh and helped the villagers recreate the school, which now sport brand new furniture, blackboards, teaching aids and colourful walls with animated characters and even indoor plants.

The pre-primary section has been accommodated in the madrassa's courtyard, where the Hayathul Islam mosque is also located.

""Even the children hailing from families who had suffered huge losses in the landslide were so happy on seeing their new school. It will immensely help them in erasing their traumatic experiences,"" district collector Keshvendra Kumar said.

The school is also a reaffirmation of the secular credentials of Kerala where everyone is helping each other, cutting across religious, social and other barriers,"" who spent around three hours at the school, added.

The school's PTA President Mohammed Aslam, also the vice president of the mahal committee, said the entire Mahal was very forthcoming in opening up its premises for the school. ""Though properties worth crores were lost in the landslide, our biggest loss was the Kurichiar Mala LP School. Most of the people in the village work in the nearby tea plantation and the school was their only hope for a better future of their children,"" Aslam said.

School headmaster Sasi P K said the deputy director of education has sanctioned the changes in the school working days to facilitate the Friday prayers at the mosque.

C K Saseendran, representing Kalpetta in the state assembly, said the school would be upgraded to an upper primary school with Rs 1 crore from the MLA fund and a Rs 49 lakh grant from the central government's multi-sectoral development programme. The Tata Group, meanwhile, has promised to construct a new building for the school on identifying a new location.

The district collector said the damaged school building would be converted to a memorial to showcase how the people overcame the natural calamity."

For a few days, almost every year during the monsoon, the Junior Basic (JB) School in Desom, on the far edge of the city of Kochi in Kerala, would turn into a virtual flood-relief camp. Positioned just 300 metres from the national highway on a higher surface, the school, believed to be over 125 years old, was always marked as a safe zone by the people of nearby villages like Purayar and Puthuvassery, prone to regular flooding from the Periyar.

Every year, when the river seizes their homes, the families, mostly belonging to the SC community, would gather what they can and run to the school at Desom. Except, this year, when the Periyar flowed in spate, even the JB school failed them. For 72 hours, the upper-primary school, its offices, classrooms, kitchen and anganwadi remained under water.

On Wednesday, as per government directions, the school reopened after a fortnight of raging floods and the subsequent Onam-Bakrid vacation. But of the 53 students enrolled at the government school between LKG and grade 4, just about ten students turned up. Headmistress Ramlah Beevi and four staff teachers were present to welcome them with chocolates and biscuits, but it was evident that neither the school nor its staff faculty was ready to start anew.

""Except one, all the staff's homes were flooded this time, including mine. My husband and kids are all out there cleaning. I'm a very healthy woman, but today, for the first time in my life, I felt my head spin. I had to sit down. This is our mental state,"" says Ramlah Beevi, who took charge as a headmistress at the school just two months ago.

Inside the school office, tonnes of files and important documents, partially drenched in floodwaters, were hung out to dry.

For the past one week, after the flood waters receded from Desom and nearby areas, Beevi says, she and other teaching and cleaning staff had to devote an equal amount of time to the sanitation of their own homes and the school. If the damage to their homes was extensive, so was that of the school. Despite a week of cleaning works, heaps of mud and filth lay scattered around the front-yard of the school. Inside the school office, tonnes of files and important documents, partially drenched in floodwaters, were hung out to dry. Instruments of critical school infrastructure like laptops, desktops and a printer sat in a corner, waiting to be drained. Inside classrooms, wooden benches and desks lay in disarray. From the school's kitchen, used for cooking the mid-day meals, several important utensils had floated away. In one of the rooms, a teacher was horrified to find a small slithering sand boa resting in a corner. Perhaps the most wrenching sight was a dirty brown line, a sort of an indelible mark left behind by the flood waters, running along the walls of the school corridor, painted with images of Kerala's classical dance forms like Kathakali and Mohiniyattam.

""After a lot of English-medium schools came up in this area over the last few areas, the enrolment of students went down considerably. Today, we have students only from the poorest communities coming to study here. Their homes have been washed away. Their books and bags have all been lost. The government has promised to supply us with essential books within two days,"" the headmistress said.

A man, employed as a cleaner at the school over the last 14 years, said it made him sad to see the institution like this, wrecked by the most calamitous floods Kerala has ever seen. ""Three-fourth of the school was flooded. We never thought the water from the river could rise all the way here,"" he said.

A man, employed as a cleaner at the school over the last 14 years, said it made him sad to see the institution like this, wrecked by the most calamitous floods Kerala has ever seen.

Jaffer, an assistant sub-inspector with the state special branch (SSB) of the Kerala Police, visited the school as part of his duty to oversee the cleaning works. ""This is one of the badly-affected schools here under our station jurisdiction. I have spoken to the panchayat officials. I will wait till 5 pm to see whether the cleaning work is completed. If not, I will send a report to my superior which will be forwarded to the chief minister's office,"" he informed.

Inside one of the classrooms, Veluppandi, a student of class 1, and his elder sister, Pandiamma, of class 3, sat around munching biscuits. Wearing clothes given to them from the relief camp, they were delighted to be welcomed with goodies on the first day in school after Onam vacations.

When asked if they missed being in school, Pandiamma smiles sheepishly, looks towards her younger brother and says, ""But he was very happy. When there was no school, he would play at home all day.""

With a population of just 300, a government primary school in Mansa, considered one of the most backward villages in Punjab, has become the most sought-after school for parents to admit their children, even from nearby villages.

Around 10 months ago, the school at Jeetsar village (block Budhalada-1) was just like any other government school of Punjab, grappling with infrastructure problems. There were 43 children then, which has now increased to 98.

Today, this primary school is not only equipped with functional learning aids such as windmill, a manual clock, counting through balls on a rope model, colourful walls, smart classroom, a train, reading cell among others, but also has a separate pre-primary wing. Above all, it is now an English medium school.

A portion of the school has been converted into a train and named 'Jeetsar Express'. After undergoing an astonishing transformation within 10 months, parents and School Management Committee (SMC) arrange a special bus which now ferries children from nearby Bachhoana village. The bus was arranged after enrollment increased and many parents from Bachhoana started sending children to Jeetsar school.

Amarjit Singh Chahal, the elementary teacher who joined school in July last, and is credited for school's transformation, while speaking to The Indian Express said junk and waste items were used to create functional learning aids for kids. ""An old discarded ceiling fan was used to create a windmill to explain renewable sources of energy. Then we tied a rope and hung colourful balls on it for kids to learn counting through practical method. We purchased old toilet seats for Rs 50-100 and installed them in garden to make students learn about cleanliness and Swachh Bharat and to tell them about importance of using toilets. Then, we also have a manual clock with moving hands for students to practise concept of time.""

He added, ""We just tried to make optimum use of resources we had. Earlier, we had only two classrooms apart from an office and kitchen. We converted the office into a smart classroom by getting LED screen installed. Two computers were purchased to start a computer room. There is a reading cell too where books have been kept for children.""

Chahal, who was promoted a few days back and is now posted at a senior secondary school, said, ""We used to take extra classes till 7 pm and even work on Sundays. Slowly, we got benches, swings and computers through donations from NRIs and others. Almost Rs 2 lakh were spent to change face of the school.""

The village panchayat also got funds of Rs 5 lakh passed through MNREGA to start pre-primary wing in the school.

However, rest of the funds have been arranged through donations and collected from village residents. ""When I joined here in 2006, we even used to ferry children on our motorbikes. But despite all this hardwork, we did not receive any appreciation or grant from the state education department. This is sad and heart-breaking,"" says Satpal Singh, head teacher of the school.

As many as 7,001 primary and 1,486 high schools are in urgent need of repairs. Hassan district tops the list with 662 such schools followed by Mandya, Belagavi-Chikkodi, Kolar and Ballari. On the other hand, Kodagu has just 20 such schools followed by Bidar, Udupi, Gadag and Bengaluru North.

Department officials told Express that in cases of emergency, the Gram Panchayats and other local bodies can be approached for funds.

Safety Of Children

The sorry state of the schools is a question of safety of thousands of children who have to sit in the unsafe buildings every day. In 2016, the ceiling of a government school building in Madhugiri taluk had collapsed resulting in four children sustaining serious head injuries and 15 escaping with minor injuries."

But the Department of Primary and Secondary Education appears to have no clarity on how this exercise will be carried out.

Recently, the department collated data that indicated there were 14,712 government primary schools that had less than 30 students. These schools are reportedly located within 1-km radius of other government schools. These schools have 25,550 teachers.

According to statistics provided by the department, there are 261 schools with zero admissions, 3,374 schools that have student enrolment between 1 and 10, and 11,077 schools that have between 11 and 30 students.

Although Primary and Secondary Education Minister N. Mahesh, after opposition from different stakeholders, had said that only around 8,000 schools would be merged with 8,530 government schools, statistics show that there are 14,712 government schools with low student enrolment.

The latest data from the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database of information about schools, says that the situation is particularly grim in states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, West Bengal, and some north-eastern states, as per 2016-17 statistics.

In these states, the percentage of students dropping out of school in secondary classes was considerably higher than the previous years. For example, in Bihar, in 2016-17, 39.73 per cent students in secondary classes withdrew from school, as compared to just 25.90 per cent students in 2015-16.

In Jharkhand, 36.64 per cent students dropped out in 2016-17, the last year for which data is available, which is over 12 per cent more than the previous year. The Union Human Resources Development Ministry has been boasting about making significant changes in the school education sector.

It's own figures, however, suggest that while the gross enrolment ratio was over 100 per cent at the primary level in 2016-17 (GER can be more than 100 per cent at the primary level because of overage and underage children taking admissions), it Is less than 80 per cent at the secondary level and is yet to reach 60 per cent at the senior secondary level.

Education experts said that while lack of access in rural areas and lack of interest in learning are major factors why children in higher classes drop out of schools, the no-detention policy till class VIII, which was introduced as part of the Right to Education act, could also be a reason.

""The government has now moved to end the no-detention policy, but in the past many year, it has been seen that children who were not assessed properly till class VIII, lose interest in studies when they don't do well at higher level examinations,"" said educationist Varsha Narain."

A mother of three, Qanungo is known for her innovative teaching ways. Last year, too, she was given a state award for best teacher, and had also received an award from a university in London.

""English is a subject in which students in our government schools don't feel very comfortable. I diagnosed the problem and developed a strategy. Rather than making it a subject confined to reading and writing, I worked on developing listening skills of the children. I would ask them to hear the announcement at railway stations, metro, radio and call centres. The strategy worked and students became very confident,"" Qanungo said.

The 43-year-old Government Higher Primary School, Daddalkad, Bantwal taluk, was in a dilapidated condition in 2015 and had only 30 students. Now it has around 500 children, studying from LKG to class VIII, where English is taught along with Kannada.

It was all possible because of the efforts and foresight of Shree Durga Friends Club, Karenki, led by Prakash Anchan, a garment merchant from Bantwal.

""When most Kannada-medium schools across the state are closing down due to various reasons, we wanted to show the world that this school can be saved by adopting new teaching skills, and today we are successful in doing so.

Anchan added that they collected all the money from generous donors, who included locals, parents and others. ""We have not taken a single penny from any government be it the Centre or state. When we proposed the same building plan, the government estimated a cost of Rs 6 crore, but we have completed the work by spending Rs 2.2 crore.""

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

In the confines of Pongalur, this former government-aided school teacher has dedicated her verdant eight-and-a-half acre to hundreds of trees. The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends."

These teachers have come together to overhaul infrastructure in as many as 1,700 schools. Efforts are on to take the number to 4,250.

LITTLE ONES: KG classes in Government Primary School, Jhans started 2 years ago

Principals, head teachers and teachers are spearheading the change with the help of philanthropists.

Here are a few stories of faith and transformation.

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

Government Primary School, Nathewal

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

He has now been asked to guide other schools in the district"

Teachers said the duty should be given to someone else so that they could focus on students, who are left in schools all by themselves. With Exams nearing, most of the schools are yet to complete syllabus of senior classes. During a visit to schools on Monday and Tuesday, TOI found teachers handling multiple classes. In some schools, especially primary schools, only the in charge of the school was present as other teachers were out for conducting survey.

The in charge had been managing all the classes together. In some schools, teachers had combined various classes to manage students, while in others students were made to sit in the open so that teachers could conduct activities for all throughout the day.

""Parents of most of the students are working. Therefore, we have to start with the survey early in the morning. December 8 is the last day of submition and all teachers have been sent to conduct it. We have no other option,"" said one of the in charge of a government school requesting anonymity.

Arvind Rana, teachercum-president, SSA teacher's welfare association, said: ""Child mapping survey is a non-teaching task. Section 27 of the RTE Act, 2009, states that teachers cannot be assigned with non-teaching work, except, decennial census, disaster duties and election duties for the legislature and state assembly.""

An emergency meeting of the executive members of the Joint Action Committee (JAC) was held on Tuesday. The meeting was held to discuss the problems being faced by teachers while conducting the survey.

""Students are suffering due to such activities. Teachers should not be involved in non-academic activities at the cost of studies of the students. Keeping in view the studies of students and security of teachers, such nonteaching activities should be allotted to an outsourcing agency so that teachers can concentrate only on the studies of students,"" said Bhag Singh Kairon, president, JAC. Various leaders of the JAC appealed to the education department that they should not assign such activities to teachers and also minimize other non-teaching activities in the schools in the interest of students.

Teachers said they were further facing problems as residents did not cooperate with them most of the times and treat them as salespersons and humiliate them. Problem of stray dogs was also listed."

The school is located in PMC Colony area near the Patil Estate slum which suffered a fire incident three days ago. The children running in the corridors are not on campus for education but for mere survival after losing their entire households in the fire.

""Most of the children in the school are from Patil Estate.

The government primary school in Bandemma Nagar near Naragund town once had a good numbers of students but after locals started to migrate, the school was left with only three children.

The teacher, H S Sunkad, hails from Naragund and he was appointed on deputation to this school four months ago.A few years ago, Bandemma Nagar had several families living here and many children went to the school. However, most of the residents got houses under a Central government scheme and left the village.

The three children continue to come to school, thanks to their dedicated teacher. ""When I first came here, I was surprised to see only three students. But it is my duty as a teacher to teach, irrespective of the number of students. I teach all the children in the same class.

importance to martial arts training for girl students as part of its self-defence programme, this government higher secondary school in Kurichi has been a pioneer in the field with seven of its students getting ready to participate in a State-level meet to be held soon.

Even its first year of training, as many as 120 of its 147 students participated in the divisional meet concluded in the city; 91 of them managed to bag medals too. The school offers training in various disciplines like fencing, judo and taekwondo.

At a time when most government schools in the city and rural areas alike concentrated on conventional games like kabaddi, volleyball and football, this schools took the initiative to introduce martial arts with the help of its physical education teachers P Sivaprakasham and N Nisar. This training was then extended to the school's girl students in the form of self-defence lessons. Teachers wanted them equipped to handle any situation they might face. After being briefed about the different forms of martial arts, many girls volunteered to be trained in fencing; they also managed to win a few

medals, he recalls.

Five girls -- S Swetha, D Mercy, R Ranjani, of class XI, and Rajeshwari (class X) and K Logeshwari (class IX) -- have been qualified to participate in the State-level event to be held soon in Kankeyam

of Tirupur district. The girls, on their part, are happy to have overcome all odds to make a mark in the

sport. Though their mothers were hesitant to allow them to be trained in martial arts, all parents are now happy that their girls have managed to achieve so much. Now, they eagerly inquire about fencing practice before asking about academics, narrates Swetha.

Headmistress N Shanthi cannot appreciate the effort more. The teacher's job is not just to improve the students' skills in academics; they should also identify their talents and put them on the path of development. She also remarks that such training has increased attendance among students. A year ago, only 50 per cent of students were willing to attend classes; this has increased to 95 per cent, she claims.

While the school might have its reasons to introduce martial arts to its students, the motivations for single

mother M Gowri are quite simple. Raising her two girls -- M Praveena and M Durgadevi -- on her own, after the demise of her husband, she wanted them to be fiercely independent. When the school

announced self-defence lessons, she was more than happy to sign them up for it. True to spirit, the girls managed to bag a silver medal in karate and Praveena has a bronze in fencing to add to it. It was the mother's aspiration that pushed them to their best, Praveena declares.

The school allows students to excel in swimming too. Four boys -- T Akash, V Mahadevan, M Muthukathiravan, S Logeshwaran (all class VIII students) -- were identified after teachers saw them

swimming in the Kurichi lake, located adjacent to the school.

All these boys had not had formal training before. Akash learnt to swim in the Kuruchi lake, for Mahadevan it was a check dam near Madukkarai and Muthukathiravan and Logeshwaran had the good local old wells."

Most students studying in government schools in India have never seen a plane, leave alone travelling in one. For 406 students of Government Senior Secondary School in Rajasthan's Indargarh village, too, it was a dream to sit in an airplane. A government engineer made this possible a few months ago by erecting a replica of a plane for a classroom in Alwar district. One class for all students is held in this special classroom inside the plane. The students feel so thrilled sitting in a plane that they don't want to go home even after school gets over.

""It has become a major attraction in the village,"" says principal Pushpa Meena. ""Even people from outside the village come here for posing in front of the plane. It has become a selfie point in the village,"" she adds.

Meena said recently after a wedding, the bride and groom came to the school for a photo shoot near the plane.

Until six months ago, the Indargarh government school, 16km from Alwar city, had a dilapidated building, broken classrooms, ceilings that leaked and an unattractive facade.

According to 2016 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey of schooling and learning levels in rural India, Rajasthan is among the top three states with highest dropout rate in children of 11 to 14 years. Against the all-India average of 3.5%, Rajasthan has 5% dropout rate in this age group.

Unattractive schools are a major reason for high dropout rates.

The district unit of Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) took up the renovation of the Indargarh school six months ago. SSA junior engineer Rajesh Lawania prepared a proposal for developing facilities at the school and constructing an airplane for a classroom. He approached Sehgal Foundation, a non-profit organisation that has developed 30 government schools in the district, with the project.

In six months, the foundation has spent Rs 45 lakh on the development of the Indargarh school, said foundation official Mahipal Singh.

The classroom inside the plan is fitted with an internet-enabled LED screen where senior students get YouTube lessons and the juniors watch cartoons and hear stories, said the principal.

""The school is already drawing new students. This year, we have had 22 new admissions. The plane classroom has started only this week. We hope to reap its benefits in the next academic session,"" she added.

""Kabhi nahi socha tha ki hawai jahaz me baithkar padhenge, yeh kisi sapne se kam nahi hai (We never thought we will ever sit in a plane. This is nothing short of a dream),"" said Priyanka Saini of Class 11. Her friends, Kanchala and Anju, couldn't agree more.

The villagers are happy with the development and feel a sense of ownership. ""We will look after the school. It has changed our vision towards a school,"" said Jatan Singh, a local.

Former sarpanch Ramjilal Meena said the gram panchayat was fortunate to have a school like this.

The plane has two entries with stairs to climb. There's pathway from the classrooms to the stairs with trees on both sides. ""We planted 1,100 plants to improve the landscape and make the campus children friendly,"" Lawania said.

The SSA engineer had earlier got classrooms of a government school painted like the coaches of a train. ""I am constantly thinking of innovations to make the schools attractive to increase enrolment and to check dropouts,"" he said.

Lawania said he has also never been inside a plane. He looked at YouTube videos to see the insides before designing the classroom."

The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), which compiled the report titled Survey of Fruits, Vegetables and Juice Intake of School Children, Nutritionists and Dieticians, found that students in government schools consumed around 250 grams of vegetables in a day while those in private schools had only 210 grams.

The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, recommends that a person should consume at least 300 grams of vegetables a day. Of this, according to NIN guidelines, 50 grams each must constitute leafy vegetables and tubers, while 200 grams should be other vegetables. The institute also recommends intake of 100 grams of fresh fruits.

""Schoolchildren need maximum nutrition and deficiency of micronutrients leads to fatigued learning. Non-consumption of vegetables leads to deficiency of micronutrients, which significantly affects learning abilities. Hence, it is important for schoolchildren to have the required amount of vegetables (micronutrients),"" said Dr YG Deosthale, former director of NIN.

The ICRIER, as a part of the survey, studied the dietary habits of 98, 596 students across 36 government schools and 54 private schools in the city. The students were from Class V to Class XII.The survey found no significant difference in the intake of fruits and vegetables between girls and boys. ""More than 56 per cent students enrolled in Classes V to XII in Delhi-NCR consumed lesser green vegetables than what is mandated. And, only over one-fourth of the students ate fruits daily,"" the report said.

However, according to the report, students in private schools consumed more fruits that those enrolled in government schools. ""While 34 per cent of students enrolled in private schools ate fruits daily, only 25 per cent of those in government schools consumed fruits,"" the report said.

The principal of a private school said that it was not the school's duty to instruct kids on what to eat. ""Almost all students eat what they are told to by parents. What we can do is to make them aware of the benefits of healthy eating. But, in the end they will follow the dietary routine of their house,"" she said.

However, no funds were sanctioned under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) for purchasing uniforms for APL students. On the other hand, the SSA sanctioned '6.44 crore in the academic year of 2017-18 to procure uniforms for 1.61 lakh students. There are a total of 40,000 APL students in the district.

There are 1,381 government-run primary and upper primary schools in the district that get funds under SSA.

While many private schools in the district have managed to complete 80% of the SSLC syllabus, students of government institutions are contending with prolonged truancy of their teachers. Consequently, a very significant amount of their syllabus has not been covered, leaving the students in a lurch.

The teachers have laid the blame squarely at the doors of the officials of the department of public instruction (DPI) for the protracted delay in finalising the transfer process. Sources in the Karnataka primary and secondary education department said that the process was initiated as early as December 2017, but stiff resistance from teachers unwilling to relocate to rural areas resulted in the delay.

An officer in the primary education department said, ""We will complete the transfer of primary school teachers by October 30, following which we will start the transfer process of high school teachers. As a result, many schools will not have teachers for various subjects till December, which might pose problems to SSLC students.""

That private schools were holding camps on how best to tackle SSLC examinations set the dire situation in state-run institutions in stark relief, he said. ""At government schools, students are more worried about, who their new teacher will be, whether he or she will complete the syllabus on time and if the teacher will continue where the previous one stopped, etc. In the absence of a full-time primary and secondary education minister, this is a fiasco. Students at government schools are likely to lose some marks owing to the delay in completion of syllabus,"" the official added.

President of the primary school teachers' association Basavaraj Gurikar attributed the delay in the transfer process to software glitches. ""We hope things change in the next few years and the process can be completed in a seamless manner, so as to avoid trouble for the students,"" said Gurikar.

Raghu Kumar, an SSLC student at a government high school in Mysuru city, said, ""The government must not let the students down. If a teacher is transferred in the middle of the academic year, it creates a lot of problems for the students. The government must ensure that such a situation does not arise next year.""

Deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru Mamata said that as many as 2,032 primary school teachers from across the district had sought transfer. ""The transfer of primary teachers was to be completed by October 22,"" said Mamata.

Former primary and secondary education minister and BSP leader N Mahesh told STOI that the delay was the result of a host of issues - the result of elections, confusion pertaining to additional teachers and technical glitches. ""It is unfortunate that students have to suffer. But, the department was also helpless in many cases,"" he added."

Basic reading and writing constitutes the child's ability to read simple sentences like: 'My name is Ramesh' or ""Gaay ghaas khay che"" (Gujarati for: A cow eats grass).

""They could not even do basic maths like answering 2+2=4; 3+7=10; 7-4=3,"" the official said.

This revelation on the shocking state of education was revealed in the seventh edition of the 'Gunotsav' drive, a study undertaken by the state government where primary school students are assessed to ascertain their levels of learning.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama admitted that the major learning gap was a cause of concern. He said that state was committed to turning the situation around.

""Gujarat is the only state that has assessed the problem. Once we knew the problem, we first initiated an out-of-box measure like Mission Vidya to remedy it. After this intervention, where earlier only five students in a class could read or write, now only 5 can't,"" said Chudasama.

Mission Vidya was launched recently by the Gujarat government, where teachers are asked to give 3 hours of extra classes to weak students for 35 days.

At the end of Mission Vidya, 43% of the weak students identified were able to read and write simple sentences and do basic maths.

Officials, however, admitted that the huge learning gap would need more than stop-gap interventions for quality to be improved.

""The no-detention policy, where students are not detained till class 8, has done significant harm to the quality of education. Teaching also has to be more holistic and focused on ensuring that every child at least gains basic education levels,"" said an educator."

The marks, however, will be based on how many plants will remain at the end of the third year when the children are in Class 10.

Explaining this, minister Shankar said, ""If the child manages to retain all the 10 saplings at the end of the third year, he or she will be awarded with internal marks of 10.""

The saplings that will be given will include mango, guava, custard apple, chikkoo, jackfruit, neem, jamoon and gooseberry - varieties that grow easily.Forest department officials said that they also plan to ask Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board to issue certificates for Class 10 students by printing a photograph of the plant they nurtured.

So far, students from three different classes were forced to sit in the same classroom for want of space.

A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Samsung R&D Institute, Bangalore (SRI-B) and the Department of Education, Government of Karnataka for the construction of the new campus at the school in February 2018.

The new campus has six classrooms and a new administrative block with the necessary school furniture. The school, which was established in 1931, will now offer curriculum in both Kannada and English medium from Class I to Class VIII.

Dipesh Shah, MD, Samsung Research Institute Bangalore said, ""At Samsung, education is a cause that is close to our heart and we strive to give back to the society. We are committed to helping students across the state learn and fulfil their dreams. Be it our 'Make for India' initiative or community-centric voluntary activities, our core mission is to contribute and propel the growth and development of this region.

From now onwards, principals of Delhi government schools will be directly held accountable in case of misbehaviour by any student within the school premises.

The school heads have been asked to strictly implement the Model Code of Conduct.

A circular has been issued specially by the Directorate of Education (DOE), citing the reason that several instances of rules and regulations are not being followed by the students.

Issues like missing classes, misbehaviour towards teachers or school staff, bullying classmates, eve teasing, indulgence in behaviour of moral turpitude, propagating a strike or connection with a banned association, gambling, theft of school property, smoking or chewing gutkha/paan/khaini, and the practice of casteism or untouchability will attract strict actions from the head of the School.

All these actions form a section of the forbidden list of behaviour.

Breaking of such rules, the circular dated September 10 says, will lead to suspension of the student or detention in which the student might be asked to complete his school work during recess time or any similar task, and in the cases of higher classes (class 9 to 12), expulsion or rustication of students in rarest of the rare cases.

In order to ensure a safe environment for students and teachers in Delhi Government schools, the Delhi Government's DOE has issued an order, asking students and teachers to refrain from missing classes and maintain decorum.

The circular, ""Model Code of Conduct"", has been issued after a three-year-old girl was allegedly sexually exploited within her school premises in northwest Delhi area earlier this month.

Bengaluru: Karan Jani studied at a school with no science lab. Today, he is a renowned scientist who was part of a historic discovery that launched a new branch of science three years ago.

Jani and his teammates at Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) were the first to detect the universe's gravitational waves. The feat, which was the culmination of a decade of efforts, won the team the Nobel Prize and the Special Breakthrough Prize in Physics last year.

This scientist's journey is one budding scientists around the country can identify with. One of the most prominent voices of Indian science online and offline today, Jani tours the country giving lectures. But getting there involved bucking the rat race, as well as advice from seniors to go for an MBA even though he was pursuing a bachelor's in physics.

Jani attended a government school in Baroda, Gujarat, where education was subsidised. ""We didn't have science labs. Our library was (a room of) tables and chairs where we all went to play 'book-cricket',"" Jani told ThePrint.

Growing up, there were no science idols to look up to. The only name he probably heard, he said, was Vikram Sarabhai. This was likely because the father of India's space programme was from Ahmedabad, Baroda's neighbouring city.

Jani subsequently joined Maharaja Sayajirao University, a public institution in Baroda, for an undergraduate degree in physics. He wasn't sure about his career, but was confused why seniors were advising him to appear for the Common Admission Test for admissions to the Indian Institutes of Management.

One day, as he was wandering outside his college, he picked up Stephen Hawking's iconic A Brief History of Time from a street-side book vendor. He was hooked from Page 1, and it was like a new world had opened up for him.

""Until I read the book, facts were always presented as a fact with no context or explanation to convince you of it,"" he said. ""But that book floored me and changed my entire outlook.""

He then set about approaching universities around the world with queries about their undergraduate astronomy programs. Penn State, US, unexpectedly responded, encouraging him to apply for a transfer there. Everything worked out, and Jani left for Pennsylvania after his first year for a B.S. in astronomy and astrophysics.

It was here that he got interested in general relativity, and obtained a simultaneous undergraduate degree in physics with a minor in mathematics.

It was during his undergraduate studies that he got the opportunity to meet Hawking, when he was a visiting scholar at the Albert Einstein Institute in Germany. At this 'Comic Con for physics', seeing Hawking was a routine affair. Eventually, Hawking invited Jani and other undergraduate students for a lunchtime interaction.

A few years later, Hawking would be a part of the committee that decided to give Jani and his team the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for the LIGO discovery.

Among his other inspirations, Jani names astrophysicist Rainer Weiss, who led the LIGO team, and theoretical physicist Abhay Ashtekar. ""It is a fantastic feeling when your idols go on to become your colleagues and you can see them at work,"" he said.

Jani went on to do his PhD at Georgia Tech University, writing his thesis on binary black holes. ""When I started my PhD, binary black holes, where two black holes orbit each other, were still hypothetical,"" said Jani.

During his PhD, Jani worked a fair amount with LIGO, simulating and modelling findings the detector could make. He subsequently joined the observatory as a resident fellow.

Jani was at a US airport when he got the text informing him that LIGO had detected gravitational waves. Back-of-the-envelope calculations blew Jani away. ""It was not the fact that these were real gravitational waves, but that the source black holes were massive,"" he said, ""I had never seen anything of this scale before.""

The actual independent confirmations went on for several days, and the time leading up to the press announcement simmered with excitement. ""This was the culmination of my work, my colleagues', and so many of my superiors', who had been working on this all their adult lives,"" he said, likening the discovery to the time humans landed on moon.

""It was an emotional moment when I saw tweets from (former US president Barack) Obama and (PM Narendra) Modi congratulating us,"" he said.

""When I told my parents to watch the press conference, I was thinking of exactly the right circumstances that prompted me to pick up the book by Hawking in Baroda,"" he told ThePrint.

From then on, the excitement in Jani's home state spiked with every subsequent discovery made by LIGO.

The idea to tour Indian colleges came as Jani and his colleagues were invited to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""He encouraged us to go visit as many colleges and universities as we could in India and talk about science and LIGO-India,"" Jain said.

LIGO-India, a gravitational-wave observatory to be set up in the country as part of a worldwide network, is likely to be commissioned by 2024.

Two of his favourite speaking gigs involved an interaction with the disabled in Gujarat, and an address at a Forbes awards ceremony alongside theoretical physicist Lisa Randall, Nobel peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, and entrepreneur Richard Branson.

On his college tours, Jani specifically picks public institutes because ""that's where I would be had I stayed in India"".

Students in India aren't exposed to a lot of open problems in their fields because of lack of research in their institute or by their professors, and that is something he hopes changes. He especially wishes Indian undergraduate research becomes a norm, just like lab courses are.

""Unless you have a problem in front of you that you are aiming to solve, there really isn't much difference between, say a BSc Physics and an MSc Physics,"" he added.

He recalled a tidbit from his own academic life to stress the need for more conferences for students where they can interact with the stalwarts of academia.

Attending a conference for undergraduate physics students at Fermilab, the iconic particle physics and accelerator laboratory in the US, was one of the best experiences of his life, he said.

""It was absolutely incredible that the people who worked there interacted with us, undergraduate students,"" he added, ""Leon Lederman, a particle physics Nobel laureate, attended our poster sessions and asked us questions when we were presenting.""

Jani is now focussed on the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which will measure gravitational waves from space and is due for a 2034 launch. He also serves as an education policy adviser for the Gujarat government.

LIGO-India is also big on his agenda.

""LIGO-India is a very important, landmark scientific project for India because this is a field that has just been born and it is important for our country to train the next generation of scientists,"" he said.

""Scientists who work on LIGO-India will also work on LISA, and when LISA flies, we will have a wealth of resources ready to lead gravitational-wave astronomy,"" he added.

Gravitational-wave astronomy has just seen its break of day, and many like Jani are hopeful that it will help us solve some deep mysteries about space, for example, what happened in the few zillionths of a second immediately after the Big Bang.

Jani also focuses on science communication online, being a firm proponent of its importance in an age of rampant pseudoscience and misinformation.

""Pseudoscience from members of the public can be pardoned, with the hope that the next generation of students is able to successfully counter it and stomp it out,"" he said.

""But when it comes from policy-makers and politicians, it becomes a matter of concern,"" he added.

""Unfortunately, everyone, whether a politician or a troll, is a product of our system, and that is an example of how our system fails our citizens,"" Jani said. ""Sadly, the burden of fixing this problem lies on our future generations, which we can hopefully steer in the right direction."""

In an exemplary move towards ensuring punctuality, teachers at some government schools in the national capital of Delhi have been reaching half-an-hour early and even staying late. And just in case you are left wondering what caused the emergence of this seemingly unusual trend, blame the introduction of the biometric system of attendance for teachers.

Teachers say they need to stand in a long queue to mark their attendance via biometric system and enter the Aadhaar number, which takes time and could lead to them being marked late. The details of the employees' timings were made available to the public through the Employee Attendance Report released by by the Directorate of Education (DoE) on its website, The Indian Express reported.

Understandably, most of the teachers are unhappy with this biometric system claiming that they still need to mark their attendance on register.

A teacher at a school in Delhi's Kohat Enclave claimed that while the school starts at 7 am, most teachers have started to reach by 6.15 am-6.30 am. The teacher alleged that feeding in Aadhaar card numbers is a time-taking process and nobody wants to risk being late. ""So I thought it is better to come early and punch in. If we come a little late, it means again standing in the queue and sometimes getting marked late,"" the teacher was quoted as saying by IE.

Many teachers have also raised questions over the purpose of introducing the system and entering Aadhaar numbers. ""Why can't we have a system where there is no need to give our Aadhaar numbers? This is the main reason why it takes such a long time. It is not a good system... Several times, it fails to read our fingerprints. Teachers who live far from the school have ended up missing their trains and reaching home late,"" said Shoaib Rana, a teacher at the Government Boys Senior Secondary School.

Another teacher questioned,""What is the point of bringing in this technology when we have to record it on paper again. Isn't it a waste of our time?"""

Goel visited the government school on Wednesday morning for a surprise inspection only to find that the principal and the vice-principal were absent. He was informed by senior teachers that the district DDE had called them. However, the DDE told Goel that no such message had been relayed by him.

""It is not understood how, during working school hours, both officials i.e. principal and vice-principal left the school without giving any information to any of staff, leaving the school in total chaos,"" Goel wrote in his inspection report.

He also found the midday meal being provided to students was of substandard quality, and the supply was far more than what was needed in the school. The distributing staff at the school later told Goel that the weighing of the midday meal food was not done for the last one year and that no weighing scale was available in the school.

The director also came to know that the midday meal in charge of the school had not informed the NGO concerned about the requirement of the meals, as a result of which only 30% of the food was consumed. ""The rice was half-boiled and the curry supplied lacked proper nutrients,"" said Goel."

The Delhi government on Friday suspended the vice principal of a government school on the day of her retirement following corruption allegations against her, IANS reported. Gomti Devi, vice principal of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Mayur Vihar's Phase II, had allegedly been pocketing some of the money meant for teachers to purchase learning material.

In an order issued on August 30 by Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash, Devi was also barred from leaving Delhi without obtaining permission.

Teachers are given Rs 500 to purchase teaching-learning material, including stationery, globes, maps and charts.

People in Kerala might not be able to forget the 'deadly months' of July and August because of the massive effect of the calamity on life and infrastructure.

Help has been pouring in from all over the country for those who have been hit by the flood. Despite fewer resources, Keralites have come together to help each other.

This government lower primary school at Kurichiarmala in the district will remain the testimony to nature's fury that has left a trail of death and destruction across the state.

A landslide on August 9 had torn through the school's one-acre compound and created two craters near the building and making it inaccessible.

Until Monday, the teachers and villagers were unsure of the future of the institute's 92 students.

In two days, the uncertainty gave way to a new-found confidence -- now seen across the state -- as the exuberant students started school on the top floor of a madrassa, barely a kilometre away.

The temporary establishment has become a symbol of communal harmony and determination of a resilient village that refused to be cowed down by adverse conditions, despite their debilitating effect.

There was an effort to clean up the three-foot mud and slush from the school building so that the classes could commence. Recurring landslides, however, posed a constant risk, forcing the authorities and volunteers to abandon their efforts.

Realising the need for continuing the school, the local mahal committee stepped in and offered space in the Hayathul Islam Madrassa building. Local residents and volunteers swung into action and made necessary arrangements on the top floor of the building.

They converted the top floor into a full-fledged school with four classrooms and a staffroom in 72 hours.

As the classes restarted on Wednesday morning, the building earned the distinction of having a madrassa, a mosque and a government school under the same roof.

The school, meanwhile, adjusted its working days. It would be closed on Fridays -- so that the faithful would have enough space for their prayers -- and instead, would work on Saturdays. The arrangement would continue for the rest of the academic year.

Authorities said the school would function in the madrassa until it a new building somewhere nearby.

Among the students who attended school on Wednesday, five have been rendered homeless by the landslides. A Facebook community, Human Being Collective, Malabar Flood Relief Forum and Green Palliative Volunteers had raised around Rs 4 lakh and helped the villagers recreate the school, which now sport brand new furniture, blackboards, teaching aids and colourful walls with animated characters and even indoor plants.

The pre-primary section has been accommodated in the madrassa's courtyard, where the Hayathul Islam mosque is also located.

""Even the children hailing from families who had suffered huge losses in the landslide were so happy on seeing their new school. It will immensely help them in erasing their traumatic experiences,"" district collector Keshvendra Kumar said.

The school is also a reaffirmation of the secular credentials of Kerala where everyone is helping each other, cutting across religious, social and other barriers,"" who spent around three hours at the school, added.

The school's PTA President Mohammed Aslam, also the vice president of the mahal committee, said the entire Mahal was very forthcoming in opening up its premises for the school. ""Though properties worth crores were lost in the landslide, our biggest loss was the Kurichiar Mala LP School. Most of the people in the village work in the nearby tea plantation and the school was their only hope for a better future of their children,"" Aslam said.

School headmaster Sasi P K said the deputy director of education has sanctioned the changes in the school working days to facilitate the Friday prayers at the mosque.

C K Saseendran, representing Kalpetta in the state assembly, said the school would be upgraded to an upper primary school with Rs 1 crore from the MLA fund and a Rs 49 lakh grant from the central government's multi-sectoral development programme. The Tata Group, meanwhile, has promised to construct a new building for the school on identifying a new location.

The district collector said the damaged school building would be converted to a memorial to showcase how the people overcame the natural calamity."

For a few days, almost every year during the monsoon, the Junior Basic (JB) School in Desom, on the far edge of the city of Kochi in Kerala, would turn into a virtual flood-relief camp. Positioned just 300 metres from the national highway on a higher surface, the school, believed to be over 125 years old, was always marked as a safe zone by the people of nearby villages like Purayar and Puthuvassery, prone to regular flooding from the Periyar.

Every year, when the river seizes their homes, the families, mostly belonging to the SC community, would gather what they can and run to the school at Desom. Except, this year, when the Periyar flowed in spate, even the JB school failed them. For 72 hours, the upper-primary school, its offices, classrooms, kitchen and anganwadi remained under water.

On Wednesday, as per government directions, the school reopened after a fortnight of raging floods and the subsequent Onam-Bakrid vacation. But of the 53 students enrolled at the government school between LKG and grade 4, just about ten students turned up. Headmistress Ramlah Beevi and four staff teachers were present to welcome them with chocolates and biscuits, but it was evident that neither the school nor its staff faculty was ready to start anew.

""Except one, all the staff's homes were flooded this time, including mine. My husband and kids are all out there cleaning. I'm a very healthy woman, but today, for the first time in my life, I felt my head spin. I had to sit down. This is our mental state,"" says Ramlah Beevi, who took charge as a headmistress at the school just two months ago.

Inside the school office, tonnes of files and important documents, partially drenched in floodwaters, were hung out to dry.

For the past one week, after the flood waters receded from Desom and nearby areas, Beevi says, she and other teaching and cleaning staff had to devote an equal amount of time to the sanitation of their own homes and the school. If the damage to their homes was extensive, so was that of the school. Despite a week of cleaning works, heaps of mud and filth lay scattered around the front-yard of the school. Inside the school office, tonnes of files and important documents, partially drenched in floodwaters, were hung out to dry. Instruments of critical school infrastructure like laptops, desktops and a printer sat in a corner, waiting to be drained. Inside classrooms, wooden benches and desks lay in disarray. From the school's kitchen, used for cooking the mid-day meals, several important utensils had floated away. In one of the rooms, a teacher was horrified to find a small slithering sand boa resting in a corner. Perhaps the most wrenching sight was a dirty brown line, a sort of an indelible mark left behind by the flood waters, running along the walls of the school corridor, painted with images of Kerala's classical dance forms like Kathakali and Mohiniyattam.

""After a lot of English-medium schools came up in this area over the last few areas, the enrolment of students went down considerably. Today, we have students only from the poorest communities coming to study here. Their homes have been washed away. Their books and bags have all been lost. The government has promised to supply us with essential books within two days,"" the headmistress said.

A man, employed as a cleaner at the school over the last 14 years, said it made him sad to see the institution like this, wrecked by the most calamitous floods Kerala has ever seen. ""Three-fourth of the school was flooded. We never thought the water from the river could rise all the way here,"" he said.

A man, employed as a cleaner at the school over the last 14 years, said it made him sad to see the institution like this, wrecked by the most calamitous floods Kerala has ever seen.

Jaffer, an assistant sub-inspector with the state special branch (SSB) of the Kerala Police, visited the school as part of his duty to oversee the cleaning works. ""This is one of the badly-affected schools here under our station jurisdiction. I have spoken to the panchayat officials. I will wait till 5 pm to see whether the cleaning work is completed. If not, I will send a report to my superior which will be forwarded to the chief minister's office,"" he informed.

Inside one of the classrooms, Veluppandi, a student of class 1, and his elder sister, Pandiamma, of class 3, sat around munching biscuits. Wearing clothes given to them from the relief camp, they were delighted to be welcomed with goodies on the first day in school after Onam vacations.

When asked if they missed being in school, Pandiamma smiles sheepishly, looks towards her younger brother and says, ""But he was very happy. When there was no school, he would play at home all day.""

With a population of just 300, a government primary school in Mansa, considered one of the most backward villages in Punjab, has become the most sought-after school for parents to admit their children, even from nearby villages.

Around 10 months ago, the school at Jeetsar village (block Budhalada-1) was just like any other government school of Punjab, grappling with infrastructure problems. There were 43 children then, which has now increased to 98.

Today, this primary school is not only equipped with functional learning aids such as windmill, a manual clock, counting through balls on a rope model, colourful walls, smart classroom, a train, reading cell among others, but also has a separate pre-primary wing. Above all, it is now an English medium school.

After undergoing an astonishing transformation within 10 months, parents and School Management Committee (SMC) arrange a special bus which now ferries children from nearby Bachhoana village. The bus was arranged after enrollment increased and many parents from Bachhoana started sending children to Jeetsar school.

Amarjit Singh Chahal, the elementary teacher who joined school in July last, and is credited for school's transformation, while speaking to The Indian Express said junk and waste items were used to create functional learning aids for kids. ""An old discarded ceiling fan was used to create a windmill to explain renewable sources of energy. Then we tied a rope and hung colourful balls on it for kids to learn counting through practical method. We purchased old toilet seats for Rs 50-100 and installed them in garden to make students learn about cleanliness and Swachh Bharat and to tell them about importance of using toilets. Then, we also have a manual clock with moving hands for students to practise concept of time.""

He added, ""We just tried to make optimum use of resources we had. Earlier, we had only two classrooms apart from an office and kitchen. We converted the office into a smart classroom by getting LED screen installed. Two computers were purchased to start a computer room. There is a reading cell too where books have been kept for children.""

Chahal, who was promoted a few days back and is now posted at a senior secondary school, said, ""We used to take extra classes till 7 pm and even work on Sundays. Slowly, we got benches, swings and computers through donations from NRIs and others. Almost Rs 2 lakh were spent to change face of the school.""

The village panchayat also got funds of Rs 5 lakh passed through MNREGA to start pre-primary wing in the school.

However, rest of the funds have been arranged through donations and collected from village residents. ""When I joined here in 2006, we even used to ferry children on our motorbikes. But despite all this hardwork, we did not receive any appreciation or grant from the state education department. This is sad and heart-breaking,"" says Satpal Singh, head teacher of the school.

The latest data from the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database of information about schools, says that the situation is particularly grim in states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, West Bengal, and some north-eastern states, as per 2016-17 statistics.

In these states, the percentage of students dropping out of school in secondary classes was considerably higher than the previous years. For example, in Bihar, in 2016-17, 39.73 per cent students in secondary classes withdrew from school, as compared to just 25.90 per cent students in 2015-16.

In Jharkhand, 36.64 per cent students dropped out in 2016-17, the last year for which data is available, which is over 12 per cent more than the previous year. The Union Human Resources Development Ministry has been boasting about making significant changes in the school education sector.

It's own figures, however, suggest that while the gross enrolment ratio was over 100 per cent at the primary level in 2016-17 (GER can be more than 100 per cent at the primary level because of overage and underage children taking admissions), it Is less than 80 per cent at the secondary level and is yet to reach 60 per cent at the senior secondary level.

Education experts said that while lack of access in rural areas and lack of interest in learning are major factors why children in higher classes drop out of schools, the no-detention policy till class VIII, which was introduced as part of the Right to Education act, could also be a reason.

""The government has now moved to end the no-detention policy, but in the past many year, it has been seen that children who were not assessed properly till class VIII, lose interest in studies when they don't do well at higher level examinations,"" said educationist Varsha Narain."

""English is a subject in which students in our government schools don't feel very comfortable. I diagnosed the problem and developed a strategy. Rather than making it a subject confined to reading and writing, I worked on developing listening skills of the children. I would ask them to hear the announcement at railway stations, metro, radio and call centres. The strategy worked and students became very confident,"" Qanungo said.

The 43-year-old Government Higher Primary School, Daddalkad, Bantwal taluk, was in a dilapidated condition in 2015 and had only 30 students. Now it has around 500 children, studying from LKG to class VIII, where English is taught along with Kannada.

It was all possible because of the efforts and foresight of Shree Durga Friends Club, Karenki, led by Prakash Anchan, a garment merchant from Bantwal.

""When most Kannada-medium schools across the state are closing down due to various reasons, we wanted to show the world that this school can be saved by adopting new teaching skills, and today we are successful in doing so.

Anchan added that they collected all the money from generous donors, who included locals, parents and others. ""We have not taken a single penny from any government be it the Centre or state. When we proposed the same building plan, the government estimated a cost of Rs 6 crore, but we have completed the work by spending Rs 2.2 crore.""

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground. Several others, including the village panchayat, contributed to construct classrooms in the school and install CCTV cameras,"" said Ratnoo.

Jay Narayan Gehlot, sarpanch of Chopasni village, said that the entire village made it a vision to give a good school to the children of the village. ""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same. From a single village we managed to bring 50-60 new students to join the school, ""said Suresh.

Sarla Ratnoo, a student of class 12, said: ""I can dream big now as I can continue with my education. Had the school been far away or without facilities, it would not have been possible.""

The school has a strength of more than 350 students and provides Identity cards and uniforms. ""CCTV cameras have been installed in the classes. The teachers and I keep watch over every activity in the school. We keep organising sports and other extra-curricular activities from time to time to give boost students' exposure,"" said the proud principal."

Krithik, who studies at Cherry Creek High School at Greenwood village in Denver, was appalled at the sight of the school. ""My images were shattered when I stepped into the school. It was unclean and did not have adequate amenities. Schoolteachers there said this was the state of many government schools in India. That's when I decided to do something,"" he said.

With help from his grandfather and his father M Ramesh Babu, Krithik, an Overseas Citizen of India, started an NGO, Empowering Rural India Foundation, about two weeks ago. When funds became an issue, his family members suggested him to find sponsors.

But the 16-year-old donated his own money of 6,000 US dollars. ""In May, I won the first prize in an international science fair held in Pittsburgh and received a cash award of 3,000 US dollars. Besides, I decided to put another 3,000 US dollars from my savings,"" he said.

When funds in hands, he approached the school management and asked them about their needs. Headmaster Perumal said installation of solar panels would help the school as it was affected by frequent power disruptions.

Krithik immediately accepted the idea and started searching for companies that install solar panels along with his father and mother Karpagavalli. They zeroed in on one and installed solar panels recently.

""The school is incurring about Rs 15,000 as electricity charges every two months. With solar panels, we can save that money,"" said a teacher, on the condition of anonymity.

Krithik said the solar panels could produce 2kw of power. ""The requirement of school is less than 2kw. It could sell excess power to the Tamil Nadu electricity board,"" he said.

Ramesh Babu said his son's idea was to build sustainable and renewable energy systems that would serve schools in India for decades. ""Our goal is to improve academic success and create self-sustaining solutions to build up a strong infrastructure,"" he said.

Krithik, who will return to the US by the end of the month, said, ""I will participate in more science fairs, will get more money and contribute something to government schools in India."" He also requested schoolteachers to contact his NGO when they need anything for their schools."

In the confines of Pongalur, this former government-aided school teacher has dedicated her verdant eight-and-a-half acre to hundreds of trees. The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends."

LITTLE ONES: KG classes in Government Primary School, Jhans started 2 years ago

Principals, head teachers and teachers are spearheading the change with the help of philanthropists.

Here are a few stories of faith and transformation.

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

Government Primary School, Nathewal

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

He has now been asked to guide other schools in the district"

In some schools, especially primary schools, only the in charge of the school was present as other teachers were out for conducting survey.

""Parents of most of the students are working. Therefore, we have to start with the survey early in the morning. December 8 is the last day of submition and all teachers have been sent to conduct it. We have no other option,"" said one of the in charge of a government school requesting anonymity.

Arvind Rana, teachercum-president, SSA teacher's welfare association, said: ""Child mapping survey is a non-teaching task.

An emergency meeting of the executive members of the Joint Action Committee (JAC) was held on Tuesday. The meeting was held to discuss the problems being faced by teachers while conducting the survey.

""Students are suffering due to such activities. Teachers should not be involved in non-academic activities at the cost of studies of the students. Keeping in view the studies of students and security of teachers, such nonteaching activities should be allotted to an outsourcing agency so that teachers can concentrate only on the studies of students,"" said Bhag Singh Kairon, president, JAC. Various leaders of the JAC appealed to the education department that they should not assign such activities to teachers and also minimize other non-teaching activities in the schools in the interest of students.

Teachers said they were further facing problems as residents did not cooperate with them most of the times and treat them as salespersons and humiliate them. Problem of stray dogs was also listed."

Even its first year of training, as many as 120 of its 147 students participated in the divisional meet concluded in the city; 91 of them managed to bag medals too. The school offers training in various disciplines like fencing, judo and taekwondo.

At a time when most government schools in the city and rural areas alike concentrated on conventional games like kabaddi, volleyball and football, this schools took the initiative to introduce martial arts with the help of its physical education teachers P Sivaprakasham and N Nisar. This training was then extended to the school's girl students in the form of self-defence lessons. Teachers wanted them equipped to handle any situation they might face. After being briefed about the different forms of martial arts, many girls volunteered to be trained in fencing; they also managed to win a few

medals, he recalls.

Five girls -- S Swetha, D Mercy, R Ranjani, of class XI, and Rajeshwari (class X) and K Logeshwari (class IX) -- have been qualified to participate in the State-level event to be held soon in Kankeyam

of Tirupur district. The girls, on their part, are happy to have overcome all odds to make a mark in the

sport. Though their mothers were hesitant to allow them to be trained in martial arts, all parents are now happy that their girls have managed to achieve so much. Now, they eagerly inquire about fencing practice before asking about academics, narrates Swetha.

Headmistress N Shanthi cannot appreciate the effort more. The teacher's job is not just to improve the students' skills in academics; they should also identify their talents and put them on the path of development. She also remarks that such training has increased attendance among students. A year ago, only 50 per cent of students were willing to attend classes; this has increased to 95 per cent, she claims.

While the school might have its reasons to introduce martial arts to its students, the motivations for single

mother M Gowri are quite simple. Raising her two girls -- M Praveena and M Durgadevi -- on her own, after the demise of her husband, she wanted them to be fiercely independent. When the school

announced self-defence lessons, she was more than happy to sign them up for it. True to spirit, the girls managed to bag a silver medal in karate and Praveena has a bronze in fencing to add to it. It was the mother's aspiration that pushed them to their best, Praveena declares.

The school allows students to excel in swimming too. Four boys -- T Akash, V Mahadevan, M Muthukathiravan, S Logeshwaran (all class VIII students) -- were identified after teachers saw them

swimming in the Kurichi lake, located adjacent to the school.

All these boys had not had formal training before. Akash learnt to swim in the Kuruchi lake, for Mahadevan it was a check dam near Madukkarai and Muthukathiravan and Logeshwaran had the good local old wells."

Most students studying in government schools in India have never seen a plane, leave alone travelling in one. For 406 students of Government Senior Secondary School in Rajasthan's Indargarh village, too, it was a dream to sit in an airplane. A government engineer made this possible a few months ago by erecting a replica of a plane for a classroom in Alwar district. One class for all students is held in this special classroom inside the plane. The students feel so thrilled sitting in a plane that they don't want to go home even after school gets over.

""It has become a major attraction in the village,"" says principal Pushpa Meena. ""Even people from outside the village come here for posing in front of the plane. It has become a selfie point in the village,"" she adds.

Meena said recently after a wedding, the bride and groom came to the school for a photo shoot near the plane.

Until six months ago, the Indargarh government school, 16km from Alwar city, had a dilapidated building, broken classrooms, ceilings that leaked and an unattractive facade.

According to 2016 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey of schooling and learning levels in rural India, Rajasthan is among the top three states with highest dropout rate in children of 11 to 14 years. Against the all-India average of 3.5%, Rajasthan has 5% dropout rate in this age group.

Unattractive schools are a major reason for high dropout rates.

The district unit of Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) took up the renovation of the Indargarh school six months ago. SSA junior engineer Rajesh Lawania prepared a proposal for developing facilities at the school and constructing an airplane for a classroom. He approached Sehgal Foundation, a non-profit organisation that has developed 30 government schools in the district, with the project.

In six months, the foundation has spent Rs 45 lakh on the development of the Indargarh school, said foundation official Mahipal Singh.

The classroom inside the plan is fitted with an internet-enabled LED screen where senior students get YouTube lessons and the juniors watch cartoons and hear stories, said the principal.

""The school is already drawing new students. This year, we have had 22 new admissions. The plane classroom has started only this week. We hope to reap its benefits in the next academic session,"" she added.

""Kabhi nahi socha tha ki hawai jahaz me baithkar padhenge, yeh kisi sapne se kam nahi hai (We never thought we will ever sit in a plane. This is nothing short of a dream),"" said Priyanka Saini of Class 11. Her friends, Kanchala and Anju, couldn't agree more.

The villagers are happy with the development and feel a sense of ownership. ""We will look after the school. It has changed our vision towards a school,"" said Jatan Singh, a local.

Former sarpanch Ramjilal Meena said the gram panchayat was fortunate to have a school like this.

The plane has two entries with stairs to climb. There's pathway from the classrooms to the stairs with trees on both sides. ""We planted 1,100 plants to improve the landscape and make the campus children friendly,"" Lawania said.

The SSA engineer had earlier got classrooms of a government school painted like the coaches of a train. ""I am constantly thinking of innovations to make the schools attractive to increase enrolment and to check dropouts,"" he said.

Lawania said he has also never been inside a plane. He looked at YouTube videos to see the insides before designing the classroom."

The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), which compiled the report titled Survey of Fruits, Vegetables and Juice Intake of School Children, Nutritionists and Dieticians, found that students in government schools consumed around 250 grams of vegetables in a day while those in private schools had only 210 grams.

The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, recommends that a person should consume at least 300 grams of vegetables a day. Of this, according to NIN guidelines, 50 grams each must constitute leafy vegetables and tubers, while 200 grams should be other vegetables. The institute also recommends intake of 100 grams of fresh fruits.

""Schoolchildren need maximum nutrition and deficiency of micronutrients leads to fatigued learning. Non-consumption of vegetables leads to deficiency of micronutrients, which significantly affects learning abilities. Hence, it is important for schoolchildren to have the required amount of vegetables (micronutrients),"" said Dr YG Deosthale, former director of NIN.

The ICRIER, as a part of the survey, studied the dietary habits of 98, 596 students across 36 government schools and 54 private schools in the city. The students were from Class V to Class XII.The survey found no significant difference in the intake of fruits and vegetables between girls and boys. ""More than 56 per cent students enrolled in Classes V to XII in Delhi-NCR consumed lesser green vegetables than what is mandated. And, only over one-fourth of the students ate fruits daily,"" the report said.

However, according to the report, students in private schools consumed more fruits that those enrolled in government schools. ""While 34 per cent of students enrolled in private schools ate fruits daily, only 25 per cent of those in government schools consumed fruits,"" the report said.

The principal of a private school said that it was not the school's duty to instruct kids on what to eat. ""Almost all students eat what they are told to by parents. What we can do is to make them aware of the benefits of healthy eating. But, in the end they will follow the dietary routine of their house,"" she said.

However, no funds were sanctioned under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) for purchasing uniforms for APL students. On the other hand, the SSA sanctioned '6.44 crore in the academic year of 2017-18 to procure uniforms for 1.61 lakh students. There are a total of 40,000 APL students in the district.

There are 1,381 government-run primary and upper primary schools in the district that get funds under SSA. Under the scheme, government spends '400 for two pairs of uniforms per child belonging to BPL category.

Two teachers of Government Middle School in Kundal village, Fazilka, were issued transfer orders after six Class VI students alleged that they were forced to strip in front of their senior girl students (of Classes VII and VIII) after a sanitary napkin was found in the school's toilet.

The two teachers are Jyoti, the class teacher and Kuldeep Kaur, in-charge of the school. Jyoti has been transferred to a school in Khui Khera village and Kaur to Balluana in the same district. Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh also ordered an inquiry into the matter that needs to be completed by Monday in order to initiate further disciplinary action against the teachers.

The alleged incident happened on October 31. The six girls alleged that when a sanitary napkin was found in the school's toilet, the class teacher wanted to find out who had thrown it there without disposing of it in a bin. As per their complaint, she decided to take them to a vacant classroom, where she called some students of Classes VII and and VIII.

Abohar Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Poonam Singh said, ""The six girl students said they were asked to strip in front of their senior girl students and class teacher to find out who was using sanitary napkin that day. The girls' complaint came to me following which I constituted an inquiry which is being done by two principals of Government Senior Secondary Schools and as per the preliminary report of their inquiry, both teachers have been transferred. The final inquiry report will be submitted on Monday after taking the statement of the teachers. We have already taken statements of girl students and they will not be called again.""

Meanwhile, the girl students have also alleged that the class teacher had made derogatory remarks, too.

However, Kuldeep Kaur told mediapersons that she was ""unaware"" of the incident. Parents of the girls alleged that as they did not get a satisfactory response from the school authorities, they decided to approach the SDM. Class teacher Jyoti has gone on leave.

Kulwant Singh, district education officer, said, ""We are conducting inquiry into the allegations of the students. After a preliminary inquiry, the two teachers were transferred on administrative grounds.""

According to the official spokesperson of the CM, further disciplinary action, as per conduct rules, will be taken once a formal report is received after completing the inquiry. He directed Education secretary Krishan Kumar to complete the investigation into the incident by Monday and update him on the final inquiry report."

Two teachers were transferred and an inquiry ordered after the matter was brought to the notice of Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, an official spokesperson said Saturday.

The teachers were trying to find out which of the girls was wearing a sanitary napkin, after one was found in the school toilet, officials said.

Instead, they said, the teachers should have educated the students on proper disposal of sanitary napkins.

The chief minister directed education secretary Krishan Kumar to complete the investigation by Monday and take further action as necessary.

The district education officer was asked to visit the school, and on questioning the students and their parents found prima facie evidence of the involvement of the two teachers.

A government spokesperson said further disciplinary action, according to rules, will be taken after the students' statements are recorded and the inquiry report received.

While many private schools in the district have managed to complete 80% of the SSLC syllabus, students of government institutions are contending with prolonged truancy of their teachers. Consequently, a very significant amount of their syllabus has not been covered, leaving the students in a lurch.

The teachers have laid the blame squarely at the doors of the officials of the department of public instruction (DPI) for the protracted delay in finalising the transfer process. Sources in the Karnataka primary and secondary education department said that the process was initiated as early as December 2017, but stiff resistance from teachers unwilling to relocate to rural areas resulted in the delay.

An officer in the primary education department said, ""We will complete the transfer of primary school teachers by October 30, following which we will start the transfer process of high school teachers. As a result, many schools will not have teachers for various subjects till December, which might pose problems to SSLC students.""

That private schools were holding camps on how best to tackle SSLC examinations set the dire situation in state-run institutions in stark relief, he said. ""At government schools, students are more worried about, who their new teacher will be, whether he or she will complete the syllabus on time and if the teacher will continue where the previous one stopped, etc. In the absence of a full-time primary and secondary education minister, this is a fiasco. Students at government schools are likely to lose some marks owing to the delay in completion of syllabus,"" the official added.

President of the primary school teachers' association Basavaraj Gurikar attributed the delay in the transfer process to software glitches. ""We hope things change in the next few years and the process can be completed in a seamless manner, so as to avoid trouble for the students,"" said Gurikar.

Raghu Kumar, an SSLC student at a government high school in Mysuru city, said, ""The government must not let the students down. If a teacher is transferred in the middle of the academic year, it creates a lot of problems for the students. The government must ensure that such a situation does not arise next year.""

Deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru Mamata said that as many as 2,032 primary school teachers from across the district had sought transfer. ""The transfer of primary teachers was to be completed by October 22,"" said Mamata.

Former primary and secondary education minister and BSP leader N Mahesh told STOI that the delay was the result of a host of issues - the result of elections, confusion pertaining to additional teachers and technical glitches. ""It is unfortunate that students have to suffer. But, the department was also helpless in many cases,"" he added."

Basic reading and writing constitutes the child's ability to read simple sentences like: 'My name is Ramesh' or ""Gaay ghaas khay che"" (Gujarati for: A cow eats grass).

This revelation on the shocking state of education was revealed in the seventh edition of the 'Gunotsav' drive, a study undertaken by the state government where primary school students are assessed to ascertain their levels of learning.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama admitted that the major learning gap was a cause of concern. He said that state was committed to turning the situation around.

""Gujarat is the only state that has assessed the problem. Once we knew the problem, we first initiated an out-of-box measure like Mission Vidya to remedy it. After this intervention, where earlier only five students in a class could read or write, now only 5 can't,"" said Chudasama.

Mission Vidya was launched recently by the Gujarat government, where teachers are asked to give 3 hours of extra classes to weak students for 35 days.

At the end of Mission Vidya, 43% of the weak students identified were able to read and write simple sentences and do basic maths.

Officials, however, admitted that the huge learning gap would need more than stop-gap interventions for quality to be improved.

From now onwards, principals of Delhi government schools will be directly held accountable in case of misbehaviour by any student within the school premises.

The school heads have been asked to strictly implement the Model Code of Conduct.

A circular has been issued specially by the Directorate of Education (DOE), citing the reason that several instances of rules and regulations are not being followed by the students.

Issues like missing classes, misbehaviour towards teachers or school staff, bullying classmates, eve teasing, indulgence in behaviour of moral turpitude, propagating a strike or connection with a banned association, gambling, theft of school property, smoking or chewing gutkha/paan/khaini, and the practice of casteism or untouchability will attract strict actions from the head of the School.

All these actions form a section of the forbidden list of behaviour.

Breaking of such rules, the circular dated September 10 says, will lead to suspension of the student or detention in which the student might be asked to complete his school work during recess time or any similar task, and in the cases of higher classes (class 9 to 12), expulsion or rustication of students in rarest of the rare cases.

In order to ensure a safe environment for students and teachers in Delhi Government schools, the Delhi Government's DOE has issued an order, asking students and teachers to refrain from missing classes and maintain decorum.

The circular, ""Model Code of Conduct"", has been issued after a three-year-old girl was allegedly sexually exploited within her school premises in northwest Delhi area earlier this month.

Bengaluru: Karan Jani studied at a school with no science lab. Today, he is a renowned scientist who was part of a historic discovery that launched a new branch of science three years ago.

Jani and his teammates at Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) were the first to detect the universe's gravitational waves. The feat, which was the culmination of a decade of efforts, won the team the Nobel Prize and the Special Breakthrough Prize in Physics last year.

This scientist's journey is one budding scientists around the country can identify with. One of the most prominent voices of Indian science online and offline today, Jani tours the country giving lectures. But getting there involved bucking the rat race, as well as advice from seniors to go for an MBA even though he was pursuing a bachelor's in physics.

Jani attended a government school in Baroda, Gujarat, where education was subsidised. ""We didn't have science labs. Our library was (a room of) tables and chairs where we all went to play 'book-cricket',"" Jani told ThePrint.

Growing up, there were no science idols to look up to. The only name he probably heard, he said, was Vikram Sarabhai. This was likely because the father of India's space programme was from Ahmedabad, Baroda's neighbouring city.

Jani subsequently joined Maharaja Sayajirao University, a public institution in Baroda, for an undergraduate degree in physics. He wasn't sure about his career, but was confused why seniors were advising him to appear for the Common Admission Test for admissions to the Indian Institutes of Management.

One day, as he was wandering outside his college, he picked up Stephen Hawking's iconic A Brief History of Time from a street-side book vendor. He was hooked from Page 1, and it was like a new world had opened up for him.

""Until I read the book, facts were always presented as a fact with no context or explanation to convince you of it,"" he said. ""But that book floored me and changed my entire outlook.""

He then set about approaching universities around the world with queries about their undergraduate astronomy programs. Penn State, US, unexpectedly responded, encouraging him to apply for a transfer there. Everything worked out, and Jani left for Pennsylvania after his first year for a B.S. in astronomy and astrophysics.

It was here that he got interested in general relativity, and obtained a simultaneous undergraduate degree in physics with a minor in mathematics.

It was during his undergraduate studies that he got the opportunity to meet Hawking, when he was a visiting scholar at the Albert Einstein Institute in Germany. At this 'Comic Con for physics', seeing Hawking was a routine affair. Eventually, Hawking invited Jani and other undergraduate students for a lunchtime interaction.

A few years later, Hawking would be a part of the committee that decided to give Jani and his team the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for the LIGO discovery.

Among his other inspirations, Jani names astrophysicist Rainer Weiss, who led the LIGO team, and theoretical physicist Abhay Ashtekar. ""It is a fantastic feeling when your idols go on to become your colleagues and you can see them at work,"" he said.

Jani went on to do his PhD at Georgia Tech University, writing his thesis on binary black holes. ""When I started my PhD, binary black holes, where two black holes orbit each other, were still hypothetical,"" said Jani.

During his PhD, Jani worked a fair amount with LIGO, simulating and modelling findings the detector could make. He subsequently joined the observatory as a resident fellow.

Also read: These Indian scientists have formed a band of myth-busters. Social media beware

Jani was at a US airport when he got the text informing him that LIGO had detected gravitational waves. Back-of-the-envelope calculations blew Jani away. ""It was not the fact that these were real gravitational waves, but that the source black holes were massive,"" he said, ""I had never seen anything of this scale before.""

The actual independent confirmations went on for several days, and the time leading up to the press announcement simmered with excitement. ""This was the culmination of my work, my colleagues', and so many of my superiors', who had been working on this all their adult lives,"" he said, likening the discovery to the time humans landed on moon.

""It was an emotional moment when I saw tweets from (former US president Barack) Obama and (PM Narendra) Modi congratulating us,"" he said.

""When I told my parents to watch the press conference, I was thinking of exactly the right circumstances that prompted me to pick up the book by Hawking in Baroda,"" he told ThePrint.

From then on, the excitement in Jani's home state spiked with every subsequent discovery made by LIGO.

The idea to tour Indian colleges came as Jani and his colleagues were invited to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""He encouraged us to go visit as many colleges and universities as we could in India and talk about science and LIGO-India,"" Jain said.

LIGO-India, a gravitational-wave observatory to be set up in the country as part of a worldwide network, is likely to be commissioned by 2024.

Two of his favourite speaking gigs involved an interaction with the disabled in Gujarat, and an address at a Forbes awards ceremony alongside theoretical physicist Lisa Randall, Nobel peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, and entrepreneur Richard Branson.

On his college tours, Jani specifically picks public institutes because ""that's where I would be had I stayed in India"".

Students in India aren't exposed to a lot of open problems in their fields because of lack of research in their institute or by their professors, and that is something he hopes changes. He especially wishes Indian undergraduate research becomes a norm, just like lab courses are.

""Unless you have a problem in front of you that you are aiming to solve, there really isn't much difference between, say a BSc Physics and an MSc Physics,"" he added.

He recalled a tidbit from his own academic life to stress the need for more conferences for students where they can interact with the stalwarts of academia.

Attending a conference for undergraduate physics students at Fermilab, the iconic particle physics and accelerator laboratory in the US, was one of the best experiences of his life, he said.

""It was absolutely incredible that the people who worked there interacted with us, undergraduate students,"" he added, ""Leon Lederman, a particle physics Nobel laureate, attended our poster sessions and asked us questions when we were presenting.""

Jani is now focussed on the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which will measure gravitational waves from space and is due for a 2034 launch. He also serves as an education policy adviser for the Gujarat government.

LIGO-India is also big on his agenda.

""LIGO-India is a very important, landmark scientific project for India because this is a field that has just been born and it is important for our country to train the next generation of scientists,"" he said.

""Scientists who work on LIGO-India will also work on LISA, and when LISA flies, we will have a wealth of resources ready to lead gravitational-wave astronomy,"" he added.

Gravitational-wave astronomy has just seen its break of day, and many like Jani are hopeful that it will help us solve some deep mysteries about space, for example, what happened in the few zillionths of a second immediately after the Big Bang.

Jani also focuses on science communication online, being a firm proponent of its importance in an age of rampant pseudoscience and misinformation.

""Pseudoscience from members of the public can be pardoned, with the hope that the next generation of students is able to successfully counter it and stomp it out,"" he said.

""But when it comes from policy-makers and politicians, it becomes a matter of concern,"" he added.

""Unfortunately, everyone, whether a politician or a troll, is a product of our system, and that is an example of how our system fails our citizens,"" Jani said. ""Sadly, the burden of fixing this problem lies on our future generations, which we can hopefully steer in the right direction."""

In an exemplary move towards ensuring punctuality, teachers at some government schools in the national capital of Delhi have been reaching half-an-hour early and even staying late. And just in case you are left wondering what caused the emergence of this seemingly unusual trend, blame the introduction of the biometric system of attendance for teachers.

Teachers say they need to stand in a long queue to mark their attendance via biometric system and enter the Aadhaar number, which takes time and could lead to them being marked late. The details of the employees' timings were made available to the public through the Employee Attendance Report released by by the Directorate of Education (DoE) on its website, The Indian Express reported.

Understandably, most of the teachers are unhappy with this biometric system claiming that they still need to mark their attendance on register.

A teacher at a school in Delhi's Kohat Enclave claimed that while the school starts at 7 am, most teachers have started to reach by 6.15 am-6.30 am. The teacher alleged that feeding in Aadhaar card numbers is a time-taking process and nobody wants to risk being late. ""So I thought it is better to come early and punch in. If we come a little late, it means again standing in the queue and sometimes getting marked late,"" the teacher was quoted as saying by IE.

Many teachers have also raised questions over the purpose of introducing the system and entering Aadhaar numbers. ""Why can't we have a system where there is no need to give our Aadhaar numbers? This is the main reason why it takes such a long time. It is not a good system... Several times, it fails to read our fingerprints. Teachers who live far from the school have ended up missing their trains and reaching home late,"" said Shoaib Rana, a teacher at the Government Boys Senior Secondary School.

""Though 1,472 government school students had cleared the NEET this year, only 24 of them could get admission to the government medical colleges,"" said Mr. Sengottaiyan, who formally inaugurated the NEET coaching centre at Avvaiyar Government Higher Secondary School at Paavoorchathram in the evening.

He assured that the complaints of sexual harassment of women teachers would be dealt with seriously within 24 hours if they registered complaints by calling 14417.

The Minister said the Department of School Education had so far sent ₹ 4.06 crore-worth relief materials to Kerala as the first consignment, worth about ₹ 2.60 crore, were transported to the neighbouring State from Erode recently.

He also participated in a function organised at Thulukkarpatti in Radhapuram taluk to mark the upgradation of the government high school into higher secondary school.

The teachers have repeatedly pleaded with local- as well as state-level officers for their money, but the officials have been shirking the responsibility by blaming the finance department for the delay, which in turn has been passing the buck onto the Union Ministry for Human Resource Development.

As per details available from the teachers, of the 25,000 teachers appointed under Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), over 12,000 working in 14 taluks including Beltangadi, Madhugiri, Gadag and Bantwal have not got their salaries.

""When we approached local block education officers and deputy directors, they said some technical issues at the state level was the cause for the delay. But when we approached state-level officers, they said they had not received funds from the MHRD to pay us,"" a teacher told Express.

When the issue was brought to the notice of RMSA officials, they blamed Khajane-2 software, which monitors Human Resource Management System (HRMS) for the ""glitch"". It is said that code numbers of the 12,000-odd teachers were wrongly uploaded, which has caused a ""technical error"" in distribution of salaries.

""These 25,000 teachers were recruited under RMSA, so their salaries are being paid from funds released by the MHRD. To pay salaries for these teachers, there is a system called HRMS in which code numbers have been given to each teacher, against which salaries are credited. This code number is wrongly used at Khajane-2 causing a technical error,"" said an official from the department of public instructions who handles RMSA.

Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy has taken note of this. While addressing the event organised by the state higher education department on the occasion of Teachers' Day on Wednesday, he said, ""I am told that salaries have not paid to over 12,000 teachers. Upon enquiring with officials, they said it was because the Centre had stopped the relevant funds. I have instructed officials of Finance and Education departments to address the issue immediately."" The CM went on to add that there was no shortage of finances in the state. ""We have enough funds in the treasury.

People in Kerala might not be able to forget the 'deadly months' of July and August because of the massive effect of the calamity on life and infrastructure.

Help has been pouring in from all over the country for those who have been hit by the flood. Despite fewer resources, Keralites have come together to help each other.

This government lower primary school at Kurichiarmala in the district will remain the testimony to nature's fury that has left a trail of death and destruction across the state.

A landslide on August 9 had torn through the school's one-acre compound and created two craters near the building and making it inaccessible.

Until Monday, the teachers and villagers were unsure of the future of the institute's 92 students.

In two days, the uncertainty gave way to a new-found confidence -- now seen across the state -- as the exuberant students started school on the top floor of a madrassa, barely a kilometre away.

The temporary establishment has become a symbol of communal harmony and determination of a resilient village that refused to be cowed down by adverse conditions, despite their debilitating effect.

There was an effort to clean up the three-foot mud and slush from the school building so that the classes could commence. Recurring landslides, however, posed a constant risk, forcing the authorities and volunteers to abandon their efforts.

Realising the need for continuing the school, the local mahal committee stepped in and offered space in the Hayathul Islam Madrassa building. Local residents and volunteers swung into action and made necessary arrangements on the top floor of the building.

They converted the top floor into a full-fledged school with four classrooms and a staffroom in 72 hours.

As the classes restarted on Wednesday morning, the building earned the distinction of having a madrassa, a mosque and a government school under the same roof.

The school, meanwhile, adjusted its working days. It would be closed on Fridays -- so that the faithful would have enough space for their prayers -- and instead, would work on Saturdays. The arrangement would continue for the rest of the academic year.

Authorities said the school would function in the madrassa until it a new building somewhere nearby.

Among the students who attended school on Wednesday, five have been rendered homeless by the landslides. A Facebook community, Human Being Collective, Malabar Flood Relief Forum and Green Palliative Volunteers had raised around Rs 4 lakh and helped the villagers recreate the school, which now sport brand new furniture, blackboards, teaching aids and colourful walls with animated characters and even indoor plants.

The pre-primary section has been accommodated in the madrassa's courtyard, where the Hayathul Islam mosque is also located.

""Even the children hailing from families who had suffered huge losses in the landslide were so happy on seeing their new school. It will immensely help them in erasing their traumatic experiences,"" district collector Keshvendra Kumar said.

The school is also a reaffirmation of the secular credentials of Kerala where everyone is helping each other, cutting across religious, social and other barriers,"" who spent around three hours at the school, added.

The school's PTA President Mohammed Aslam, also the vice president of the mahal committee, said the entire Mahal was very forthcoming in opening up its premises for the school. ""Though properties worth crores were lost in the landslide, our biggest loss was the Kurichiar Mala LP School. Most of the people in the village work in the nearby tea plantation and the school was their only hope for a better future of their children,"" Aslam said.

School headmaster Sasi P K said the deputy director of education has sanctioned the changes in the school working days to facilitate the Friday prayers at the mosque.

C K Saseendran, representing Kalpetta in the state assembly, said the school would be upgraded to an upper primary school with Rs 1 crore from the MLA fund and a Rs 49 lakh grant from the central government's multi-sectoral development programme. The Tata Group, meanwhile, has promised to construct a new building for the school on identifying a new location.

The district collector said the damaged school building would be converted to a memorial to showcase how the people overcame the natural calamity."

For a few days, almost every year during the monsoon, the Junior Basic (JB) School in Desom, on the far edge of the city of Kochi in Kerala, would turn into a virtual flood-relief camp. Positioned just 300 metres from the national highway on a higher surface, the school, believed to be over 125 years old, was always marked as a safe zone by the people of nearby villages like Purayar and Puthuvassery, prone to regular flooding from the Periyar.

Every year, when the river seizes their homes, the families, mostly belonging to the SC community, would gather what they can and run to the school at Desom. Except, this year, when the Periyar flowed in spate, even the JB school failed them. For 72 hours, the upper-primary school, its offices, classrooms, kitchen and anganwadi remained under water.

On Wednesday, as per government directions, the school reopened after a fortnight of raging floods and the subsequent Onam-Bakrid vacation. But of the 53 students enrolled at the government school between LKG and grade 4, just about ten students turned up. Headmistress Ramlah Beevi and four staff teachers were present to welcome them with chocolates and biscuits, but it was evident that neither the school nor its staff faculty was ready to start anew.

""Except one, all the staff's homes were flooded this time, including mine. My husband and kids are all out there cleaning. I'm a very healthy woman, but today, for the first time in my life, I felt my head spin. I had to sit down. This is our mental state,"" says Ramlah Beevi, who took charge as a headmistress at the school just two months ago.

Inside the school office, tonnes of files and important documents, partially drenched in floodwaters, were hung out to dry.

For the past one week, after the flood waters receded from Desom and nearby areas, Beevi says, she and other teaching and cleaning staff had to devote an equal amount of time to the sanitation of their own homes and the school. If the damage to their homes was extensive, so was that of the school. Despite a week of cleaning works, heaps of mud and filth lay scattered around the front-yard of the school. Inside the school office, tonnes of files and important documents, partially drenched in floodwaters, were hung out to dry. Instruments of critical school infrastructure like laptops, desktops and a printer sat in a corner, waiting to be drained. Inside classrooms, wooden benches and desks lay in disarray. From the school's kitchen, used for cooking the mid-day meals, several important utensils had floated away. In one of the rooms, a teacher was horrified to find a small slithering sand boa resting in a corner. Perhaps the most wrenching sight was a dirty brown line, a sort of an indelible mark left behind by the flood waters, running along the walls of the school corridor, painted with images of Kerala's classical dance forms like Kathakali and Mohiniyattam.

""After a lot of English-medium schools came up in this area over the last few areas, the enrolment of students went down considerably. Today, we have students only from the poorest communities coming to study here. Their homes have been washed away. Their books and bags have all been lost. The government has promised to supply us with essential books within two days,"" the headmistress said.

A man, employed as a cleaner at the school over the last 14 years, said it made him sad to see the institution like this, wrecked by the most calamitous floods Kerala has ever seen. ""Three-fourth of the school was flooded. We never thought the water from the river could rise all the way here,"" he said.

A man, employed as a cleaner at the school over the last 14 years, said it made him sad to see the institution like this, wrecked by the most calamitous floods Kerala has ever seen.

Jaffer, an assistant sub-inspector with the state special branch (SSB) of the Kerala Police, visited the school as part of his duty to oversee the cleaning works. ""This is one of the badly-affected schools here under our station jurisdiction. I have spoken to the panchayat officials. I will wait till 5 pm to see whether the cleaning work is completed. If not, I will send a report to my superior which will be forwarded to the chief minister's office,"" he informed.

Inside one of the classrooms, Veluppandi, a student of class 1, and his elder sister, Pandiamma, of class 3, sat around munching biscuits. Wearing clothes given to them from the relief camp, they were delighted to be welcomed with goodies on the first day in school after Onam vacations.

When asked if they missed being in school, Pandiamma smiles sheepishly, looks towards her younger brother and says, ""But he was very happy. When there was no school, he would play at home all day.""

With a population of just 300, a government primary school in Mansa, considered one of the most backward villages in Punjab, has become the most sought-after school for parents to admit their children, even from nearby villages.

Around 10 months ago, the school at Jeetsar village (block Budhalada-1) was just like any other government school of Punjab, grappling with infrastructure problems. There were 43 children then, which has now increased to 98.

Today, this primary school is not only equipped with functional learning aids such as windmill, a manual clock, counting through balls on a rope model, colourful walls, smart classroom, a train, reading cell among others, but also has a separate pre-primary wing. Above all, it is now an English medium school.

The bus was arranged after enrollment increased and many parents from Bachhoana started sending children to Jeetsar school.

""An old discarded ceiling fan was used to create a windmill to explain renewable sources of energy. Then we tied a rope and hung colourful balls on it for kids to learn counting through practical method. We purchased old toilet seats for Rs 50-100 and installed them in garden to make students learn about cleanliness and Swachh Bharat and to tell them about importance of using toilets. Then, we also have a manual clock with moving hands for students to practise concept of time.""

He added, ""We just tried to make optimum use of resources we had. Earlier, we had only two classrooms apart from an office and kitchen. We converted the office into a smart classroom by getting LED screen installed. Two computers were purchased to start a computer room. There is a reading cell too where books have been kept for children.""

Chahal, who was promoted a few days back and is now posted at a senior secondary school, said, ""We used to take extra classes till 7 pm and even work on Sundays. Slowly, we got benches, swings and computers through donations from NRIs and others. Almost Rs 2 lakh were spent to change face of the school.""

The village panchayat also got funds of Rs 5 lakh passed through MNREGA to start pre-primary wing in the school.

However, rest of the funds have been arranged through donations and collected from village residents. ""When I joined here in 2006, we even used to ferry children on our motorbikes.
